## Question

how drinking alcohol affecting blood sugar level

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how drinking alcohol affects blood sugar levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the acute metabolic effects of ethanol on hepatic glucose production. Then, I should verify the delayed hypoglycemia risk, especially in type 1 diabetes and insulin users. Next, I will examine chronic effects on insulin sensitivity and glycemic control. After that, I need to consider dose, timing, and meal context. Finally, I should review medication interactions and synthesize practical, guideline-aligned recommendations with appropriate caveats and monitoring advice [^1121URgZ] [^115jWfbT].

> Let me first confirm the acute metabolic effects. Alcohol inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, which can blunt the liver's ability to release glucose when needed, thereby predisposing to hypoglycemia, particularly when alcohol is consumed without carbohydrate intake or in the setting of depleted glycogen stores [^112foVXy] [^116SDatF]. Wait, let me verify the timing of this effect; I initially thought the hypoglycemia risk was immediate, but hold on, the more clinically important signal is often delayed, manifesting several hours later as blood alcohol declines while hepatic glucose output remains suppressed, which explains next-morning hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes [^113PSmxW] [^116SDatF].

> I need to check the delayed hypoglycemia risk in type 1 diabetes specifically. Evening alcohol consumption suppresses nocturnal growth hormone, a counter-regulatory hormone that normally helps maintain euglycemia, and leads to significantly lower fasting and post-breakfast glucose the next morning, with frequent need for hypoglycemia treatment in controlled studies [^113PSmxW]. Hold on, I should verify whether this translates into real-world risk; qualitative and observational data in young adults with type 1 diabetes consistently describe delayed hypoglycemia overnight and impaired awareness, reinforcing the need for anticipatory guidance and glucose monitoring after drinking [^112FDGLb] [^114m3fFF].

> Next, I should review chronic effects on insulin sensitivity and glycemic control. Meta-analyses of randomized trials suggest that moderate alcohol intake can reduce fasting insulin and, in some analyses, HbA1c, with signals of improved insulin sensitivity particularly in women, although effects are modest and not universal across populations or sexes [^111eChs5] [^111yL3cr]. Let me consider whether this is clinically meaningful; a randomized trial in adults with type 2 diabetes initiating moderate wine intake showed improved fasting glucose and cardiometabolic markers, and longer-term observational data link moderate consumption with lower A1C, but I should double-check that these benefits are dose-dependent and context-specific, and that they do not negate the acute hypoglycemia risk in insulin-treated patients [^111R24wR] [^112TPcUZ] [^111GCL3i].

> I will now examine dose, timing, and meal context, because these modify risk and benefit. Light to moderate intake with meals tends to minimize upward blood alcohol excursions and may mitigate hypoglycemia risk, whereas heavy or binge drinking increases risk of both acute and delayed hypoglycemia and may worsen glycemic control over time [^111UbLs3] [^115dukys] [^113mM2MJ] [^112LGMCy]. Wait, let me verify the dose-response for diabetes incidence; multiple meta-analyses describe a U-shaped relationship with lowest risk around 1–2 standard drinks per day, with risk rising beyond about 50–60 g/day, which aligns with general population guidance and supports advising within-dietary-guideline limits rather than abstinence for those who already drink responsibly [^115yWB5w] [^111D6A77].

> But wait, what if the person is on insulin or sulfonylureas. I should confirm medication interactions. Alcohol increases the risk of hypoglycemia with insulin and secretagogues, and labels for glipizide and insulin aspart explicitly caution against alcohol due to hypoglycemia risk, necessitating dose adjustments, food co-ingestion, and vigilant post-drink glucose monitoring [^113c3zst] [^111HDgMG] [^115Nc7a6]. Hold on, I should verify metformin-specific issues; while metformin itself rarely causes hypoglycemia, heavy or chronic alcohol use increases the risk of lactic acidosis, so patients should avoid binge drinking and maintain hydration, with label guidance supporting counseling on limiting intake and recognizing sick-day precautions [^115rzfPb] [^113ZzXsA] [^116VbBys].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications by diabetes type. For type 1 diabetes, the dominant concern is delayed hypoglycemia due to impaired counter-regulation and suppressed growth hormone after evening alcohol, so education should emphasize never drinking on an empty stomach, checking glucose before bed and overnight, and having a hypoglycemia plan with glucagon accessible, alongside strict avoidance of alcohol if planning to drive given additive cognitive impairment with hypoglycemia [^113PSmxW] [^116SDatF] [^111WqSRQ]. For type 2 diabetes, modest alcohol intake with meals may modestly improve insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose in some patients, but benefits are small and must be balanced against caloric load, medication interactions, and adherence risks, so shared decision-making and individualized monitoring are essential [^111R24wR] [^111yL3cr] [^112TPcUZ].

> I should confirm guideline-concordant recommendations. The ADA advises that adults with diabetes who drink should stay within general dietary limits, that abstainers not start, and that all insulin or secretagogue users be educated about delayed hypoglycemia and the need for glucose monitoring after drinking, with emphasis on moderation and meal co-ingestion to mitigate risk [^115jWfbT] [^1121URgZ] [^111WFuu7]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric and adolescent guidance; ISPAD similarly highlights impaired counter-regulation and nocturnal hypoglycemia risk, reinforcing anticipatory education and overnight monitoring strategies for youth with type 1 diabetes [^116SDatF].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical safety steps are explicit. Advise eating carbohydrate-containing food when drinking, check glucose before, during, and after drinking, and be prepared for delayed lows overnight; avoid alcohol if driving or operating machinery; and review all diabetes medications for interactions, adjusting insulin or secretagogue doses as needed in collaboration with the care team, with clear sick-day and hydration guidance to reduce lactic acidosis risk when relevant [^111wTtyq] [^115Nc7a6] [^115rzfPb]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that moderate alcohol reliably improves long-term outcomes for everyone; I should correct that and emphasize that population-level signals of benefit are modest, heterogeneous, and must be weighed against individual risk profiles, medication regimens, and behavioral context, with abstinence remaining a reasonable and safe choice for many patients [^111yL3cr] [^112me1y3].

Alcohol has **bimodal effects** on blood sugar: acute intake can cause hypoglycemia by inhibiting hepatic glucose production [^112foVXy], especially in people with diabetes or on insulin/secretagogues [^1121URgZ], while chronic moderate use may improve insulin sensitivity and lower fasting glucose/HbA1c [^111eChs5] [^111UbLs3]. Heavy or binge drinking increases hyperglycemia risk and impairs glycemic control [^112LGMCy]. People with diabetes should **limit intake to ≤ 1–2 drinks/day**, never drink on an empty stomach, and monitor glucose before, during, and after drinking to mitigate delayed hypoglycemia [^115dukys] [^112me1y3] [^113qPjZR].

---

## Acute effects of alcohol on blood sugar

### Hypoglycemia risk

- **Inhibition of gluconeogenesis**: Alcohol suppresses hepatic glucose production [^112foVXy], risking hypoglycemia, especially when fasting or with insulin/secretagogues [^1121URgZ].

- **Delayed hypoglycemia**: Hypoglycemia can occur 12–24 hours after drinking, particularly overnight, due to impaired counterregulation and reduced growth hormone [^113PSmxW] [^116SDatF].

- **Impaired awareness**: Alcohol blunts hypoglycemia symptoms and counterregulation, increasing severe hypoglycemia risk [^113qPjZR] [^1161cZUu].

---

### Hyperglycemia risk

- **Carbohydrate content**: Sugary mixers or beer can raise glucose acutely, especially with inadequate insulin [^113CCF9P].

- **Binge drinking**: Heavy intake impairs insulin action and glycemic control, increasing hyperglycemia risk [^112LGMCy].

---

## Chronic effects of alcohol on blood sugar

### Beneficial effects with moderate intake

- **Improved insulin sensitivity**: Moderate intake (1–2 drinks/day) improves insulin sensitivity and lowers fasting insulin/HbA1c [^111eChs5] [^117EXQFD].

- **Lower diabetes risk**: Moderate intake is associated with a 30–40% lower type 2 diabetes risk in observational studies [^111D6A77] [^115yWB5w].

- **Cardiometabolic benefits**: Moderate intake improves lipids and may reduce cardiovascular risk in diabetes [^111GCL3i] [^1157fhxb].

---

### Detrimental effects with heavy intake

Heavy intake is linked to **increased diabetes risk** → 3 drinks/day raises type 2 diabetes risk — and worsens glycemic control, contributing to hyperglycemia and complications [^115dukys] [^112sWqhR]. Chronic use can cause **pancreatic injury**, reducing insulin production and impairing glycemic control.

## Factors influencing alcohol's impact on blood sugar

Several factors modulate **alcohol's glycemic effects**:

| **Factor** | **Effect on blood sugar** |
|-|-|
| Amount and frequency | - Moderate: improved insulin sensitivity <br/> - Heavy: hyperglycemia and complications [^111UbLs3] [^112LGMCy] |
| Type of alcoholic beverage | - Sugary mixers/beer: hyperglycemia <br/> - Dry wine/spirits: lower glycemic impact [^113CCF9P] [^116aTuva] [^111R24wR] |
| Individual metabolism | - Genetic variants (e.g. ADH1B) alter glycemic response [^111GCL3i] |
| Presence of diabetes | - Higher hypoglycemia risk <br/> - Especially with insulin/secretagogues [^1121URgZ] |
| Nutritional status | - Fasting/low carb stores: higher hypoglycemia risk [^112foVXy] |

## Clinical guidelines for alcohol consumption in diabetes

The ADA provides **clear guidance**:

- **Limit intake**: ≤ 1 drink/day (women) or ≤ 2 drinks/day (men) [^112me1y3].

- **Never drink on an empty stomach**: Eat carbs to reduce hypoglycemia risk [^115dukys].

- **Monitor glucose**: Check before, during, and after drinking; watch for delayed hypoglycemia [^112me1y3].

- **Educate**: Teach recognition and management of delayed hypoglycemia [^111WrtkR].

- **Avoid if high risk**: History of hypoglycemia, liver disease, or alcohol use disorder [^115dukys].

---

## Practical recommendations for individuals with diabetes

- **Plan ahead**: Eat carbs before and during drinking; monitor glucose frequently [^1121URgZ].

- **Hydrate**: Drink water between alcoholic drinks to reduce hypoglycemia risk.

- **Carry glucose**: Have fast-acting carbs and glucagon available [^notfound].

- **Avoid risky drinks**: Limit sugary mixers and high-carb beers [^112PvonU].

- **Educate peers**: Ensure friends know hypoglycemia signs and how to help [^113igJ1p].

---

Alcohol has **complex, dose-dependent effects** on blood sugar: acute intake can cause hypoglycemia, while moderate chronic use may improve insulin sensitivity; heavy use worsens glycemic control. People with diabetes should **limit intake**, eat when drinking, and monitor glucose to reduce risks.

### Limited alcohol consumption and lower risk of diabetes: can we believe our own eyes? [^111UbLs3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

The case of alcohol and diabetes is unique, however, in that randomized trials of alcohol consumption among nondiabetic individuals have already tested its association with central aspects of diabetes pathophysiology. No equivalent to insulin resistance or glycemia itself exists for cardiovascular disease, for example, precluding this approach for other diseases, but this apposition enables a direct comparison of standard epidemiology (i.e. our own eyes), genetic epidemiology, and truly gold-standard evidence in this unique instance. What have these trials demonstrated?

In brief, they firmly support the results of conventional epidemiology. Our meta-analysis of 14 such trials showed that limited alcohol consumption significantly reduced fasting insulin and glycated hemoglobin concentration. Although these trials were generally short-term, every existing trial among adults with diabetes that has spanned months to years has also demonstrated significant improvements in insulin resistance and/or glycemia.

How should we reconcile results from actual randomized trials with genetic studies that suggest otherwise? Ma et al. provide several important clues to this discrepancy. The authors studied > 300,000 current drinkers in the UK Biobank, who were followed for ∼11 y for the occurrence of type 2 diabetes. The authors excluded nondrinkers, fully eliminating concerns about abstainers, and adjusted for key confounders including socioeconomic status. Even so, alcohol consumption was nonlinearly associated with risk of diabetes, with the lowest risk among consumers of between 100 and 200 g (i.e. ∼8–16 drinks) per week. Moreover, the authors observed a statistically significant 14% lower risk of type 2 diabetes for those consuming alcohol with meals than for those drinking outside meals; individuals with varying patterns showed intermediate risk. This finding persisted even with adjustment for actual drinking amount, although individuals who reported consuming alcohol only with meals were more likely to be high-frequency, low-quantity consumers. Of note, that very pattern has previously been associated with lower risk of diabetes. Thus, limited alcohol consumption was associated with lowest risk of diabetes, but specifically when consumed in a pattern that minimizes upward excursions in blood alcohol concentrations (as drinking with meals and low-quantity intake both do).

### Short-and medium-term effects of light to moderate alcohol intake on glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^115kJr3P]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

People with diabetes are told that drinking alcohol may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia.

Aims

To report the effects of alcohol consumption on glycaemic control in people with diabetes mellitus.

Methods

Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases were searched in 2015 to identify randomized trials that compared alcohol consumption with no alcohol use, reporting glycaemic control in people with diabetes. Data on blood glucose, HbA 1c and numbers of hypoglycaemic episodes were pooled using random effects meta-analysis.

Results

Pooled data from nine short-term studies showed no difference in blood glucose concentrations between those who drank alcohol in doses of 16–80 g (median 20 g, 2.5 units) compared with those who did not drink alcohol at 0.5, 2, 4 and 24 h after alcohol consumption. Pooled data from five medium-term studies showed that there was no difference in blood glucose or HbA 1c concentrations at the end of the study between those who drank 11–18 g alcohol/day (median 13 g/day, 1.5 units/day) for 4–104 weeks and those who did not. We found no evidence of a difference in number of hypoglycaemic episodes or in withdrawal rates between randomized groups.

Conclusions

Studies to date have not provided evidence that drinking light to moderate amounts of alcohol, with or without a meal, affects any measure of glycaemic control in people with Type 2 diabetes. These results suggest that current advice that people with diabetes do not need to refrain from drinking moderate quantities of alcohol does not need to be changed; risks to those with Type 1 diabetes remain uncertain.

### Diabetes mellitus and alcohol [^112foVXy]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Alcohol influences glucose metabolism in several ways in diabetic patients as well as in non-diabetic patients. Since alcohol inhibits both gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, its acute intake without food may provoke hypoglycaemia, especially in cases of depleted glycogen stores and in combination with sulphonylurea. Consumed with a meal including carbohydrates, it is the preferred fuel, which may initially lead to somewhat higher blood glucose levels and hence an insulin response in type 2 diabetic patients. Depending on the nature of the carbohydrates in the meal, this may be followed by reactive hypoglycaemia. Moderate consumption of alcohol is associated with a reduced risk of atherosclerotic disorders. Diabetic patients benefit from this favourable effect as much as non-diabetic patients. Apart from effects on lipid metabolism, haemostatic balance and blood pressure, alcohol improves insulin sensitivity. This improvement of insulin sensitivity may also be responsible for the lower incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus reported to be associated with light-to-moderate drinking. In case of moderate and sensible use, risks of disturbances in glycaemic control, weight and blood pressure are limited. Excessive intake of alcohol, however, may not only cause loss of metabolic control, but also annihilate the favourable effects on the cardiovascular system.

### Changes in alcohol consumption and subsequent risk of type 2 diabetes in men [^114B7wiC]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

The plausibility of these observational results is supported by short-term randomized controlled trials on changes in alcohol consumption (25–30 g/day). In these studies, moderate drinking significantly improved insulin sensitivity after 6 to 8 weeks. Also, clinical trials in a variety of populations have shown that alcohol consumption increases adiponectin, a hormone secreted by adipose tissue that appears to improve insulin sensitivity. Indeed, adiponectin appears to explain ∼25 to 30% of the inverse association between alcohol consumption and type 2 diabetes in women Finally, longer-term randomized trials of 3 to 12 months among diabetic individuals have shown that assignment to alcohol consumption lowers fasting glucose and A1C.

These findings from randomized trials suggest that the effects of alcohol intake on glycemia may have a short latency, as they appear within weeks of assignment to alcohol. Our results are consistent with this finding, as the more beneficial metabolic parameters and the lower subsequent risk of diabetes associated with an increase in alcohol consumption were observed in the next follow-up period. Our results further imply that the effect may be transient, as a decrease in consumption was accompanied by a modest increase in risk. Finally, our results highlight that any benefit of alcohol on glycemia and risk of diabetes is restricted to moderate drinking, and increases among those already drinking moderately confer no lower risk.

### Effects of alcohol on plasma glucose and prevention of alcohol-induced hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes – A systematic review with GRADE [^113qPjZR]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Because ethanol is thought to be a risk factor for severe hypoglycemia, patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are recommended to limit ethanol intake. However, little is known on how ethanol affects plasma glucose and how ethanol-induced hypoglycemia can be prevented. In this study, we systematically reviewed the literature for ethanol effects on plasma glucose and for prevention strategies on ethanol-induced hypoglycemia. Electronic searches on PubMed and Google were conducted in February 2017. Randomized clinical trials and observational studies were included. Studies involved patients with T1D with no history of ethanol abuse. The primary aims were changes in plasma glucose after ethanol intake and prevention strategies for ethanol-induced hypoglycemia. Quality of the studies was assessed by GRADE. Additionally, we searched for guidelines from diabetes associations on their suggested prevention strategies. We included 13 studies. Eight studies reported that ethanol, regardless of administration intravenously or orally, were associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia due to decrease in plasma glucose, impaired counter-regulatory response, awareness of hypoglycemia, and cognitive function. Five studies did not report an increased risk of hypoglycemia. None of the studies investigated prevention strategies for ethanol-induced hypoglycemia. Recommendations from 13 diabetes associations were included. All associations recommend that ethanol should only be consumed with food intake. The majority of included studies showed that ethanol intake increased the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with T1D. However, the evidence for how to prevent ethanol-induced hypoglycemia is sparse, and further investigations are needed to establish evidence-based recommendations.

### The effect of alcohol consumption on insulin sensitivity and glycemic status: a systematic review and meta-analysis of intervention studies [^111eChs5]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. This reduced risk might be explained by improved insulin sensitivity or improved glycemic status, but results of intervention studies on this relation are inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of intervention studies investigating the effect of alcohol consumption on insulin sensitivity and glycemic status.

Research Design and Methods

PubMed and Embase were searched up to August 2014. Intervention studies on the effect of alcohol consumption on biological markers of insulin sensitivity or glycemic status of at least 2 weeks' duration were included. Investigators extracted data on study characteristics, outcome measures, and methodological quality.

Results

Fourteen intervention studies were included in a meta-analysis of six glycemic end points. Alcohol consumption did not influence estimated insulin sensitivity (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.08 [-0.09 to 0.24]) or fasting glucose (SMD 0.07 [-0.11 to 0.24]) but reduced HbA1c (SMD -0.62 [-1.01 to -0.23]) and fasting insulin concentrations (SMD -0.19 [-0.35 to -0.02]) compared with the control condition. Alcohol consumption among women reduced fasting insulin (SMD -0.23 [-0.41 to -0.04]) and tended to improve insulin sensitivity (SMD 0.16 [-0.04 to 0.37]) but not among men. Results were similar after excluding studies with high alcohol dosages (> 40 g/day) and were not influenced by dosage and duration of the intervention.

Conclusions

Although the studies had small sample sizes and were of short duration, the current evidence suggests that moderate alcohol consumption may decrease fasting insulin and HbA1c concentrations among nondiabetic subjects. Alcohol consumption might improve insulin sensitivity among women but did not do so overall.

### Effect of meal composition and alcohol consumption on postprandial glucose concentration in subjects with type 1 diabetes: a randomized crossover trial [^112MRUb6]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Glycemic variability, especially in the postprandial state, is one of the most challenging issues of blood glucose control in subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D). It can have profound implications for both patients and healthcare providers. For the former, glycemic variability implies a greater risk of unexpected hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia and may represent a psychological burden since it is related to a poor quality of sleep and probably to a worse quality of life.

Meal composition is certainly one of the most important determinants of both intraday and interday within-subject postprandial variability. Additionally, there is evidence of intersubject variability in the response to identical meals. Nevertheless, carbohydrate intake is the main driver of postprandial glucose (PPG) elevation, and despite accurate carbohydrate counting and new technologies it remains one of the most challenging aspects of diabetes care. Protein and fat intake likely plays a role on PPG, but findings are heterogeneous. Indeed, while some studies observed a significant increase in mean glucose area under the curve (AUC) (or in insulin needed to maintain the same glucose control) with the addition of proteins and/or fats in the meal, others failed to demonstrate it. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect varies greatly among studies, and most importantly, majority of them used relatively low amount of carbohydrates (30–50 g).

Another possible source of PPG variability is alcohol consumption. However, data regarding the role of alcohol in the context of a mixed meal are scarce. This issue is relevant, since ethanol consumption among subjects with T1D is similar to that of the general populationand it could significantly affect blood glucose control through direct and indirect pathways. The literature is even poorer about the effect of beer, despite it being the most consumed alcoholic drink in the vast majority of countries in the world.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of high carbohydrate meals of different compositions, with or without ethanol, on the PPG response in adult subjects with T1D.

### Glipizide (glipizide XL) [^113c3zst]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

You must continue your diet and exercise program while taking GLIPIZIDE XL. You must also have your blood and urine tested regularly to be sure GLIPIZIDE XL is working.

GLIPIZIDE XL may not work for everyone. If it does work, you may find that GLIPIZIDE XL is not working as well for you after you have used it for a while. Tell your healthcare provider if GLIPIZIDE XL is not working well.

What Should I Avoid While Taking GLIPIZIDE XL?

Some medicines can affect how well GLIPIZIDE XL works or may affect your blood sugar level. Check with your healthcare provider or pharmacist before you start or stop taking prescription or over-the-counter medicines, including natural/herbal remedies, while on GLIPIZIDE XL.

What are the Possible Side Effects of GLIPIZIDE XL?

Low blood sugar. GLIPIZIDE XL may lower your blood sugar to low levels that are dangerous (hypoglycemia). This can happen if you do not follow your diet, exercise too much, drink alcohol, are under stress, or get sick. This could also happen if your dose of GLIPIZIDE XL is higher than you need. Your healthcare provider may need to adjust it. Do not adjust the dose on your own.

### Glyburide-metformin hydrochloride [^113EuHLR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

What should I avoid while taking glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets?

Do not drink a lot of alcoholic drinks while taking glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets. This means you should not binge drink for short periods, and you should not drink a lot of alcohol on a regular basis. Alcohol can increase the chance of getting lactic acidosis.
Do not drive, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets affects you.

What are the possible side effects of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets?

Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets can cause serious side effects, including:

See " What is the most important information I should know about glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets?"
low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Low blood sugar is a serious, but common side effect of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets. If you take glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets with another medicine that can cause low blood sugar, such as insulin, you have a higher risk of getting low blood sugar. The dose of insulin or other diabetic medicines may need to be lowered while you take glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets. Signs and symptoms of low blood sugar may include:

increased risk of cardiovascular deaths. Taking oral hypoglycemic medicines like glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets to treat diabetes have increased the risk of death from heart disease or stroke compared to treating diabetes with diet alone or diet and insulin.
hemolytic anemia. People with G6PD deficiency who take glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets may develop hemolytic anemia (fast breakdown of red blood cells).
low vitamin B (vitamin B deficiency). Using glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets may cause a decrease in the amount of vitamin B12in your blood, especially if you have had low vitamin B12levels before. Your healthcare provider may do blood tests to check your vitamin B12levels.

### Glipizide (glucotrol XL) [^113S2Jc9]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

You must continue your diet and exercise program while taking GLUCOTROL XL. You must also have your blood and urine tested regularly to be sure GLUCOTROL XL is working.

GLUCOTROL XL may not work for everyone. If it does work, you may find that GLUCOTROL XL is not working as well for you after you have used it for a while. Tell your healthcare provider if GLUCOTROL XL is not working well.

What Should I Avoid While Taking GLUCOTROL XL?

Some medicines can affect how well GLUCOTROL XL works or may affect your blood sugar level. Check with your healthcare provider or pharmacist before you start or stop taking prescription or over-the-counter medicines, including natural/herbal remedies, while on GLUCOTROL XL.

What are the Possible Side Effects of GLUCOTROL XL?

Low blood sugar. GLUCOTROL XL may lower your blood sugar to low levels that are dangerous (hypoglycemia). This can happen if you do not follow your diet, exercise too much, drink alcohol, are under stress, or get sick. This could also happen if your dose of GLUCOTROL XL is higher than you need. Your healthcare provider may need to adjust it. Do not adjust the dose on your own.

PATIENT INFORMATION ABOUT FORTAMET®
(metformin hydrochloride) Extended-Release Tablets

Q1. Why do I need to take FORTAMET?

Your doctor has prescribed FORTAMET®to treat your
type 2 diabetes, a condition in which blood sugar (blood glucose) is elevated.
There are two types of diabetes. FORTAMET®is indicated
for the most common type, known as type 2 diabetes.

Q2. Why is it important to control type 2 diabetes?

Type 2 diabetes has multiple possible complications, including blindness,
kidney failure, and circulatory and heart problems. Lowering your blood sugar to
a normal level may prevent or delay these complications.

Q3. How is type 2 diabetes usually controlled?

High blood sugar can be lowered by diet and exercise, by a number of oral
medications and by insulin injections. Your doctor may recommend that you try
lifestyle modifications such as improved diet and exercise before initiating
drug treatment for type 2 diabetes. Each patient will be treated individually by
his or her physician, and should follow all treatment recommendations.

Q4. Does FORTAMET work differently
from other glucose control medications?

Yes. FORTAMET®, as well as other formulations of
metformin, lowers the amount of sugar in your blood by controlling how much
sugar is released by the liver. FORTAMET®(metformin
hydrochloride) does not cause your body to produce more insulin. FORTAMET®rarely causes hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and it does not
usually cause weight gain when taken alone. However, if you do not eat enough,
if you take other medications to lower blood sugar, or if you drink alcohol, you
can develop hypoglycemia. Specifically, when FORTAMET®is
taken together with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, hypoglycemia and weight gain
are more likely to occur.

### Effect of alcohol consumption on diabetes mellitus: a systematic review [^112sWqhR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Both diabetes mellitus and alcohol consumption are prevalent in the United States, yet physicians are poorly informed about how alcohol use affects risk for or management of diabetes.

Purpose

To conduct a systematic review assessing the effect of alcohol use on the incidence, management, and complications of diabetes mellitus in adults.

Data Sources

English-language studies in persons 19 years of age or older that were identified by searching the MEDLINE database from 1966 to the third week of August 2003 and the reference lists of key articles.

Study Selection

Two independent assessors reviewed 974 retrieved citations to identify all experimental, cohort, or case-control studies that assessed the effect of alcohol use on diabetes risk, control, self-management, adverse drug events, or complications.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data and evaluated study quality on the basis of established criteria.

Data Synthesis

Thirty-two studies that met inclusion criteria were reviewed. Compared with no alcohol use, moderate consumption (one to 3 drinks/d) is associated with a 33% to 56% lower incidence of diabetes and a 34% to 55% lower incidence of diabetes-related coronary heart disease. Compared with moderate consumption, heavy consumption (> 3 drinks/d) may be associated with up to a 43% increased incidence of diabetes. Moderate alcohol consumption does not acutely impair glycemic control in persons with diabetes.

Conclusions

Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a decreased incidence of diabetes mellitus and a decreased incidence of heart disease in persons with diabetes. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term effects of alcohol consumption on glycemic control and noncardiac complications in persons with diabetes.

### Lifestyle management of hypertension: international society of hypertension position paper endorsed by the World Hypertension League and European Society of Hypertension [^1148Bsti]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertension, defined as persistently elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at least 90 mmHg (International Society of Hypertension guidelines), affects over 1.5 billion people worldwide. Hypertension is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events (e.g. coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke) and death. An international panel of experts convened by the International Society of Hypertension College of Experts compiled lifestyle management recommendations as first-line strategy to prevent and control hypertension in adulthood. We also recommend that lifestyle changes be continued even when blood pressure-lowering medications are prescribed. Specific recommendations based on literature evidence are summarized with advice to start these measures early in life, including maintaining a healthy body weight, increased levels of different types of physical activity, healthy eating and drinking, avoidance and cessation of smoking and alcohol use, management of stress and sleep levels. We also discuss the relevance of specific approaches including consumption of sodium, potassium, sugar, fibre, coffee, tea, intermittent fasting as well as integrated strategies to implement these recommendations using, for example, behaviour change-related technologies and digital tools.

### Alcohol use and fasting glucose in a developing Southern Chinese population: the guangzhou biobank cohort study [^11329ho3]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In observational studies, mainly from Western Caucasian populations, moderate alcohol use has been shown to be associated with a lower risk of diabetes. However, whether the protection is due to the attributes of alcohol or to those of moderate alcohol users is difficult to disentangle. A population with a different distribution of alcohol consumption and diabetes prevalence from Western populations was studied as a counterfactual comparison.

Methods

Baseline data from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study phases 1 and 2 (2003–6) were used to examine the adjusted associations, using multivariable censored linear regression, of alcohol use with fasting blood glucose in older (≥ 50 years) men (n = 5740) and women (n = 14 274) from southern China. Moderate alcohol use was defined as weekly drinking of ≤ 210 g alcohol in men and ≤ 140 g in women. The expected associations of alcohol with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and blood pressure were also checked.

Results

Moderate alcohol users had very similar fasting glucose levels to never users, adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, smoking and physical activity. In contrast, moderate alcohol users had higher HDL-cholesterol by 0.05 mmol/litre (95% CI 0.02 to 0.07). Excessive (more than moderate) alcohol users had higher fasting glucose.

Conclusions

In an understudied population with a different pattern of alcohol use from the populations usually studied, the biologically expected effects of moderate alcohol use were seen, but there was little effect on fasting glucose. Although cross-sectional studies cannot be conclusive, this pattern of findings, if confirmed, suggests that moderate alcohol use may not affect fasting glucose, although excessive use may be a risk factor.

### Knowledge, safety, and impact of alcohol consumption in young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a qualitative study [^112FDGLb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Several sources contribute to a widely inconsistent understanding of the impact and management of alcohol consumption

A majority of the participants reported that information regarding the management of alcohol consumption was provided in some form by their diabetes clinical team. Of those who received alcohol-related information, half found that the information offered practical harm reduction benefit when applied to their drinking, including the importance of food before and after drinking and specific strategies to manage insulin dosing. However, there was some observed disparity in the quality and presentation of the data, varying from high-quality explanations to underwhelming delivery through a multitude of documents (quotes 1 and 2). One individual reported that this advice led to an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. Some of the advice provided to these young adults included ensuring food consumption before and throughout the timespan of drinking, regular glucose monitoring, and modification or omittance of insulin doses. Those who did not receive advice from their clinical team had to seek out alternative sources of education. The different sources reported included various websites, other individuals with type 1 diabetes, and family members (quote 3). The most commonly used websites for information were forms of social media with personal anecdotes; some participants did use more reputable sources such as 'Beyond Type 1. Personal lived experience with past alcohol consumption was also rated as a very useful education tool (quote 4).

Every participant highlighted during their interview that they knew alcohol consumption was theoretically riskier for them due to their chronic condition, nonetheless, they did not let this prevent them from partaking. They all reported knowing how their blood glucose levels would react to alcohol consumption. Notably most participants found that in their experience their blood sugars would normally increase with alcohol consumption. Nearly all of these individuals then found that their blood glucose levels would begin to fall, especially overnight (quote 5).

### Modifying effects of alcohol on the postprandial glucose and insulin responses in healthy subjects [^113CCF9P]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Moderate alcohol consumption associates with lower risk of type 2 diabetes, but in postprandial studies, alcohol induced impaired insulin sensitivity. The measurement of the glycemic index (GI) for beer has been considered challenging because of its low carbohydrate content. Therefore, imputed GI values from 36 to 95 on the basis of carbohydrate-rich beverages have been used for beer in epidemiologic studies.

Objectives

We investigated the acute effects of alcohol on glucose and insulin responses and measured GIs and insulinemic indexes (IIs) of nonalcoholic and alcoholic beers.

Design

In a crossover design, 10 healthy volunteers were served beer with 4.5% alcohol by volume, nonalcoholic beer, and a glucose solution with alcohol once and the reference glucose solution twice. Each portion contained 25 g available carbohydrate, and the beer and glucose solution with alcohol contained 21 g alcohol. Capillary blood samples were collected up to 2 h after ingestion, and the incremental AUCs (IAUCs), GIs, and IIs were calculated.

Results

Compared with the reference glucose solution, the glucose solution with alcohol produced an 18% higher postprandial glucose IAUC (P = 0.03) and had no significant effect on the insulin IAUC. Compared with the reference glucose solution, beer had no significant effect on glucose or insulin IAUCs, and nonalcoholic beer tended to reduce the glucose IAUC (P = 0.06) but not the insulin IAUC. GIs of beer and nonalcoholic beer were 119 and 80, and IIs were 130 and 88, respectively.

Conclusions

Alcohol increases the postprandial glucose response, probably through impaired insulin sensitivity. GI values published for alcohol-containing beers have underestimated the true glycemic effects.

### Glycemic effects of moderate alcohol intake among patients with type 2 diabetes: a multicenter, randomized, clinical intervention trial [^111R24wR]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

In a randomized controlled trial, we assessed the effect of daily moderate alcohol intake on glycemic control in the fasting and postprandial states in patients with type 2 diabetes who previously had abstained from alcohol.

Research Design and Methods

We randomly assigned 109 patients (41–74 years old) with established type 2 diabetes who abstained from alcohol to receive 150 mL wine (13 g alcohol) or nonalcoholic diet beer (control) each day during a 3-month multicenter trial. The beverages were consumed during dinner. Diet and alcohol consumption were monitored.

Results

During the intervention, 17% of participants (12% from the alcohol group) dropped out, leaving 91 who completed the trial. Within the alcohol group, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) decreased from 139.6 ± 41 to 118.0 ± 32.5 mg/dl after 3 months compared with 136.7 ± 15.4 to 138.6 ± 27.8 mg/dl in the control subjects (P(v) = 0.015). However, alcohol consumption had no effect on 2-h postprandial glucose levels (difference of 18.5 mg/dl in the control group vs. 17.7 mg/dl in the alcohol group, P(v) = 0.97). Patients in the alcohol group with higher baseline A1C levels had greater reductions in FPG (age-adjusted correlation -0.57, P(v) < 0.001). No significant changes were observed in the levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, or aspartate aminotransferase, and no notable adverse effects were reported. Participants in the alcohol group reported an improvement in the ability to fall asleep (P(v) < 0.001).

Conclusions

Among patients with type 2 diabetes who had previously abstained from alcohol, initiation of moderate daily alcohol consumption reduced FPG but not postprandial glucose. Patients with higher A1C may benefit more from the favorable glycemic effect of alcohol. Further intervention studies are needed to confirm the long-term effect of moderate alcohol intake.

- have liver problems.

- have congestive heart failure that requires treatment with medicines.

- drink a lot of alcohol (very often or short-term "binge" drinking).

- get dehydrated (lose a large amount of body fluids). This can happen if you are sick with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. Dehydration can also happen when you sweat a lot with activity or exercise and do not drink enough fluids.

- have certain x-ray tests with injectable dyes or contrast agents.

- have surgery.

- have a heart attack, severe infection, or stroke.

- are 80 years of age or older and have not had your kidney function tested.

What are metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets?

- Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are prescription medicines that contain metformin hydrochloride. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used with diet and exercise to help control high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) in adults with type 2 diabetes.

- Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not for people with type 1 diabetes.

- Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not for people with diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in your blood or urine).

Metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets have the same active ingredient. However, metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets works longer in your body. Both of these medicines help control your blood sugar in a number of ways. These include helping your body respond better to the insulin it makes naturally, decreasing the amount of sugar your liver makes, and decreasing the amount of sugar your intestines absorb. Metformin hydrochloride tablets and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets do not cause your body to make more insulin.

### Alcohol as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115yWB5w]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To clarify the dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption and type 2 diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

A systematic computer-assisted and hand search was conducted to identify relevant articles with longitudinal design and quantitative measurement of alcohol consumption. Adjustment was made for the sick-quitter effect. We used fractional polynomials in a meta-regression to determine the dose-response relationships by sex and end point using lifetime abstainers as the reference group.

RESULTS

The search revealed 20 cohort studies that met our inclusion criteria. A U-shaped relationship was found for both sexes. Compared with lifetime abstainers, the relative risk (RR) for type 2 diabetes among men was most protective when consuming 22 g/day alcohol (RR 0.87 [95% CI 0.76–1.00]) and became deleterious at just over 60 g/day alcohol (1.01 [0.71–1.44]). Among women, consumption of 24 g/day alcohol was most protective (0.60 [0.52–0.69]) and became deleterious at about 50 g/day alcohol (1.02 [0.83–1.26]).

CONCLUSIONS

Our analysis confirms previous research findings that moderate alcohol consumption is protective for type 2 diabetes in men and women.

### The relationship between different dimensions of alcohol use and the burden of disease-an update [^111hgA4n]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus

There seems to be a beneficial effect of alcohol use on diabetes mellitus type 2 incidence 188, as evidenced in meta‐analyses and in systematic reviews 189, 190, 191, 192, 193. However, this seemingly unambiguous picture must be qualified by different results by gender and ethnicity. For instance, stratification of available data in the latest and most comprehensive meta‐analyses by Knott and colleagues 192 revealed that reductions in risk may apply to women only and may be absent in studies sampled in the Asian region. In addition, Knott 192 found that some beneficial effects disappeared when compared to life‐time abstainers, a problem not unique to diabetes (174; see below and discussion in 173). Also, intervention studies about the effects of reductions in the consumption of alcohol on glucose and insulin biomarkers in people with and without diabetes showed mixed results 194, 195. Irregular heavy drinking occasions may play a role in explaining the differences between studies and in the reviews (e.g. 196, 197), but there are not enough epidemiological studies on diabetes including this dimension of alcohol exposure to settle this question.

Whether a beneficial effect of alcohol on diabetes should be modelled in future CRAs will be a discussion in the respective technical advisory committees. This decision has important public health relevance (see 198 for additional considerations), as the effect is fairly large, given the prevalence of diabetes mellitus world‐wide 199, 200 and the relatively high effect size found in epidemiological studies on alcohol use and the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus 191, 192.

### The experiences and support needs of students with diabetes at university: an integrative literature review [^1142r96p]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Alcohol management strategies

In online posts, students reported incidents of severe hypoglycaemia due to alcohol but not knowing how to manage their diabetes when drinking. Drinking habits may not be regularly discussed with healthcare professionals. Students used a variety of methods to moderate the risks of alcohol and having strategies in place predicted less drinking and fewer consequences. Strategies included eating before and/or after drinking, avoiding parties and bars, socialising but not drinking alcohol, having personal rules about the type and amount of alcohol they can safely consume, avoiding drinking games, pacing or keeping track of drinks, choosing drinks with sugar or sugar‐free, taking insulin to cover alcohol, monitoring blood glucose, and drinking with friends. Friends were helpful by either not pressuring them to drink or by assisting in an emergency. Short‐term improvements in binge drinking, knowledge, attitudes, concerns and intentions were reported after alcohol and diabetes education.

### Alcohol as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114v1t8L]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Non–insulin-dependent diabetes (type 2) was the outcome. Although this outcome can be measured in various ways, the current World Health Organization (WHO) clinical diagnostic criteria were considered the gold standard for this meta-analysis. These criteria define diabetes by a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level ≥ 7.0 mmol/l or a venous plasma concentration ≥ 11.1 mmol/l 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose challenge. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) also includes as sufficient criteria symptoms of hyperglycemia and a random plasma glucose concentration ≥ 11.1 mmol/l. The criteria, however, changed in 1996 (ADA) and 1999 (WHO) from an FPG ≥ 7.8 mmol/l.

Articles were found via a search of the following sources: Medline (via OVID and PubMed), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), CAB Abstracts, World Health Organization Library Information System (WHOLIS), the System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE), the Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Science (ETOH), Web of Science, and the Alcohol In Moderation (AIM; an alcohol industry database) databases. The databases were searched for reports published from 1 January 1980 to 31 January 2008, with the following keywords: alcohol or ethanol, diabetes, case-control or cohort or prospective, and risk. Animal studies, commentaries, editorials, letters, and review articles were excluded. No language restriction was applied. A simplified search using the terms alcohol or ethanol as well as diabetes was used for WHOLIS and SIGLE, which could not support the complex strategy. AIM is not a searchable index, but a selective list of articles was reviewed.

### Alcohol consumption and diabetes risk in the diabetes prevention program [^111f3okR]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in the general population, but little is known about the effects in individuals at high risk of diabetes.

Objectives

The objectives were to determine associations between alcohol consumption and diabetes risk factors and whether alcohol consumption was a predictor of incident diabetes in individuals enrolled in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).

Design

DPP participants (n = 3175) had impaired glucose tolerance (2-h glucose: 7.8–11.1 mmol/L), elevated fasting glucose (5.3–7.0 mmol/L), and a body mass index (in kg/m(2)) ≥ 24. Participants were randomly assigned to placebo, metformin, or lifestyle modification and were followed for a mean of 3.2 y. Alcohol intake was assessed at baseline and year 1 by using a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Diabetes was diagnosed by annual oral-glucose-tolerance testing and semiannual fasting plasma glucose measurement.

Results

Participants who reported higher alcohol consumption tended to be male, older, white, and less obese and to have a higher calorie intake and a higher HDL-cholesterol concentration. Higher alcohol consumption was associated with lower insulin secretion at any level of insulin sensitivity. We found lower incidence rates of diabetes with higher alcohol consumption in the metformin (P < 0.01 for trend) and lifestyle modification (P = 0.02 for trend) groups, which remained significant after adjustment for multiple baseline covariates. No similar association was observed in the placebo group.

Conclusions

Despite overall low rates of alcohol consumption, there was a reduced risk of incident diabetes in those who reported modest daily alcohol intake and were assigned to metformin or lifestyle modification. Moderate daily alcohol intake is associated with lower insulin secretion-an effect that warrants further investigation. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00038727.

### Effects of repeated binge drinking on blood pressure levels and other cardiovascular health metrics in young adults: national health and nutrition examination survey, 2011–2014 [^112ksLDd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

In middle‐aged and older adults, binge drinking is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and hypertension. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Binge drinking is also associated with an increased likelihood of developing prehypertension, previously defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 120 and 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 70 and 90 mm Hg. 6 In nearly all population‐based studies examining the effects of alcohol on blood pressure (BP) and other cardiovascular metrics, young adults (18‐30 years) and those in middle adulthood (31‐45 years) are underrepresented. 1, 7 In the United States high rates of binge drinking are prevalent in both of these age cohorts. 8 Binge drinking is often defined as consuming 5 drinks or more in a row for men (≥ 4 drinks for women) per occasion within the past 30 days. 7

Present‐day young adults consume 6 to 7 drinks per binge‐drinking episode (exceeding the current binge threshold of 4+/5+ drinks per episode) and binge drink several times a week. 9, 10, 11, 12 Compared with previous generations, the intensity (ie, 6‐7 drinks) and regularity (several times per week) of binge drinking may place today's young adults at greater risk for more profound rates of alcohol‐related harm, such as elevated BP and increased prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors. In particular, elevated BP is one of the strongest, most modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. 13 Even among normotensive individuals, small reductions in average BP may have a marked impact on the future development of cardiovascular disease. 14 The new High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline defines "elevated BP" as a systolic BP between 120 and 129 mm Hg and diastolic > 80 mm Hg. 15 In the United States it is estimated that alcohol consumption may account for close to 10% of the population burden of hypertension. 15

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between repeated binge drinking and BP as well as lipid and fasting glucose levels in adults between 18 and 45 years of age. We also sought to determine if there were differences in these associations between men and women. We analyzed data from NHANES (the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) for male and female 18‐ to 45‐year‐olds who were non–binge drinkers, binge drank 1 to 12 times, or binge drank > 12 times in the past year. 16

### Alcohol and ideal cardiovascular health: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^113Uhyv3]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

4.3 Possible mechanisms

The main finding of our study showed light, and in some participants moderate, alcohol consumption was associated with favorable CVH scores and most ideal metrics. Participants who drank any alcohol did not meet the ideal criteria for smoking. This is not surprising because alcohol consumption and smoking are closely related behaviors. 23 Among alcoholics, the rate of smoking is approximately 90% and may be attributable to neurobiological mechanisms, such as cross‐tolerance and cross‐sensitization to both nicotine and alcohol. 23 Light to moderate alcohol consumption was associated with increased odds of ideal physical activity and BMI. Although these positive associations have been previously reported, 24, 25, 26 the mechanisms underlying them are still ambiguous. For example, individuals who drink alcohol only in moderation may have other favorable health‐seeking behaviors that contribute to their more optimal CVH profile.

In addition, we found light to moderate alcohol consumption was associated with ideal blood glucose levels. This finding, if causal, could be explained by the hypoglycemic effect alcohol has on glucose metabolism. Light to moderate alcohol consumption has been linked to increase in high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol; however, we found that participants who reported > 2 drinks/day were 54% less likely to have ideal total cholesterol levels. For blood pressure, those who reported < 1 drink/day were 38% more likely to have ideal levels. Prior research has demonstrated heavy drinking increases blood pressure mainly through stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and increase in intracellular calcium in the vascular smooth muscle. 27, 28, 29

Another interesting finding of our study was that sex was an effect modifier of the association between alcohol and CVH. Similar to prior research, 30 we found that women had a larger proportion of abstainers compared to men (29% vs 10%) while men had a larger proportion of heavy (6% vs < 1%) and binge drinkers (14% vs 3%). These differences in drinking habits may be driven by psycho‐socio‐cultural factors, such as the perceived differences in traditional gender roles observed in different ethnic and age groups. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 However, recent studies show that the differences reported in alcohol consumption among men and women is diminishing as the socioeconomic and cultural characteristics of younger people become more similar regardless of sex. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34

### Alcohol as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112PeJSa]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To clarify the dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption and type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

A systematic computer-assisted and hand search was conducted to identify relevant articles with longitudinal design and quantitative measurement of alcohol consumption. Adjustment was made for the sick-quitter effect. We used fractional polynomials in a meta-regression to determine the dose-response relationships by sex and end point using lifetime abstainers as the reference group.

Results

The search revealed 20 cohort studies that met our inclusion criteria. A U-shaped relationship was found for both sexes. Compared with lifetime abstainers, the relative risk (RR) for type 2 diabetes among men was most protective when consuming 22 g/day alcohol (RR 0.87 [95% CI 0.76–1.00]) and became deleterious at just over 60 g/day alcohol (1.01 [0.71–1.44]). Among women, consumption of 24 g/day alcohol was most protective (0.60 [0.52–0.69]) and became deleterious at about 50 g/day alcohol (1.02 [0.83–1.26]).

Conclusions

Our analysis confirms previous research findings that moderate alcohol consumption is protective for type 2 diabetes in men and women.

### Effects of initiating moderate alcohol intake on cardiometabolic risk in adults with type 2 diabetes: a 2-year randomized, controlled trial [^111GCL3i]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Recommendations for moderate alcohol consumption remain controversial, particularly in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Long-term randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) are lacking.

Objective

To assess cardiometabolic effects of initiating moderate alcohol intake in persons with T2DM and whether the type of wine matters.

Design

2-year RCT (CASCADE [CArdiovaSCulAr Diabetes & Ethanol] trial). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00784433).

Setting

Ben-Gurion University of the Negev-Soroka Medical Center and Nuclear Research Center Negev, Israel.

Patients

Alcohol-abstaining adults with well-controlled T2DM.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to 150 mL of mineral water, white wine, or red wine with dinner for 2 years. Wines and mineral water were provided. All groups followed a Mediterranean diet without caloric restriction.

Measurements

Primary outcomes were lipid and glycemic control profiles. Genetic measurements were done, and patients were followed for blood pressure, liver biomarkers, medication use, symptoms, and quality of life.

Results

Of the 224 patients who were randomly assigned, 94% had follow-up data at 1 year and 87% at 2 years. In addition to the changes in the water group (Mediterranean diet only), red wine significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level by 0.05 mmol/L (2.0 mg/dL) (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.06 mmol/L [1.6 to 2.2 mg/dL]; P < 0.001) and apolipoprotein(a)1 level by 0.03 g/L (CI, 0.01 to 0.06 g/L; P = 0.05) and decreased the total cholesterol-HDL-C ratio by 0.27 (CI, -0.52 to -0.01; P = 0.039). Only slow ethanol metabolizers (alcohol dehydrogenase alleles [ADH1B*1] carriers) significantly benefited from the effect of both wines on glycemic control (fasting plasma glucose, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and hemoglobin A1c) compared with fast ethanol metabolizers (persons homozygous for ADH1B*2). Across the 3 groups, no material differences were identified in blood pressure, adiposity, liver function, drug therapy, symptoms, or quality of life, except that sleep quality improved in both wine groups compared with the water group (P = 0.040). Overall, compared with the changes in the water group, red wine further reduced the number of components of the metabolic syndrome by 0.34 (CI, -0.68 to -0.001; P = 0.049).

Limitation

Participants were not blinded to treatment allocation.

Conclusion

This long-term RCT suggests that initiating moderate wine intake, especially red wine, among well-controlled diabetics as part of a healthy diet is apparently safe and modestly decreases cardiometabolic risk. The genetic interactions suggest that ethanol plays an important role in glucose metabolism, and red wine's effects also involve nonalcoholic constituents.

### The association between alcohol and metabolic syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11276Eyp]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Dose of alcohol

The dose and amount of alcohol consumption varied in different studies. Our study was categorized based on the study by Lee S and Vidot DC and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In this way, 0 to 15 g per day were considered as light consumption, 15 to 30 g per day as moderate consumption, and more than 30 g per day as heavy consumption. Also, alcohol consumption per week by gender was considered as low drinker (females: 1–3 drinks/week; males: 1–7 drinks/week), moderate drinker (females: 3–7 drinks/week; males: 7–14 drinks/week) and heavy (females: > 7 drinks/week; males: > 14 drinks/week). In general, for studies that did not separate alcohol consumption by gender, on average, less than 2 times per week was considered as light consumption, 2 to 7 times per week was considered as moderate consumption, and more than seven times per week as heavy consumption.

Metabolic syndrome

In most studies, the definitions used for metabolic syndrome are based on the criteria of the modified United States National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATP) III and International Diabetes Federation definition (IDF) as follows:

Metabolic syndrome (Mets): is defined according to NCEP-ATP III Guideline. Patients had at least three of the following risk features to be categorized under the Mets group: waist circumference (WC) ≥ 102 cm in men and ≥ 88 cm in women, triglycerides (TG) ≥ 150 mg/dl, reduced high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, (HDL-C) < 40 mg/dl in men and < 50 mg/dl in women, blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHg systolic blood pressure (SBP) or ≥ 85 mmHg diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting blood glucose (FBG) ≥ 110 mg/dl.

According to IDF, metabolic syndrome is diagnosed based on waist circumference ≥ 90th percentile in combination with any two clinical measures of the following elements: blood pressure (≥ 130/85 MmHg), glucose (fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 100 mg/dL), and lipids (serum triglyceride ≥ 150 mg/dL or serum HDL-C < 40 mg/dl).

### Type 1 diabetes through the life span: a position statement of the American diabetes association [^112iddPi]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Nutrition Therapy

Nutrition therapy is an important component of the treatment plan for all individuals with type 1 diabetes. Each patient should have an individualized food plan based on food preferences, schedule, and physical activity. Nutrition therapy aims to ensure that the patient and family understand the impact food has on blood glucose, how food interacts with exercise and insulin to prevent hypo- and hyperglycemia and to achieve glucose goals, and how to implement the food plan in a variety of situations. The food plan takes into consideration the patient's numeracy, literacy, engagement, and ability to adjust insulin.

General diabetes nutrition principles, as defined in the ADA Standards of Care, apply to people with type 1 diabetes, particularly in reference to normal growth and development in youth and the maintenance of a healthy body weight at all ages. Specifically, with regards to individuals with type 1 diabetes, topics such as carbohydrate counting and meal composition should be addressed. For selected individuals who have mastered carbohydrate counting, education on the impact of protein and fat on glycemic excursions should be incorporated into diabetes management. Those who are overweight or obese may benefit from weight reduction counseling.

Recommendations

Individualized medical nutrition therapy is recommended for all people with type 1 diabetes as an effective component of the overall treatment plan. (A)
Monitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, remains a key strategy in achieving glycemic control. (B)
If adults with type 1 diabetes choose to drink alcohol, they should be advised to do so in moderation (one drink per day or less for adult women and two drinks per day or less for adult men). Discussion with a health care provider is advised to explore potential interactions with medications. Adults should be advised that alcohol can lower blood glucose levels and that driving after drinking alcohol is contraindicated. (E)

### Effects of repeated binge drinking on blood pressure levels and other cardiovascular health metrics in young adults: national health and nutrition examination survey, 2011–2014 [^114fazt6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Increased levels of HDL‐c in young adults have been associated with a reduced cardiovascular risk later in life. 29 The role of HDL‐c, however, has been brought into question by negative findings from clinical drug trials and negative Mendelian randomization studies. 32 In our study binge drinking was associated with higher HDL‐c levels, and in all groups HDL‐c levels were greater than 50 mg/dL.

Few studies have examined the effect of binge drinking on metabolic parameters, such as fasting glucose. In our study fasting glucose was decreased for binge‐drinking men compared with non–binge drinkers but higher in binge‐drinking women compared with non–binge‐drinking women. Importantly, in our analysis we included potential confounders related to diet and physical activity, parameters that can affect glucose levels. Increased fasting glucose is a feature of metabolic syndrome. 33 Using NHANES data, others have reported that frequent binge drinking (once or more per week) (mean age 42 years) was associated with an increased adjusted odds ratio for developing metabolic syndrome. 34 However, impaired (or increased) fasting glucose was not one of the metabolic abnormalities associated with the increased odds for metabolic syndrome. 34 Similar to our findings and after controlling for body mass index and smoking, Nygren and colleagues found that higher alcohol consumption together with binge drinking was associated with the highest fasting plasma glucose levels in women but not in men. 35 These data are from the Northern Swedish prospective longitudnial (27 years) cohort study, which enrolled subjects at 16 years of age and included follow‐up to 43 years of age. 35

### The effect of evening alcohol consumption on next-morning glucose control in type 1 diabetes [^113PSmxW]. Diabetes Care (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Alcohol is associated with acute hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes. After drinking alcohol in the evening, delayed hypoglycemia has also been described, although its cause is unknown. We performed a controlled study to investigate this phenomenon.

Research Design and Methods

We admitted six men with type 1 diabetes (aged 19–51 years, HbA(1c) 7.0–10.3%) on two occasions, from 5:00 P.M. to 12:00 noon the following day. They received regular insulin injections before standardized meals, at 6:00 P.M. and 8:00 A.M., and a basal insulin infusion (0.15 mU x kg(-1) x min(-1)) from 11:00 P.M. They drank either dry white wine (0.75 g/kg alcohol) or mineral water at 9:00 P.M. over 90 min. Blood glucose, alcohol, insulin, cortisol, growth hormone, and glucagon levels were measured.

Results

Blood ethanol reached a mean (SEM) peak of 19.1 (1.2) mmol/l and was undetectable by 8:00 A.M. There were no significant differences in evening or overnight blood glucose levels between the studies. In the morning, fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels were significantly lower after consumption of wine (postprandial peak 8.9 [1.7] vs. 15 [1.5] mmol/l, P < 0.01), and from 10:00 A.M., five subjects required treatment for hypoglycemia (nadir 1.9–2.9 mmol/l). None of the subjects had hypoglycemia after consumption of water. After consumption of wine, growth hormone secretion was significantly reduced between midnight and 4:00 A.M. (area under the curve 2.1 [1.1] vs. 6.5 [2.1] microg. l(-1) x h(-1), P = 0.04). There were no differences in insulin or other hormone levels.

Conclusions

In type 1 diabetes, moderate consumption of alcohol in the evening may predispose patients to hypoglycemia after breakfast the next morning. This is associated with reduced nocturnal growth hormone secretion. Patients should be informed of this risk and advised regarding appropriate preventative measures.

### Effect of meal composition and alcohol consumption on postprandial glucose concentration in subjects with type 1 diabetes: a randomized crossover trial [^113jKrGh]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Meal composition is known to affect glycemic variability and glucose control in type 1 diabetes. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of high carbohydrate meals of different nutritional composition and alcohol on the postprandial glucose response in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

Twelve participants were recruited to this randomized crossover trial. Following a 4-week run-in period, participants received a mixed meal on three occasions with the same carbohydrate content but different macronutrient composition: high protein-high fat with alcohol (0.7g/kg body weight, beer), high protein-high fat without alcohol, and low protein-low fat without alcohol at 2-week intervals. Plasma and interstitial glucose, insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol, alcohol, free fatty acids, lactate, and pH concentrations were measured during 6hours. A statistical analysis was then carried out to determine significant differences between studies.

Results

Significantly higher late postprandial glucose was observed in studies with higher content of fats and proteins (p = 0.0088). This was associated with lower time in hypoglycemia as compared with the low protein and fat study (p = 0.0179), at least partially due to greater glucagon concentration in the same period (p = 0.04). Alcohol significantly increased lactate, decreased pH and growth hormone, and maintained free fatty acids suppressed during the late postprandial phase (p < 0.001), without significant changes in plasma glucose.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that the addition of proteins and fats to carbohydrates increases late postprandial blood glucose. Moreover, alcohol consumption together with a mixed meal has relevant metabolic effects without any increase in the risk of hypoglycemia, at least 6hours postprandially.

### Long-term alcohol consumption and incident health risk conditions related to cardiometabolic risk markers: a 20-year prospective cohort study [^115HMY1m]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

In men, medium or heavy alcohol consumption was positively associated with developing hyperglycemia and high blood pressure, but light alcohol consumption was not. In women, positive associations between light alcohol intake (2 < −16 g/day of alcohol) and hyperglycemia and high blood pressure were observed, but not with medium‐to‐heavy alcohol intake, possibly because of the limited sample size. Nevertheless, significant linear trends between alcohol intake and hyperglycemia and high blood pressure were observed in women. The lower threshold dose of alcohol for developing hyperglycemia and high blood pressure in women is likely because of their lower proportion of body water compared to men of similar body weight, as well as men generally having higher alcohol dehydrogenase activity. Our findings for men align with the low‐risk drinking thresholds (≤ 16 g/day of alcohol for adults) suggested by the UK alcohol intake guideline, but those for women did not. Additionally, our findings were inconsistent with the 2020 to 2025 United States (US) dietary guidelines, which define moderate drinking as < 28 g/day of alcohol for men and < 14 g/day for women. The discrepancy between our findings and these guidelines may be attributed to the low prevalence of wine drinkers or the lower capacity for alcohol metabolism in Northeast Asians. However, a cohort study conducted in Spain indicated that individuals consuming seven or more drinks per week (~10 g/day or more of alcohol) had an 80% higher risk of developing MetS compared to non‐drinkers. The study also reported a positive association between wine consumption and hyperglycemia. A recent review of clinical trials on wine intake and metabolic effects indicated that long‐term wine consumption significantly increased HDL‐C levels in healthy individuals. However, the effects of long‐term wine intake on triglycerides, LDL, insulin and markers of inflammation and endothelial function remain unclear. Taken together, the limits for drinking in moderation may require further careful consideration, accounting for potential biological differences by sex.

### Alcohol consumption is inversely associated with adherence to diabetes self-care behaviours [^113SECwW]. Diabetic Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

Our aim was to examine the associations of alcohol consumption with six diabetes self-care behaviours.

Methods

We determined levels of alcohol consumption and examined associations between alcohol consumption and six self-care behaviours in 65 996 adults with diabetes who received care through Kaiser Permanente Northern California and who responded to a 1994–1997 survey. Adherence with recommendations for self monitoring of blood glucose, HbA1c testing, and diabetes medications were determined from electronic records; smoking and use of diet and exercise to treat diabetes were self reported. Multiple logistic regression models were used to determine the associations between alcohol consumption (average number of drinks/day in the past year) and the probability of adherence to each self-care behaviour.

Results

Current alcohol consumption was reported by 50.8% of adults with diabetes. In adjusted models, we observed a gradient of increasing risk for poor adherence to diabetes self-care behaviours with increasing alcohol consumption, starting with those who consume even one drink a day. Former drinkers had the greatest compliance with each self-care behaviour, except for current smoking.

Conclusions

Alcohol consumption is a marker for poorer adherence to diabetes self-care behaviours. These findings highlight the importance of routine assessment of alcohol intake in people with diabetes, particularly as half of adults with diabetes consume alcohol. Given extant evidence that moderate alcohol intake may have cardiovascular benefits for patients with diabetes, examination of the trade-offs between cardiovascular benefits vs. potential risk of lower adherence with self-care behaviours deserves study.

### Association between soft drink consumption and mortality in 10 European countries [^116aTuva]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

We found nonlinear J-shaped associations for soft drink consumption and all-cause mortality, with higher risks observed at consumption levels of more than 125 mL per day (half a glass) of artificially sweetened soft drinks and more than 225 mL per day (approximately 1 glass) of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, and the lowest risks found from drinking 50 mL per day. The reduced risk found at low consumption levels may be the result of reverse causality (analogous to what has been observed for alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality,), driven by participants with disease symptoms reporting nonconsumption of soft drinks.

The role of BMI in the soft drink consumption and mortality outcomes association is complex, with adiposity likely a mediating and confounding factor that varies by cause of death. In our analyses, results were unchanged between the multivariable models with or without BMI adjustment, suggesting that the observed associations may be independent of adiposity. In support of this hypothesis, positive associations were found between total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft drinks with deaths from all causes, circulatory diseases, and digestive diseases among participants with healthy weight. These results may suggest that soft drinks alter mortality risk independently of adiposity, possibly because of the high glycemic index of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, which elevates blood glucose levels and may in turn lead to insulin resistance and inflammation.

### The effect of alcohol intake on insulin sensitivity in men: a randomized controlled trial [^111zRjSo]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Population data suggest that alcohol consumption may influence the risk of diabetes in a biphasic manner, but this has not been tested by any controlled interventions. The object of this study was to determine whether reducing alcohol intake in moderate-to-heavy drinkers (40–110 g/day) results in improvement in insulin sensitivity.

Research Design and Methods

A 4-week run-in period where subjects maintained their usual drinking pattern was followed by randomization to a two-way cross-over intervention study. In each of two 4-week treatment interventions, subjects either substituted their usual alcohol intake with a 0.9% alcohol beer or maintained their usual alcohol intake. At the end of each 4-week period, insulin sensitivity as determined by the low-dose insulin glucose infusion test and the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) score, and biomarkers of alcohol consumption (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [gamma-GT] and HDL cholesterol) were measured.

Results

A total of 16 healthy men aged 51.0 ± 2.7 (mean ± SEM) years with a BMI of 26.4 ± 0.61 kg/m(2) completed the study. There was a large reduction in alcohol intake (72.4 ± 5.0 vs. 7.9 ± 1.6 g/day, P < 0.001) and significant reductions in gamma-GT (geometric mean 24.4 units/l [95% CI 19.7–30.2] vs. 18.6 units/l [15.5–22.2], P < 0.01) and HDL cholesterol (1.36 ± 0.07 vs. 1.13 ± 0.07 mmol/l, P < 0.001). There was no effect of alcohol on insulin sensitivity index (ISI), fasting insulin, glucose, or HOMA score.

Conclusions

A substantial reduction in alcohol intake from 7.2 to 0.8 standard drinks per day in healthy men did not change insulin sensitivity as measured by ISI or HOMA score.

Other nutrition recommendations

Sugar alcohols and nonnutritive sweeteners are safe when consumed within the acceptable daily intake levels established by the Food and Drug Administration. (A)
If adults with diabetes choose to use alcohol, daily intake should be limited to a moderate amount (one drink per day or less for adult women and two drinks per day or less for adult men). (E)
Routine supplementation with antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C and carotene, is not advised because of lack of evidence of efficacy and concern related to long-term safety. (A)
Benefit from chromium supplementation in people with diabetes or obesity has not been conclusively demonstrated and, therefore, cannot be recommended. (E)

### Metformin hydrochloride tablet (metformin hydrochloride) [^111E4Hd4]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

- have liver problems.

- have congestive heart failure that requires treatment with medicines.

- drink a lot of alcohol (very often or short-term "binge" drinking).

- get dehydrated (lose a large amount of body fluids). This can happen if you are sick with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. Dehydration can also happen when you sweat a lot with activity or exercise and do not drink enough fluids.

- have certain x-ray tests with injectable dyes or contrast agents.

- have surgery.

- have a heart attack, severe infection, or stroke.

- are 80 years of age or older and have not had your kidney function tested.

What are metformin hydrochloride tablets?

- Metformin hydrochloride tablets are prescription medicines that contain metformin hydrochloride. Metformin hydrochloride tablets are used with diet and exercise to help control high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) in adults with type 2 diabetes.

- Metformin hydrochloride tablets are not for people with type 1 diabetes.

- Metformin hydrochloride tablets are not for people with diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in your blood or urine).

Metformin hydrochloride tablets help control your blood sugar in a number of ways. These include helping your body respond better to the insulin it makes naturally, decreasing the amount of sugar your liver makes, and decreasing the amount of sugar your intestines absorb. Metformin hydrochloride tablets do not cause your body to make more insulin.

### Alcohol consumption promotes insulin sensitivity without affecting body fat levels [^112ATmzF]. International Journal of Obesity (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Alcohol consumption promotes insulin sensitivity. In obesity, a decrease in body fat levels decreases the risk of developing insulin resistance; therefore, it is possible that alcohol improves insulin sensitivity by negatively affecting body fat. The aim of this study was to determine whether alcohol consumption promotes insulin sensitivity by reducing body fat levels in C57BL/6 male mice.

Methods

We examined the effects of alcohol consumption on insulin sensitivity in male mice with three different body weight (BW) phenotypes. The BWs were induced by feeding the mice a 30% calorie-restricted (CR) regimen, a low-fat (LF) diet and a high-fat (HF) diet. The mice had free access to water or 20% ethanol in the drinking water. To determine the effects of the three different BW phenotypes and of alcohol on glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity, we performed the insulin tolerance test (ITT) and glucose tolerance test (GTT) on the mice. The effects of the diets and alcohol on body composition, percent body fat (% BF), percent lean mass and bone mineral density (BMD) were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).

Results

Data show that mice with the highest body fat levels (HF) were insulin resistant and glucose intolerant. In contrast, mice with the lowest body fat levels (CR) were the most insulin sensitive and cleared the injected endogenous glucose the fastest. Results show that alcohol did not affect GTT in any of the BW phenotypes. However, alcohol consumption promoted insulin sensitivity in mice consuming both the LF and HF diets. Alcohol consumption increased insulin sensitivity without affecting body fat levels, as body fat levels were similar in mice consuming the LF or HF diets and drinking either water or alcohol.

Conclusions

Alcohol consumption promotes insulin sensitivity without affecting body fat levels in mice consuming LF and HF diets.

### An ongoing struggle: a mixed-method systematic review of interventions, barriers and facilitators to achieving optimal self-care by children and young people with type 1 diabetes in educational settings [^113igJ1p]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The majority of students reported that they drank alcohol whilst at university. Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can interfere with metabolic control and can induce hypoglycaemia and in the longer term it can worsen or increase the risk of diabetes complications.

Students reported using several strategies when drinking alcohol which were in keeping with current guidelines for young people and general advice for students. These included the following: eating before and/or during drinking; keeping track of how many drinks you were having; determining, in advance, not to exceed a set number of drinks; avoiding drinking games; having a friend let you know when you have had enough; alternating non-alcoholic with alcoholic beverages; pacing drinks to 1 or fewer per hour; choosing not to drink alcohol; drinking an alcohol look-alike (non-alcoholic beer, punch etc.); avoiding or diffusing peer pressure; limiting the frequency of going out to parties and bars; drinking with trusted friends who understood the symptoms of low blood sugar that would mimic intoxication, and checking or monitoring blood glucose levels. Students reported that they usually tested their blood glucose at home, or in more private spaces, before and after going out, rather than while they were out.

Students felt that they did not receive adequate support from their college or university that would enable them to balance the demands of further education and management of their T1D. An example was being allowed to manage their glycemic control during examinations.

Although some students preferred to continue to receive care from their diabetes team in their home town others felt unsupported by their T1D team. For example they reported that care had to stop with their old diabetes team now that they were at university and they experienced difficulties assessing a new local diabetes team, whilst others felt that they had not received enough information particularly in relation to managing their diabetes and drinking alcohol.

### Patterns of alcohol consumption and the metabolic syndrome [^112LGMCy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context and Objective

Protective and detrimental associations have been reported between alcohol consumption and the metabolic syndrome. This may be due to variations in drinking patterns and different alcohol effects on the metabolic syndrome components. This study is designed to examine the relationship between alcohol consumption patterns and the metabolic syndrome.

Design, Setting, Participants, and Measures

The 1999–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a population-based survey of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults. Current drinkers aged 20–84 yr without cardiovascular disease who had complete data on the metabolic syndrome and drinking patterns were included in the analysis (n = 1529). The metabolic abnormalities comprising the metabolic syndrome included having three of the following: impaired fasting glucose/diabetes mellitus, high triglycerides, abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, and low high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol. Measures of alcohol consumption included usual quantity consumed, drinking frequency, and frequency of binge drinking.

Results

In multinomial logistic regression models controlling for demographics, family history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and lifestyle factors, increased risk of the metabolic syndrome was associated with daily consumption that exceeded U.S. dietary guideline recommendations (more than one drink per drinking day for women and more than two drinks per drinking day for men (odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.22–2.11) and binge drinking once per week or more [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.51 (1.01–2.29]. By individual metabolic abnormality, drinking in excess of the dietary guidelines was associated with an increased risk of impaired fasting glucose/diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia, abdominal obesity, and high blood pressure.

Conclusion

Public health messages should emphasize the potential cardiometabolic risk associated with drinking in excess of national guidelines and binge drinking.

### Alcohol consumption, mediating biomarkers, and risk of type 2 diabetes among middle-aged women [^111ozSr8]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

It is difficult to assess whether the attenuation of the alcohol-diabetes relationship by BMI reflects confounding by BMI or whether alcohol truly acts by minimizing weight gain in women. A recent study among 49,324 women showed that moderate alcohol consumption was prospectively associated with a decreased 8-year weight gain, whereas heavier drinkers had an increased risk for weight gain. Other studies among women have confirmed these results, whereas no or even a positive association with body weight is reported for men. To date, few prospective randomized interventions examined the effect of moderate alcohol consumption on body weight, but these have not been long enough to exclude such an effect conclusively.

The mechanisms underlying the protective effect of light to moderate alcohol consumption are complex and not completely understood. Our results suggest that other mechanisms apart from adiponectin explain the association between alcohol consumption and type 2 diabetes. Lipotoxicity, excess release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, is thought to be an important cause of insulin resistance. In the liver, free fatty acids increase glucose production, triglycerides, and secretion of VLDL. Associated lipoprotein abnormalities include reductions in HDL and increased LDL. Alcohol consumption strongly affects lipid metabolism and could thereby possibly also influence insulin resistance and risk of type 2 diabetes. Another possibility is that the effects of moderate drinking are not related to ethanol itself but to acetate, the end product of ethanol oxidation. Acetate may affect fat oxidation and decrease lipolysis and free fatty acids and indirectly improve insulin sensitivity.

The strengths of this study include its prospective design; detailed assessment of alcohol consumption, diet, and lifestyle; and inclusion of a variety of markers previously related to risk of diabetes. Nonetheless, certain limitations need to be addressed. Because insulin was only assessed for those with fasting blood samples, we used slightly different subgroups for each group of biomarkers, which may have introduced some selection bias. However, within each subgroup, moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a similar decreased risk of diabetes as in the entire case-control study. In addition, we could only include women providing blood samples in this study, which could also be subject to selection. In comparing those women with women not providing blood samples, they had higher prevalences of obesity and family history of diabetes, which could lead to increased diabetes risk in this sample. However, because we only included incident cases of diabetes, selection of these women is not related to the occurrence of disease and therefore does not lead to selection bias. It could limit generalizability of our results to women with a slightly lower diabetes risk.

### Alcohol as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114zDKJs]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

We found significant heterogeneity among men and women, which was expected because of the different methods used in the individual studies. Most studies were conducted in Western countries with the exception of three studies of Japanese and Korean populations; however, this was not a significant source of heterogeneity for men or women (analyses not shown). Study type cannot be a source of heterogeneity because only cohort studies were included, though the variable follow-up time may have contributed. The finding of heterogeneity indicates that there are additional factors such as pattern of consumption that should be considered in future research.

Our findings confirm previous research, both individual studies and summary estimates, of the U-shaped relationship between average alcohol consumption and risk of diabetes in both men and women. Although the biological mechanism responsible for this relationship is still a matter of research, several possibilities exist including increased insulin sensitivity with low levels of alcohol consumption. These factors, together, add weight to the argument for a causal role of alcohol consumption in diabetes. Alcohol consumption in men and women should thus be limited to moderate amounts, and heavy consumption should be discouraged. Moreover, the balance of risk of alcohol consumption on other diseases and health outcomes, even at moderate levels of consumption, may outweigh the positive benefits with regard to diabetes.

Other nutrition recommendations

Sugar alcohols and nonnutritive sweeteners are safe when consumed within the acceptable daily intake levels established by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). (A)
If adults with diabetes choose to use alcohol, daily intake should be limited to a moderate amount (one drink per day or less for adult women and two drinks per day or less for adult men). (E)
Routine supplementation with antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C and carotene, is not advised because of lack of evidence of efficacy and concern related to long-term safety. (A)
Benefit from chromium supplementation in people with diabetes or obesity has not been conclusively demonstrated and, therefore, cannot be recommended. (E)

MNT is an integral component of diabetes prevention, management, and self-management education. In addition to its role in preventing and controlling diabetes, ADA recognizes the importance of nutrition as an essential component of an overall healthy lifestyle. A full review of the evidence regarding nutrition in preventing and controlling diabetes and its complications and additional nutrition-related recommendations can be found in the ADA position statement "Nutrition Recommendations and Interventions for Diabetes", published in 2007 and updated for 2008. Achieving nutrition-related goals requires a coordinated team effort that includes the active involvement of the person with pre-diabetes or diabetes. Because of the complexity of nutrition issues, it is recommended that a registered dietitian who is knowledgeable and skilled in implementing nutrition therapy into diabetes management and education be the team member who provides MNT.

### American cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention [^116i6pJf]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Clinical strategies to promote healthy eating and active living and limiting alcohol — In primary care, it is recommended that clinicians offer or refer adults with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions, which evidence suggests can lead to clinically significant improvements in weight status and reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes among adults with obesity and elevated plasma glucose levels; recommendations regarding reducing alcohol consumption include alcohol screening and behavioral counseling interventions in primary care settings to identify those individuals, including pregnant women, at higher risk of alcohol-related harms. Incorporation of questions about exercise as a vital sign — asked during routine visits just as blood pressure and weight are measured — has been associated with modest weight loss and lower hemoglobin A1c levels; screening for food insecurity and inclusion of questions related to food choices as a vital sign during routine clinical encounters may also promote healthful eating behaviors; health care providers can be a valuable referral source to community efforts such as food assistance programs, food banks, voucher programs to retail stores and farmers markets, and doctor-led walking groups to promote walking as a health-enhancing behavior among patients.

### The effects of alcohol on ambulatory blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes: a randomized intervention [^114LYmPJ]. Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Although prospective studies suggest light-to-moderate chronic alcohol intake protects against coronary artery disease in type 2 diabetic patients, the balance of effects on individual cardiovascular risk factors needs further assessment. We examined the effects of alcohol consumption on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, homocysteine, and glycaemic control in well controlled type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Twenty-four participants aged 49–66 year were randomized to a three-period crossover study with women drinking red wine 230 ml/day (∼24 g alcohol/day) and men drinking red wine 300 ml/day (∼31 g alcohol/day), or equivalent volumes of dealcoholized red wine (DRW) or water, each for 4 weeks. Ambulatory BP and HR were monitored every 30 min for 24 h at the end of each period. Home blood glucose monitoring was carried out twice weekly throughout.

Results

Red wine increased awake SBP and DBP relative to water by 2.5 ± 1.2/1.9 ± 0.7 mmHg (P = 0.033, P = 0.008, respectively), with a similar nonsignificant trend relative to DRW. Asleep DBP fell with red wine relative to DRW (2.0 ± 0.8 mmHg, P = 0.016) with a similar nonsignificant trend relative to water. Red wine increased 24-h, awake and asleep HR relative to water and DRW. Relative to DRW, red wine did not affect glycaemic control or any other cardiovascular risk factor.

Conclusion

In well controlled type 2 diabetic individuals 24–31 g alcohol/day (∼2–3 standard drinks) raises awake BP and 24-h HR and lowers asleep BP but does not otherwise favourably or adversely modify cardiovascular risk factors.

### How many alcoholic drinks might benefit an older person with hypertension? [^114GcysX]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Lowering alcohol intake reduces blood pressure and hence cardiovascular risk. However, abstainers have an increase in cardiovascular risk and the advice to reduce intake to low levels may not be sound. This review examines the effects of lowering alcohol consumption in terms of blood pressure and coronary heart disease (CHD). The relationship between both CHD and stroke and alcohol consumption, and the benefits and disadvantages of alcohol consumption in the general population, are discussed. Where available, the results of large meta-analyses are reported. It is concluded that the hypertensive patient over the age of 60 who drinks over 16 drinks per week should be advised to reduce his or her alcohol intake but a daily drink may be advisable and the patient should not stop drinking entirely. It is not suggested that the non-drinker should start drinking, but most hypertensives are over the age of 60 when community studies suggest that drinking alcohol does more good than harm.

### Knowledge, safety, and impact of alcohol consumption in young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a qualitative study [^114mymJa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Inconvenience of maintaining healthy glycaemic control whilst drinking socially

Every participant reported that good glycaemic management could be a burden whilst drinking socially. This often arose due to the perceived inconvenience of typical glucose management. Twelve participants reported self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) by capillary blood glucose testing, of which eight reported a reduced frequency of monitoring whilst drinking. There were various reasons for this, most notably inconvenience, privacy, and redundancy (quote 6). Several of the participants also described the burden of carrying a blood test kit due to the risk of it being stolen or damaged. Reducing the frequency of monitoring was reported to increase the likelihood of hyperglycaemia. The impact of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and technology on this is discussed in a following section.

The burden of insulin management also regularly arose as another inconvenience to glycaemic management. Whilst drinking, several individuals within this study reported attempting to correct their blood glucose levels whilst being intoxicated. Four of these individuals reported over-correcting with insulin resulting in hypoglycaemia (quote 7). Some individuals would entirely avoid giving insulin due to the perceived hassle of having to manage hypoglycaemia whilst in social spaces (quote 8). Two participants also reported occasionally prioritising appearance over their management by removing their insulin pump to facilitate wearing certain outfits whilst drinking (quote 9).

The difficulty of diabetes management whilst drinking led to all the participants reporting a negative experience at some time. These negative experiences were heterogenous but oftentimes involved episodes of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia as per the pattern described earlier, the experiences of losing the ability to manage their own safety, or a combination of the above. When these experiences occurred, they predominantly did not result in reported harm – defined as requiring external assistance to manage their glucose levels. However, five participants reported that their drinking has resulted in hospitalisation at some stage; two of which required an ambulance. Further, two individuals reported that they have required an intramuscular glucagon injection due to severe hypoglycaemia associated with alcohol consumption (see illustrative case below). There were no reports of other serious physical injury or diabetic ketoacidosis occurring due to alcohol consumption within this sample.

### Effect of alcohol ingestion on plasma glucose kinetics after roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery [^115CJuEm]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) increases the rate of alcohol absorption so that peak blood alcohol concentration is 2-fold higher after surgery compared with concentrations reached after consuming the same amount presurgery. Because high doses of alcohol can lead to hypoglycemia, patients may be at increased risk of developing hypoglycemia after alcohol ingestion.

Objectives

We conducted 2 studies to test the hypothesis that the consumption of approximately 2 standard drinks of alcohol would decrease glycemia more after RYGB than before surgery.

Setting

Single-center prospective randomized trial.

Methods

We evaluated plasma glucose concentrations and glucose kinetics (assessed by infusing a stable isotopically labelled glucose tracer) after ingestion of a nonalcoholic drink (placebo) or an alcoholic drink in the following groups: (1) 5 women before RYGB (body mass index = 43 ± 5 kg/m 2) and 10 ± 2 months after RYGB (body mass index = 31 ± 7 kg/m 2; study 1), and (2) 8 women who had undergone RYGB surgery 2.2 ± 1.2 years earlier (body mass index = 30 ± 5 kg/m 2; study 2) RESULTS: Compared with the placebo drink, alcohol ingestion decreased plasma glucose both before and after surgery, but the reduction was greater before (glucose nadir placebo = -.4 ± 1.0 mg/dL versus alcohol = -9.6 ± 1.5 mg/dL) than after (glucose nadir placebo = -1.0 ± 1.6 mg/dL versus alcohol = -5.5 ± 2.6 mg/dL; P < .001) surgery. This difference was primarily due to an alcohol-induced early increase followed by a subsequent decrease in the rate of glucose appearance into systemic circulation.

Conclusion

RYGB does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia after consumption of a moderate dose of alcohol.

### National, regional, and global statistics on alcohol consumption and associated burden of disease 2000–20: a modelling study and comparative risk assessment [^113w1S3H]. The Lancet: Public Health (2025). High credibility.

The RR estimates used in this study were selected by the WHO Technical Advisory Group on the basis of majority consensus. This approach might bias the selection of the RRs. To reduce the random error introduced by expert decisions, ideally, a Delphi study or other systematic methods to deal with decision making under uncertainty can assist in making important judgements. The RR estimates used were obtained from studies that used lifetime abstention or abstainers as the reference category. People choose to be lifetime abstainers from alcohol consumption for various potentially confounding reasons, including religion and health. The use of abstainers as the reference category is also problematic as abstainers often include people who are so-called sick quitters, ie, people who have stopped drinking for health reasons. Therefore, this use of reference category might lead to an underestimation of the risk of disease among drinkers.

The WHO's Global Health Estimates combine data for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes accounts for the majority of diabetes cases globally. The present study modelled the effect of alcohol use on diabetes by applying an RR function for type 2 diabetes to an aggregated category, which includes both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Although alcohol consumption is a known causal risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes, less is known about its effects on type 1 diabetes. Alcohol can affect glucose metabolism and could have adverse effects in individuals with type 1 diabetes, however, it remains unclear whether its effect on type 1 diabetes mirrors that observed for type 2 diabetes. As such, the estimated health effect of alcohol on diabetes in this study might represent an overestimate.

The presented estimates are not separated by race or ethnicity. This limits the results of our study as people with the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2*2 allele (prevalent in East Asian populations) have a higher risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancers. Furthermore, racialised minorities in some countries are disproportionately affected by alcohol use compared with people from other ethnicities.

### Role of diet in type 2 diabetes incidence: umbrella review of meta-analyses of prospective observational studies [^111yL3cr]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

We found high quality evidence for an inverse association between moderate alcohol consumption and incidence of type 2 diabetes. Results from observational studies suggested that light or moderate alcohol consumption increases insulin sensitivity. However, a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing moderate alcohol consumption (including wine, beer, and spirits) with no alcohol consumption only confirmed this result for women. No effect on insulin sensitivity was found for men. Nevertheless, moderate alcohol intake decreased fasting insulin concentrations and glycated haemoglobin. The sex specific effect was also confirmed by the meta-analysis by Li and colleagues. which showed a stronger inverse association with incidence of type 2 diabetes for women than for men, although both associations were statistically significant. Results from a randomised controlled trial comparing the effect of red wine, dealcoholised red wine, and gin on glucose homeostasis suggested that the non-alcoholic fraction of red wine (mainly the polyphenols) contributes to possible beneficial effects of red wine on plasma insulin and the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance. This possible effect is supported by our findings that especially wine was inversely associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes. However, alcohol causes adverse health effects such as liver cirrhosis, which increases incidence of type 2 diabetes. Given the U shaped association of total alcohol and alcoholic beverages with incidence of the disease, the risk for alcohol abuse, and other adverse health effects of alcohol (eg, increased risk for certain types of cancer), translation of these results into recommendations have to be considered carefully.

### Knowledge, safety, and impact of alcohol consumption in young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a qualitative study [^117UE3dc]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

A review of alcohol and recreational drug use in young adults with type 1 diabetes found that the rates of alcohol consumption are generally comparable to other young adults; however, the harms of consumption were significantly greater as observed by inordinate acute hospital admissions induced by alcohol. This is because alcoholic drinks contain varying amounts of carbohydrates and ethanol, which may alter glucose metabolism and increase the risk of hypoglycaemia through multiple mechanisms. For example, a study found that alcohol consumption in people with type 1 diabetes resulted in greater impaired hypoglycaemia awareness, which can predispose those who consume alcohol to delayed intervention and an increased risk of fatal outcomes.

Currently, recommendations from the American Diabetes Association include a maximum alcohol suggestion of moderate consumption levels defined as one standard drink (14 g of ethanol) per day for women, and 2 standard drinks per day for men, along with ensuring carbohydrate and calorie content are known. This level of consumption is the same as general public health messaging despite the additional safety risk that alcohol consumption by people with type 1 diabetes confers. Further suggestions from the New Zealand Ministry of Health recommends no more than 4 standard drinks on a single occasion for women, and no more than 5 for men. Despite these guidelines, data from the New Zealand Health Survey has found that 31% of those aged between 18 and 24 are classified as hazardous drinkers. It is currently not known what knowledge young adults with type 1 diabetes have of these guidelines or the impact of alcohol on their diabetes control. Therefore, in this qualitative study we aimed to explore the lived experiences of young adults with type 1 diabetes regarding alcohol and their diabetes management.

Glycaemic status. Individuals were considered to have diabetes if they had been previously diagnosed with diabetes or had a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level ≥ 6.5% and/or a fasting plasma glucose concentration ≥ 126 mg/dL. Individuals with prediabetes were defined as those with an HbA1c between 5.7% and 6.4% or a fasting plasma glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dL. The remainder were considered normoglycaemic. Individuals with diabetes (n = 183) were further classified according to diabetes type (178 [97.2%] participants had T2DM [among whom hyperglycaemia was considered to have been induced by glucocorticoids in 2 individuals] and 5 [2.7%] had type 1 diabetes), glucose‐lowering treatment (157 participants [85.7%] were receiving any glucose‐lowering agent, of which 32 [17.4%] were on insulin therapy), glycaemic control (91 [50.0%] participants showed an HbA1c < 7.0% [data available for 182 participants]), and disease duration (68 [37.3%] participants had a diabetes duration ≥ 10 years [data available for 182 participants]). To calculate the incidence of T2DM, individuals without diabetes were followed from the time of assessment for study recruitment (November 2012–March 2015) until the date of the last blood test available when the computerised medical records were consulted (July 2022–August 2022).

Insulin resistance. Insulin resistance was estimated using the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA‐IR), which is fasting serum glucose (mg/dL) × fasting serum insulin (μU/mL) ÷ 405.23. Analyses regarding HOMA‐IR were conducted exclusively in participants not receiving insulin therapy (n = 1484), as the administration of exogenous insulin can confound the interpretation of HOMA‐IR.

### Effect of meal composition and alcohol consumption on postprandial glucose concentration in subjects with type 1 diabetes: a randomized crossover trial [^116wwv8m]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

In our study, despite the lower carbohydrate content of the HPHF-A study (10.5 ± 1.9 g) due to the unavoidable slight mismatch with non-alcoholic beer, PPG was not lower than the HPHF-W condition. Additionally, none but one patient experienced hypoglycemia (that patient was overdosed, since he/she had hypoglycemia under all study conditions). Importantly, this occurred with similar plasma insulin, but lower free fatty acids and GH concentrations, as seen by others. Thus, the observed PPG differences are probably underestimated and support the predominance of alcohol-induced insulin resistanceand overinhibition of gluconeogenesis and lipolysis, at least in the 6 hours postprandial state. Additionally, a delayed alcohol effect promoting a greater incidence of nocturnal or next-morning hypoglycemia has been ruled out by CGM data (although data must be interpreted with caution due to uncontrolled conditions and the small sample size). This is in line with one study in adolescents, where alcohol consumption in the context of meals and sweetened mixers resulted in significantly less time spent in hypoglycemia than an alcohol-free evening.

Importantly, we have shown that alcohol consumption was followed by a significant decrease in pH level, likely due to the known increase of beta-hydroxybutyrate (not measured) and specular to the increase in lactate concentration (resulting from inhibition of its peripheral conversion into pyruvate). Although the difference may seem small in absolute terms, it should be remembered that pH is tightly regulated and that in some patients pH fell below 7.35 despite high plasma insulin and suppressed lipolysis. This may have clinically relevant implications, especially in the context of inadequate prandial insulin titration.

The strengths of our study include the measurement of glucose in plasma instead of capillary blood or interstitial fluid, which reduces bias and the expected greater variance from a less accurate method; the measurement of plasma insulin, which excludes observed differences in plasma glucose that are affected by variability in insulin absorption; and the virtually identical normoglycemic values across patients and studies achieved with standardization of the preprandial glucose by means of an insulin feedback. Another strong point is the assessment of hormonal and metabolic concentrations since this allows a deeper explanation of our findings. Besides, the crossover design minimizes the risk of confounding factors.

### Changes in alcohol consumption and subsequent risk of type 2 diabetes in men [^112LnkiC]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Four-year change in amount of alcohol intake and effect on markers of glycemia.

To test the robustness of our findings, we next examined the 4-year change in alcohol consumption from 1990–1994 on markers of glycemia collected in 1994, stratified by initial alcohol consumption in 1990 (Table 4). A similar interaction between change in alcohol and baseline alcohol intake as in the main analysis was observed for levels of total adiponectin and A1C among nondiabetic men. For example, a 7.5 g/day increment in alcohol intake, between 1990–1994, was associated with a 1.2 ± 0.3 μg/ml (mean ± SEM) higher total adiponectin level in 1994 among men who were nondrinkers at baseline, a 0.5 ± 0.3 μg/ml higher adiponectin level among < 1 glass/day drinkers, and a 0.6 ± 0.3 μg/ml lower level among ≥ 1 glass/day drinkers at baseline (P interaction = 0.002). For A1C, the inverse association between change in alcohol intake in 1990–1994 and A1C concentration was also strongest among nondrinkers compared with < 1 glass/day drinkers and ≥ 1 glass/day drinkers in 1990 (P interaction = 0.02).

### Nutrition therapy recommendations for the management of adults with diabetes [^115dukys]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

A systematic review evaluating the effects of cinnamon in people with diabetes concluded there is currently insufficient evidence to support its use, and there is a lack of compelling evidence for the use of other herbal products for the improvement of glycemic control in people with diabetes. It is important to consider that herbal products are not standardized and vary in the content of active ingredients and may have the potential to interact with other medications. Therefore, it is important that patients/clients with diabetes report the use of supplements and herbal products to their health care providers.

Alcohol

If adults with diabetes choose to drink alcohol, they should be advised to do so in moderation (one drink per day or less for adult women and two drinks per day or less for adult men). (E)
Alcohol consumption may place people with diabetes at increased risk for delayed hypoglycemia, especially if taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Education and awareness regarding the recognition and management of delayed hypoglycemia is warranted. (C)

Moderate alcohol consumption has minimal acute and/or long-term detrimental effects on blood glucose in people with diabetes, with some epidemiologic data showing improved glycemic control with moderate intake. Moderate alcohol intake may also convey cardiovascular risk reduction and mortality benefits in people with diabetes, with the type of alcohol consumed not influencing these beneficial effects. Accordingly, the recommendations for alcohol consumption for people with diabetes are the same as for the general population. Adults with diabetes choosing to consume alcohol should limit their intake to one serving or less per day for women and two servings or less per day for men. Excessive amounts of alcohol (≥ 3 drinks/day) consumed on a consistent basis may contribute to hyperglycemia. One alcohol-containing beverage is defined as 12 oz beer, 5 oz wine, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits, each containing approximately 15 g of alcohol. Abstention from alcohol should be advised, however, for people with a history of alcohol abuse or dependence, women during pregnancy, and people with medical conditions such as liver disease, pancreatitis, advanced neuropathy, or severe hypertriglyceridemia.

Despite the potential glycemic and cardiovascular benefits of moderate alcohol consumption, use may place people with diabetes at increased risk for delayed hypoglycemia. This is particularly true in those using insulin or insulin secretagogue therapies. Consuming alcohol with food can minimize the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia (,–). Individuals with diabetes should receive education regarding the recognition and management of delayed hypoglycemia and the potential need for more frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose after consuming alcoholic beverages.

### Alcohol-associated risks for young adults with type 1 diabetes: a narrative review [^113mM2MJ]. Diabetic Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Aim

To undertake a narrative review of the impact and pattern of alcohol consumption in young adults with Type 1 diabetes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, meeting abstracts of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the American Diabetes Association and Diabetes UK, Current Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, UK Clinical Research Network, scrutiny of bibliographies of retrieved papers and contact with experts in the field.

Inclusion Criteria

relevant studies of any design of alcohol consumption and young adults with Type 1 diabetes (age 14–25 years) were included. The key outcomes were the quantity, pattern and impact of alcohol consumption, the effect on diabetes control and the effect of interventions to minimize the risks of alcohol for this population.

Results

Six articles and two conference abstracts met the inclusion criteria. There were six cross-sectional studies, one qualitative study and one within-subjects design study. Quality of studies was variable. Alcohol use amongst young adults with Type 1 diabetes was reported to be common and potentially harmful. There was a paucity of evidence on interventions to minimize the risks of alcohol in this target group.

Conclusions

Research is required to understand the social context of alcohol consumption in this population with a view to developing appropriate interventions to minimize the risks associated with its use.

### Glycemic variability and its association with demographics and lifestyles in a general adult population [^112W2r6G]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

Classification of Alcohol Consumption and Smoking

Alcohol consumption was assessed using the standard drinking unit system, which sums the number of glasses of wine (~10g), bottles of beer (~10g), and units of spirits (~20g). Individuals with an habitual alcohol consumption of 1–140 g/week (n = 281, 48.4%) were considered light drinkers, and those with an alcohol consumption of > 140 g/week (n = 71, 12.2%) were considered heavy drinkers: the remainder (n = 229, 39.4%), made up of alcohol abstainers and very occasional alcohol drinkers, were pooled and included in the same group.

Tobacco smoking was recorded as the number of cigarettes regularly consumed per day. Consumers of at least 1 cigarette per day were considered smokers, as were individuals who had quit smoking during the preceding year. Subjects were classified according to smoking status into the following 3 groups: (1) nonsmokers (n = 309, 53.2%), (2) ex-smokers (n = 154, 26.5%), and (3) current smokers (n = 110, 20.3%).

Physical Activity Assessment

Subjects completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (short form), from which we calculated metabolic equivalent of task and hours per week engaged in vigorous and moderate activities and walking, as described by Craig et al. We then classified them according to the 3 levels of physical activity: (1) "inactive" (n = 209, 36.0%), (2) "minimally active" (n = 223, 38.4%), and (3) "HEPA active" (health-enhancing physical activity; a high active category, n = 149, 25.6%).

Laboratory Determinations

The HbA1c was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. All HbA1c values were converted to Diabetes Control and Complications Trial–aligned units. Glucose was determined in fasting serum samples by the glucose oxidase peroxidase method.

### Wine and health-new evidence [^1157fhxb]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Health benefits of moderate wine consumption have been studied during the past decades, first in observational studies and more recently, in experimental settings and randomized controlled studies. Suggested biological pathways include antioxidant, lipid regulating, and anti-inflammatory effects. Both the alcoholic and polyphenolic components of wine are believed to contribute to these beneficial effects. Although several of these studies demonstrated protective associations between moderate drinking and cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, certain types of cancer, type 2 diabetes, neurological disorders, and the metabolic syndrome, no conclusive recommendations exist regarding moderate wine consumption. Yet, it is suggested that the physician and patient should discuss alcohol use. In the CASCADE (CArdiovaSCulAr Diabetes & Ethanol) trial, 224 abstainers with type 2 diabetes were randomized to consume red wine, white wine or mineral water for two years. Here, we summarize our previous findings, offer new evidence concerning the differential effects of wine consumption among men and women, and further suggest that initiating moderate alcohol consumption among well-controlled persons with type 2 diabetes is apparently safe, in regard to changes in heart rate variability and carotid plaque formation.

### Relation of drinking alcohol to atherosclerotic risk in type 2 diabetes [^1117MAV7]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The effects of drinking alcohol on atherosclerotic risks were investigated in 194 type 2 diabetic patients to determine whether drinking alcohol influences risk of atherosclerosis in diabetic subjects.

Research Design and Methods

The subjects were divided by the degree of their average weekly alcohol consumption into three groups: nondrinkers, light drinkers (ethanol consumption < 210 g/week), and heavy drinkers (ethanol consumption ≥ 210 g/week). The degree of atherosclerotic progression was evaluated using aortic pulse wave velocity (a-PWV), and possible atherosclerotic risks were evaluated using known atherosclerotic risk factors.

Results

a-PWV was significantly lower in light drinkers than in nondrinkers and heavy drinkers, but there was no significant difference in a-PWV between nondrinkers and heavy drinkers. Systolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in heavy drinkers than in nondrinkers and light drinkers, whereas there was no significant difference in these levels between nondrinkers and light drinkers. The mean levels of BMI and blood HbA(1c), uric acid, and fibrinogen were not different between the three groups. There were significant positive correlations of a-PWV with age and systolic blood pressure and weak but significant negative correlations of a-PWV with alcohol consumption and HDL cholesterol level.

Conclusions

Light drinking, but not heavy drinking, has preventive effects on atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic subjects. The known beneficial effects of drinking alcohol on blood lipids and fibrinogen may not be involved in the preventive effect of light drinking on atherosclerosis in diabetic subjects.

### Influence of alcohol on cognitive performance during mild hypoglycaemia; implications for type 1 diabetes [^111WqSRQ]. Diabetic Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

Alcohol and hypoglycaemia independently affect cognitive function. This may be relevant for insulin-treated diabetic patients who drive motor vehicles. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of mild hypoglycaemia (2.8 mmol/l) with modest alcohol intoxication (levels below UK driving limits) on intellectual performance in patients with Type 1 diabetes.

Methods

A hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp (60 mU/m2) was used to study 17 subjects [age 35 ± 8 years, HbA1c 8.1 ± 1.4% (mean ± sd)] on four occasions: (A) euglycaemia (4.5 mmol/l) with placebo, (B) euglycaemia with alcohol, (C) hypoglycaemia (2.8 mmol/l) with placebo, and (D) hypoglycaemia with alcohol. Cognitive performance was assessed using four-choice reaction time (4CRT, primary outcome), measurements of general intellectual skills [trail making B (TMB) and digit symbol substitution (DSST)], and visual information processing [visual change detection (VCD)]. A test related to driving performance (hazard perception) was also used.

Results

In experiments B and D the average blood alcohol level was 43 mg/dl. This was associated with deterioration in 4CRT [+ 35 ms [95% confidence interval (CI) 20, 50]] and TMB, whereas hypoglycaemia without alcohol increased 4CRT only [+ 39 ms (95% CI 5, 73)]. However, when alcohol was combined with hypoglycaemia, there was marked deterioration in all the cognitive function tests [4CRT 74 ms (95% CI 35, 113), TMB, DSST and VCD]. Hazard perception was not affected. The effect of alcohol was no different in euglycaemia than in hypoglycaemia, i.e. there was no interaction. Whereas hypoglycaemia did not reduce the likelihood that the subjects would drive, alcohol did.

Conclusions

The cumulative effect of alcohol and hypoglycaemia on cognitive function together has implications for driving in patients with Type 1 diabetes. Both independently impair cognitive function and together the effects are additive. Patients with Type 1 diabetes should be educated about hypoglycaemia and driving and should avoid alcohol completely if planning to drive.

### Alcohol drinking, the metabolic syndrome and diabetes in a population with high mean alcohol consumption [^112wurTA]. Diabetic Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the relationship of alcohol consumption with the metabolic syndrome and diabetes in a population-based study with high mean alcohol consumption. Few data exist on these conditions in high-risk drinkers.

Methods

In 6172 adults aged 35–75 years, alcohol consumption was categorized as 0, 1–6, 7–13, 14–20, 21–27, 28–34 and ≥ 35 drinks/week or as non-drinkers (0), low-risk (1–13), medium-to-high-risk (14–34) and very-high-risk (≥ 35) drinkers. Alcohol consumption was objectively confirmed by biochemical tests. In multivariate analysis, we assessed the relationship of alcohol consumption with adjusted prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, diabetes and insulin resistance, determined with the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).

Results

Seventy-three per cent of participants consumed alcohol, 16% were medium-to-high-risk drinkers and 2% very-high-risk drinkers. In multivariate analysis, the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, diabetes and mean HOMA-IR decreased with low-risk drinking and increased with high-risk drinking. Adjusted prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 24% in non-drinkers, 19% in low-risk (P < 0.001 vs. non-drinkers), 20% in medium-to-high-risk and 29% in very-high-risk drinkers (P = 0.005 vs. low-risk). Adjusted prevalence of diabetes was 6.0% in non-drinkers, 3.6% in low-risk (P < 0.001 vs. non-drinkers), 3.8% in medium-to-high-risk and 6.7% in very-high-risk drinkers (P = 0.046 vs. low-risk). Adjusted HOMA-IR was 2.47 in non-drinkers, 2.14 in low-risk (P < 0.001 vs. non-drinkers), 2.27 in medium-to-high-risk and 2.53 in very-high-risk drinkers (P = 0.04 vs. low-risk). These relationships did not differ according to beverage types.

Conclusions

Alcohol has a U-shaped relationship with the metabolic syndrome, diabetes and HOMA-IR, without differences between beverage types.

### Influence of acute alcohol ingestion on the hormonal responses to modest hypoglycaemia in patients with type 1 diabetes [^1161cZUu]. Diabetic Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine whether mild alcohol intoxication (45–50 mg/dl) influences counterregulatory hormone responses to moderate hypoglycaemia (2.8 mmol/l)in patients with Type 1 diabetes.

Methods

Seventeen subjects (14 male, age range 21–46 years) with Type 1 diabetes underwent four hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamps: euglycaemia with placebo; euglycaemia with alcohol (0.4 g/kg); hypoglycaemia (2.8 mmol/l for 65 min)with placebo; and hypoglycaemia (2.8 mmol/l for 65 min) with alcohol (0.4 g/kg). Arterialized venous blood samples were taken for measurement of insulin and counterregulatory hormones.

Results

During hypoglycaemia, peak growth hormone concentrations were significantly lower after alcohol compared with placebo (14.3 ± 2.9 vs.25.9 ± 3.4 microg/l, P < 0.001) associated with reduced insulin sensitivity in both hypoglycaemia and euglycaemia studies.

Conclusions

We found an attenuated growth hormone response to hypoglycaemia associated with mild alcohol intoxication. Although this may potentially contribute to impaired recovery of glucose after hypoglycaemia in patients with Type 1 diabetes, it appears to be offset by a reduction in insulin action.

### Knowledge, safety, and impact of alcohol consumption in young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a qualitative study [^114m3fFF]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To explore the lived experiences of alcohol consumption among young adults with type 1 diabetes.

Methods

Fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted amongst young adults aged between 18 and 25 years, inclusive, with type 1 diabetes and experience consuming alcohol. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed to identify common themes regarding their experiences.

Results

The interviews confirmed that young adults with type 1 diabetes engage in social, and occasionally excessive, drinking behaviour. Furthermore, the interviews revealed four key themes: (i) Several sources contribute to a widely inconsistent understanding of the impact and management of alcohol consumption; (ii) Perceived inconvenience of maintaining healthy glycaemic control whilst drinking socially; (iii) Engagement in proactive strategies for harm reduction occurred when convenient; and (iv) Impact of modern diabetes technology in overcoming previous burdens and promoting glycaemic safety.

Conclusion

Young adults with type 1 diabetes continue to need anticipatory education surrounding safe alcohol consumption and behaviours, as well as ongoing support and encouragement to ensure engagement with traditional self-management tasks. Significant alcohol-diabetes related safety issues, particularly hypoglycaemia do occur, and were captured within this small sample and study. Diabetes technology has an important complementary role along with education and tailored support strategies to support health and safe glucose control during alcohol consumption.

### The relationship between alcohol consumption and glycemic control among patients with diabetes: the kaiser permanente Northern California diabetes registry [^112TPcUZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol consumption is a common behavior. Little is known about the relationship between alcohol consumption and glycemic control among people with diabetes.

Objective

To evaluate the association between alcohol consumption and glycemic control.

Design

Survey follow-up study, 1994–1997, among Kaiser Permanente Northern California members.

Patients

38,564 adult diabetes patients.

Measurements

Self-reported alcohol consumption, and hemoglobin A1C (A1C), assessed within 1 year of survey date. Linear regression of A1C by alcohol consumption was performed, adjusted for sociodemographic variables, clinical variables, and diabetes disease severity. Least squares means estimates were derived.

Results

In multivariate-adjusted models, A1C values were 8.88 (lifetime abstainers), 8.79 (former drinkers), 8.90 (< 0.1 drink/day), 8.71 (0.1–0.9 drink/day), 8.51 (1–1.9 drinks/day), 8.39 (2–2.9 drinks/day), and 8.47 (≥ 3 drinks/day). Alcohol consumption was linearly (p < 0.001) and inversely (p = 0.001) associated with A1C among diabetes patients.

Conclusions

Alcohol consumption is inversely associated with glycemic control among diabetes patients. This supports current clinical guidelines for moderate levels of alcohol consumption among diabetes patients. As glycemic control affects incidence of complications of diabetes, the lower A1C levels associated with moderate alcohol consumption may translate into lower risk for complications.

### ISPAD clinical practice consensus guidelines 2022: assessment and management of hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with diabetes [^116SDatF]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Alcohol

Alcohol inhibits gluconeogenesisand hypoglycemia may occur if there is an inadequate intake of carbohydrates. Furthermore, the symptoms of hypoglycemia may be masked by the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Even moderate consumption of ethanol may reduce hypoglycemia awareness and impair the counter regulatory response to insulin‐induced hypoglycemia. Apart from the acute effects, moderate consumption of alcohol in the evening is associated with reduced nocturnal growth hormone secretion and may increase the risk of hypoglycemia on the subsequent morning. Although an increase in insulin sensitivity with alcohol intake has been postulated, this remains inconclusive.

Nocturnal hypoglycemia

The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) CGM study group in 2010 described frequent prolonged nocturnal hypoglycemia on 8.5% of nights in both children and adults but more prolonged episodes in children. In this study, the mean time spent in nocturnal hypoglycemia (< 60 mg/dl) was 81 min. Almost half of these episodes were undetected by caregivers or individuals with diabetes. The counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia are attenuated during sleep, and individuals with T1D are much less likely to be awakened by hypoglycemia than individuals without diabetes. This is significant as prolonged nocturnal hypoglycemia can lead to seizures. Nocturnal hypoglycemia should be suspected if pre‐breakfast glucose is low, and/or the individual experiences confusion, nightmares or seizures during the night, or if impaired thinking, lethargy, altered mood, or headaches are reported on waking. It is recommended to monitor overnight glucose levels, particularly if there is an additional risk factor that may predispose to nocturnal hypoglycemia. Younger age, lower HbA1c levels, antecedent exercise, and hypoglycemia are associated with a greater frequency of nocturnal hypoglycemia.

### Dietary carbohydrates: role of quality and quantity in chronic disease [^112CbYrr]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Beyond body weight, meta-analyses of randomised trials indicate that higher intakes of added sugars raise triglycerides, total cholesterol, blood pressure, and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Of special concern is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, an obesity related condition that has emerged as a major public health threat. Reduction of fructose or sugar consumption in several clinical trials resulted in lower intrahepatic fat. However, each of these studies has design limitations, such as lack of a control group and confounding by unintended weight loss. In a six month trial, people consuming sugar sweetened drinks had higher levels of liver and ectopic fat than those consuming drinks without added sugar, even though body weight did not differ by diet group.

Based on the finding that "increasing or decreasing free sugars is associated with parallel changes in body weight… regardless of the level of intake of free sugars", the 2015 WHO guidelines recommended that consumption of free sugars should be less than 10% of energy intake for both adults and children, with potential additional benefits below 5%. The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition in the UK recommended a 5% upper limit, noting potential benefits at this lower level for dental health and total energy intake.(Modern starchy foods may also contribute to dental carries.) The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend a limit on added sugars of 10% total energy.

Composite quality indices

Beyond the mechanisms implied by these broad classification systems, carbohydrate containing foods may influence health in various other ways. Whole plant foods contain myriad compounds with demonstrably beneficial (vitamins, minerals, and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phytochemicals) or possibly adverse(lectins, phytates) actions. Ultimately, diet must be considered in an integrated fashion, with changes in consumption of one category of food affecting others. The nature of these exchanges will determine the apparent healthfulness of specific foods in population studies. Recognising this challenge, several indices for carbohydrate quality (based on GI, fibre, whole:total grain consumption, and other factors) and total diet quality have been proposed.

### Alcohol as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1167A2iy]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Scatter plot of the RR estimates of type 2 diabetes reported in the 20 studies included in the analyses. Each study provides more than one RR estimate. The area of each circle is proportional to the precision of the RR estimate.

Among women, the best-fitting model was the second-degree model with powers 0.5 and 3 (and function β 1 x 0.5 + β 2 x 3) (P < 0.001). Among men, the best-fitting model was the second-degree fractional polynomial with powers 1 and 1 (and function β 1 x + β 2 x ln x) (P = 0.007).

Figure 3 displays the relationship between the risk of alcohol consumption and type 2 diabetes among women and men. For both sexes, the relationship was U shaped. For women, the protective effect was greatest at the 24 g/day level, with a risk reduction of 40% compared with lifetime abstainers (95% CI 0.52–0.69). Alcohol consumption remained protective until just under 50 g/day. For men, the protective effect of alcohol consumption was greatest at 22 g/day, with the risk of diabetes being ∼0.87 times that of lifetime abstainers (95% CI 0.76–1.00), and remained protective until consumption of ∼60 g/day. Thus, for both women and men, the protective effect of alcohol consumption on incident type 2 diabetes was greatest with the consumption of about two drinks per day. Similarly, for both men and women, higher levels of consumption (above ∼50 g/day for women and 60 g/day for men) were no longer protective but actually increased the risk for diabetes.

### Moderate alcohol consumption lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of prospective observational studies [^111D6A77]. Diabetes Care (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This meta-analysis was undertaken to obtain insight regarding the shape and strength of the relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes, the effects of adjustment for confounders, and the effect of modification by type 2 diabetes definition, sex, and BMI.

Research Design and Methods

The 15 original prospective cohort studies that were included comprise 11,959 incident cases of type 2 diabetes in 369,862 individuals who, on average, were followed for 12 years.

Results

After pooling the data, a U-shaped relationship was found. Compared with nonconsumers, the relative risk (RR) for type 2 diabetes in those who consumed ≤ 6 g/day alcohol was 0.87 (95% CI 0.79–0.95). For the moderate consumption ranges of 6–12, 12–24, and 24–48 g/day, RRs of 0.70 (0.61–0.79), 0.69 (0.58–0.81), and 0.72 (0.62–0.84) were found, respectively. The risk of type 2 diabetes in heavy drinkers (≥ 48 g/day) was equal to that in nonconsumers (1.04 [0.84–1.29]). In general, nonsignificant trends for larger RR reduction associated with moderate alcohol consumption were observed for women compared with men, for crude compared with multivariate-adjusted analyses, and for studies that used self-reports instead of testing for type 2 diabetes definition. No differences in RR reductions were found between individuals with low or high BMI.

Conclusions

The present evidence from observational studies suggests an approximately 30% reduced risk of type 2 diabetes in moderate alcohol consumers, whereas no risk reduction is observed in consumers of ≥ 48 g/day.

### Continuous glucose monitoring systems can meet the challenge of glucose management and beyond in individuals with type 2 diabetes: an expert multidisciplinary position [^111JP5HH]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Action Strategy for Type 2 Diabetes

Current therapeutic guidelines for the treatment of diabetes emphasize individualization of care, both in terms of glycemic targets and the route to achieving these. The selection of a therapeutic strategy in a person with T2D should take into account any risk of hypoglycemia and its consequences (especially in the elderly and in patients with cardiovascular and/or nervous system disorders), the duration of the diabetes, the presence of major diabetic vascular complications, and of any serious concomitant diseases. The expectations and attitude of the person with T2D and their anticipated commitment to therapy must also be considered, as well as the benefit-to-risk ratio associated with the achievement of specific treatment targets. Behavioral therapy is also now considered to be an essential first element of treatment for people with diabetes, regardless of diabetes type and age, where the priority is to maintain a healthy body weight. This aspect of therapy focuses on health education and emotional support. It embraces issues related to healthy and balanced nutrition, regular physical activity that is tailored to the patient's abilities and needs, smoking cessation and reduced alcohol consumption, along with reducing stress levels. Implementation of the principles of good nutrition and physical activity in people with diabetes can help to reduce excessive body weight, to achieve and maintain normal plasma glucose levels, with optimal serum lipid and lipoprotein levels, and optimal blood pressure readings.

### Alcohol as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112vJ2A3]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The results of the search are shown in Fig. 1. The strategy resulted in 1,615 hits after the removal of duplicates. The abstracts or complete publications were reviewed and excluded if they contained no indication of a measure of association between alcohol and either morbidity or mortality due to diabetes (n = 1,561), if the measure was cross-sectional (n = 8), or if fewer than three levels of alcohol consumption (i.e. no dose-response data) were reported (n = 5). For all non-English articles, the authors were able to ascertain eligibility. Of the 41 publications remaining, 3 (student theses) could not be obtained and 6 did not contain enough information to quantify, for each alcohol group, consumption in grams per day and/or the measure of association. Two publications reporting consumption using continuous measures could not be revised to provide a measure of association. In cases where more than one publication was generated from a given study, the most comprehensive analysis was used. After exclusion of 6 such duplicates, 24 articles remained. The references of these and relevant review articles were checked for additional publications, and 25 articles were identified. One remained after applying the same criteria described above. Combining the database and hand searches, 25 articles were identified for data abstraction. However, four were excluded because the number of cases of diabetes per alcohol exposure group, which was required for the analysis, was not reported. One was excluded because the measure was for a recent drinking occasion and not a typical day. Thus, 20 articles were included in the analysis.

Figure 1
Flow diagram of literature search for the relationship between alcohol consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes.

Data abstracted included descriptors of study design in addition to measures of association. Alcohol consumption was converted to grams per day (if not originally reported as such). For studies that reported ranges of alcohol consumption for the categories, the midpoint was used. When the highest category was open ended, three-quarters the width of the previous interval was added to the lower limit. Where consumption was reported in drinks and not grams, the grams of pure alcohol equivalent described in the article, if stated, was used as a conversion factor; if not stated, conversion was based on typical drink sizes of the country. In one case, due to ambiguity over a suspected misprint, the authors were contacted via e-mail for clarification. 1.

### Changes in alcohol consumption and subsequent risk of type 2 diabetes in men [^1164UeKf]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Four-year changes in amount of alcohol intake and risk of type 2 diabetes.

The effect of a 7.5 g/day (approximately half a glass) change in alcohol intake on subsequent change in diabetes risk differed between initial alcohol consumption levels (P interaction < 0.01) (Table 2). Such an increment had the largest association with risk on men who were initially nondrinkers at the beginning of any 4-year period of change (HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.60–1.00). This was followed by men who initially consumed < 1 glass/day (HR 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83–0.96). A 4-year change in alcohol intake was not associated with subsequent diabetes risk among men who consumed ≥ 1 glass/day at the beginning of the 4-year period (HR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.95–1.02).

### Knowledge, safety, and impact of alcohol consumption in young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a qualitative study [^116W4WHR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study has highlighted the potentially risky drinking behaviours of these young adults, but also how they adapt some of their behaviours to reduce the possible harms of their alcohol consumption. It has also identified the potential role of advanced diabetes technologies in reducing and managing alcohol related diabetes-harm.

Alcohol, in some countries such as New Zealand, is known to be an important factor in the social lives of young adults. It is often used as a way to assist the development of social relationships; especially as this life-stage involves exploring their newfound independence. For those with type 1 diabetes, previous research has shown that binge-drinking is viewed as a normalised behaviour and that these young adults have a desire to participate despite the potential risks to their health. This was exemplified in this study with all participants partaking in social drinking in excess of the ADA and New Zealand Ministry of Health guidelines. Other common risky behaviours included a reduction in the frequency of glycaemic monitoring and incoherence whilst managing insulin dosages. These behaviours often resulted in periods of hyperglycaemia followed by reactive hypoglycaemia; while a common reaction to alcohol in individuals with diabetes, the mechanisms responsible are incompletely understood but include impaired gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. These states of reactive hypoglycaemia can be worsened by intoxication leading to a general hypoglycaemia unawareness; thus, delaying glycaemic intervention. The illustrative case presented demonstrates this risk with severe hypoglycaemia and unconsciousness as a result, despite protection available to them from automated insulin delivery low and glucose suspend. This case again emphasises the importance of pre-emptive education for managing exercise while drinking (i.e. insulin dose reduction, carbohydrate intake), preventing more extreme intoxication, and ideally close support from friends and/or family following intoxication (demonstrated by the parental intervention seen in this case). Fortunately, within this cohort no greater harms were reported, such as seizures or death, however these remain a possibility if drinking behaviour is not adequately controlled.

### Knowledge, safety, and impact of alcohol consumption in young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a qualitative study [^111zUCxM]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study has highlighted the experiences of young adults with type 1 diabetes who consume alcohol and the ways they engage with both the social aspects and the harms of alcohol consumption. This demographic are known to engage in binge-drinking, and for those who have type 1 diabetes they also show disproportionate rates of harm related to consumption compared to those without diabetes. However, this study has exhibited that these harms may be worsened by a disparity in anticipatory education surrounding alcohol, and thus suggests that there is a need for further development in this area to reduce future harm. This study also indicates that education may need to be individually tailored to consider the competing interests of sociability and harm-reduction to find more feasible interventions and support strategies to be implemented. Diabetes technology may have an important complementary role in these strategies to promote safe glucose control during alcohol consumption.

### Nutrition therapy recommendations for the management of adults with diabetes [^112PvonU]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

There is now abundant evidence from studies of individuals without diabetes that because of their high amounts of rapidly absorbable carbohydrates (such as sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup), large quantities of SSBs should be avoided to reduce the risk for weight gain and worsening of cardiometabolic risk factors. Evidence suggests that consuming high levels of fructose-containing beverages may have particularly adverse effects on selective deposition of ectopic and visceral fat, lipid metabolism, blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and de novo lipogenesis, compared with glucose-sweetened beverages. In terms of specific effects of fructose, concern has been raised regarding elevations in serum triglycerides. Such studies are not available among individuals with diabetes; however, there is little reason to suspect that the diabetic state would mitigate the adverse effects of SSBs.

Nonnutritive sweeteners and hypocaloric sweeteners

Use of nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs) has the potential to reduce overall calorie and carbohydrate intake if substituted for caloric sweeteners without compensation by intake of additional calories from other food sources. (B)

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reviewed several types of hypocaloric sweeteners (e.g. NNSs and sugar alcohols) for safety and approved them for consumption by the general public, including people with diabetes. Research supports that NNSs do not produce a glycemic effect; however, foods containing NNSs may affect glycemia based on other ingredients in the product. An American Heart Association and ADA scientific statement on NNS consumption concludes that there is not enough evidence to determine whether NNS use actually leads to reduction in body weight or reduction in cardiometabolic risk factors. These conclusions are consistent with a systematic review of hypocaloric sweeteners (including sugar alcohols) that found little evidence that the use of NNSs lead to reductions in body weight. If NNSs are used to replace caloric sweeteners, without caloric compensation, then NNSs may be useful in reducing caloric and carbohydrate intake, although further research is needed to confirm these results.

### Alcohol intake reduction for controlling hypertension [^113SdWQN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

High blood pressure constitutes one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity all over the world. At the same time, heavy drinking increases the risk for developing cardiovascular diseases, including cardiomyopathy, hypertension, atrial arrhythmias, or stroke. Several studies have already assessed specifically the relationship between alcohol intake and hypertension. However, the potential effect on blood pressure of alcohol intake reduction interventions is largely unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effect of any intervention to reduce alcohol intake in terms of blood pressure decrease in hypertensive people with alcohol consumption compared to a control intervention or no intervention at all. To determine additional effects related to mortality, major cardiovascular events, serious adverse events, or quality of life.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to June 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 5, 2020), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), MEDLINE Ovid Epub Ahead of Print, and MEDLINE Ovid In-Process, Embase Ovid (from 1974), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Trial authors were contacted when needed and no language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with minimum 12 weeks duration and including 50 or more subjects per group with quantitative measurement of alcohol consumption and/or biological measurement of the outcomes of interest. Participants were adults (16 years of age or older) with systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 mmHg, and SBP ≥ 130 or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg in participants with diabetes. We included any intervention implemented to reduce their alcohol intake.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures adopted by Cochrane.

Main Results

A total of 1210 studies were screened. We included one randomised controlled trial involving a total of 269 participants with a two-year follow-up. Individual patient data for all participants were provided and used in this review. No differences were found between the cognitive-behavioural intervention group and the control group for overall mortality (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.17; low-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (not estimable) and cardiovascular events (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.79; very low-certainty evidence). There was no statistical difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction (Mean Difference (MD) -0.92 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.66 to 3.82 mmHg; very low-certainty evidence) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decrease (MD 0.98 mmHg, 95% CI -1.69 to 3.65 mmHg; low-certainty evidence) between the cognitive-behavioural intervention group and the control group. We also did not find any differences in the proportion of subjects with SBP < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg (Risk Ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.65; very low-certainty evidence). Concerning secondary outcomes, the alcohol intake was significantly reduced in the cognitive-behavioural intervention compared with the control group (MD 191.33 g, 95% CI 85.36 to 297.30 g). We found no differences between the active and control intervention in the proportion of subjects with lower-risk alcohol intake versus higher-risk and extreme drinkers at the end of the study (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.60). There were no estimable results for the quality of life outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

An intervention for decreasing alcohol intake consumption did not result in differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with a control intervention, although there was a reduction in alcohol intake favouring the active intervention. No differences were found either for overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events. No data on serious adverse events or quality of life were available to assess. Adequate randomised controlled trials are needed to provide additional evidence on this specific question.

### Effect of moderate alcohol intake on blood chemistry values… [^114PccA5]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The effect of moderate alcohol intake on selected clinical chemistry values was determined in eight normal men and four normal women. When alcohol was consumed in three portions from one hour before supper to 11 PM and serum specimens were obtained between 7 AM and 8 AM the next day, there was no significant alteration in serum uric acid, lactate, pyruvate, cholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipid, or zinc levels. Fasting blood glucose level was slightly decreased but glucose tolerance curves were not altered. Urinary zinc level was increased. Similar measurements in three subjects between 11 PM and 7 AM showed that serum lactate level increased twofold and uric acid level increased by 0. 5 mg/100 mL at first but both returned to control levels by 7 AM. A decrease of 20% in blood glucose level became 6% by 7 AM. Carey MA, Jones JD, Gastineau CF. Effect of Moderate Alcohol Intake on Blood Chemistry Values. JAMA. 1971; 216: 1766–1769.

### Moderate alcohol consumption may improve glycemic control… [^115N8FYD]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Background: In addition to its known protective effects on the cardiovascular system, moderate alcohol consumption can lower the incidence of type 2 diabetes, according to observational studies. Like many antidiabetic medications, ethanol metabolism inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver, a process that is elevated in persons with diabetes. Shai and colleagues examined whether moderate alcohol intake influences glycemic control in persons with type 2 diabetes who had previously abstained from alcohol consumption. The Study: The randomized controlled trial included patients 40 to 75 years of age from three medical centers in Israel. Participants were healthy; were medically stable; did not already drink alcohol; and did not have significant kidney or liver disease, a recent cardiovascular event, or risk of substance addiction.

The 109 participants were randomly assigned in a 2: 1 ratio to the intervention group or to the control group. Dieticians instructed patients in each group to reduce their carbohydrate intake to compensate for the beverage calories. Fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels, A1C level, lipid profile, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure were assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks. Results: There was a statistically significant 9. 2 percent decrease in fasting blood glucose levels in the intervention group, but no change in the control group. There were no other significant differences between groups. In the intervention group, patients with the highest baseline A1C values had the greatest change in fasting blood glucose levels throughout the study.

Conclusion: This small study shows that moderate alcohol intake may directly improve fasting glucose control without increasing the risk of postprandial hypoglycemia or adversely affecting liver profiles. The study also suggests that patients with the poorest glycemic control may benefit the most from moderate alcohol consumption.

### 10 surprising things that can spike your blood sugar | Diabetes… [^113DUgvt]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know When you first found out you had diabetes, you tested your blood sugar often. This helped you understand how food, activity, stress, and illness could affect your blood sugar levels. Even now that you know the ups and downs, some causes of blood sugar spikes may surprise you. Do you know all these blood sugar triggers.
- Sunburn — the pain causes stress, and stress increases blood sugar levels.
- Artificial sweeteners — more research is needed, but some studies show they can raise blood sugar.
- Coffee — even without sweetener. Some people's blood sugar is extra-sensitive to caffeine.
- Losing sleep — even just one night of too little sleep can make your body use insulin less well.
- Skipping breakfast — going without that morning meal can increase blood sugar after both lunch and dinner.
- Time of day — blood sugar can be harder to control the later it gets.
- Dawn phenomenon — people have a surge in hormones early in the morning whether they have diabetes or not.

For people with diabetes, blood sugar can spike.
- Dehydration — less water in your body means your blood sugar is more concentrated.
- Nose spray — some have chemicals that trigger your liver to make more blood sugar.
- Gum disease — it's both a complication of diabetes and a blood sugar spiker. Watch out for other triggers that can make your blood sugar fall. For example, extreme heat can cause blood vessels to dilate. That makes insulin absorb more quickly and could lead to low blood sugar. If an activity or food is new, check your blood sugar before and after to see how you respond.

### Effects of moderate alcohol intake on fasting insulin and glucose concentrations and insulin sensitivity in postmenopausal women… [^117EXQFD]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

treatments. Conclusions Consumption of 30 g/d of alcohol has beneficial effects on insulin and triglyceride concentrations and insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic postmenopausal women. Moderate alcohol intake has been shown to be cardioprotective. Hyperinsulinemia and reduced insulin sensitivity are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. and type 2 diabetes mellitus1–4 and appear to be influenced by alcohol intake. Alcohol intake is associated with reduced risk for type 2 diabetes, reduced fasting insulin concentration, and/or improved insulin sensitivity. 5–9 Furthermore, menopause is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular. concentration. When women consumed 30 g/d of alcohol compared with 0 g/d, there was a significant improvement of 7. 2% in insulin sensitivity, as estimated by MFFM. Fasting triglyceride concentrations were previously reported to be significantly reduced with alcohol consumption compared with a placebo drink in postmenopausal women. Given the source of alcohol used and the careful control of other dietary factors, the response can be attributed to the ethanol. It. approximately 10% when comparing 30 g/d of alcohol with 0 g/d. 15 Insulin sensitivity was enhanced after consumption of 30 g/d alcohol compared with 0 g/d, independent of BMI, which confirms the findings of recent cross-sectional studies. 7, 9, 18, 19. and with epidemiologic data. 22–24 Moreover, the relative risk for developing type 2 diabetes is significantly reduced in women who consume more than 15 g/d of alcohol compared with nondrinkers. 5 The significant linear effect indicates that this study population may have. carbohydrates.

In conclusion, consumption of 30 g/d of alcohol reduced insulin concentration and improved insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic, postmenopausal women independent of BMI. The observed effects are attributed to ethanol, though other components in red wine may impart additional cardioprotective effects. 33 Elevated fasting insulin concentration is associated with increased insulin.
