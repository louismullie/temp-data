## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage a patient with vomiting, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and red flags. Then, I should classify the vomiting as acute versus chronic and identify alarm features. Next, I will build a prioritized differential diagnosis and outline a targeted diagnostic workup. After that, I will map phase-based management strategies, including acute, prophylactic, and inter-episodic care. Finally, I will address special populations and close with follow-up and patient education, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the basics: I need to ensure airway, breathing, and circulation are intact, assess volume status, and screen for life-threatening causes that mandate urgent action, such as hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, severe electrolyte derangements, or signs of obstruction like bilious emesis or distension, because missing these would be unsafe and delays definitive care would worsen outcomes [^116jNUk3] [^115VicEV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should classify the time course and pattern of vomiting because management diverges substantially. Acute vomiting lasts up to about 7 days and is often infectious or iatrogenic, whereas chronic vomiting persists beyond 4 weeks and requires a broader differential and more structured evaluation. I also need to check for alarm features such as weight loss, GI bleeding, neurologic signs, severe abdominal pain, or a changing pattern that would lower my threshold for invasive testing and expedited specialty referral [^115tX9y8].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis, but wait, let me verify that I am prioritizing by prevalence and danger. Common causes include gastroenteritis, foodborne illness, medication effects, vestibular disorders, early pregnancy, and migraine, while serious mimics include obstruction, acute coronary syndrome, increased intracranial pressure, metabolic derangements, and toxin exposures. I should also keep cyclic vomiting syndrome in mind given its underrecognition and treatability, especially with stereotyped episodes and migraine history [^115tX9y8] [^111oNUsD].

> Next, I should review the history with precision because it drives testing and treatment. I need to check onset and duration, episode frequency and stereotypy, associated symptoms like fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, neurologic changes, medication and substance use including cannabis, pregnancy status, dietary triggers, and comorbidities such as diabetes, migraine, anxiety, or autonomic dysfunction. I should confirm whether there is a prodrome, early morning predominance, or hot-water bathing behavior, which nudge toward CVS, while bilious emesis or focal deficits push me to obstruction or neurologic disease respectively [^115tX9y8] [^111oNUsD] [^113KKHaz].

> Let me consider the physical examination carefully, and I should double-check for dehydration signs, abdominal distension or surgical scars, focal neurologic deficits, papilledema, and occult blood. In children, bilious emesis is obstruction until proven otherwise, and any red flags should trigger urgent imaging and surgical consultation rather than watchful waiting [^116jNUk3] [^115VicEV].

> For initial testing, I need to ensure I am not over-ordering. In acute vomiting without alarms, basic labs such as CBC, electrolytes, glucose, renal function, liver panel, and urinalysis are usually sufficient. In chronic or alarm-feature presentations, I should add thyroid function, calcium, pregnancy testing when appropriate, and consider ECG if cardiac ischemia is plausible. I should reserve endoscopy, cross-sectional imaging, and specialized testing for cases with red flags or refractory symptoms, and in suspected CVS I should avoid shotgun testing and instead pursue a limited, high-yield workup after the diagnosis is considered clinically [^115tX9y8] [^112HCynJ] [^113ZXNHT].

> But wait, what if the pattern fits cyclic vomiting syndrome? I should confirm the Rome IV criteria: stereotyped episodes of acute vomiting lasting less than 7 days, at least 3 discrete episodes in a year with 2 in the prior 6 months, separated by at least 1 week of baseline health, and absence of organic pathology explaining symptoms. Supportive features include personal or family migraine history, and I should remember that abdominal pain is common during episodes and does not exclude CVS [^114kNtZi] [^111oNUsD].

> I will now examine acute management principles, and I need to ensure I am aligning with guideline-based care. For acute gastroenteritis or undifferentiated acute vomiting without alarms, prioritize oral rehydration when tolerated, small frequent meals, and short-course antiemetics such as a serotonin antagonist or dopamine antagonist, while recognizing that evidence for serotonin antagonists in adult gastroenteritis is limited; in dehydration or inability to retain fluids, use IV crystalloids with dextrose, and in CVS flares, IV dextrose-containing fluids and antiemetics are recommended, with consideration of sedating antipsychotics like droperidol or haloperidol in the ED setting for refractory cases [^1136Lvju] [^115XaCkV] [^114X8k52].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to CVS beyond the acute episode. Prophylactic therapy is indicated for moderate-to-severe disease or frequent attacks, with tricyclic antidepressants, especially amitriptyline, as first-line. Alternatives include topiramate, zonisamide, levetiracetam, or aprepitant in refractory cases, acknowledging that much of the evidence is low to very low certainty and decisions should be individualized. Abortive options include triptans early in the prodrome and antiemetics during attacks, and I should screen and treat comorbid anxiety, depression, migraine, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, and substance use within a biopsychosocial model [^113VeL2Y] [^1131gAbH] [^113FoZNV] [^112CnBg5].

> Let me think about inter-episodic and lifestyle strategies because they materially reduce episode frequency. I should confirm that patients maintain regular sleep, avoid prolonged fasting, identify and mitigate triggers such as stress, infections, motion, hormonal fluctuations, and certain foods, and consider cognitive behavioral therapy or mindfulness; supplemental carbohydrates may help in fasting-prone patients, and hot-water bathing, while temporarily relieving nausea, carries burn risk and should be cautioned against [^114xydoW] [^112YSK9Y] [^113KKHaz].

> I need to ensure I address special populations explicitly. In pregnancy, I should confirm gestational age, assess for hyperemesis gravidarum, and use first-line antiemetics per obstetric guidance, escalating if refractory. In pediatrics, I should apply pediatric CVS criteria and avoid overtesting when classic features are present, reserving neuroimaging or metabolic workup for red flags. In older adults, I must maintain a low threshold for obstruction, ACS, medication-induced etiologies, and neurologic causes. In patients with cancer, I should anticipate CINV and use guideline-concordant prophylaxis and rescue strategies, and in palliative care, I should use a mechanism-based, multi-receptor antiemetic approach with non-oral routes when needed [^112S4EFN] [^115zcffi] [^115tX9y8] [^111iQD8G] [^116GDxgm].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring, and I will double-check that I am aligning metrics with patient-centered outcomes. For acute cases, reassess within 48–72 hours for hydration, symptom control, and need for further workup. For chronic or CVS, track episode frequency, duration, severity, ED utilization, disability, and quality of life, titrating prophylactic therapy every 4–6 weeks to effect while monitoring for adverse effects. I should educate patients on trigger recognition, early abortive strategies, and when to seek urgent care, and I should coordinate multidisciplinary care to address comorbidities and reduce healthcare utilization [^116NuZzo] [^114xydoW].

> In summary, I need to ensure my approach remains disciplined: stabilize first, classify and flag alarms, build a prioritized differential, use targeted diagnostics, and apply phase-based management with special population adaptations. For CVS in particular, early recognition, limited but appropriate testing, and a biopsychosocial regimen of prophylaxis, abortives, and lifestyle change can transform outcomes, and I should continually verify that each step is supported by current guidelines and the best available evidence [^111oNUsD] [^112HCynJ] [^111AHWMG].

Vomiting is best managed by **identifying and treating the underlying cause** while providing supportive care [^115tX9y8]. Use **antiemetics** (ondansetron, metoclopramide, promethazine) for symptom control and ensure hydration with oral rehydration or IV fluids if needed [^115tX9y8]. In cyclic vomiting syndrome, use a **biopsychosocial approach** with prophylactic agents (amitriptyline, topiramate, aprepitant) and abortive therapy (triptans, benzodiazepines) [^113VeL2Y] [^1131gAbH] [^115XaCkV]. For cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, stop cannabis and use supportive care [^115uYWDq]. Always monitor for complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and aspiration, and escalate care if alarm features are present [^115tX9y8].

---

## Common causes of vomiting

Vomiting has a broad differential; **identifying the cause is essential** for effective management [^115tX9y8]:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Gastrointestinal | - Gastroenteritis <br/> - Gastroparesis <br/> - Bowel obstruction <br/> - GERD <br/> - Peptic ulcer disease [^115tX9y8] |
| Neurological | - Migraine <br/> - Vestibular disorders <br/> - Increased intracranial pressure <br/> - Seizures [^115tX9y8] |
| Metabolic/endocrine | - Diabetic ketoacidosis <br/> - Hyperemesis gravidarum <br/> - Hypercalcemia <br/> - Uremia [^111GcL98] [^115mhRdR] [^115S2Eje] |
| Medication-induced | - Chemotherapy <br/> - Opioids <br/> - Antibiotics <br/> - NSAIDs [^111iQD8G] [^115S2Eje] |
| Functional disorders | - Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) <br/> - Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) [^111oNUsD] [^112DmqZG] |

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnostic approach

A thorough **history and physical examination** are critical to guide testing and management [^114kC9du]. Key elements include onset and duration, associated symptoms (fever, abdominal pain, neurologic symptoms), medication and substance use, and **alarm features (weight loss, hematemesis, neurologic deficits)** [^115tX9y8]. Initial tests typically include **CBC**, electrolytes, renal and liver function, glucose, and urinalysis; further studies (e.g. imaging, endoscopy) are guided by clinical suspicion [^112HCynJ].

---

## General management principles

### Supportive care

Supportive care is foundational: provide **oral rehydration** with small, frequent sips for mild dehydration, and use intravenous fluids (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) for moderate to severe dehydration or when oral intake is not tolerated [^114X8k52]. Correct electrolyte abnormalities — especially potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate — and use antiemetics such as ondansetron, metoclopramide, promethazine, or prochlorperazine for symptom control [^115tX9y8].

---

### Pharmacological management

Pharmacological therapy targets the **underlying cause and mechanism**:

- **Serotonin (5-HT3) antagonists**: ondansetron, granisetron for acute vomiting, especially chemotherapy-induced or postoperative [^1156WSAi] [^112AL6pt].
- **Dopamine antagonists**: metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, promethazine for acute vomiting [^115tX9y8].
- **Neurokinin-1 antagonists**: aprepitant, fosaprepitant for chemotherapy-induced vomiting [^notfound].
- **Benzodiazepines**: lorazepam for anxiety-related or anticipatory vomiting [^notfound].
- **Cannabinoids**: dronabinol, nabilone for refractory cases, especially in oncology or palliative care [^notfound].

---

## Management of specific conditions

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS)

CVS is a disorder of gut–brain interaction characterized by recurrent, stereotypic vomiting episodes. Management is **phase-targeted**:

- **Inter-episodic phase**: lifestyle modifications (regular sleep, stress management, trigger avoidance), psychological support, and prophylactic medications (amitriptyline, topiramate, zonisamide, levetiracetam, aprepitant) [^114xydoW] [^113VeL2Y] [^1131gAbH].
- **Prodromal phase**: abortive therapy with triptans (e.g. sumatriptan) or benzodiazepines [^112CnBg5] [^115XaCkV].
- **Emetic phase**: supportive care with IV fluids, antiemetics, and sedation as needed [^114X8k52] [^115XaCkV].

---

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS)

CHS presents with cyclic vomiting in chronic cannabis users. Management centers on **cannabis cessation**, supportive care with IV fluids and electrolytes, and antiemetics; benzodiazepines may help in severe cases, and hot showers are characteristic but not a primary therapy [^112DmqZG].

---

### Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV)

CINV is a common and distressing side effect of chemotherapy. Management follows **risk-based prophylaxis** using serotonin antagonists, dexamethasone, and NK1 antagonists, with olanzapine added for high-risk regimens or breakthrough symptoms [^115S2Eje] [^117QMDPn].

---

### Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)

PONV is common after anesthesia and surgery. Management includes **risk assessment**, prophylaxis with combination antiemetics (ondansetron, dexamethasone, droperidol), and rescue therapy with agents from a different class if PONV occurs [^116rWMfM] [^112B4vmR].

---

## Complications and monitoring

Vomiting can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance**: monitor fluid status and electrolytes, especially potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate [^112HCynJ].
- **Aspiration pneumonia**: risk increases with impaired consciousness or respiratory compromise.
- **Mallory-Weiss tears**: esophageal tears from forceful vomiting [^112HCynJ].
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: chronic vomiting can cause malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Patient education is essential to improve adherence and outcomes. Key points include trigger identification and avoidance, medication adherence, and **when to seek medical attention** (e.g. persistent vomiting, signs of dehydration, **hematemesis**, severe abdominal pain, neurologic symptoms) [^115tX9y8]. Follow-up should monitor symptom control, **medication side effects**, and complications, with care coordinated among primary care, gastroenterology, neurology, psychology, and other specialties as needed [^112CnBg5].

---

Effective vomiting management requires a **structured approach**: identify the cause, provide supportive care, and use targeted pharmacologic therapy. CVS, CHS, CINV, and PONV each have specific management strategies, and complications must be monitored closely.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^112jCajT]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) management — "it is now imperative to adopt evidence based antiemetic combination for prophylaxis, as well as appropriate rescue antiemetics". Although "individual antiemetics differ in their efficacy", it "is not yet clear how this translates to the efficacy of combination prophylaxis". "There are robust PONV risk scores that are accurate for risk stratification at a population level", and clinicians "should be cognizant of additional factors which could modify individuals' PONV risks and management". Pediatric care is highlighted: "PONV management in children should follow algorithmic approach, using evidence-based interventions". A "paradigm shift towards personalized medicine" offers research opportunities, and policies "should include considerations to the socioeconomic and equity aspects of healthcare delivery".

### Improving the non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) pathway using quality improvement methodology [^112ZBhps]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

All ACS are caused by a sudden reduction of blood flow to cardiac muscle, usually caused by rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque within the wall of a coronary artery and formation of a blood clot which may be partially or completely occlusive. The most common symptom of ACS is severe pain in the chest and/or in other areas lasting several hours. Other symptoms include sweating, nausea, vomiting, breathlessness and feeling faint. ACS typically has a broad range of clinical presentations from patients who are symptom free at presentation to patients with ongoing chest discomfort/symptoms, cardiac arrest, electrical/haemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock.

Patients presenting with suspected ACS are typically classified for initial management based on ECG at presentation. After this, they can be further classified based on the presence or absence of cardiac troponin elevation. These (ECG changes and cardiac troponin elevation), along with clinical features, are important in the initial triage and diagnosis of patients with ACS, helping to risk stratify patients and guide management.

This paper focuses on the care pathway for patients with NSTEACS, which commonly involves admission to a local hospital then transfer to a cardiac centre for coronary angiography.

In patients with an intermediate or higher risk of future adverse cardiovascular events, coronary angiography, to define the extent and severity of coronary disease within 72 hours of admission to hospital, offers advantages over an initial conservative strategy, provided there are no contraindications to angiography. NICE guideline NG185 for ACS states that services should provide coronary angiography (with follow-on PCI if indicated) as soon as it offers net clinical benefits; within 72 hours and sooner if possible.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with cancer: practical considerations for the management of patients with nausea or vomiting [^112uBhqX]. The Oncologist (2018). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have proven efficacy and safety and are approved for use in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and those with atrial fibrillation (AF). There is no clear guidance on the use of DOACs in the significant proportion of these patients who have or will develop concomitant cancer. The occurrence of nausea and vomiting in these patients, despite implementation of guideline-recommended antiemetic strategies, is a particular concern because it may affect oral drug intake and consequently outcomes with anticoagulation therapy. Here, we review recent data on the incidence and management of cancer-associated nausea and vomiting and the current evidence and guidance relating to the use of DOACs in patients with cancer. On the basis of this evidence, an international working group of experts in the fields of cancer-associated thrombosis/hemostasis, hematology, and oncology discussed key issues related to the use of DOACs in patients with VTE or AF and cancer who are at risk of nausea and vomiting and developed some consensus recommendations. We present these consensus recommendations, which outline strategies for the use and management of anticoagulants, including DOACs, in patients with VTE or AF and cancer for whom oral drug intake may pose challenges. Guidance is provided on managing patients with gastrointestinal obstruction or nausea and vomiting that is caused by cancer treatments or other cancer-related factors. The recommendations outlined in this review provide a useful reference for health care professionals and will help to improve the management of anticoagulation in patients with VTE or AF and cancer.

Implications For Practice

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) offer several advantages over traditional anticoagulants, including ease of administration and the lack of need for routine monitoring. However, the management of patients with an indication for anticoagulation and concomitant cancer, who are at high risk of thromboembolic events, presents several challenges for administering oral therapies, particularly with regard to the risk of nausea and vomiting. In the absence of robust data from randomized trials and specific guidelines, consensus recommendations were developed for healthcare professionals regarding the use of DOACs in patients with cancer, with a focus on the management of patients who are at risk of nausea and vomiting.

### Practical perspectives in the treatment of nausea and vomiting [^117BYSHc]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Nausea and vomiting result from complex interactions between afferent and efferent pathways of the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, and autonomic nervous system. Afferent pathways from the vagus nerve, vestibular system, and chemoreceptor trigger zone project to nucleus tractus solitarius, which in turn relays signals to the central pattern generator to initiate multiple downstream pathways resulting in symptoms of nausea and vomiting. There is increasing evidence that the central pathway of chronic nausea is different from that of acute nausea and vomiting-and closely resembles that of neuropathic pain. This improved understanding of chronic nausea has resulted in a paradigm shift with regard to management strategy. Although conventional therapies such as antiemetics and prokinetics are commonly used to manage acute nausea and vomiting, they are historically not as effective in treating chronic nausea. Recently, neuromodulator agents, such as tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, olanzapine, mirtazapine, and benzodiazepines, and cannabinoids have been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of nausea and vomiting, and may be useful in the treatment of chronic symptoms. There is a need to study these agents, especially in the management of chronic functional nausea. Improved understanding of the central and peripheral circuitry of nausea and vomiting symptoms will allow for enhanced utilization of the currently available medications, and the development of novel therapeutic options.

### Antiemetic guidelines: creating a more practical treatment approach [^114LmNLR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Antiemetic guidelines from a variety of professional organizations have been available for several years. It is unclear just how often these guidelines have been used, however; data indicate that some practitioners still do not treat their patients according to the recommendations. Some of those involved in the creation of the original guidelines convened to try to create a simpler, more practical approach to the use of antiemetics in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The group's intention was to clarify available guidelines and produce a practical document, based on evidence, that could be used in everyday practice. The group created four consensus statements that would serve as a basis for their recommendations. One primary strategy used was to have chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting viewed as a single process that can occur throughout a treatment cycle, and not so much as an acute and a delayed process, as is usual in clinical trials. Patients' management should be considered over a 4- to 5-day period, rather than primarily dealing with the day of treatment only. The group created three tables: emetic risk of chemotherapy; treatment options based on emetic category; and antiemetic dosing recommendations. Use of these tables should make appropriate antiemetic selection more straightforward and easier for the practitioner in an everyday setting. Although this document alone may not solve all the challenges with appropriate antiemetic management, it will hopefully prove to be a step in the right direction.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome — supplemental carbohydrate: Supplemental carbohydrate can provide additional energy during high energy demands; published observations have noted that fasting induces some episodes and, conversely, frequent feedings prevent others, even in the absence of documented hypoglycemia; furthermore, a rapid response to intravenous dextrose infusion can be seen during acute attacks, and when a patient's history suggests fasting-induced attacks, high-carbohydrate snacks may be given between meals, before physical exertion, and at bedtime.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines on the diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^1176TP7K]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in children — target population and diagnostic approach describe that the 'target population for these guidelines includes children of all ages with symptoms consistent with CVS' and that 'The diagnostic considerations and recommended symptom-based criteria are described in a separate document'. The guideline notes that 'diagnostic criteria and exclusionary medical workup to strengthen a diagnosis of CVS have been driven by expert consensus recommendations', that 'There is lack of direct evidence in support of any specific diagnostic testing for disorders mimicking pediatric CVS unless suspected by clinical alarm signs', and that 'Extensive diagnostic workup such as screening for metabolic conditions, brain pathology, or mucosal GI disease is documented to be of low yield and unlikely to change management for patients with few symptom-based criteria'.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome: commentary [^11595t1a]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — epidemiology and care burden in adults is marked by frequent health-care utilization and disability: Approximately one-half of people with CVS visit the emergency department (ED) at least annually, and 1 in 3 adults with CVS will become disabled. The prevalence of CVS is approximately 2% in the United States and is more common in women. Although there are effective treatments for most patients, the condition remains underdiagnosed and thus undertreated, with most patients experiencing years of diagnostic delays, extensive and futile investigations, and even unnecessary surgical procedures. Yet, only a small fraction of all individuals with CVS are likely to have received a CVS diagnosis. Access to care, early recognition of CVS, and appropriate treatment can reduce CVS symptoms, reduce health care utilization, and improve patients' quality of life.

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome: pathophysiology, comorbidities, and future research directions [^113TgX5P]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is characterized by severe episodic emesis in adults and children. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is an increasingly recognized CVS-like illness that has been associated with chronic cannabis use. There are significant gaps in our understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical features, comorbidities, and effective management options of CVS. Recommendations for treating CVS are based on limited clinical data, as no placebo-controlled, randomized trials have yet been conducted. Diseases associated with CVS, including migraine, mitochondrial disorders, autonomic dysfunction, and psychiatric comorbidities, provide clues about pathophysiologic mechanisms and suggest potential therapies. We review our current understanding of CVS and propose future research directions with the aim of developing effective therapy. Establishing a multicenter, standardized registry of CVS patients could drive research on multiple fronts including developing CVS-specific outcome measures to broaden our understanding of clinical profiles, to serve as treatment end points in clinical trials, and to provide a platform for patient recruitment for randomized clinical trials. Such a robust database would also facilitate conduct of research that aims to determine the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and genetic basis for CVS, as well as identifying potential biomarkers for the disorder. Soliciting government and industry support is crucial to establishing the necessary infrastructure and achieving these goals. Patient advocacy groups such as the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association (CVSA), which partner with clinicians and researchers to disseminate new information, to promote ongoing interactions between patients, their families, clinicians, investigators, to support ongoing CVS research and education, must be an integral part of this endeavor.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^111NogsU]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) introduction — clinical impact and prior guidance notes that PONV is a common adverse event after surgery and anesthesia, and it is distressing for patients, delays post-anesthesia recovery, and can sometimes lead to more serious complications. Optimal management of PONV requires a multidisciplinary approach, with evidence-based care and appropriate institutional infrastructure, and in the last consensus guideline, the expert panel recommended a general approach to multimodal PONV prophylaxis, and rescue treatment with antiemetics from a different pharmacological class. Since the last guideline, there has been a plethora of studies on various novel antiemetic combinations and a growing body of literature on genetic, socioeconomic, and diversity considerations, and the updated guidelines will address the emerging clinical evidence as well as novel considerations in PONV management.

Purpose Of Review

This review was undertaken to survey recent literature for research reports and comprehensive clinical reviews addressing the pharmacologic management of nausea and vomiting (N&V) in advanced cancer. The goal was to integrate findings in a comprehensive article that incorporates palliative care concepts into antiemetic treatment.

Recent Findings

There are few published studies of N&V in advanced cancer; such research may be limited by the multicausal nature of N&V and participant burden to patients with life-limiting disease. Most articles are written by oncologists who also specialize in palliative care, and those addressing adverse effects of drugs used as antiemetics are found in other literature. Articles addressing more novel therapies, like cannabinoids and medical marijuana, are uncommon in the oncology literature. N&V in patients with progressive or advanced cancer is often multicausal. Nausea is more common and persistent, and even mild nausea is bothersome and may cause anxiety or depression. The mechanisms of nausea and vomiting overlap, but different neural pathways constitute the final pathway for each-the brainstem for vomiting and higher brain regions for nausea. Common causes of N&V in advanced cancer include constipation, opioids, and malignant bowel obstruction. About 40% have undetermined causes and may be exacerbated by impaired gastric emptying, chemical imbalances, or other factors. Several drugs that have antiemetic effects and act at different receptors are used to palliate N&V. There is a paucity of research that supports palliative antiemetic choices, and other research is needed to define potential therapeutic strategies that capitalize on differences between nausea and vomiting.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — neurological red flags and neurodiagnostic testing: Progressive or focal neurological findings (new-onset ataxia, abnormal eye movements, papilledema, motor asymmetry, gait abnormality, developmental regression or stagnation, or recent personality changes) are "not typical of CVS and should alert the clinician to evaluate for increased intracranial pressure or a metabolic disorder". If vomiting is associated with progressive focal or diffuse neurological symptoms or signs, "neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is warranted", and "MRI is superior to CT scanning for visualization of the posterior fossa", whereas "Skull x-rays have no value in this clinical setting". If seizures are suspected, "electroencephalography during awake, drowsy, and sleep states is indicated". Contextual tumor data note that "one fourth of children with brain tumors initially present with vomiting", and in cerebellar medulloblastoma "about three fourths of patients present with chronic vomiting".

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome in 41 adults: the illness, the patients, and problems of management [^113kyFno]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS) consists of recurrent, stereotypic episodes of incapacitating nausea and vomiting lasting hours to days and separated by symptom-free intervals, which typically last weeks or months.

The illness has four phases: the inter-episodic phase, during which the patient is relatively symptom-free; the prodrome, which begins when the patient begins to sense the approach of an episode, has nausea of varying intensity, but is still able to retain oral medications; the emetic phase, characterized by intense, persistent nausea, vomiting and other symptoms; and the recovery phase, which begins with the subsidence of nausea and ends when hunger, tolerance of oral intake and vigor return to normal (Figure 1). Episodes typically recur 6–12 times per year. CVS is considered to be a functional disorder. Some investigators have suggested that it is a manifestation of migraine diathesis.

Figure 1
Schematic representation of the four phases of Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome and their therapeutic goals.

CVS was first described in the English literature in 1882 by Samuel Gee who reported a series of nine children ranging in age from 4 to 8 years. Thereafter, CVS was considered to be a pediatric disorder, and the absence of characteristic physical, laboratory or radiological markers for CVS resulted in its poor recognition by physicians who practice adult medicine. Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome has been reported in adults with onset ranging from childhood to middle age. CVS in adults has been characterized as similar to CVS in children. However, naturalistic observation of patients with CVS made during personalized continuity of care indicates that adults often present features and management challenges not typical of pediatric patients. Moreover, the impression is gained that the pattern of episodes in untreated CVS tends to remain more or less constant with respect to inter-episodic duration, duration of the emetic phase and associated symptoms. By contrast, we found, and herein describe, the phenomenon of episode coalescence, which characterizes deterioration in the course of the illness. Although the high prevalence of migraine diathesis has been noted for more than 70 years, co-morbid anxiety, panic attacks and inter-episodic dyspeptic nausea are additional features of CVS in many adult patients. These features of CVS and their possible synergy in cyclic vomiting attacks have not been addressed previously.

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome: future clinical and research priorities for: special supplement / proceedings of 3rd international symposium [^115uYWDq]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

An increasing number of studies have explored the clinical features, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). CVS is common in adults and children and negatively impacts patients, families, and the healthcare system. A related condition, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), has been a focus of interest in the lay press and published literature.

Purpose

Clinical presentations of CVS have been defined by small series and expert opinion, but recent prospective studies are refining our understanding of the spectrum of emetic episodes and the breadth of comorbid conditions. Large cross-sectional population analyses are clarifying CVS prevalence and factors related to age, ethnicity, and geographic region. CVS pathophysiology is multifactorial with contributions from migraines, dysautonomia, endogenous cannabinoids, mitochondrial dysfunction, genetic abnormalities, and rapid gastric emptying. CVS treatment relies on antiemetics and antimigraine therapies to abort acute episodes coupled with prophylactic regimens employing neuromodulators and antiepileptics. CHS represents a challenge partly because of difficulties in achieving sustained cannabis abstinence. Benefits of other therapies in CHS remain poorly defined. Several areas warrant further scrutiny including better identification of CVS triggers and characterization of different CVS subsets including those with frequent severe episodes, refined description of epidemiology to allow targeting of populations predisposed to CVS development, rigorous definition of pathogenic factors to provide a foundation for exploratory studies of novel therapies, and conduct of controlled trials by multicenter collaborations to confirm benefits of existing and new therapies in development. Progress in these areas will be facilitated by generous governmental and industry support.

### The management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: current thoughts and protocols [^116bxqbH]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The postoperative course of surgical patients can have a tremendous impact on the surgical outcome and on patient satisfaction. One of the most significant issues is postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) which, despite being a common side effect of general anesthesia, has received little attention in the plastic surgery literature. The incidence and potential consequences of PONV are frequently underestimated and consequently the need for prophylaxis is often overlooked. There are significant consequences to this seemingly minor morbidity that extend beyond patient discomfort and dissatisfaction. In addition to being considered a significant undesirable outcome by patients, severe cases of PONV may result in postoperative complications and unplanned hospital admissions. In this article we overview the mechanism, pathophysiology, and risk factors for PONV and provide a comprehensive algorithmic approach to its management.

### Guidelines versus individualized care for the management of CINV [^112AL6pt]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Numerous groups have published guidelines for the prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). The current management of CINV, however, remains suboptimal, due in part to poor adherence to existing antiemetic guidelines. Challenges in clinical trial design have also slowed progress and complicated the selection of optimal antiemetic therapy. In addition, patient-specific characteristics and factors are not included in current CINV guidelines and are an important contributor to an individual's risk for nausea and vomiting. CINV risk prediction algorithms have now emerged and provide the opportunity to individualize antiemetic prophylaxis. Further studies are underway to examine the precise role for risk model-guided antiemetic prophylaxis in patients with cancer.

On admission, he was dehydrated, and laboratory findings included an aspartate aminotransferase level of 81 U/L, prothrombin time of 12. 3 seconds, and bilirubin level of
0. 9 mg/dL. His transaminase levels were elevated 24 hours after ingestion; his PT was 12. 1 seconds, and his bilirubin level was
0. 2 mg/dL. His PT became prolonged the next day and peaked at 35 seconds on the fourth day. Case 3. A 30-year-old man used a guidebook to assist in the collection of wild mushrooms. Twelve hours after eating the mushrooms he had gathered, he developed vomiting and severe diarrhea. He was admitted to a hospital 17 hours after ingestion because of orthostatic hypotension and dehydration. Abnormal laboratory findings indicated an AST level of 75 U/L, blood urea nitrogen level of 22 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 2. 8 mg/dL.

He was treated with intravenous fluids. Although renal function indicators were within normal limits 1 day after admission, his liver enzyme and PT levels began to increase; on the fourth day, transaminase levels peaked, total bilirubin level was 1. 6 mg/dL, and PT was 18 seconds. Patients may not associate their symptoms with ingestion of wild mushrooms because of the delayed onset. As illustrated by the cases described in this report, symptoms typically occur in a progression through three stages. During the first stage, which occurs 6–24 hours after ingestion, symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, severe diarrhea, fever, tachycardia, hyperglycemia, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalance. During the second stage, which occurs during the next 24–48 hours, symptoms appear to abate even as hepatic and renal functions deteriorate.

During the third stage, which occurs 3–5 days after the ingestion, hepatocellular damage and renal failure may progress, resulting in jaundice and hepatic coma.

5.5 Investigations

The Rome IV criteria for the diagnosis of CVS require that there is "no organic pathology" to explain the symptoms. Hence, it is reasonable to pursue some higher‐yield diagnostic investigations to exclude other disorders that may mimic CVS. Unfortunately, many patients with CVS are subjected to extensive and often repetitive diagnostic testing before the diagnosis is even considered. Diagnosing CVS efficiently and in a cost‐effective manner can be achieved by early clinical recognition based upon the Rome IV criteria, followed by a limited diagnostic workup to exclude alternative disorders. The following suggestions reflect the committee's expert opinion as there is limited published data pertaining to approach.

A basic workup for a patient with previously uninvestigated episodes of vomiting should include biochemical, endoscopic, and potentially radiographic assessments. Biochemical testing should include the following: a complete blood count, serum electrolytes and glucose, liver panel, lipase, and urinalysis. Although patients will undoubtedly receive some testing in an ED setting if presenting with a CVS episode, in general diagnostic tests should be performed after resolution to minimize confounding variables such as dehydration. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) should be performed to exclude organic pathology such a gastric volvulus, which may mimic CVS in rare instances. It is important not to over‐interpret some endoscopic findings, such as a Mallory‐Weiss tear, mild gastritis, or esophagitis as being causal, when those findings may more likely be epiphenomena reflective of recent retching and vomiting. Imaging studies including a right upper quadrant ultrasound could reveal biliary disease, and a small bowel follow‐through or CT/MR enterography may also be able to exclude any obstructive lesions within the small bowel.

### Cyclic vomiting syndrome: what a gastroenterologist needs to know [^111BiiJa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

CVS (cyclic vomiting syndrome) is a functional disorder that may occur in any age group of patients. In the past the disorder was considered to be fairly uncommon of unknown etiology. Treatment has generally been based on anecdotal reports.

Methods

Literature review was performed based on internet/Medline search as of April 2006.

Results

CVS is much more common than previously thought, especially in adults and is commonly associated with migraine headaches and sharing many of its characteristic features. Genetic association with mitochondrial DNA has been recognized with CVS. Prompt diagnosis is essential in order to prevent the significant morbidity associated with CVS. It is mandatory to rule out certain life-threatening disorders that can mimic CVS. Treatment options are based on the particular phase of the syndrome in which a patient is in and carried out in a systematic manner.

Conclusion

Expert consensus is that CVS is a distinct disorder and is a part of the migraine spectrum (migraine headaches, CVS, and abdominal migraines). Once patients are properly diagnosed, treatment is highly effective. Because of renewed interest in CVS since the 1990's, many more patients in all age groups are being recognized who suffer from this disabling disorder. An increase in basic science and clinical research in CVS will hopefully lead to better patient outcomes.

### Management of intractable nausea and vomiting in patients at the end of life: "I was feeling nauseous all of the time… nothing was working" [^116GDxgm]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Nausea and vomiting, symptoms that occur commonly near the end of life, represent a substantial source of physical and psychological distress for patients and families. In the context of the case of Mr Q, a 50-year-old man with metastatic esophageal cancer admitted to the hospital with intractable nausea and vomiting, we review the evaluation and treatment of this symptom complex. A thorough history and physical examination are essential first steps in the management of these patients because they define the severity of the symptoms and clues to their underlying etiology. Once the most likely cause is determined, the clinician discerns the mechanism, specific transmitters, and receptors by which this etiology is triggering nausea and vomiting. Subsequent pharmacological management focuses on prescribing the appropriate antagonist to the implicated receptors. If symptoms are refractory despite adequate dosage and around-the-clock prophylactic administration, an empirical trial combining several therapies to block multiple emetic pathways should be attempted. Less traditional agents are also discussed, although evidence for their use is limited. Often, oral administration of medication is not feasible and alternate routes such as rectal suppositories, subcutaneous infusions, and orally dissolvable tablets should be considered. Using this step-wise approach, nausea and vomiting can be successfully managed in most patients at the end of life.

Key Points

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) has associations with migraines, lifestyle and psychosocial factors, neurohumoral contributors, and cannabis use; treatment remains empiric based on small case series.
Gaps persist in understanding the pathophysiology, comorbidities, and effective therapies of CVS and a related disorder — cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.
Goals of future CVS research should include validating CVS‐specific symptom and quality of life instruments and establishing an infrastructure to permit multicenter data acquisition, investigation of disease mechanisms, and facilitation of patient recruitment for treatment trials.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — future directions and conclusions — There are major gaps in understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of CVS, which limits the development of more effective treatments. Similarly, an incomplete understanding of the clinical features and comorbidities that predict clinical responses is a barrier to developing personalized therapeutic approaches. Clinical research leveraging multicenter, standardized registries of patients with CVS and directed investments by both industry and governmental sources are needed. CVS is a common and disabling condition in adults, but need not be so, as it is a treatable condition, and prompt recognition remains the key factor in avoiding unnecessary investigations and providing patients with effective treatments.

### Evidence-based recommendations for cancer nausea and vomiting [^117QMDPn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

The experience of patients living with cancer and being treated with chemotherapy often includes the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. To provide a framework for high-quality management of these symptoms, we developed a set of key targeted evidence-based standards through an iterative process of targeted systematic review, development, and refinement of topic areas and standards and consensus ratings by a multidisciplinary expert panel as part of the RAND Cancer Quality-Assessing Symptoms Side Effects and Indicators of Supportive Treatment Project. For nausea and vomiting, key clinical standards included screening at the initial outpatient and inpatient visit, prophylaxis for acute and delayed emesis in patients receiving moderate to highly emetic chemotherapy, and follow-up after treatment for nausea and vomiting symptoms. In addition, patients with cancer and small bowel obstruction were examined as a special subset of patients who present with nausea and vomiting. The standards presented here for preventing and managing nausea and vomiting in cancer care should be incorporated into care pathways and should become the expectation rather than the exception.

### Guidelines on management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association [^113FpKEw]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

This article represents an official statement of the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society (ANMS) and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association (CVSA) on the diagnosis and management of CVS in adults. The target audience for this guideline includes gastroenterologists, emergency medicine physicians, primary care providers, other clinicians, patients, and policymakers. The committee developed and graded the recommendations and assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. 6 The committee members, who were selected jointly by the CVSA and a council member of the ANMS clinical guidelines committee, included primarily gastroenterologists with clinical and research expertise, providers from other disciplines, such as psychology and neurology, methodologists with experience in evidence appraisal and guideline development, and one patient representative, who was also President of the CVSA. The panel chair was a gastroenterologist. Conflicts of interest of all participants were managed according to ANMS policies. At the time of appointment, a majority of the guideline panel, including the chair and the vice‐chair, had no conflicts of interest as defined and judged by ANMS policies. This manuscript was prepared by committee members and a patient advocate who served as part of the committee in order to incorporate patient values and preferences while developing recommendations, as per the GRADE methodology. 6 A librarian conducted the literature search and two GRADE experts reviewed and graded the literature. The reader is referred to the accompanying technical review for a more detailed understanding of the process and additional details about individual studies. The committee had four in‐person meetings and multiple conference calls during this process. Committee members except for the two GRADE experts voted on all recommendations and either "agreed" or "disagreed" and votes were tallied.

Recommendations for the diagnosis of CVS, suggested investigations, treatment protocol for the emergency department (ED), and algorithm for management are also provided. These recommendations are based on best practices and consensus of the committee members. These were formulated based on review of the available literature and the collective experience of the committee members who have taken care of more than 3000 patients with CVS in their practices.

With increasing attention paid to use of cannabis in CVS, Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) has been proposed as a distinct entity by the Rome Foundation. 7, 8, 9, 10 CHS, the role of cannabis in hyperemesis, and the overlap between CHS and CVS are described in a separate manuscript included with these CVS guidelines.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — clinical features and burden include recurrent, discrete, self-limited episodes defined by symptom-based criteria and the absence of positive laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic testing, with intense vomiting and early-morning onset described. A large case series found that although it affects only 5% to 15% of a child's lifetime, it results in 24 days of missed school and an annualized cost of care of $17,035. The vomiting is intense (median 6 times/ hour at peak), often bilious (83% in some series), and episodes often commence in the early morning (eg, 3–4 AM or upon awakening). CVS starts commonly in early childhood, and the vomiting symptoms may abate with the onset of classical migraine headaches during adolescence.

### Searching for perfection: further progress in management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting-concluding thoughts [^112aworM]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Ultimately, no presently available antiemetic therapy alone will provide complete protection from the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy across the different emetogenic phases. Ongoing trials are exploring antiemetic therapies in pediatric and adolescent patients, as well as those with refractory CINV, to expand the reach of currently available and novel approaches for CINV management. Specific areas of unmet needs in CINV, such as nausea and anticipatory CINV, need to be addressed in future clinical research to identify the mechanisms involved in these responses and the potential strategies to overcome these extremely bothersome side effects. The role for olanzapine in nausea control continues to be explored in ongoing studies of patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy for solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Nausea should be included as a primary study endpoint in future clinical trial designs to better measure the efficacy of CINV therapies and reflect patients' true experience. The control arms for ongoing clinical trials also need to include guideline-based antiemetic therapy to provide insightful comparison data that can shape future management of CINV.

Patient-related risk factors, including genetic differences in cytochrome P450 or 5-HT3 mutations and ethnic differences, have also been insufficiently evaluated, with emerging risk models and new suggestions for risk-adapted antiemetic therapy representing a promising pathway for better results in many situations. Novel antiemetic therapies and combination approaches to overcome delayed CINV and breakthrough/refractory CINV are another focus of ongoing investigation and seek to achieve better control of nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy. Effective education of the multidisciplinary healthcare team, including physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, regarding current CINV guidelines and emerging therapeutic options will likely improve the use of these regimens. In addition, patients must be informed of their risk for CINV, the importance of timely reporting of symptoms, and the antiemetic therapies available for their use. By working together, patients and clinicians can continue to strive for perfection and make nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy a thing of the past.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome in children — background and burden — is prevalent in 1.9%–2.3% of children, markedly affects quality of life and healthcare utilization with recurrent emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and school-related disability, and presents as stereotypical attacks of emesis that closely resemble migraine. There is insufficient knowledge of exact pathophysiology and lack of evidence-based treatment algorithms, leading to inconsistency and poor consensus among practitioners; therapies are typically empiric and/or targeted towards common comorbidities with substantial focus on pharmacological interventions. These guidelines were developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess certainty in evidence and formulate recommendations.

The GRADE approach was used to rate the certainty in the evidence. In this approach, direct evidence from RCTs starts at high quality and can be rated down to levels of moderate, low, and very low quality, based on risk of bias in the body of evidence (or study quality), indirectness (addressing a different but related population, intervention, or outcome, from the one of interest), imprecision (of the summary estimate and boundaries of 95% CI), inconsistency (or heterogeneity in the results of the included studies), and/or publication bias. Due to inherent limitations in observational studies (selection bias, unmeasured confounding, etc.), evidence derived from observational studies starts at low quality and then is potentially downgraded based on the aforementioned factors or upgraded in case of dose‐response relationship and large magnitude of effect. High‐quality evidence suggests that we are confident of the quality of the evidence and/or the direction and magnitude of the effect estimate, and any new data are unlikely to alter this. Moderate certainty suggests that we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty suggests that our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Finally, very low certainty: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Judgments about the certainty in the evidence were made via discussion among the panel, and any disagreements were resolved by group consensus.

2.7 Evidence‐to‐decision framework

Information from this review was used in combination with factors such as patients' values and preferences, cost‐effectiveness data (if available), and resource utilization to inform the development of the clinical guideline.

5 TREATMENT OF COMORBID CONDITIONS

5.1 Recommendation 9. We suggest screening and treatment for comorbid conditions such as anxiety, depression, migraine headache, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, and substance use. We suggest referral to appropriate allied health services (psychologist, psychiatrist, neurologist, sleep, or substance use specialist) as indicated

Vote: 100% agreement

Psychiatric conditions, including anxiety, panic, and depression, are common in adults with CVS, 18, 75 with one systematic review finding a prevalence of 39.7% (CI: 33.6‐46.1). 76 However, few studies used standardized diagnostic interviews to ascertain psychiatric disorders, with most reporting the presence of psychiatric conditions based on either a patient report/chart review or via a screening instrument. One case report described persistent nausea that provoked anxiety, leading to conditioned anticipatory nausea and vomiting that in turn aggravated the patient's CVS. 77 Other studies reported that panic symptoms can trigger episodes of CVS. 75, 78 Taranukha et al 79 recently reported that 41% of adults with CVS had high degrees of psychological distress measured by the Basic Symptom Inventory. Anxiety and mood symptoms may both be risk factors for precipitating episodes of CVS or as a consequence of CVS. It is prudent to assess for psychiatric comorbidity in adult CVS patients. Further, several population studies have found increased symptom burden, functional disability, decreased quality of life, and increased healthcare costs when medical and mental health conditions co‐occur. 80

Migraine headache (including a family history of migraine) is closely linked with CVS. 4, 5 The prevalence of migraine headaches in adults with CVS varies between 13% and 70%. 15 75 Furthermore, 57% of adult CVS patients (with or without migraine) were reported to have a first and/or second‐degree relative with migraines or migraine variants. 75 It is unclear whether treating migraines independently improves the CVS disease course, but many medications are effective prophylactic therapies (i.e. TCAs, anti‐epileptic drugs) or abortive therapies (ie, triptans) for both conditions. Anecdotally, some committee members have observed that when CVS and migraines co‐occur, they may both respond to TCAs but at different dosages, requiring the clinician to keep titrating the dose upwards even when symptoms of one of the disorders have been abolished.

### Functional nausea and vomiting [^115fESnJ]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Medium credibility.

Although functional vomiting (FV), cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) and chronic idiopathic nausea (CIN) are fairly rare disorders, it has been increasingly recognized that these conditions can be highly disabling. Traditionally, FV, CVS and CIN have been under-investigated; however, interest in the cause and treatment of these disorders has increased, particularly with regard to their pathophysiology and the evaluation of new treatment approaches. This article presents a literature-based review of the nomenclature, pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of CIN, CVS and FV. There is a dearth of randomized, controlled trials of treatments for these disorders, owing mainly to their low prevalence. Consequently, referral centers that see a large number of patients with these challenging disorders are working together to share their experience, so that the most productive treatment strategies can be used to help patients. Our knowledge of the treatment of FV, CVS and CIN, as best we know it, is presented here.

### Vomiting [^116jNUk3]. Pediatrics in Review (2013). Low credibility.

Vomiting can be the presenting symptom of a variety of disorders, ranging from self-limited diseases to life-threatening diseases. The causes of vomiting vary with age of presentation, and pediatricians should develop the skill to identify serious conditions at the earliest stage based on the age of presentation. Bilious emesis at any age is a sign of intestinal obstruction until proven otherwise and needs immediate attention. Vomiting is not always due to a GI disorder, and pediatricians should look for causes outside the GI tract if no GI disease is identified.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome: commentary [^115XaCkV]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — recovery and emergency department (ED) care — If a patient cannot abort an episode at home, presentation to an ED for intravenous (IV) fluids and IV abortive therapy is reasonable, though many with shorter-duration attacks (ie, < 24 hours) tend to stay home and not seek ED-based care. In the recovery phase, the priority is to consume electrolyte-rich fluids (ie, sports drinks) or nutrient drinks; patients may feel nauseated or have dyspeptic symptoms but can generally tolerate moderate liquid volumes, and most patients' recovery phase lasts approximately 1–2 days. For ED management, all patients presenting with uncontrolled retching and vomiting should be treated regardless of suspicion for potential cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS); severe abdominal pain may in only the most severe refractory forms require a dose of narcotic pain medication as part of an abortive regimen, whereas non-narcotic approaches are preferable, with many patients doing best in a quiet, darker room in the ED along with IV benzodiazepines to induce sedation. All patients with CVS should receive IV dextrose-containing fluids, and most benefit from IV administration of antiemetic medication; although typically reserved for use in the ED, patients with CVS also respond to sedating antipsychotic medications (eg, droperidol and haloperidol).

Recurrent, episodic vomiting in children — diagnostic approach emphasizes that a pattern fulfilling the revised historical criteria listed in Table 1 is likely (about 90%) to be ultimately diagnosed as idiopathic CVS, while clinicians must differentiate individuals with specific and serious underlying causes of vomiting (about 10%) for which prompt treatment may alter outcomes. The principles aim to identify those with a cyclic vomiting pattern between ages 2 and 18 years at the greatest risk for having an organic cause, acknowledging that children younger than 2 years may have CVS, serious underlying metabolic and surgical disorders are more frequent and more difficult to diagnose in that age range. There are no specific laboratory markers to diagnose CVS.

### Evaluation and treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults [^115tX9y8]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that can reduce quality of life and indicate life-threatening illness. Acute nausea and vomiting last up to 7 days. In the absence of alarm symptoms, they are typically treated symptomatically and without an extensive evaluation. Typical causes include gastroenteritis or other viral syndromes, foodborne illness, acute migraine headaches, vestibular disturbances, early pregnancy, and adverse effects of medication. Chronic nausea and vomiting last 4 weeks or longer and have a broad differential diagnosis. Causes can be gastrointestinal, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or related to medications and toxins. A careful history of related factors is essential to guide the initial evaluation and narrow the differential diagnosis. These factors include associated symptoms, timing of onset and duration of symptoms, exacerbating or relieving factors, alarm symptoms, medication and substance use, relationship with recent food ingestion, and comorbidities. Nonpharmacologic management options include fluid and electrolyte replacement; small, frequent meals; and avoidance of trigger foods. Antiemetic drugs effectively reduce symptoms of acute nausea and vomiting, but chronic symptoms are often more challenging to treat. When a specific etiology is not identified, a serotonin antagonist or dopamine antagonist can be used. However, medications may also target the suspected cause of symptoms and the neurotransmitters involved in central and peripheral pathways of nausea and vomiting. Pharmacologic therapy should be used for the shortest time necessary to control symptoms.

Management — lifestyle modification for CVS includes involvement of referral and allied health services to address comorbid conditions; addressing underlying conditions with pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy or mindfulness meditation can substantially improve CVS symptoms and overall quality of life; patients should attempt to identify and mitigate or avoid CVS triggers during the inter-episodic phase, and advising patients to get regular sleep, avoid prolonged fasting, and pursue stress management are general approaches that all patients with CVS should follow.

### Acute nausea and vomiting… [^115kkQ1r]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting is a common presenting symptom in primary care. Diagnostic and management strategies vary depending on the duration of symptoms. This article addresses acute and chronic nausea and vomiting, with illustrative cases. Chronic Nausea and Vomiting ILLUSTRATIVE CASE The patient described previously returns two months later with intermittent nausea and vomiting that is much less severe than on initial presentation. Her current symptoms have lasted two days, and she has had six bouts of emesis. She has no fever, chills, or headache, but has intermittent epigastric discomfort associated with nausea and vomiting. Her symptoms are not relieved by antacids, and she has no melena or blood in her stool. She says she feels full quickly when eating and often feels bloated. She has not had contact with any sick persons or toxins, does not drink alcohol, and appears well hydrated.

38 For this patient, the chronic nature of her symptoms and the waxing and waning course suggest that the most likely cause is diabetes-associated gastroparesis. In this patient and in others with suspected gastroparesis, a gastric emptying study should be performed.
3. 40 Alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine also delay gastric emptying. Impaired gastric emptying may be treated with metoclopramide or erythromycin, which result in up to 60% improvement in symptoms. 3 However, symptom relief must be balanced against the risk of Parkinson-like symptoms or tardive dyskinesia with the use of metoclopramide and the risk of tachyphylaxis with the use of erythromycin, which limits its long-term effectiveness. Patients with gastroparesis and significant weight loss, recurrent dehydration, or electrolyte disturbances should be referred to a gastroenterologist for possible endoscopic therapies and nutritional supplementation.
40.

Gastritis is suggested by the presence of dyspepsia symptoms, including postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, or burning. Helicobacter pylori testing should be performed, 41 and, if negative, a gastric emptying study and esophagogastroduodenoscopy can be conducted, particularly if nausea and vomiting persists. Patients with dyspepsia who are not taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and who have negative H. pylori serology are unlikely to have a gastric ulcer. 42.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) treatment phases and approach — the clinical course is divided into the episode phase and the well phase; the episode phase includes the prodrome, the vomiting phase, and the recovery phase. Treatment with abortive therapy as early as possible in the prodrome or vomiting phase may terminate the attack, while full-blown vomiting prompts supportive therapy at home or in the hospital. If abortive therapy fails consistently or if episodes are frequent and/or severe, then daily prophylactic therapy to prevent subsequent episodes is recommended. Management requires an individually tailored regimen, and the 2 key treatment arms are prophylactic (or preventive) measures and medications administered between attacks, and acute and supportive interventions given during attacks.

The present guidelines are the most recent data on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and an update on the 2 previous sets of guidelines published in 2003 and 2007. These guidelines were compiled by a multidisciplinary international panel of individuals with interest and expertise in PONV under the auspices of the Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia. The panel members critically and systematically evaluated the current medical literature on PONV to provide an evidence-based reference tool for the management of adults and children who are undergoing surgery and are at increased risk for PONV. These guidelines identify patients at risk for PONV in adults and children; recommend approaches for reducing baseline risks for PONV; identify the most effective antiemetic single therapy and combination therapy regimens for PONV prophylaxis, including nonpharmacologic approaches; recommend strategies for treatment of PONV when it occurs; provide an algorithm for the management of individuals at increased risk for PONV as well as steps to ensure PONV prevention and treatment are implemented in the clinical setting.

Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea, defined as the unpleasant subjective feeling of wanting to vomit or retch, and/or vomiting, are experienced by as many as 68% of patients with cancer at some point during their illness; during the last 6 weeks of life, the prevalence of nausea and vomiting is 40% or more. Poorly controlled nausea and vomiting is associated with physical, cognitive, and psychosocial distress, and can contribute to patient and family fears of death from dehydration and/or starvation.

Nausea and vomiting secondary to antineoplastic agents or radiation therapy should be anticipated and managed according to ASCO antiemetic, or equivalent, clinical practice guidelines. The latest ASCO antiemetic update includes evidence-based recommendations and information on the appropriate use of olanzapine, neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists, and use of subcutaneous 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists.

Much less trial evidence is available for the use of antiemetics in patients with advanced cancer and nausea and vomiting unrelated to antineoplastic agents or radiation therapy. Instead, an etiologic or mechanism-based approach to choosing an antiemetic is commonly recommended. This approach requires clinicians to take a detailed history and perform a focused examination to determine the most likely underlying cause(s) of the patient's nausea and vomiting. In the advanced cancer population, the most common underlying causes of nausea and vomiting are chemical abnormalities (eg, renal or liver failure, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia); drugs (eg, opioids, antidepressants, antibiotics); infection; and impaired gastric emptying, as well as visceral and serosal causes of delayed gastrointestinal transit (bowel obstruction, gastric bleed, enteritis, constipation). - Once the most likely underlying cause of the patient's nausea and vomiting is determined, an appropriate antiemetic can then be selected based on the pathophysiology and receptors implicated (Table 1).

### Initial check… [^112M4LKT]. atsdr.cdc.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Initial Check This initial check will help you assess your current knowledge about carbon tetrachloride toxicity. To take the initial check, read the case below and then answer the questions that follow. A hazardous waste worker has delayed-onset abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. As the physician on duty at a hospital emergency department in an urban community, you are notified that an ambulance is bringing three hazardous waste workers-two males and a female -directly from their worksite to your emergency room. All three workers are complaining of.
- headache,
- dizziness, and
- nausea. You learn that the workers were handling several dozen barrels of a sweet-smelling hazardous waste liquid in a hot, unventilated room. Their work required taking samples from barrels obtained from a defunct chlorofluorocarbon manufacturing plant. All three workers were initially wearing full-face respirators and protective clothing.

However, the younger of the two males removed his respirator early in the day. He said he had a hangover with nausea and felt it was easier to work without being hampered by the respirator. The other two workers continued in full protective gear. After 3–4 hours, all three workers began to experience headache, dizziness, and nausea and notified their supervisor. Six hours later, while still in the ED, the younger male becomes acutely ill. He has
- abdominal pain,
- nausea,
- vomiting, and
- diarrhea. His rectal temperature is now 101∘F, pulse 140/minute, and he has become disoriented and drowsy. Two days after hospital admission, he still has an elevated temperature and abnormal laboratory test results, as follows:

- Prothrombin time – 15 seconds. Urinalysis reveals 2+ proteinuria, and urine output has decreased, despite intravenous hydration.
- How will you identify the material to which the workers have been exposed.
- You discuss the acute exposures with the workers' company supervisor. He suspects that the waste barrels contain carbon tetrachloride (CCl.
- Immediate follow-up for the acutely ill patient includes monitoring liver and kidney function for up to 2 weeks. You should also periodically evaluate the patient's cardiac and pulmonary systems and clotting ability; abnormalities can occur secondary to hepatic and renal damage.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Overview

Study details are presented in Table 2 a, b and summarized for each PICO question in the accompanying evidence profiles. The team acknowledges the limited evidence for CVS with few randomized control trials or high‐quality observational studies leaving us with low‐ or very low‐quality certainty in the evidence across outcomes. Given the paucity of literature on the topic, studies of all populations (adult and pediatric) were included with the assumption that the pathophysiology of CVS was similar in adults and adolescents, and that the effects of the various interventions may be generalizable across some populations. Finally, there was variability in criteria used to diagnose CVS, medication exposures (eg, dosage and length of treatment) that were not consistently reported, and variable definitions for "response to treatment" used by authors across studies.

### Update on the evaluation and management of functional dyspepsia [^115GhGa4]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia affects up to 40 percent of adults each year and is often diagnosed as functional (nonulcer) dyspepsia. The defining symptoms are postprandial fullness, early satiation, or epigastric pain or burning in the absence of causative structural disease. These symptoms may coexist with symptoms of functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as anxiety and depression. The history and physical examination can help identify other possible causes of the symptoms. Warning signs of serious disease, such as cancer, are unintended weight loss, progressive dysphagia, persistent vomiting, evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, and a family history of cancer. In these cases, more extensive laboratory investigation, imaging, and endoscopy should be considered as clinically indicated. During the initial evaluation, a test-and-treat strategy to identify and eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection is more effective than empiric treatment and more cost-effective than initial endoscopy. Eradication of H. pylori helps one out of 15 patients with functional dyspepsia diagnosed by endoscopy, but may not be cost-effective. Treatment options that may be beneficial for functional dyspepsia include histamine H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetic agents. Although psychotropic medications and psychological interventions have no proven benefit in patients with functional dyspepsia, they are appropriate for treating common psychiatric comorbidities.

Despite this, the committee members including the patient representative unanimously agreed that TCAs are extremely effective prophylaxis in CVS based on their collective experience and made a strong recommendation for its use. The committee acknowledged that conducting a RCT would be difficult due to lack of funding and potential difficulties with recruitment for the control arm, rendering the availability of high‐quality evidence difficult to obtain in the future. Further, side effects associated with AT would make it difficult to blind patients to the drug vs. placebo, which may skew the results of RCTs in favor of a response to AT

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome [^115EG8eD]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a disorder noted for its unique intensity of vomiting, repeated emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and reduced quality of life. It is often misdiagnosed due to the unappreciated pattern of recurrence and lack of confirmatory testing. Because no accepted approach to management has been established, the task force was charged to develop a report on diagnosis and treatment of CVS based upon a review of the medical literature and expert opinion. The key issues addressed were the diagnostic criteria, the appropriate evaluation, the prophylactic therapy, and the therapy of acute attacks. The recommended diagnostic approach is to avoid "shotgun" testing and instead to use a strategy of targeted testing that varies with the presence of 4 red flags: abdominal signs (eg, bilious vomiting, tenderness), triggering events (eg, fasting, high protein meal), abnormal neurological examination (eg, altered mental status, papilledema), and progressive worsening or a changing pattern of vomiting episodes. Therapeutic recommendations include lifestyle changes, prophylactic therapy (eg, cyproheptadine in children 5 years or younger and amitriptyline for those older than 5), and acute therapy (eg, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists, termed triptans herein, as abortive therapy, and 10% dextrose and ondansetron for those requiring intravenous hydration). This document represents the official recommendations of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition for the diagnosis and treatment of CVS in children and adolescents.

The differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting is extensive and the underlying cause can be difficult to diagnose. Treatment of nausea and vomiting also can be unsatisfactory because the available pharmacotherapy does not correct the fundamental underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities. In contrast, the diagnosis of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy generally is straightforward. Almost 80% of women have some degree of nausea in the first trimester of pregnancy, and the diagnosis of pregnancy is established easily by the patient or physician. The spectrum varies from mild nausea to hyperemesis gravidarum. Various treatment approaches are addressed.

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview

This evidence review was developed using the GRADE framework to develop clinically focused questions, and identify, synthesize, and evaluate the quality of the supporting evidence to inform a recommendation. 3

2.2 Formulation of clinical questions

Through an iterative process, the panel developed focused clinical questions on the role of specific therapeutics in the management of CVS. The PICO format was used which frames a clinical question by defining a specific population (P), intervention (I), comparator (C), and outcomes (O) (Table 1). The population was adult patients with CVS. The intervention was one of numerous therapies used in CVS. The preferred comparator was placebo. Relevant patient‐centered outcomes were considered and rated in terms of importance. All PICO questions formed the basis for a literature search which is detailed below.

Table 1
PICO questions

2.3 Outcomes

Outcomes were grouped into two broad categories for prophylactic and abortive therapies. We arrived at a consensus as to what measurements would be acceptable for each outcome. Outcomes were rated by the group on a scale of 1 (not important) to 9 (critically important) for medical decision making. It was understood that data on all outcomes would not be available in the published literature.

3.3.6 Areas of limited/insufficient evidence

Three recommendations (recommendations 7, 9, and 10) that are presented in the accompanying manuscript were deemed consensus recommendations and no GRADE evidence profile was created. Recommendation 7 addresses the role of 5‐HT3 antagonists, such as ondansetron, as abortive therapy for CVS. Acknowledging the lack of direct evidence to inform this clinical question, the committee relied on indirect evidence on the efficacy of ondansetron in patients with chemotherapy‐induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in treating acute, delayed, and anticipatory nausea and vomiting to inform the recommendation. For recommendations 9 and 10, there was insufficient evidence in the published literature examining the role of screening and treatment of co‐morbid conditions on CVS symptoms and the effects of complementary therapies on CVS symptoms. For these two recommendations, the committee made consensus‐based recommendations based on their large collective experience of managing adult and pediatric CVS patients and their observations in clinical practice as well as the recognition that the treatment of CVS, a functional disorder, should be based on a biopsychosocial care model, integrating lifestyle modification, prophylactic, and/or abortive medications, and evidenced‐based psychotherapy to address psychiatric co‐morbidity. Finally, the guideline also includes consensus statements that address the diagnosis and workup of CVS patients as well as a narrative review and sample protocol for treatment of CVS patients in the ED.

6 CONCLUSIONS

Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a condition that challenges both patients and healthcare providers alike due to the considerable morbidity and misery associated with it and the lack of a clear understanding of pathophysiology and robust therapeutic evidence required to advance treatment. The 10 recommendations, the consensus statement, and treatment algorithms provided aim to bridge the gap between our current knowledge of CVS and how we can best help patients until we have a more complete understanding of this complex condition. Other sections in this special supplement on CVS include a more detailed discussion of CHS, pathophysiology, gaps in knowledge, and future research directions.

### Evaluation of nausea and vomiting [^111GcL98]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally are the result of infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathologic response to any of a variety of conditions. Gastrointestinal etiologies include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases. Central nervous system etiologies are primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure, and typically cause other neurologic signs. Pregnancy is the most common endocrinologic cause of nausea and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age. Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses also may cause nausea and vomiting. Evaluation should first focus on detecting any emergencies or complications that require hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies. When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.

Table 3
Proposed data collection sheet for cyclic vomiting syndrome

Fleischer et al 75 described patterns of coalescence with CVS wherein over a period of time, the duration of individual episodes gets longer while asymptomatic intervals shorten, eventually leading to a pattern that resembles chronic daily vomiting. In others, chronic daily nausea becomes superimposed on acute vomiting episodes resulting in continuous symptomatology and disability. Encountering a patient in a coalescent phase of their illness presents a diagnostic challenge as the illness may not be recognizable as CVS by most clinicians. When the typical episodic pattern is lost (often occurring over years), a careful history focusing on symptoms at the onset of the disorder is important to make an accurate diagnosis, as most patients endorse a discernable cyclic pattern that was part of the initial presentation.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) triggers and symptomatic behaviors are dominated by stress, which has been confirmed in approximately 70%–80% of patients, while other triggers include sleep deprivation, hormonal fluctuations linked with phases of the menstrual cycle, travel, motion sickness, acute infections or surgery, with less common triggers such as prolonged fasting or intense exercise; providers should help patients recognize triggers and develop strategies to eliminate or mitigate them. Hot water bathing or showering is common in the prodromal and emetic phases and provides temporary relief, with approximately 48% of patients with CVS who do not use cannabis finding relief; this behavior is not pathognomonic for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), may also be observed in chronic nausea vomiting syndrome, and prolonged exposure can lead to burns from hot water.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome: commentary [^111oNUsD]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — diagnosis and clinical features emphasize recognition of a chronic disorder of gut–brain interaction characterized by acute episodes of nausea, vomiting, and retching, separated in time by episode-free periods. In essence, a clinician should consider CVS as a potential diagnosis in any adult presenting with the core clinical feature of episodic bouts of repetitive vomiting. CVS has 4 distinct phases — inter-episodic, prodromal, emetic, and recovery — each of which is associated with a distinct treatment approach and management goal. Like other disorders of gut–brain interaction, CVS is diagnosed on the basis of clinical criteria, as established by the Rome Foundation. The hallmark of CVS is recurrent, acute episodes of nausea and retching, and although most patients meet Rome IV criteria, there is a wide range of presentations and clinical severity seen in clinical practice. First, many patients (approximately 65%) with CVS experience prodromal symptoms, lasting a median of 1 hour, before the onset of vomiting. Third, abdominal pain is present in most patients during a CVS episode and thus, this symptom should not preclude a diagnosis of CVS. Finally, although CVS episodes can present at any time of day, most episodes tend to occur in the early morning hours.

### Nausea and vomiting in 2021: a comprehensive update [^114x4g6f]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Goal

A comprehensive review of treatments for nausea and vomiting (N/V).

Background

N/V are common symptoms encountered in medicine. While most cases of acute N/V related to a specific cause can be straightforward to manage, other cases of acute N/V such as chemotherapy-induced N/V and especially chronic unexplained N/V can be difficult to control, leading to a significant decline in the patient's quality of life and increased cost of medical care from repeated hospitalizations.

Study

Traditional management has relied on pharmacotherapy which may be inadequate in a certain proportion of these patients. Many of the medications used in the management of N/V have significant side effect profiles making the need for new and improved interventions of great importance.

Results

This review covers a broad review of the pathophysiology of N/V, pharmacotherapy, including safety concerns and controversies with established pharmaceuticals, newer immunotherapies, bioelectrical neuromodulation (including gastric electrical stimulation), behavioral and surgical therapies, and complementary medicine.

Conclusion

On the basis of emerging understandings of the pathophysiology of N/V, improved therapies are becoming available.

### Diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome: a critical review [^112DmqZG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a chronic disorder of gut-brain interaction characterized by recurrent disabling episodes of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. CVS affects both children and adults with a prevalence of approximately 2% in the United States. CVS is more common in female individuals and affects all races. The pathophysiology of CVS is unknown and a combination of genetic, environmental, autonomic, and neurohormonal factors is believed to play a role. CVS is also closely associated with migraine headaches and likely have a shared pathophysiology. The diagnosis of CVS is based on the Rome criteria, and minimal recommended testing includes an upper endoscopy and imaging studies of the abdomen. CVS is frequently associated with anxiety, depression, and autonomic dysfunction. Patients with CVS commonly use cannabis therapeutically for symptom relief. By contrast, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is believed to be a subset of CVS with chronic heavy cannabis use leading to hyperemesis. Due to the recalcitrant nature of the illness, patients often visit the emergency department and are hospitalized for acute CVS flares. Guidelines on the management of CVS recommend a biopsychosocial approach. Prophylactic therapy consists of tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline), antiepileptics (topiramate), and aprepitant in refractory patients. Abortive therapy consists of triptans, antiemetics (ondansetron), and sedation. Treatment of comorbid conditions is extremely important to improve overall patient outcomes. CVS has a significant negative impact on patients, families, and the healthcare system, and future research to understand its pathophysiology and develop targeted therapies is needed.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a chronic, debilitating illness that is characterized by recurrent episodes of intense nausea and vomiting. Although the true prevalence of CVS in adults in the general population remains uncertain, it is not a rare disorder. A recent population‐based study noted that the US prevalence was 2% among adults, mirroring prevalence estimates in children. 1 Another estimated that ~10% of outpatients presenting to a tertiary gastroenterology clinic met the Rome III criteria for the illness; 2 however, even in this clinical setting, CVS was considered as a potential diagnosis in only a small minority of these patients. This finding highlights the poor recognition of CVS in adults by clinicians, with many patients continuing to suffer for several years before receiving a diagnosis of CVS. Concerted messaging and increased awareness campaigns should minimize this clinical recognition gap. Recognizing CVS in adults is critical, as there are several fairly effective prophylactic and abortive therapies to treat the disorder.

This evidence review represents a foundational effort by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society (ANMS) and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association (CVSA) to develop recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to provide a robust guideline for best practices in the management of CVS. This review addresses focused clinical questions on the use of pharmacologic agents for prophylactic and abortive therapies for the management of patients with CVS and was used to inform the development of the accompanying clinical practice guidelines. Panel members were selected by the CVS guideline committee task chair (T.V.), co‐chair (B.L.), and former ANMS council member (B.M.) and the CVSA based on their clinical and methodological expertise. All members of the panel underwent a thorough vetting process for potential conflicts of interest.

Key Points

Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a chronic disorder of gut–brain interaction and should be managed based on a biopsychosocial model of care.
Guidelines recommend both prophylactic and abortive medications in their treatment based on disease severity.
However, there is a lack of CVS‐specific tools to assess disease severity and patient‐reported outcomes.
The development of such tools is critical to conducting future trials in cyclic vomiting syndrome and to advancing the care of these patients.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) medication context and family support — despite the absence of US Food and Drug Administration–approved medications for use in children with CVS, recommendations include off-label use; in pediatrics overall, more than 70% of prescribed medications lack pediatric approval. Families face repeated misdiagnoses (mean time to diagnosis 2.6 years) and should be strongly encouraged to obtain information from available sources, seek consultation with a pediatric specialist familiar with CVS, and contact the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association.
