## Question

28-year-old woman with 3 months of episodic squeezing chest pain not related to exertion; normal vitals and office ECG; 24-hour monitoring shows transient ST elevations during episodes that resolve completely.

A 28-year-old female comes to the physician's office with a complaint of episodic chest pain. She describes the pain as squeezing and tightness in her chest. This pain has been happening every few days for 3 months. She says there is no association of the pain with food or exercise. She is able to climb up to her fourth floor apartment daily without issue. Her only past medical history is migraines for which she takes appropriate medication. Here temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. She has no known family history. The patient is not in pain on presentation and EKG in the office is normal. 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely. The mechanism of this patient's chest pain is most similar to the mechanism behind which of the following?

Answer Choices:
A. Raynaud's phenomenon
B. Myocardial infarction
C. Aortic dissection
D. Costochondritis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which mechanism best explains episodic, non-exertional chest pain with transient ST-segment elevation in a 28-year-old woman with migraines, and to choose among Raynaud's phenomenon, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and costochondritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical syndrome and whether it fits vasospastic angina. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of vasospastic angina and how it maps to the options. Next, I will examine each alternative choice and check for mismatches in mechanism, epidemiology, or ECG findings. Finally, I will confirm the best match and briefly note implications for management and medication review, especially triptans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. Episodic chest pain at rest with transient ST-segment elevation that resolves spontaneously is classic for vasospastic (Prinzmetal) angina, which reflects reversible coronary artery spasm with transient ischemia rather than fixed obstruction or infarction. This fits the vignette precisely, including the young age and female sex, as vasospasm can occur in patients with angiographically normal coronaries and is a recognized cause of MINOCA in younger adults [^114Am6o1] [^112fC8S3].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before I jump to conclusions. Vasospastic angina is driven by abnormal vascular smooth muscle reactivity, endothelial dysfunction, and autonomic imbalance, producing transient epicardial coronary constriction with ischemia and ST elevation that reverses with nitrates or calcium channel blockade. This is mechanistically distinct from plaque rupture with thrombosis, which causes persistent ischemia and myocyte necrosis, i.e., myocardial infarction, and would not show complete spontaneous resolution of ST elevation without reperfusion therapy [^114Am6o1] [^11794PWA].

> I will now examine Raynaud's phenomenon as a candidate. Raynaud's shares a vasospastic mechanism in the digital arterioles, typically triggered by cold or emotional stress, with reversible ischemia and color change. This is the closest pathophysiologic parallel to coronary vasospasm among the choices, even though the organ system differs. Hold on, I should verify that the question is asking for the most similar mechanism, not the same organ system, which supports Raynaud's as the best match here.

> Next, I should review myocardial infarction. MI reflects irreversible myocyte injury from prolonged ischemia due to plaque rupture and thrombosis; it is not transient and would not show complete spontaneous resolution of ST elevation without reperfusion, so the mechanism is fundamentally different from the vignette's reversible ischemia. I initially thought MI might be tempting because of the ST elevation, but wait, that would be a mistake because the ECG changes here are transient and the pain is non-exertional, which argues against MI as the mechanism match [^112fpq23] [^114Am6o1].

> Let me consider aortic dissection. Dissection causes severe, tearing pain from a structural intimal tear with false lumen propagation; it does not produce transient ST-segment elevation from reversible ischemia, and the mechanism is mechanical rather than vasomotor, so this is a poor fit for the described syndrome.

> I should double-check costochondritis. Costochondritis is musculoskeletal inflammation of costosternal joints; it produces reproducible, positional, localized pain without ischemia or ECG changes, so it cannot explain transient ST elevation and is not a vascular mechanism, making it incompatible with the vignette.

> But wait, what if the migraine history is a clue to a shared vasospastic propensity? Migraine is associated with endothelial dysfunction and a vasoreactive phenotype, and triptans can precipitate coronary vasospasm in susceptible patients; this biologic plausibility reinforces that the underlying mechanism here is vasospasm rather than atherosclerotic plaque rupture or nonvascular causes, aligning with vasospastic angina and, by extension, Raynaud's as the closest mechanistic analogue among the options [^1148ve8S] [^116jBQhk] [^112fC8S3].

> Final answer: A. Raynaud's phenomenon, because both reflect reversible vasospasm with transient ischemia in response to triggers, even though the affected vascular beds differ. The other choices either represent irreversible injury (MI), structural disease (aortic dissection), or non-ischemic pain (costochondritis) and do not match the transient, ischemic, vasospastic mechanism seen here [^114Am6o1].

---

The correct answer is **A. Raynaud's phenomenon**. The patient's episodic chest pain with transient ST elevation is most consistent with **coronary artery vasospasm** (Prinzmetal's angina), which shares a pathophysiologic mechanism with Raynaud's phenomenon — both involve **reversible vasospasm** of smooth muscle in response to triggers such as cold, stress, or autonomic imbalance [^114Am6o1] [^117Wy8M9]. Myocardial infarction is incorrect because it reflects irreversible ischemia from plaque rupture and thrombosis, not transient spasm [^112fpq23]. Aortic dissection is a structural emergency with different ECG findings, and costochondritis is musculoskeletal and non-ischemic [^116tBrdG].

## Pathophysiological mechanism of the patient's chest pain

The patient's presentation — episodic, non-exertional chest pain with transient ST elevation that resolves spontaneously — is classic for **vasospastic angina** (Prinzmetal's angina), caused by reversible coronary artery spasm with transient myocardial ischemia [^114Am6o1]. Key features include:

- **Transient ST elevation**: Reflects transient ischemia from spasm, resolving with relaxation of the vessel [^11794PWA].
- **Non-exertional pain**: Typically occurs at rest, often at night or early morning, aligning with autonomic fluctuations [^116KM47L].
- **Normal coronaries**: Frequently seen on angiography, supporting a functional rather than fixed obstructive process [^114Am6o1].

---

## Comparison with Raynaud's phenomenon

Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by **episodic vasospasm of digital arteries**, causing color changes and ischemic symptoms in response to cold or stress. The underlying mechanism — reversible vasospasm of smooth muscle — is analogous to coronary vasospasm in Prinzmetal's angina [^notfound]. Both involve:

- **Vascular smooth muscle hyperreactivity**: Exaggerated constriction to stimuli [^114Am6o1].
- **Autonomic dysregulation**: Sympathetic overactivity contributing to spasm [^114Am6o1].
- **Endothelial dysfunction**: Impaired vasodilation amplifying spasm [^114Am6o1].

Thus, the mechanism of this patient's chest pain is most similar to **Raynaud's phenomenon** because both reflect reversible vasospasm rather than structural obstruction or irreversible injury.

---

## Why the other options are incorrect

| **Option** | **Reason for incorrectness** |
|-|-|
| B. Myocardial infarction | MI reflects irreversible ischemia from plaque rupture and thrombosis, not transient spasm; ECG shows persistent ST elevation and troponin rise [^112fpq23] [^111nTTLT] |
| C. Aortic dissection | A structural emergency with different ECG findings (e.g. diffuse ST depression from ischemia) and clinical picture; not transient spasm [^notfound] |
| D. Costochondritis | Musculoskeletal pain without ischemia or ECG changes; non-ischemic and unrelated to vasospasm [^116tBrdG] |

---

## Clinical implications and management considerations

Given the likely diagnosis of vasospastic angina, management focuses on:

- **Calcium channel blockers and nitrates**: First-line to prevent and relieve spasm [^114Am6o1].
- **Avoid triggers**: Cold, stress, and vasoconstrictive drugs (e.g. triptans) can precipitate spasm [^116jBQhk].
- **Coronary angiography**: Recommended to exclude fixed disease and confirm diagnosis in patients with transient ST elevation [^115epr3u].

---

The patient's episodic chest pain with transient ST elevation is best explained by **coronary vasospasm**, which shares a reversible vasospastic mechanism with Raynaud's phenomenon, making **A. Raynaud's phenomenon** the correct choice.

### Chest pain evaluation: updated guidelines from the AHA / ACC… [^1158u1Hw]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Initial Evaluation Chest pain can present as pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw and less commonly as shortness of breath, nausea, or fatigue without pain. Chest pain is considered acute with new onset or if it involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration; it is considered stable if it is chronic with unchanging triggers such as exertion or emotional stress. Patients commonly describe ischemic chest pain as pressure, squeezing, heaviness, tightness, exertional, stress-related, or retrosternal. Pain that is sharp, fleeting, pleuritic, positional, or shifting locations is less likely to be of cardiac origin. These guidelines suggest describing chest pain as cardiac; possible cardiac; or noncardiac. The descriptor atypical is no longer used because it can be interpreted by patients as being benign.

Physical examination can sometimes demonstrate life-threatening causes of chest pain, including diaphoresis and tachypnea suggesting ACS, tachycardia and dyspnea suggesting pulmonary embolism, and subcutaneous emphysema suggesting esophageal rupture. Chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration suggests a noncardiac etiology. Exercise can be used for any patient who is not frail and can achieve at least five metabolic equivalents, which is required to do many activities of daily living. Patients who cannot meet both requirements should receive pharmacologic stress testing. Exercise ECG testing should be avoided in patients with ECG findings of 0. 5-mm ST depression, left ventricular hypertrophy, paced rhythm, left bundle branch block, Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern, or digitalis use. Exercise ECG testing is equally predictive of future events as stress imaging, despite lower sensitivity for obstruction.

Failure to exceed five metabolic equivalents or to achieve 85% of predicted heart rate suggests a poor prognosis, whereas exceeding 10 metabolic equivalents confers a low risk of cardiac events. Positive exercise ECG results can be further clarified by CCTA or functional fractional reserve testing. For patients without known CAD at intermediate risk, CCTA is recommended with a negative or inconclusive ACS workup and for patients with a mildly abnormal stress test within the past year. CCTA allows for rapid diagnosis and discharge with similar outcomes as stress testing. CCTA decreases time to diagnosis by 50% compared with nuclear stress testing. Negative stress testing rules out the need for anatomic testing. Exercise ECG testing and stress echocardiography are most likely to reduce length of stay.

### Migraine headache: an under-appreciated risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women [^1148ve8S]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Migraine headache is a common, chronic disorder, and women comprise two thirds of patients with this disorder, that has negative effects on health and is costly for patients and society. 1, 2 There is accumulating evidence linking migraine, particularly with aura, to increased risk for cardiovascular events. 3 Given the high prevalence of this condition and the fact it affects younger women, 1 it is important to educate cardiovascular disease (CVD) providers about the potential increased cardiovascular risk associated with migraine. In this review, an overview is provided of epidemiological studies linking migraine headache and cardiovascular events, with emphasis on women, and the possible pathophysiological mechanisms for this association. However, there are many important knowledge gaps on the sex‐related aspects of migraine that potentially impact advances in management. An additional purpose of this document is to summarize these areas and provide recommendations to address these gaps.

Briefly, migraine (ie, episodic migraine) is characterized by moderate to severe headache, with or without transient focal neurology symptoms (eg, aura) that persists ≈4 to 72 hours. 4 Approximately 1 in 3 patients with migraine experience aura, which may be visual (eg, lights), auditory (eg, noises), somatosensory (eg, tingling and numbness), or motor (eg, jerking movements). 5 Typically, aura precedes the onset of headache and persists for less than an hour. 6 There is variation in the number of attacks between patients: some experience multiple attacks weekly while others experience < 1 per year. There is also wide variation in the frequency of episodes within the same individual, and often the condition improves with advancing age. Patients who experience several attacks monthly (ie, ≥ 15 headache days a month) are classified as having chronic migraine. 7, 8

Worldwide, migraine is the third most prevalent medical condition and second most disabling neurological disorder. 9 In the United States, its annual prevalence is ≈1 in 8 adults. 1, 2 Migraine usually affects young‐ to middle‐aged women (25–55 years old). 1 Although the prevalence of migraine is generally low before puberty (≈2.5%) and is similar in boys and girls, 10 the prevalence increases in girls at about 10 years of age versus boys. 2, 10 The prevalence continues to rise in women versus men (18% versus 6%), peaking at about 30 years old. 2 The prevalence decreases after age 42 years in both sexes, but remains 2 times higher in women. 2

### Prinzmetal-variant angina in a patient using zolmitriptan and citalopram [^112fC8S3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Prinzmetal-variant angina is a syndrome of chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia secondary to reversible coronary artery vasospasm, which may occur in angiographically normal and diseased coronary arteries. It typically occurs at rest and is accompanied by transient ST-segment elevation. Although the underlying pathophysiology is not well established, coronary spasm secondary to increased serotonergic activity as well as increased sympathetic activity may prevail. Coronary artery spasm can be invoked by antimigraine therapy and also by drugs having serotonergic activity such as ergonovine and ergotamine. Prinzmetal-variant angina may be complicated with acute myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias as well as sudden cardiac death. We report a case of 48-year old woman presenting with chest pain and diffuse ST-segment elevation on electrocardiography during an episode of angina, while she was taking zolmitriptan 5 mg/d and citalopram 20 mg/d for migraine and depression, respectively. Coronary angiography (performed because of prolonged angina and presence of diffuse ST-segment elevation on electrocardiography) revealed that diffuse narrowing of left anterior descending coronary artery alleviated after intracoronary nitrate therapy. The most likely cause of myocardial infarction was coronary artery spasm because of the possible increased serotonergic activity secondary to concomitant use of zolmitriptan and citalopram.

### Cardiac cephalalgia: severe, non-exertional headache presenting as unstable angina [^112fM7U8]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiac cephalalgia is a migraine-like headache that occurs during episodes of myocardial ischaemia. Clinical characteristics of the headache vary widely but are often severe in intensity, worsen with reduced myocardial perfusion and resolve with reperfusion. It can present along with typical symptoms of angina pectoris, although not always. We present a 64-year-old man with a 6-month history of severe, non-exertional headaches occurring with increasing frequency. A resting ECG showed ST elevation in the inferior leads. His serum troponin I was not elevated. Coronary angiography showed severe stenosis of his right coronary artery, which was successfully stented by percutaneous coronary intervention. He remains headache free at 2-year follow-up.

4 Conclusion

Our cases highlight the necessity of considering ACS and chronic stable angina in patients who present with atypical symptoms, such as headaches, particularly in those experiencing exertional triggers or possessing cardiovascular risk factors. Atypical ischaemic symptoms may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, potentially resulting in adverse outcomes. Early recognition through appropriate diagnostic investigations is vital for timely management.

### Prevalence and clinical factors of migraine in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^11299ynv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Migraine headaches are frequent in SCAD, and this observation raises the question of a possible underlying vascular propensity to injury, potentially modified by hormonal or genetic factors, as other vascular studies have hypothesized. Migraineurs with SCAD are more likely to report a history of depression and recurrent chest pain at 1 month but do not appear to be at higher risk for recurrent SCAD at 5 years. As SCAD research continues, further investigation into this newly characterized association between migraine and SCAD may significantly impact our understanding of mechanisms of disease and clinical management decisions, particularly related to systemic vascular abnormalities, recurrent angina, mood disorders, and migraine medications.

Cardiac cephalgia

Cardiac cephalgia is a rare exertional headache secondary to cardiac ischaemia and responds to treatment of the cardiac ischaemia. The entity is now recognised in the Appendix of the ICHD. A recent 2017 review of the case reports (n = 35) found that there was a male preponderance with mean age of onset of 62 years. Half of the cases were precipitated by exertion, sexual activity and emotional fluctuation. The clinical syndrome was of a bilateral or unilateral headache, with or without typically migrainous features but severe in 33 of the patients. Only half presented with characteristics associated with cardiac ischaemia, such as chest pain or tightness, palpitations and dyspnoea. The headache settled with rest and could be eased by anti-anginal treatment such as nitroglycerine spray. This is a particularly useful indicator, given that in headaches of a similar phenotype, namely migraine and tension-type headache, nitroglycerine precipitates the headache. Most cases had an abnormal baseline ECG and elevated cardiac enzymes. Of those who had indicators for cardiac ischemia, three had a normal baseline ECG, one a normal exercise stress test and two normal angiography.

### Stunned and hibernating myocardium: where are we nearly 4 decades later? [^11686kk4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conditions That May Be Caused By Stunned Myocardium

Several recent reports have suggested that certain conditions whose exact cause remains to be determined, may be a manifestation of stunned myocardium. While the original description of stunned myocardium describes prolonged return of function after relief of a discrete episode of ischemia, these conditions may, but have not been unequivocally shown to, reflect ischemia followed by relief of ischemia. Therefore, it is safer at this point to state that these conditions may be, rather than definitively are, manifestations of stunning.

Stress cardiomyopathy or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Table 2) is one such example. This entity is characterized by chest pain, dyspnea, signs of ischemia on ECG (including transient ST‐segment–elevation and T‐wave inversion), elevated cardiac enzymes, transient LV apical ballooning with sparing of the basal portion of the left ventricle, and exclusion of significant organic stenosis in the coronary arteries. The circumferential nature of the transient LV wall motion abnormalities extend beyond the distribution of a single epicardial coronary artery, suggesting that, unlike most acute MIs, an occlusion in a single coronary artery cannot explain the extent of the wall motion abnormality. 27 Takotsubo cardiomyopathy often occurs in postmenopausal women and is preceded by emotional stress. This disease may account for up to 1% to 2% of all patients hospitalized with the initial diagnosis of acute ST‐segment–elevation MI. Because the LV dysfunction usually resolves in about 2 to 5 weeks, an element of stunned myocardium has been implicated. 28, 29 However, as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is usually associated with elevations of cardiac enzymes, it is likely that once the acute episode is resolved, there is a mix of irreversibly injured cells (that die) as well as reversibly injured cells that survive. The cause of the apical ballooning is likely ischemia, but the exact mechanism is still debated. Coronary angiography usually does not show classic atherosclerotic narrowing. The arteries are often patent, suggesting elements of coronary artery vasospasm, perhaps microvascular spasm, or plaque rupture with spontaneous thrombolysis. Adrenergic hyperactivity or a sympathetic storm following stress may play a role and contribute to coronary artery spasm, damage cardiomyocytes by calcium overload, cause disorders of myocardial fatty acid metabolism, and contribute to atherosclerotic plaque rupture with subsequent spontaneous thrombolysis. 30 Postmenopausal low estrogen levels have also been implicated. That Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is often associated with emotional stress is exemplified by recent reports linking it to the emotional stress associated with earthquakes. 31 In experimental models, the administration of high doses of isoproterenol (to mimic adrenergic hyperactivity/sympathetic storm) has been used to study Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. In one study, our group observed that rats exposed to isoproterenol exhibited LV apical akinesis, with preservation of contractile motion in the basal portion of the left ventricle. Histologic and ultrastructural analysis at 24 hours exhibited a mix of necrotic cells plus reversibly injured myocytes showing vacuolization, lipid droplets, damaged mitochondria, and edema. Mononuclear cell infiltration was also observed. On day 8 after exposure, the apical akinesis fully resolved by echocardiographic analysis. Histologic analysis at day 8 revealed foci of both necrosis and fibrosis plus areas of viable tissue in the apical regions. 32 Thus, the fact that viable tissue in the apex is present at 8 days and the function of the apex largely recovered after the initial insult on day 1 supports the concept that stunned myocardium plays a major role in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

3 Discussion

Headache is an extremely rare but clinically significant presenting symptom of ACS and chronic stable angina. While chest pain remains the hallmark symptom of ischaemic heart disease (IHD), atypical presentations, including headaches, can delay diagnosis and management. The cases presented highlight two distinct manifestations of IHD: ACS and chronic stable angina. In both cases, headache was the primary or predominant symptom, highlighting the importance of a broad differential diagnosis in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or accompanying symptoms.

The underlying mechanisms linking headache to MI remain incompletely understood. Several hypotheses have been proposed:
1 Autonomic dysfunction: MI triggers autonomic responses, leading to symptoms such as diaphoresis, nausea, and headache. This autonomic response may be mediated by increased sympathetic activation and catecholamine release, which could contribute to vascular headache mechanisms similar to those seen in migraine pathophysiology.
2 Referred pain: Cardiac pain can be referred to non‐thoracic regions, including the head, due to shared neural pathways between the heart and upper cervical sensory fibers. This may explain why some patients with MI experience headaches rather than or in addition to chest pain.
3 Endothelial dysfunction and vascular dysregulation: CAD involves endothelial dysfunction and reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, potentially affecting cerebral vasculature and predisposing patients to headaches.
4 Exercise‐induced hyper‐perfusion and vasodilation: In patients with fixed coronary stenoses, exertion‐induced ischaemia can lead to systemic hemodynamic changes, potentially affecting cerebral blood flow and leading to exertional headaches.

These cases suggest that an ischaemic cardiac aetiology should be considered in patients presenting with unexplained headaches, particularly exertional or pressure‐like headaches, especially in those with cardiovascular risk factors. This aligns with previous reports where headaches, including migraine‐like symptoms, have been associated with silent MI or ACS. Timely recognition and treatment of headache‐predominant ACS and chronic stable angina are crucial for preventing adverse outcomes. Our cases reinforce the importance of early cardiac assessment, including ECG and further imaging or stress testing, to rule out MI. Coronary revascularisation successfully alleviated symptoms in both patients, further supporting the causal relationship between ischaemia and headache.

These cases highlight headaches as an atypical but important presentation of MI. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for ACS and chronic stable angina in patients with exertional or unexplained headaches, particularly in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors or atypical chest discomfort. Further studies are needed better to characterize the relationship between headaches and IHD, potentially leading to improved diagnostic strategies and earlier intervention for affected patients.

### Chest pain in a young female [^117XtwNx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a common diagnosis in the emergency department (ED), the most severe manifestation of which is ST elevation on electrocardiogram (ECG). ST elevation reflects obstruction of flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly due to coronary atherosclerotic plaque rupture. However, alternative causes of coronary obstruction causing ST elevation are possible. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an unusual cause of ST elevation in ED patients which providers may encounter in patients without traditional atherosclerosis risk factors. Patients presenting with SCAD as a cause of ST elevation require unique management from traditional ACS. Here we report a case of a 43 year old female presenting with chest pain and unusual ECG findings including accelerated idioventricular rhythm followed by subtle ST segment elevation and resolution of abnormalities. This case illustrates subtle clinical and ECG findings suggestive of SCAD which emergency physicians should consider when evaluating patients for ACS in the absence of traditional clinical presentations. Such considerations may prompt physicians to avoid therapy for coronary plaque rupture which is not indicated in patients with SCAD.

### Almotriptan [^116jBQhk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events

Cardiac Events and Fatalities with 5-HT Agonists

Serious adverse cardiac events, including acute myocardial infarction, have been reported within a few hours following administration of almotriptan tablets. Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm and death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of other triptans. Considering the extent of use of triptans in patients with migraine, the incidence of these events is extremely low.

Almotriptan tablets can cause coronary vasospasm; at least one of these events occurred in a patient with no cardiac history and with documented absence of coronary artery disease. Because of the close proximity of the events to use of almotriptan tablets, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following dosing should be evaluated for the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) or a predisposition to Prinzmetal's variant angina before receiving additional doses of medication, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur.

Premarketing Experience with Almotriptan Tablets in Adults Among the 3865 subjects/patients who received almotriptan tablets in premarketing clinical trials, one patient was hospitalized for observation after a scheduled electrocardiogram (ECG) was found to be abnormal (negative T-waves on the left leads) 48 hours after taking a single 6.25 mg dose of almotriptan. The patient, a 48-year-old female, had previously taken 3 other doses for earlier migraine attacks. Myocardial enzymes at the time of the abnormal ECG were normal. The patient was diagnosed as having had myocardial ischemia and that she had a family history of coronary disease. An ECG performed 2 days later was normal, as was a follow-up coronary angiography. The patient recovered without incident.

### Acute coronary syndrome and transient global amnesia with sumatriptan [^115asM4V]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Triptans are potent serotoninergic vasoconstrictors. They are generally avoided in elderly patients age greater than 65 or in patients with a history of CAD. Although there are reported cases of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) or Transient Global Amnesia (TGA) in patients after ingesting therapeutic doses of triptan or dihydroergotamine, this is the first case report, up to our knowledge, of a patient, who had no previous cardiac history, that was diagnosed with both ACS and TGA. A 59-year-old woman with a long-standing history of migraine, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypothyroidism, presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of amnesia, chest pain, and left arm numbness after ingesting a single dose of oral sumatriptan approximately 1–2 h prior to arrival. She had no recollection of the events that occurred after taking sumatriptan. No acute laboratory abnormalities were found except for an elevated troponin, which continued to trend upwards. Her EKG had no ST-T wave abnormalities. She was diagnosed with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), non-ST elevation MI. She had a negative noncontrast CT head. Neurology was consulted for her amnesia and diagnosed her with Transient Global Amnesia (TGA). They recommended discontinuing sumatriptan and beginning topiramate as a prophylactic therapy. There is an increasing number of reports delineating sumatriptan's adverse effects. Emergency medicine physicians should promptly recognize the toxic effects and adverse reactions from triptans.

### ST segment elevation in an adult chest pain patient: a case of coronary artery vasospasm [^11794PWA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Chest pain is one of the most common symptoms of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) in the United States, accounting for up to eight million cases annually. We present a 55-year-old male who was brought in to the ED with sudden onset chest pain and was found to have ST-segment elevations in the infero-lateral leads on electrocardiogram (ECG). These changes resolved with nitroglycerin. Coronary artery vasospasm was diagnosed as coronary angiogram was normal. Calcium channel blocker was prescribed with good symptom relief. The most important teaching point is, coronary vasospasm as a cause of ST-segment elevation is missed frequently and should be considered among the differentials in patients presenting with chest pain. Nitrates and/or calcium channel blockers along with avoidance of triggers can help in symptom management.

### Clinical evaluation… [^111nTTLT]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Typical angina is described as pain that is substernal, occurs on exertion, and is relieved with rest. Patients with all three of these features have a greater likelihood of having acute coronary syndrome than patients with none, one, or even two of these features. Chest pain that occurs suddenly at rest or in a young patient may suggest acute coronary vasospasm, which occurs in Prinzmetal's angina or with the use of cocaine or methamphetamine. Only about 2 percent of patients with cocaine-associated chest pain have acute coronary syndrome. 4 Atypical symptoms do not necessarily rule out acute coronary syndrome. One study 5 found the syndrome in 22 percent of 596 patients who presented to emergency departments with sharp or stabbing pain. However, a combination of atypical symptoms improves identification of low-risk patients.

The same study 5 demonstrated that patients presenting with sharp or stabbing pain, pleuritic pain, and positional chest pain had only a 3 percent likelihood of having acute coronary syndrome. 12 of 775 consecutive patients with chest pain who were admitted to a cardiac care unit, acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 10 percent of patients with normal ECG findings in the emergency department, 8 percent of patients with "minimal changes", and 41 percent of patients with "frankly abnormal" ECG findings. Although the ECG may be completely normal in a patient with myocardial ischemia and evolving infarction, classic ECG changes occur in STEMI. 14 Within minutes, there is J-point elevation, and tall, peaked, "hyperacute" T waves develop; ST-segment elevation and reciprocal-lead ST-segment depression also occur.

Abnormal Q waves usually develop within the first day, and T-wave inversion and normalization of ST segments occur within hours to days. A suggested approach to the evaluation of patients with chest pain or symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome is provided in Figure 1. When a patient presents with chest pain or symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome, vital signs should be obtained, the patient should be monitored, and a focused but careful history should be obtained. A 12-lead ECG should be obtained within 10 minutes of presentation.

A 43-year-old woman developed a sudden-onset severe chest pain and breathlessness at home. She collapsed within minutes and received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation from her husband. On arrival, the paramedics identified ventricular fibrillation requiring defibrillation. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for observation. A coronary angiogram performed at our hospital demonstrated non-obstructive disease of the right coronary artery. Her antidepressant medications were discontinued and she was discharged. No specific cause was found for the arrhythmia and collapse. One week later, she developed similar chest pain. An ECG showed transient ST-elevation in the inferior leads. Symptoms and ECG changes resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin. During the course of a repeat coronary angiogram the patient developed severe spasm of the right coronary artery associated with typical chest pain and ST-elevation in the inferior leads. She was treated with insertion of a drug-eluting stent and a cardiac defibrillator.

5.1 Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events

Cardiac Events and Fatalities with 5-HT Agonists

Serious adverse cardiac events, including acute myocardial infarction, have been reported within a few hours following administration of almotriptan malate. Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm and death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of other triptans. Considering the extent of use of triptans in patients with migraine, the incidence of these events is extremely low.

Almotriptan malate can cause coronary vasospasm; at least one of these events occurred in a patient with no cardiac history and with documented absence of coronary artery disease. Because of the close proximity of the events to use of almotriptan malate, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following dosing should be evaluated for the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) or a predisposition to Prinzmetal's variant angina before receiving additional doses of medication, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur.

Premarketing Experience with Almotriptan Malate in Adults

Among the 3865 subjects/patients who received almotriptan malate in premarketing clinical trials, one patient was hospitalized for observation after a scheduled electrocardiogram (ECG) was found to be abnormal (negative T-waves on the left leads) 48 hours after taking a single 6.25 mg dose of almotriptan. The patient, a 48-year-old female, had previously taken 3 other doses for earlier migraine attacks. Myocardial enzymes at the time of the abnormal ECG were normal. The patient was diagnosed as having had myocardial ischemia and that she had a family history of coronary disease. An ECG performed 2 days later was normal, as was a follow-up coronary angiography. The patient recovered without incident.

The uncontrolled nature of postmarketing surveillance, however, makes it impossible to definitively determine the proportion of the reported cases that were actually caused by almotriptan or to reliably assess causation in individual cases [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)].

Patients with Documented Coronary Artery Disease

Because of the potential of this class of compound (5-HT1agonists) to cause coronary vasospasm, AXERT®should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease [see Contraindications (4.1)].

Nonatheromatous

Coronary Vasospasm

Coronary vasospasm is a rare but important cause of AMI in young patients and a subcategory of myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries. This syndrome refers to a transient process characterized by sudden onset chest pain secondary to epicardial coronary artery spasm which usually leads to transient myocardial ischemia, with chest pain and ECG changes. Persistent and refractory vasospasm is what ultimately leads to myocardial necrosis and AMI. Although the prevalence of coronary spasm is unknown, it predominantly affects younger patients with similar incidence in men and women. The pathophysiology of coronary vasospasm is multifactorial and is hypothesized to be secondary to autonomic overstimulation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and smooth muscle hypercontractility. Clues to consider vasospastic angina include a prior history of repetitive nonexertional chest pain, ST‐elevation in contiguous leads on the presenting ECG, and nonobstructive coronary arteries on angiography. A detailed history of recreational and prescribed drugs that might induce coronary vasospasm may provide additional evidence to support this diagnosis. The definitive assessment for coronary artery vasospasm involves coronary angiography with provocative testing using ergonovine (acts on serotonergic receptors on smooth muscle) or acetylcholine (acts on muscarinic receptors on smooth muscle and the endothelium). A positive provocation test is defined as coronary luminal narrowing of 50%, 70%, 75%, or 90% with accompanying symptoms and ECG changes. The single most important evidence‐based therapy for improving prognosis in vasospasm is smoking cessation, if applicable. After this, the primary strategy includes avoidance of vasospasm‐precipitating medications and medical therapy with calcium channel blockers and nitrates. Despite adequate treatment, vasospasm may recur in up to 4% to 19% of patients. The overall clinical prognosis is generally favorable if patients are treated with appropriate medical therapies and modifiable risk factors (ie, medications and recreational substance use) are properly addressed.

### Systematic review: transient left ventricular apical ballooning: a syndrome that mimics ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^116kht1n]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome, also known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is characterized by transient wall-motion abnormalities involving the left ventricular apex and mid-ventricle in the absence of obstructive epicardial coronary disease. In this paper, we review case series that report on patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome to better characterize patients presenting with the syndrome. We identified 7 case series that reported on at least 5 consecutive patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome. The syndrome more often affects postmenopausal women (82% to 100%) (mean age, 62 to 75 years). Patients commonly present with ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads, chest pain, relatively minor elevation of cardiac enzyme and biomarker levels, and transient apical systolic left ventricular dysfunction despite the absence of obstructive epicardial coronary disease. An episode of emotional or physiologic stress frequently precedes presentation with the syndrome. The in-hospital mortality rate seems to be low, as does the risk for recurrence.

Chest pain — terminology and characterization — emphasizes precise language and symptom context: Chest pain should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and chest pain should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Because patients may not use the descriptor "pain", a more appropriate term is "chest discomfort". Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac. Pain — described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

Electrocardiogram — supportive considerations: When an ECG is nondiagnostic, it "should be compared with previous ECGs, if available", and "a normal or unchanged ECG is reasonably useful but not sufficient at ruling out ACS", so decision‑making "should not be based solely on a single normal or nondiagnostic ECG". Masking conditions may occur, and "Up to 6% of patients with evolving ACS are discharged from the ED with a normal ECG", therefore "serial ECGs should be performed and management should be guided by new electrocardiographic changes or other diagnostic testing". When ST‑elevation is present on the initial ECG, "management should follow the prescribed STEMI treatment algorithms", and if ST depression is identified, "management should follow the NSTE-ACS guidelines". Because a normal ECG may accompany certain occlusions and posterior ischemia, which is "often 'electrically silent'; therefore, right-sided ECG leads should be considered when such lesions are suspected".

5.2 Immediate Post-Injection Reaction

Approximately 16% of patients exposed to glatiramer acetate injection 20 mg per mL in the 5 placebo-controlled trials compared to 4% of those on placebo, and approximately 2% of patients exposed to glatiramer acetate injection 40 mg per mL in a placebo-controlled trial compared to none on placebo, experienced a constellation of symptoms that may occur immediately (within seconds to minutes, with the majority of symptoms observed within 1 hour) after injection and included at least two of the following: flushing, chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, anxiety, dyspnea, constriction of the throat, and urticaria. These events are termed immediate post-injection reactions.

The symptoms of an immediate post-injection reaction may overlap with those of anaphylaxis; prompt identification of anaphylaxis is important to avoid a delay in treatment. In general, symptoms of an immediate post-injection reaction have onset several months after the initiation of treatment, although they may occur earlier, and a given patient may experience one or several episodes of these symptoms. Whether or not any of these symptoms actually represent a specific syndrome is uncertain. Typically, the symptoms were transient and self-limited and did not require treatment; however, there have been reports of patients with similar symptoms who developed fatal anaphylaxis and/or received emergency medical care. Whether an immunologic or nonimmunologic mechanism mediates these episodes, or whether several similar episodes seen in a given patient have identical mechanisms, is unknown.

5.3 Chest Pain

Approximately 13% of glatiramer acetate injection 20 mg per mL patients in the 5 placebo-controlled studies compared to 6% of placebo patients, and approximately 2% of patients exposed to glatiramer acetate injection 40 mg per mL in a placebo-controlled trial compared to 1% of placebo patients, experienced at least one episode of transient chest pain. While some of these episodes occurred in the context of the Immediate Post-Injection Reaction described above, many did not. The temporal relationship of this chest pain to an injection was not always known. The pain was usually transient, often unassociated with other symptoms, and appeared to have no clinical sequelae. Some patients experienced more than one such episode, and episodes usually began at least 1 month after the initiation of treatment. The pathogenesis of this symptom is unknown.

Q29. A 55-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath, a tight feeling on the chest, and palpitations for 3 h. In addition, she mentions a few episodes of intermittent chest discomfort over the last 6 months, lasting minutes but sometimes hours, occurring both at rest and during exercise. She has a positive family history for CAD. The initial ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 130 bpm and then 96 bpm with no ischaemic changes after 30 minutes of a resting period. Initial and 1 h hs-cTn measures were 30 ng/L and 36 ng/L (ULN 14 ng/L), respectively. A resident asks you, as supervisor of the emergency department/CPU, whether CCTA should be performed now to rule-out obstructive coronary artery disease.

CCTA has a high diagnostic accuracy for ruling out occlusive CAD. However, image quality and interpretability may be hampered when irregular heart rhythm is present. Although elevated levels of hs-cTn may be attributable to myocardial injury due to rapid ventricular rate response, a CCTA is recommended because of the chest discomfort during the last 6 months and the positive family history for CAD.

Q30. A just-appointed radiologist challenges the work-up of patients with acute chest pain by stating the following: 'Why bother with clinical evaluation, repeated cTn testing, and ECG assessments in patients with suspected NSTE-ACS? In the end, all need CCTA'. Is this statement correct?

Not at all. Broad adoption of non-invasive anatomic testing, in terms of CCTA, among inadequately risk stratified patients, has been shown to increase downstream testing and costs without clinical benefit for the patient. In addition, despite the reduction in radiation doses achieved in recent years, acquisition of high-quality images with low radiation exposure, as well as appropriate interpretation of CT images, is not usually available on a 24/7 basis at every institution.

### Sumatriptan succinate, camphor, menthol (migranow) [^117Wy8M9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Chest discomfort and jaw or neck tightness have been reported following use of sumatriptan tablets and have also been reported infrequently following administration of sumatriptan succinate Nasal Spray. Chest, jaw, or neck tightness is relatively common after administration of sumatriptan succinate injection. Only rarely have these symptoms been associated with ischemic ECG changes. However, because sumatriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following sumatriptan should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal variant angina before receiving additional doses of sumatriptan, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur. Similarly, patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud syndrome following sumatriptan should be evaluated for atherosclerosis or predisposition to vasospasm (see WARNINGS).

Sumatriptan should also be administered with caution to patients with diseases that may alter the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, such as impaired hepatic or renal function.

There have been rare reports of seizure following administration of sumatriptan. Sumatriptan should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold.

Care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurologic conditions before treating headache in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine headache or who experience a headache that is atypical for them. There have been rare reports where patients received sumatriptan for severe headaches that were subsequently shown to have been secondary to an evolving neurologic lesion (see WARNINGS).

For a given attack, if a patient does not respond to the first dose of sumatriptan, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before administration of a second dose.

Overuse:

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. Migraine patients should be informed about the risks of medication overuse, and encouraged to record headache frequency and drug use.

### Ischaemic heart disease masquerading as headache: a case series [^112QhwkC]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Headache is a rare yet clinically significant presentation of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). While chest pain is the hallmark symptom of myocardial ischaemia (MI), some patients present with atypical symptoms, such as headaches, which lead to diagnostic challenges and potential delays in treatment. This case series highlights the diagnostic complexity and clinical significance of headache-predominant presentations of both acute and chronic coronary syndromes, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive differential diagnosis in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. We present two cases where headache was the primary symptom of MI. The first case describes an acute ischaemic event wherein the headache preceded the onset of classic cardiac symptoms, leading to the identification of an occluded obtuse marginal artery. This was the second case in our institution where a previous patient presented with exertion-induced headaches, ultimately diagnosed as a chronic total occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, which was successfully revascularised. Two years later, the same patient re-presented with acute coronary syndrome secondary to disease in a different coronary artery and his presentation was solely with headache. Both cases were successfully managed with percutaneous revascularisation, resulting in the resolution of symptoms and reinforcing the link between headache and CAD. These cases underscore the importance of considering ACS and chronic stable angina in patients presenting with unexplained headaches, particularly when symptoms are exertional or pressure-like. Early cardiac assessment, including ECG and further imaging when indicated, is essential for timely intervention. Raising the awareness of exertional headache as a potential ischaemic symptom may facilitate earlier diagnosis and prevent adverse outcomes. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying headaches in MI and refine diagnostic approaches for atypical cardiac presentations.

### Ischaemic heart disease masquerading as headache: a case series [^114LtXu1]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Headache is a well‐documented yet often under‐recognized symptom of cardiovascular diseases, particularly within the context of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and chronic stable angina. While chest pain remains the predominant symptom leading to the diagnosis of myocardial ischaemia (MI), a subset of patients presents with atypical symptoms such as headaches, which may lead to mismanagement. The pathophysiological mechanisms linking headaches with MI are not fully understood, but proposed explanations include autonomic dysfunction, referred pain mechanisms, and vascular endothelial dysfunction. Previous studies have highlighted the association between exertional headaches and significant CAD, particularly in patients without traditional anginal symptoms. This case series presents two patients with headache‐predominant presentations of MI. The first case involves an acute ischaemic event in which headache was the initial symptom, later evolving into classic cardiac chest discomfort. The second case describes exertional headaches as the primary manifestation of chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), with subsequent recurrence linked to progressive CAD in a different coronary artery.

Case presentation

A 35-year-old woman presented with centrally located chest heaviness radiating to arms, shoulder blades and upper back after waking up. The pain was not affected by activity or position, but was associated with nausea and dizziness. She had similar, less severe episodes of discomfort over the prior 2 days lasting not more than 30 minutes; however, the chest pain this time was prolonged and more severe. The patient had previously suffered three spontaneous abortions but was now 2 weeks post partum after the delivery of healthy twins. She was herself previously healthy and took no medications. Family history was unremarkable for cardiac risk. Her cardiovascular physical examination was normal.

The initial ECG is shown in figure 1. Her chest discomfort had resolved in the emergency department, and her initial serum troponin level was within normal limits. CT was negative for pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection. Due to high-risk clinical history and ECG findings, she underwent emergent coronary angiography.

Myocardial infarction with non-obstructed coronary arteries (MINOCA)

Q32. A 62-year-old woman, former smoker, with no prior relevant medical history, is admitted to the emergency department because of a prolonged typical chest pain lasting > 6 h. Vital signs are normal except for body temperature that is 37.6°C. The ECG shows 0.5 mm horizontal ST depression in the anterior and inferior leads. Transthoracic echocardiography shows borderline left ventricular function. The first hs-cTn I is 270 ng/L (ULN < 14 ng/L). She immediately receives aspirin and unfractionated heparin and, a few hours later, undergoes invasive coronary angiography which shows no significant stenosis. Your colleague argues that the problem is microvascular spasm/obstruction and suggests treating the patient with standard NSTE-ACS drug therapy. Is he right?

No. MINOCA is a working diagnosis until further assessment excludes other possible causes for cTn elevation. Intracoronary functional tests (acetylcholine/ergonovine) may be performed when coronary or microvascular spasm is suspected and, in this specific case, CMR should be performed to exclude myocarditis or specify other causes for the cTn elevation. Standard NSTE-ACS therapy may not be the correct choice since pharmacological therapy will vary according to the final diagnosis.

Q33. A 70-year-old man, with hypertension and dyslipidaemia, presents to the emergency department because of recurrent episodes of chest pain, not associated with exercise, lasting for a few minutes. At admission, physical examination is unremarkable. First and second hs-cTn I levels are both within normal range and the first ECG is normal. Two hours later, the patient has a recurrence of chest pain with transient ST-segment elevation of 0.5 mm in leads II, III, and aVF. Immediate invasive coronary angiography is performed and a mild focal disease on the right coronary artery and left circumflex artery is found. The fellow tells you that there is an available slot for CMR in 30 minutes. Would you do additional invasive tests while waiting for the CMR?

### It's a trap! clinical similarities and subtle ECG differences between Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction [^11351tYK]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

We describe a 65-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and smoking who presented with an acute episode of chest pain precipitated by severe emotional stress. Her initial electrocardiogram done in the emergency room showed non-specific T wave changes in the lateral leads and her cardiac troponin levels were mildly elevated. Because of her clinical presentation, she was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and managed with antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy. Coronary angiogram did not reveal coronary artery disease and left ventriculography showed findings consistent with apical ballooning syndrome or takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Subsequent electrocardiograms displayed dramatic changes including T wave inversions, QT interval prolongation and U waves. The patient remained asymptomatic and recovered uneventfully. Three weeks post-discharge, an echocardiogram documented resolved left ventricular dysfunction. We describe the clinical features and highlight the electrocardiographic findings that may help differentiate takotsubo cardiomyopathy from myocardial infarction.

5.1 Immediate Post-Injection Reaction

Approximately 16% of patients exposed to glatiramer acetate injection 20 mg per mL in the five placebo-controlled trials compared to 4% of those on placebo, and approximately 2% of patients exposed to glatiramer acetate injection 40 mg per mL in a placebo-controlled trial compared to none on placebo, experienced a constellation of symptoms that may occur immediately (within seconds to minutes, with the majority of symptoms observed within 1 hour) after injection and included at least two of the following: flushing, chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, anxiety, dyspnea, constriction of the throat, and urticaria. In general, these symptoms have their onset several months after the initiation of treatment, although they may occur earlier, and a given patient may experience one or several episodes of these symptoms. Whether or not any of these symptoms actually represent a specific syndrome is uncertain. Typically, the symptoms were transient and self-limited and did not require treatment; however, there have been reports of patients with similar symptoms who received emergency medical care. Whether an immunologic or nonimmunologic mechanism mediates these episodes, or whether several similar episodes seen in a given patient have identical mechanisms, is unknown.

5.2 Chest Pain

Approximately 13% of glatiramer acetate injection 20 mg per mL patients in the five placebo-controlled studies compared to 6% of placebo patients, and approximately 2% of patients exposed to glatiramer acetate injection 40 mg per mL in a placebo-controlled trial compared to 1% of placebo patients, experienced at least one episode of transient chest pain. While some of these episodes occurred in the context of the Immediate Post-Injection Reaction described above, many did not. The temporal relationship of this chest pain to an injection was not always known. The pain was usually transient, often unassociated with other symptoms, and appeared to have no clinical sequelae. Some patients experienced more than one such episode, and episodes usually began at least 1 month after the initiation of treatment. The pathogenesis of this symptom is unknown.

### Myocardial infarction in the setting of anaphylaxis to celecoxib: a Case of kounis syndrome [^116aSLDF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute coronary syndromes in the setting of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction are known as Kounis syndrome. The syndrome involves release of inflammatory mediators after an allergen exposure that leads to coronary artery vasospasm or platelet activation. A variety of foods, drugs, and environmental exposures have been implicated in this condition.

Case Report

The case involves a 62-year-old woman with dyspnea, chest pain, and transient ST-segment elevation after ingesting celecoxib. Her symptoms resolved with treatment for a suspected allergic reaction. Although she did have mild elevation of serum cardiac biomarkers, subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated normal coronary arteries. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This is the first reported case of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction after allergy to celecoxib. Knowledge of Kounis syndrome will better prepare physicians in both its identification and clinical management.

### Acute coronary syndromes can be a headache [^115zojDB]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Ischaemic heart disease is a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Patients typically present with chest pain and breathlessness either on exertion or at rest. Cardiac ischaemia can also lead to headache, although this is very rarely its only manifestation. Headache is mostly associated with migraine, cluster and tension headache disorders. More sinister causes include subarachnoid haemorrhage, temporal arteritis, meningitis, venous sinus thrombosis as well as vertebral and carotid artery dissection. A case of headache is presented where the underlying cause was cardiac ischaemia, itself the result of triple vessel coronary artery disease. This, also referred to as cardiac cephalgia, should be suspected in the older patient with risk factors for atherosclerotic disease presenting with recent-onset headache. Diagnosis of this requires high clinical suspicion and is essential for correct patient management.

Coronary artery vasospasm

Coronary artery vasospasm is an important cause of chest pain that can lead to myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death. Chest pain episodes usually occur during the early morning hours. Coronary invasive angiography may or may not demonstrate fixed coronary obstruction. Often an atherosclerotic plaque at the level of vasospasm is present, and; therefore, the detection of a stenosis using cardiac CT may be crucial in interpreting the findings at invasive coronary angiography. The pathophysiology of coronary artery spasm includes endothelial dysfunction through metabolism of nitric oxide. Calcium antagonists and nitroglycerin are effective in treating and preventing new episodes of coronary spasm, Fig. 6.

Introduction

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an important cause of nonatherosclerotic myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden cardiac arrest, particularly among young and middle‐aged women. 1 SCAD may account for as many as 4.0% of all acute coronary syndromes and 30% of acute coronary syndromes in women under 50 years of age. 2, 3, 4 SCAD occurs due to an intramural hematoma ± intimal/medial tear in a coronary artery, which can impair blood flow to the myocardium with consequent MI and/or sudden cardiac arrest. 5 While the majority of SCAD occurs in a single coronary artery, it can also occur in several coronary arteries concurrently. 6 It may also recur weeks to years following an initial SCAD, the risk factors for which are not well identified. 2

Clinical introduction

A 38-year-old Caucasian man presented with central chest heaviness at rest. There was a history of mild abdominal discomfort but no infective prodrome. There was no antecedent exertional or nocturnal chest pain. The patient had a 26-pack-year history of tobacco smoking and no known comorbidities. Recent social history was unremarkable. Examination and vital signs were normal. An ECG taken with mild residual chest discomfort is shown in figure 1A. High-sensitivity troponin I was 74 ng/L, peaking at 1405 ng/L. Echocardiography demonstrated a structurally normal heart with normal biventricular function. Medical therapy for an acute coronary syndrome was commenced and invasive coronary angiography was performed (figure 1B, C).

Additional ECG findings consistent with acute coronary artery occlusion — diagnostic cues — note that the application of STEMI ECG criteria on a standard 12-lead ECG alone will miss a significant minority of patients who have acute coronary occlusion; therefore, the ECG should be closely examined for subtle changes such as hyperacute T waves or ST-segment elevation < 1 mm, particularly when combined with reciprocal ST-segment depression, as concomitant reciprocal ST-segment depression may be visually more evident than ST-segment elevation; if present, these patients should be evaluated for emergent coronary angiography.

Outcome ascertainment

All participants were followed up for the occurrence of a major ischaemic vascular event, a combined end point defined as the first of any of non-fatal ischaemic stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or ischaemic cardiovascular death. In addition, we evaluated any first myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, coronary revascularisation procedure, and angina. There were too few cases of cardiovascular death to perform meaningful stratified analyses. Medical records were obtained for all reported cardiovascular end points except angina and reviewed by an end points committee of physicians. Stroke was confirmed if the participant had a new focal neurological deficit of sudden onset that persisted for more than 24 hours and was then classified as ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or undefined, with excellent agreement between observers. For this report, we included only cases of ischaemic stroke and censored participants with other subtypes of stroke at the time of event. The occurrence of myocardial infarction was confirmed if symptoms met World Health Organization criteria and if the event was associated with abnormal levels of cardiac enzymes or abnormal results on electrocardiography. Cardiovascular deaths were confirmed by autopsy reports, death certificates, medical records, and information obtained from next of kin or family members.

### Frequency, characteristics, and clinical significance of transient ST segment elevation in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^113XXRb2]. European Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Prior investigations of transient myocardial ischaemia have focused on ST depression events. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis was to determine the frequency, characteristics, and clinical significance of transient ST segment elevation in patients with acute coronary syndromes.

Methods

A secondary analysis from two prospective studies utilizing 12-lead ST segment monitoring was used to compare ST elevation vs ST depression events.

Results

Of 868 patients, 177 (20%) had 574 events (242, ST elevation; 332, ST depression). Patients with ST elevation were more likely to have single vessel coronary artery disease, whereas patients with ST depression were more likely to have triple vessel coronary artery disease. ST elevation events were of shorter duration, more often associated with chest pain, and had greater ST changes than ST depression events. There was no difference in clinical outcome between patients with ST elevation vs depression; however, those with ST events were more likely to have adverse hospital outcomes (OR, 3.67) or death (OR, 2.03) than patients without ST events. After controlling for clinical prognostic factors, transient ST events observed with continuous ST monitoring predicted hospital death independently from signs of ischaemia on the initial standard 12-lead ECG.

Conclusions

Transient ST elevation is nearly as prevalent as transient ST depression in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Since the vast majority of ST events are brief and otherwise clinically silent, ST segment monitoring is more efficacious in detecting ischaemic events and in predicting adverse clinical outcomes than patients' symptoms or the initial standard 12-lead ECG.

Background and Purpose

Although a great deal of literature has been generated regarding left ventricular wall abnormalities, ECG changes and cardiac enzyme leaks associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), there have been only a few reports of true transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome in patients with SAH. Several pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the unusual features of this syndrome, such as multivessel coronary vasospasm, abnormalities in coronary microvascular function, and catecholamine-mediated cardiotoxicity. Summary of Case- A previously healthy 64-year-old woman with no history of vascular disease was found unresponsive at home. She was taken to the emergency room where a CT head revealed an SAH due to a ruptured aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery. On admission, an ECG showed deeply inverted T-waves and QT prolongation, typical of SAH. Cardiac troponin was measured at 1.2 ng/mL, and later increased to 3.7 ng/mL. A transthoracic echocardiogram on the next day revealed a large left ventricular wall abnormality, characteristic of apical ballooning with an ejection fraction of 25% to 30%. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and was started on low dose beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. She had an uneventful cardiac recovery within 5 days at which time a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction with no wall motion abnormality.

Conclusions

This report adds to the growing list of "stressors" for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Clinicians should be aware of the existence and the typical clinical manifestations of this syndrome, which is increasingly recognized in various populations. In particular, neurologists should consider this syndrome in the differential diagnosis of ECG changes and apical wall motion abnormalities in patients with SAH. Prognosis is generally very good with full recovery in most patients; however, there may be increased morbidity associated in patients with SAH.

Typical patterns of symptom presentation in women describe differences in symptom triggers and descriptors compared with men; the most common presentation of myocardial ischemia is chest pain or discomfort; however, women have a different pattern and distribution of non–chest-related pain symptoms, and women's ischemic symptoms are more often precipitated by mental or emotional stress and less frequently by physical exertion; proportionately, women more often report epigastric discomfort and associated nausea; radiation of discomfort to the arms, neck, and interscapular areas; and dyspnea and fatigue; studies have not found a pattern of symptoms uniquely ascribed to either sex, but significant overlap in qualitative descriptors exists, and the evidence synthesis highlights that women experience a broad range of symptoms, frequently including recent and stress-related symptoms.

### Prevalence and clinical factors of migraine in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^115mUWw3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In the context of SCAD and migraine, these considerations are particularly intriguing given the finding that non‐FMD EVAs (and all EVAs on adjusted analyses) were more common in SCAD patients with migraine. Upon stratification based on location or type of EVA, statistically significant differences were lost, likely due to insufficient sample sizes. Nevertheless, this strengthens the supposition that migraine, SCAD, and arteriopathies including EVAs and FMD, are indicative of an underlying systemic propensity to vascular injury and/or dysfunction, and in some may include genetic predispositions. 13, 23, 36, 38, 43

Whatever the baseline characteristics of the vasculature, it stands to reason that other factors must also be involved. One potential factor may be hormonal changes in women. 18 Migraine headaches are associated with the menstrual cycle in over 50% of women. 44, 45 A peak in frequency of migraine without aura has been correlated with the fall in estrogen (and progesterone) that triggers menstruation. 44, 46, 47 Hormonal decline has also been suggested as a possible inciting trigger for menstrual‐related post‐SCAD chest pain 48 and pregnancy‐associated SCAD, which occurs most frequently during the first weeks postpartum. 5, 12

At present, although exogenous hormones can be safely used to control some types of migraine, 49, 50 they are often discouraged post‐SCAD due to uncertainty about risk. As estrogen is known to have multiple vascular effects, 51 further research into hormonal influences in migraine and SCAD is critical to identify shared mechanisms of disease and clarify the potential harms and benefits of hormonal substances in both conditions. 49

Interestingly, we found an increased incidence of recurrent chest pain among those with SCAD and migraine compared with other SCAD patients (although overall both groups had frequent chest pain following SCAD). This may be related to increased global sensitivity to pain, which has been noted among migraineurs. 52, 53 Endothelial dysfunction, coronary vasospasm, and microvascular disease can cause nonatherosclerotic chest pain, 54 but the role of these processes in SCAD is poorly understood. Even though post‐SCAD chest pain often responds to antianginal medication, such as nitrates, 5 the use of nitrates may exacerbate headaches. Such limitation in therapeutic options could contribute to more prevalent recurrent chest pain among patients with SCAD and migraine.

5.2 Immediate Post-Injection Reaction

Approximately 16% of patients exposed to glatiramer acetate injection 20 mg per mL in the 5 placebo-controlled trials compared to 4% of those on placebo, and approximately 2% of patients exposed to glatiramer acetate injection 40 mg per mL in a placebo-controlled trial compared to none on placebo, experienced a constellation of symptoms that may occur immediately (within seconds to minutes, with the majority of symptoms observed within 1 hour) after injection and included at least two of the following: flushing, chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, anxiety, dyspnea, constriction of the throat, and urticaria. These events are termed immediate post-injection reactions.

The symptoms of an immediate post-injection reaction may overlap with those of anaphylaxis; prompt identification of anaphylaxis is important to avoid a delay in treatment. In general, symptoms of an immediate post-injection reaction have onset several months after the initiation of treatment, although they may occur earlier, and a given patient may experience one or several episodes of these symptoms. Whether or not any of these symptoms actually represent a specific syndrome is uncertain. Typically, the symptoms were transient and self-limited and did not require treatment; however, there have been reports of patients with similar symptoms who developed fatal anaphylaxis and/or received emergency medical care.

### An atypical case of vasospastic angina: demonstrating the usefulness of holter monitoring [^117QFWwF]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Prinzmetal variant angina or vasospastic angina is a clinical syndrome characterised by episodic chest pain and transient reversible ST segment changes in ECG. The aetiology and treatment of the condition are quite different compared to those of conventional coronary artery disease. The crux of the problem in variant angina patients remains the diagnosis, especially if coexisting coronary artery disease is present. Timely diagnosis not only helps relieve symptoms, it also prevents complications such as ventricular tachycardia. Conventional provocative tests are used for diagnosis of such conditions; they have varied sensitively and specificity, and are cumbersome to perform. We present a case of an elderly man who presented with recurrent episodes of breathlessness and chest pain, where Holter monitoring proved to be a better mode for diagnosing variant angina than more invasive provocative tests. In this report, we reemphasis the role of this simple non-invasive diagnostic mode for diagnosis of variant angina.

Biomarkers and differential diagnosis

Q1. You are on rounds in the emergency department and your intern asks you: what is the main difference between non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina?

NSTEMI is characterized by ischaemic symptoms associated with acute cardiomyocyte injury (= rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin T/I), while ischaemic symptoms at rest (or minimal effort) in the absence of acute cardiomyocyte injury define unstable angina. This translates into an increased risk of death in NSTEMI patients, while unstable angina patients are at relatively low short-term risk of death.

Q2. A 72-year-old patient with hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia as cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) presents to the emergency department with typical chest pain of 3 h duration, palpitations, atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of about 120 beats per minute, ST depression on electrocardiogram (ECG), and a mild elevation in cardiac troponin (cTn) (twice the upper limit of normal [ULN]). Is it correct to state that the underlying process is a rupture, ulceration, fissuring, or erosion of a coronary atherosclerotic plaque?

No. According to the universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI), two main subtypes of NSTEMI have to be differentiated: type 1 MI, characterized by any of the processes just previously described, and type 2 MI, in which an extra-coronary condition is the main cause of imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand (e.g. tachycardia, anaemia, hypertension, or hypotension). The patient described may have had both.

Q3. Which are the three mandatory diagnostic cornerstones of the early diagnosis of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) among the following: past clinical history including a detailed description of the chest pain characteristics, 12-lead ECG, chest X-ray, elevated and dynamic rise in cTn, treadmill test, computed tomography (CT) angiography, and myocardial perfusion scan?

We conclude that the cause for the transient myocardial ischemia is coronary vasospasm, precipitated by beta-blocker overdose.

2 Chest Pain

Because 80% of both women and men with ACS present with chest pain or pressure, this symptom is detailed in the guidelines, derived in part from the US Chest Pain guideline. The ESC document noted that additional symptoms such as diaphoresis, indigestion or epigastric pain, and shoulder or arm pain occur commonly in both women and men with an ACS. However, some symptoms appear to be more common in women, including dizziness and syncope, nausea and vomiting, jaw and back pain, shortness of breath, pain between the shoulder blades, palpitations, and fatigue.

### Microvascular dysfunction in the spectrum of coronary instability [^114VXiXf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The term "coronary instability" commonly refers to the sequence of events that lead from plaque erosion or rupture to the occurrence of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). However, evidence indicates that coronary microvascular dysfunction plays a relevant pathophysiologic and prognostic role in the setting of ACS, both in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and in non-ST-segment elevation ACS. Our group have recently demonstrated that Tako-Tsubo syndrome, which clinically mimics ACS, is sustained by a common pathophysiologic mechanism represented by reversible coronary microvascular dysfunction. Given this evidence, we propose a reappraisal of the concept of coronary instability, extending this notion from the dramatic event represented by plaque erosion or rupture to a more diffuse process that can acutely affect each segment of the coronary circulation.

Answer: A

Discussion

In the era of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays, the aetiology of myocardial injury can be difficult to ascertain. In this case, myocardial infarction with non-obstructed coronary arteriesdue to plaque erosion was the probable cause of the index presentation, given the typical presentation and left anterior descending (LAD) atheroma. Stress cardiomyopathy was unlikely given the lack of a trigger, regional wall motion abnormality on echocardiography or ECG changes. Mild myocarditis was less likely in the absence of an infective prodrome and a clinical presentation most in keeping with acute ischaemia, although cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) may be a useful test when there is clinical uncertainty. Microvascular dysfunction is a recognised cause of ischaemiabut typically presents with a history of angina rather than a discrete episode of myocardial infarction. Similarly, coronary artery spasm usually presents with episodic chest pain of diurnal variation that responds rapidly to nitrates. If an ECG is taken during an acute episode, transient ST-segment deviation can be seen, not present in in this case. In situations of diagnostic ambiguity, the use of adjunctive tools such as intravascular imaging or CMRshould be considered to clarify the underlying pathology and guide therapies.

However, myocarditis was felt to be the most likely diagnosis by the treating team. Preventative therapies were stopped and the patient was discharged. He continued to smoke. Six months later, he re-presented with severe chest pain and anterior ST elevation. Emergent coronary angiography demonstrated a thrombotic occlusion of the mid-LAD artery (figure 2A, B). Primary percutaneous intervention was undertaken (figure 2C, D). The patient recovered well.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

2021 AHA/ACC Chest Pain Guideline — Setting considerations for initial ECG and transport: Unless a noncardiac cause is evident, an ECG should be performed for patients seen in the office setting with stable chest pain; if an ECG is unavailable the patient should be referred to the ED so one can be obtained. Patients with clinical evidence of ACS or other life-threatening causes of acute chest pain seen in the office setting should be transported urgently to the ED, ideally by EMS. In all patients who present with acute chest pain regardless of the setting, an ECG should be acquired and reviewed for ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) within 10 minutes of arrival.

Plaque rupture

It has been suggested that transient ischaemia induced by plaque rupture followed by rapid lysis may cause myocardial stunning in patients with apparent non-obstructed CAD at angiography. Indeed, eccentric atherosclerotic plaques in the mid-portion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery have been reported, but intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography have failed to identify ruptured plaques in the vast majority of TTS patients. Furthermore, this explanation is very unlikely as patients with TTS exhibit wall motion abnormalities extending beyond single coronary vascular territories and also sometimes include the right ventricle. In addition, the apical ballooning phenotype is known to occur in the absence of a wraparound LAD and this coronary anatomical variant is not more prevalent in TTS than in the control group.

Multi-vessel epicardial spasm

Sympathetically mediated epicardial spasm has been proposed as a potential cause in TTS. Takotsubo syndrome may be associated with endothelial dysfunction and other conditions of abnormal vasomotor function such as migraine or Raynaud's phenomenon. Similarly, endothelium-dependent dilation is reduced after emotional stress and prevented by endothelin antagonists. At presentation, patients with TTS have marked impairment in brachial artery flow-mediated dilation compared to those with infarction or healthy controls, which gradually improves over several weeks. In the early recovery period, predisposition to coronary vasospasm using intracoronary acetylcholine was demonstrated in some, but not all TTS patients. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the pattern of LV dysfunction in patients with TTS may require involvement of specific coronary side branches. Similarly, myocardial bridging in the LAD has been considered. Although epicardial coronary vasoconstriction may contribute to TTS in a subset of patients, the vast majority of patients do not show any evidence of epicardial spasm even with use of provocative agents.

Furthermore, endothelial dysfunction is often associated with oxidative stress, and studies suggest that this may play a role in myocardial dysfunction in TTS. A recent study by Zhang et al.found that hydrogen sulfide relieved cardiac dysfunction in animal models by decreasing oxidative stress. It has been reported that the level of oxidative stress correlates to the extent of myocardial dysfunction in TTS patients in the acute recovery phase. Nanno et al. measured 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and norepinephrine levels in TTS patients compared with AMI patients. They found that 8-OHdG levels changed proportionately with wall motion score and plasma levels of norepinephrine were twice as high in TTS patients as in AMI patients.

Pericarditis and myocarditis — clinical presentation and electrocardiographic features: Pericarditis and myocarditis share overlapping common causes and likely form a continuum, and most pericarditis in developed nations is viral although tuberculosis is sometimes a consideration. Pericarditis classically causes sharp, pleuritic chest pain that may improve by sitting up or leaning forward, a pericardial friction rub may be audible, and widespread ST-elevation with PR depression is the electrocardiographic hallmark though changes may be nonspecific and transient. Clinical manifestations of myocarditis are varied, often including sharp chest pain reflective of epicardial inflammation; myocardial dysfunction often causes fatigue and exercise intolerance, and predominance of heart failure distinguishes myocarditis from pericarditis; troponin is usually elevated, while in pericarditis a minimally elevated troponin does not appear to confer a worse prognosis.

Dobutamine induced ST-segment elevation in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease is a rare condition. We report a case of a 37-year-old man, a smoker, who developed severe chest pain associated with transient ST-segment elevation in anterolateral leads and significant segmental wall motion abnormalities during dobutamine stress echocardiography that was immediately relieved by sublingual nitrates without evidence of acute myocardial infarction. Coronary angiogram showed patent epicardial coronary arteries.

### Ischaemic heart disease masquerading as headache: a case series [^115525oL]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Headache is a rare yet clinically significant presentation of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). While chest pain is the hallmark symptom of myocardial ischaemia (MI), some patients present with atypical symptoms, such as headaches, which lead to diagnostic challenges and potential delays in treatment. This case series highlights the diagnostic complexity and clinical significance of headache‐predominant presentations of both acute and chronic coronary syndromes, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive differential diagnosis in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. We present two cases where headache was the primary symptom of MI. The first case describes an acute ischaemic event wherein the headache preceded the onset of classic cardiac symptoms, leading to the identification of an occluded obtuse marginal artery. This was the second case in our institution where a previous patient presented with exertion‐induced headaches, ultimately diagnosed as a chronic total occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, which was successfully revascularised. Two years later, the same patient re‐presented with acute coronary syndrome secondary to disease in a different coronary artery and his presentation was solely with headache. Both cases were successfully managed with percutaneous revascularisation, resulting in the resolution of symptoms and reinforcing the link between headache and CAD. These cases underscore the importance of considering ACS and chronic stable angina in patients presenting with unexplained headaches, particularly when symptoms are exertional or pressure‐like. Early cardiac assessment, including ECG and further imaging when indicated, is essential for timely intervention. Raising the awareness of exertional headache as a potential ischaemic symptom may facilitate earlier diagnosis and prevent adverse outcomes. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying headaches in MI and refine diagnostic approaches for atypical cardiac presentations.

### Vasospastic angina accompanied by Brugada-type electrocardiographic abnormalities [^1118wfBo]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2001). Low credibility.

Brugada Syndrome and Vasospastic Angina. We present two patients with vasospastic angina and Brugada-type ECG abnormalities. The first patient complained of chest pain, and transient ST segment elevation was confirmed on ECG. Coronary angiogram showed no organic stenosis. The second patient had syncopal episodes following anginal chest pain, and the same symptoms were reproduced by intracoronary acetylcholine injection that induced vasospasm. In both patients, ECG at rest showed ST segment elevation in leads V1 and V2 and a right bundle branch block pattern that were accentuated by a Class I antiarrhythmic drug. Ventricular fibrillation also was induced by programmed electrical stimulation. Susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation can be modulated by the interaction of coronary vasospasm with Brugada syndrome or vice versa; therefore, it is important to study the clinical implications of the coexistence of the two diseases in such patients.

Chest pain symptom characterization and terminology — For myocardial ischemia, the sensation is described as "characteristically deep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse", and "Point tenderness renders ischemia less likely". "It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation.17" Although "A patient's history is the most important basis for considering presence or absence of myocardial ischemia", "The diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone", and "In some patients, what appears to be noncardiac chest pain may be ischemic in origin". Features more consistent with ischemia are summarized as "Chest pain that is more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin". Terminology guidance states "Atypical chest pain is a problematic term" and "we discourage the use of atypical chest pain"; to reduce ambiguity, "To diminish ambiguity, use "cardiac", "possible cardiac", and "noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged", and "chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen".

### Acute pericarditis: rapid evidence review [^114weJcn]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute pericarditis is defined as inflammation of the pericardium and occurs in approximately 4.4% of patients who present to the emergency department for nonischemic chest pain, with a higher prevalence in men. Although there are numerous etiologies of pericarditis, most episodes are idiopathic and the cause is presumed to be viral. Diagnosis of pericarditis requires at least two of the following criteria: new or worsening pericardial effusion, characteristic pleuritic chest pain, pericardial friction rub, or electrocardiographic changes, including new, widespread ST elevations or PR depressions. Pericardial friction rubs are highly specific but transient, and they have been reported in 18% to 84% of patients with acute pericarditis. Classic electrocardiographic findings include PR-segment depressions; diffuse, concave, upward ST-segment elevations without reciprocal changes; and T-wave inversions. Transthoracic echocardiography should be performed in all patients with acute pericarditis to characterize the size of effusions and evaluate for complications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line treatment option. Glucocorticoids should be reserved for patients with contraindications to first-line therapy and those who are pregnant beyond 20 weeks' gestation or have other systemic inflammatory conditions. Colchicine should be used in combination with first- or second-line treatments to reduce the risk of recurrence. Patients with a higher risk of complications should be admitted to the hospital for further workup and treatment.

2 ACUTE AND CHRONIC CORONARY SYNDROMES

Acute coronary syndromes encompass a spectrum of acute conditions, including ST‐elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI), non‐ST‐elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina. These presentations have a common underlying pathophysiology, with the majority due to coronary atherosclerotic plaque rupture with thrombosis resulting in myocardial ischaemia. The mortality of acute coronary syndromes is highest within hours of symptom onset, and the prompt diagnosis can allow timely delivery of life‐saving treatments that improve prognosis. The electrocardiogram is essential for differentiating STEMI from NSTEMI, whilst measuring cardiac troponin is required to rule in or rule out myocardial infarction in those without ST‐segment elevation and to differentiate NSTEMI from unstable angina. For a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin is required, with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL), in addition to one of the following: symptoms of myocardial ischaemia, new ischaemic changes on the electrocardiogram, the development of pathological Q‐waves, imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality, or identification of atherothrombosis on coronary angiography.

The term chronic coronary syndrome is more recent and encompasses a range of clinical presentations due to diseases of the coronary arteries and/or microcirculation resulting in structural or functional abnormalities that result in transient myocardial ischaemia. At the macrovascular level, these include focal or diffuse atheroma, myocardial bridging, congenital arterial anomalies or transient coronary artery vasospasm, whilst coronary microvascular dysfunction may be responsible at the microvascular level. These may result in reversible myocardial ischaemia that arises with exertion and may manifest as angina, dyspnoea or be asymptomatic. Although chronic coronary diseases can be stable, they can also be progressive and dynamic with episodes of acute chest pain requiring expedited assessment. Whilst measuring cardiac troponin is recommended by clinical practice guidelines to exclude acute myocardial infarction, hs‐cTn assays may also provide insights into the risk of future adverse cardiovascular events in those with chronic coronary syndromes.
