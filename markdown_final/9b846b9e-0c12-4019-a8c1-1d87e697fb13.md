chairi malformation

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Chiari malformation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and classification of Chiari malformations. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why tonsillar descent matters. Next, I will review clinical presentation and how to distinguish typical from atypical headaches. After that, I need to check the diagnostic workup, including MRI thresholds and advanced imaging. I will then examine indications for surgery versus conservative management, including pediatric nuances. I should confirm surgical techniques and their trade-offs, followed by outcomes and complications. Finally, I will consider special populations, controversies, and synthesize a practical decision framework with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't anchor on outdated criteria. Chiari malformation type I is classically defined by cerebellar tonsillar descent of at least 5 mm below the foramen magnum, though contemporary practice recognizes a spectrum and some use a 3–5 mm threshold depending on age and imaging context, with MRI as the gold standard for diagnosis and characterization of the posterior fossa and craniocervical junction [^111MeVLb] [^114SUHWc]. Hold on, I should verify the broader taxonomy: types 0 and 1.5 likely reflect a continuum of paraxial mesodermal underdevelopment, whereas types II–V are true neural tube closure defects associated with myelomeningocele and more severe hindbrain anomalies, which changes both presentation and urgency of management [^114kPx1i] [^114dh64v].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. The leading theory remains a mismatch between posterior fossa volume and neural contents, leading to tonsillar herniation, crowding at the foramen magnum, impaired CSF flow, and, in many, syringomyelia from abnormal CSF dynamics. Acquired forms can mimic this via intracranial hypotension, lumboperitoneal shunting, or mass effect, so I should keep those mimics in mind [^112PpnEX] [^113CbLR3] [^114dh64v]. Wait, let me verify the CSF flow claim: while cine MRI can show flow abnormalities, the correlation with symptom benefit from decompression is inconsistent, so I should not overinterpret cine MRI as a standalone predictor of surgical response [^1115xDhJ] [^1133oXdd].

> Next, I should review clinical presentation and be careful to separate typical from atypical features. Typical CM1 symptoms include suboccipital or neck pain precipitated by Valsalva, cough headache, balance or coordination issues, and lower cranial nerve or long tract signs; syringomyelia may add dissociated pain/temperature loss and intrinsic hand muscle atrophy, whereas atypical headaches such as migraine or tension-type are common but less likely to respond to decompression [^111oafQE] [^111nBLHB]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric nuances: children may present with scoliosis or gait disturbance even without headache, and early decompression before puberty may mitigate curve progression when syringomyelia is present, so I need to screen for spine deformity and motor deficits proactively [^115v8pEy] [^114gzbi4] [^111oXFYR].

> I will now examine the diagnostic workup, starting with core imaging. MRI brain and cervical spine are mandatory to confirm tonsillar descent, quantify crowding, assess cisterna magna, and detect syrinx or hydrocephalus. If a syrinx is present, full spine MRI is indicated to define its extent and look for additional CSF flow obstructions [^111qU7mw] [^1141fALQ] [^114uQAmh]. Wait, let me verify the role of advanced imaging: cine MRI can document flow disturbance but should not be used alone to decide on surgery, and craniovertebral metrics like clivoaxial angle or pB-C2 may help predict instability and the need for fusion in select cases, though evidence is limited and heterogeneous [^1115xDhJ] [^113XdbAX] [^111b9vSS]. I should double-check that routine flexion-extension films are not recommended to predict future instability in CM1 absent clinical suspicion, as evidence is insufficient [^115QmjMm] [^115iwXtz].

> Now, indications for treatment — this is where I need to be precise. Symptomatic CM1, especially with a syrinx, is a reasonable indication for posterior fossa decompression, whereas asymptomatic CM1 without syrinx should not undergo prophylactic surgery. Conservative management with reassurance and activity as tolerated is appropriate, and routine activity restriction is not advised [^115WTgUN] [^113xCefD] [^111W6wuh]. But wait, what if the patient has scoliosis and CM1 with syrinx? In children, timely decompression before puberty may reduce curve progression, so I should coordinate with pediatric orthopedics and neurology early [^115v8pEy]. I should also confirm that decompression is not indicated for primary POTS symptoms; cardiology guidance advises against Chiari surgery for POTS management, so I must avoid conflating autonomic symptoms with Chiari pathophysiology [^112LoB6o].

> Let me consider surgical techniques and their trade-offs, and I should verify the strength of evidence. Both extradural (bone-only) decompression and intradural decompression with duraplasty improve symptoms and syrinx, but duraplasty may yield higher rates of clinical improvement at the cost of more CSF leaks; tonsillar reduction can be added when tonsillar crowding persists or arachnoid scarring is present, but complication risk rises with more invasive intradural steps [^115WTgUN] [^111izGfx] [^115ucpUm]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric preferences: many pediatric series favor osteoligamentous decompression alone, reserving dural opening for select cases, which aligns with a more conservative intradural approach in children to minimize CSF-related complications [^116mWoZv]. I need to ensure I counsel on expected outcomes: headache improves in roughly 80–90% of appropriately selected patients, syrinx regresses in most, but atypical headaches and nonheadache symptoms respond less reliably, reinforcing the need for careful patient selection [^112GgjqN] [^111oafQE].

> Next, I should review postoperative expectations and when to reoperate. If a syrinx fails to improve radiographically by 6–12 months after adequate decompression, additional intervention may be considered, including revision decompression or targeted measures to restore CSF flow; symptom improvement and syrinx resolution do not always correlate, so I must align expectations and follow both domains [^115nj5fJ] [^114xcqmf]. Wait, let me verify monitoring guidance: intraoperative neuromonitoring can be considered, but evidence for routine use is limited; nonetheless, many centers employ it selectively for complex cases or revision surgery [^116nuyTB] [^114xcqmf].

> I should confirm complication profiles and mitigation strategies. CSF leak and pseudomeningocele are the most common complications, more frequent with duraplasty; meticulous closure, sealants, and postoperative care reduce risk, and patients should be counseled preoperatively about these trade-offs [^111izGfx] [^112GgjqN]. Hold on, I should verify that complication rates vary by age and technique; pediatric series report lower CSF leak rates with bone-only approaches, supporting a tailored strategy in children when feasible [^notfound].

> Let me consider special populations and associated conditions so I don't miss important modifiers. In syndromic craniosynostosis, CM1 prevalence is high and management may require combined cranial vault expansion and posterior fossa decompression; screening protocols vary, so multidisciplinary planning is essential [^112tKe4B] [^116CdKM9]. In connective tissue disorders, craniovertebral instability may coexist, and craniocervical metrics can guide the need for stabilization; I should maintain a low threshold to evaluate alignment and stability in these patients [^113XdbAX] [^111b9vSS]. For pediatric patients, I need to ensure timely decompression when scoliosis or syrinx is present, and reassure families that participation in sports is generally acceptable without increased risk of worsening when asymptomatic [^115v8pEy] [^111W6wuh].

> I will now examine controversies and evidence gaps so I don't overstate certainty. The role of cine MRI remains unsettled, with mixed data on predicting surgical benefit; thus, it should supplement, not replace, clinical judgment and standard MRI findings [^1115xDhJ] [^1133oXdd]. The optimal surgical technique — bone-only versus duraplasty — continues to be debated, with meta-analytic signals favoring duraplasty for symptom improvement but at the expense of more CSF leaks; patient-specific factors and surgeon experience should guide choice [^111izGfx] [^115WTgUN]. Natural history studies suggest that many asymptomatic patients remain stable, but longer prospective data are needed to refine risk stratification and surveillance intervals [^115M1dpn] [^116zMQhH].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical decision framework and sanity-check it against guidelines. Symptomatic CM1 with compatible MRI and no better explanation warrants decompression; asymptomatic CM1 without syrinx warrants observation with patient education and no activity restriction; a syrinx, progressive neurological deficits, or scoliosis in a child tilt toward surgery; atypical headaches or primary POTS symptoms should prompt caution and nonoperative management rather than decompression [^115WTgUN] [^113xCefD] [^111W6wuh] [^112LoB6o]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with consensus statements: WFNS and CNS guidance converge on symptom-driven indications, pediatric modifiers, and judicious use of advanced imaging, which supports this approach while acknowledging evidence limitations [^114SUHWc] [^111qU7mw].

Chiari malformation is a congenital disorder marked by **cerebellar tonsillar herniation** [^111MeVLb] through the foramen magnum, with type I being the most common and often presenting in adolescence or adulthood [^112kRCZu]. Diagnosis relies on **MRI** [^111qU7mw] to confirm tonsillar descent and to assess for syringomyelia or hydrocephalus [^1141fALQ]; cine MRI may help evaluate CSF flow but is not definitive for surgical decisions [^1115xDhJ]. Management is symptom-driven: asymptomatic patients without syrinx are managed conservatively [^113xCefD], while symptomatic patients or those with syrinx are candidates for posterior fossa decompression [^115WTgUN], with or without duraplasty [^114xcqmf]. Outcomes are generally favorable for symptom relief and syrinx reduction, but complications such as CSF leak and pseudomeningocele can occur [^112GgjqN] [^111izGfx].

---

## Classification

Chiari malformations are classified into **four main types** based on anatomical and clinical features:

| **Type** | **Description** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Type I | Cerebellar tonsillar herniation ≥ 3–5 mm below the foramen magnum [^111MeVLb] | - Often asymptomatic <br/> - Headache <br/> - Neck pain <br/> - Syringomyelia [^115Rj9VP] |
| Type II | - Inferior displacement of cerebellar vermis <br/> - Brainstem <br/> - Fourth ventricle into the cervical canal [^notfound] | - Myelomeningocele <br/> - Hydrocephalus <br/> - Severe neurological deficits |
| Type III | - Cerebellum and brainstem herniate into a cervical or occipital encephalocele [^114sffKt] | - Severe neurological impairment <br/> - High mortality |
| Type IV | - Cerebellar hypoplasia without tonsillar herniation [^notfound] | - Severe neurological impairment |

---

Type I is the most common and often presents in adolescence or adulthood, whereas types II–IV are typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood [^112kRCZu].

---

## Pathophysiology

The primary mechanism involves **posterior fossa overcrowding**, with cerebellar tonsillar herniation through the foramen magnum that compresses the brainstem and upper cervical spinal cord [^112PpnEX]. This compression and CSF flow obstruction can cause syringomyelia and hydrocephalus [^112GgjqN].

---

## Clinical presentation

Symptoms vary by type and severity; **common features** include:

- **Headache**: Especially Valsalva-provoked or cough headaches [^111nBLHB].
- **Neck pain**: Common in type I [^114gzbi4].
- **Neurological deficits**: Sensory loss, motor weakness, ataxia, cranial nerve palsies [^1148uoZd].
- **Syringomyelia**: Present in ~50–70% of type I cases, causing dissociated sensory loss and motor weakness [^112GgjqN].
- **Hydrocephalus**: Common in type II, often requiring shunting [^114SUHWc].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

MRI is the **gold standard** [^114SUHWc], confirming tonsillar descent and identifying syringomyelia or hydrocephalus [^1141fALQ]. Cine MRI can assess CSF flow dynamics but is not definitive for surgical decisions [^1115xDhJ]. CT may be used to evaluate bony abnormalities, and flexion-extension radiographs can assess craniocervical instability [^notfound].

---

## Management

Management is **symptom-driven**:

- **Conservative management**: Asymptomatic patients without syrinx are managed with observation and regular follow-up [^113xCefD] [^114SUHWc].
- **Surgical intervention**: Indicated for symptomatic patients or those with syringomyelia. Posterior fossa decompression with or without duraplasty is the standard approach [^115WTgUN] [^114xcqmf].
- **Syrinx management**: Persistent or recurrent syrinx may require additional interventions such as syringosubarachnoid shunting [^115nj5fJ].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with appropriate management; symptom relief and syrinx reduction are common after surgery [^112GgjqN]. Complications include CSF leak, pseudomeningocele, infection, and neurological deterioration [^112GgjqN].

---

## Recent advances

Recent advances include improved MRI techniques, better understanding of CSF dynamics, and refined surgical techniques. Genetic studies suggest a **familial predisposition** in some cases [^114UGs8p].

---

Chiari malformation is a congenital disorder characterized by cerebellar tonsillar herniation, with management tailored to symptoms and MRI findings. Recent advances have improved **diagnosis and treatment**, but further research is needed to optimize outcomes [^111b9vSS].

Chiari type I malformation has traditionally been defined as a downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils of ≥ 5 mm through the foramen magnum and it is likely associated with a volumetrically reduced posterior fossa. Syringomyelia is commonly associated with Chiari type I malformation. We estimate the prevalence of these two conditions and determine that they are more common than previously expected. We identify the genetic syndromes associated with some cases of Chiari type I malformation, and we provide evidence in favor of a genetic hypothesis for at least a subset of the nonsyndromic cases.

### Sleep-related breathing disorders and the Chiari 1 malformation [^114mJK2S]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

The Chiari 1 malformation is characterized by > 5-mm herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. Consequent compression of the brain stem and nearby neuronal structures involved in respiratory control and maintenance of pharyngeal wall muscle tone may result in respiratory changes during sleep. These changes include respiratory failure and arrest, as well as sleep-related breathing disorders (ie, OSA and central sleep apnea). Although data have accrued on the significance of sleep-related breathing disorders in patients with the Chiari 1 malformation, many management questions remain unanswered. This article reviews the available literature on prevalence and management of sleep-related breathing disorders in patients with the Chiari 1 malformation.

CHAPTER 10. CHIARI

Question 10.1 What is the management of Chiari in craniosynostosis?

The risk of Chiari I malformation (partial sagging of the lower part of the cerebellum in the foramen magnum) varies greatly per type of syndromic craniosynostosis and is hardly or not at all seen in nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. The occurrence, causes, consequences, and need for treatment are often unclear. Chiari I malformation is best imaged with an MRI scan, but as to how often it should be done for the different types of craniosynostosis, and when a specific treatment is indicated, is unclear.

(1) How common is Chiari in children with craniosynostosis, and what is needed to diagnose it?
Chiari occurs in children with isolated nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. This is in 3% to 8% with sagittal suture synostosis, 0% in metopic suture synostosis, 6% to 18% with coronal suture synostosis, and 25% to 60% with lambdoid suture synostosis. It is possible that the presence of Chiari rarely causes any symptoms in these children. It is preferably diagnosed by MRI.
Chiari may occur in Crouzon and Pfeiffer in 70% to 82% of cases, and in 2% to 29% in Apert. In multisuture craniosynostosis, where the lambdoid sutures are also fused, Chiari is found in 57% to 71% and without fused lambdoid sutures, in 7% to 11%. It is unknown how common this is with Saethre-Chotzen and Muenke syndrome. It is possible that Chiari may often be present without complaints and symptoms in multisuture and syndromic craniosynostosis. It can often only be determined with the help of an x-ray and preferably MRI.

### Quality-of-life outcomes in adults and children with Chiari 1 malformation and in those managed without surgery: a prospective, multicenter, observational study [^116zMQhH]. Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Chiari 1 malformation (CM1) is a common MRI finding and a frequent reason for neurosurgical consultation. Although many studies have investigated surgical outcomes for patients with CM1, outcomes for those treated without surgery have been less frequently reported. The UK Chiari 1 Study reports the quality of life of adults and children with CM1 treated without surgery, 12 months after the first neurosurgical clinic visit.

Methods

The UK Chiari 1 Study was a prospective, multicenter cohort study of adults (≥ 16 years) and children (< 16 years) with CM1. This was an observational study that did not alter the course of clinical care. Symptoms and quality-of-life data (using Short-Form 36 in adults and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ in children) were collected at baseline and 12 months after the first clinical review for all participants.

Results

One hundred ninety-two patients with CM1 (146 females; 148 adults) were studied at baseline, and 113 patients with CM1 treated without surgery were studied at a 12-month follow-up. Baseline quality-of-life scores in the study cohort were significantly lower in every domain compared with normative control data, in both adults and children. There were no decreases in quality-of-life subscores after 12 months in this cohort of adults and children with CM1 treated without surgery. Social functioning (t = -40, P < .001) and bodily pain (t = -2.9; p = 0.03) Short-Form 36 scores showed improvements at 12 months in adult patients treated without surgery.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates the stability of quality-of-life domains in adults and children with CM1 after 12 months who have been managed without surgery. Further studies are required to understand the determinants of poor quality of life in patients with CM1 and to investigate interventions for improving quality of life. There is a further need for robust comparison of surgical and nonsurgical management for patients with CM1.

Clinical implications

Migrainous and TTH-like headaches can be found in Chiari 1 malformation, but causality remains unclear.
Occipital decompression is effective for headache relief, particularly in patients with typical cough headache.
Migrainous and TTH-like headaches respond less well to surgery.

### An unusual presentation of Chiari I malformation [^111oXFYR]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The most typical symptom of Chiari malformation type I in children is headache. The authors describe a 14-year-old girl who presented with a 3-year history of gait decline and no headache, which is very unusual. After surgery to correct the Chiari I malformation, the patient's gait improved; however, she went on to develop decreased hand use with joint deformities. She was diagnosed with a probable connective tissue disorder. Patients with connective tissue disorders are at increased risk for developing Chiari I malformation. The authors discuss the possible reasons for the unusual presentation of the Chiari I malformation and possible mechanisms. The unusual presentation of Chiari I delayed this young patient's diagnosis and treatment.

### Familial Chiari malformation: case series [^114UGs8p]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Chiari malformations (Types I-IV) are abnormalities of the posterior fossa that affect the cerebellum, brainstem, and the spinal cord with prevalence rates of 0.1%-0.5%. Case reports of familial aggregation of Chiari malformation, twin studies, cosegregation of Chiari malformation with known genetic conditions, and recent gene and genome-wide association studies provide strong evidence of the genetic underpinnings of familial Chiari malformation. The authors report on a series of 3 family pairs with Chiari malformation Type I: 2 mother-daughter pairs and 1 father-daughter pair. The specific genetic causes of familial Chiari malformation have yet to be fully elucidated. The authors review the literature and discuss several candidate genes. Recent advances in the understanding of the genetic influences and pathogenesis of familial Chiari malformation are expected to improve management of affected patients and monitoring of at-risk family members.

Chiari malformation (CIM) diagnosis — this evidence table summarizes case series describing patient assessment features, scoliosis associations, imaging predictors, and treatment-related observations. Patients with CIM might present with headache/ neck pain and scoliosis, and a retrospective view of 500 surgically treated patients reported symptom improvement and resolution of syrinx. A series includes 12 patients with isolated thoracic syrinx. Work focused on scoliosis determines associated factors and clinical and radiologic predictors of curve regression after posterior fossa decompression (PFD), using curve progression > 5 degrees. Cine phase contrast MRI could independently predict response to posterior fossa decompression for CIM, with follow-up at 1 month and 1 year after surgery. Reports addressing therapy note outcomes such as resolution of syringohydromelia and reestablishment of CSF flow, and study designs reported include Retrospective case series and Prospective case series, with categories including Therapy/patient assessment.

### Characterizing the in utero phenome of the Chiari II malformation – A network medicine approach, using fetal MRI [^114gEnhc]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, network medicine and biometric analysis together characterize in utero phenotypic unfolding of CM II and provide diverse insights into the origin and characterization of distinct phenotypes amongst this condition. Brain edema is identified as a more severe phenotype with a distinct anatomical/shape origin. These approaches support and validate the pathogenic "deformation" sequence nature of this complex syndrome, which primarily stems from a primary defect: spina bifida malformation. This further supports the rationale for prenatal surgery, which aims to repair the spinal defect and prevent ongoing deformation events.

### An unusual cause of neck pain: acquired Chiari malformation leading to brainstem herniation and death [^111C6hhB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chiari malformations are structural defects in which portions of the cerebellum are located below the foramen magnum. Of the four types of Chiari malformation, emergency physicians are most likely to encounter Type I (Chiari I). Chiari I malformations may be congenital or acquired. Congenital Chiari I malformations are most frequently encountered in the emergency department (ED) setting due to an exacerbation of subacute or chronic Chiari-related symptoms. However, acute Chiari-associated symptoms from an occult congenital or a secondary (acquired) Chiari malformation may occur.

Objective

To present a literature-guided approach to the identification and initial management of patients with Chiari I malformations in the ED setting.

Case Report

We present the case of a 30-year-old man who presented to the ED with isolated cervical region pain, and who subsequently died as a result of acute brainstem herniation from an acquired Chiari I malformation.

Conclusions

Although rare, acute Chiari I malformation may present to the ED. The new finding of a Chiari I malformation should be presumed acquired until proved otherwise, and should trigger an evaluation for central nervous system lesions or hydrocephalus. Brain imaging to exclude increased intracranial pressure and, in certain cases, specialty consultation, are important considerations.

### Sudden onset of Chiari malformation type I in previously asymptomatic patients [^114MHyvY]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) is usually suspected in patients with slowly progressing neurological symptoms. However, in some instances, especially if syringomyelia is associated, an abrupt clinical onset is reported and is accompanied by an acknowledged risk of potentially severe clinical signs or even sudden death. Little is known about such a critical course in CM-I/syringomyelia complex. The authors describe 3 challenging cases of the abrupt onset of CM-I/syringomyelia to reveal more information on the clinical presentation and pathogenetic mechanisms of this sudden and potentially severe clinical phenomenon: a 38-year-old man experienced acute respiratory failure requiring intubation following acute decompensation of hydrocephalus associated with Noonan syndrome, a 1-year-old boy had sudden hemiparesis and Horner syndrome after a minor head/neck injury, and a 2.5-year-old boy presented with quickly progressing tetraplegia and dyspnea after a mild flexion and extension neck injury a few hours before. All 3 patients showed a CM-I/syringomyelia complex at diagnosis, and all of them had a good neurological outcome after surgery despite the ominous clinical presentation.

### Chiari type II malformation: past, present, and future [^115qHEmU]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

Object

The Chiari Type II malformation (CM II) is a unique hindbrain herniation found only in patients with myelomeningocele and is the leading cause of death in these individuals younger than 2 years of age. Several theories exist as to its embryological evolution and recently new theories are emerging as to its treatment and possible prevention. A thorough understanding of the embryology, anatomy, symptomatology, and surgical treatment is necessary to care optimally for children with myelomeningocele and prevent significant morbidity and mortality.

Methods

A review of the literature was used to summarize the clinically pertinent features of the CM II, with particular attention to pitfalls in diagnosis and surgical treatment.

Conclusions

Any child with CM II can present as a neurosurgical emergency. Expeditious and knowledgeable evaluation and prompt surgical decompression of the hindbrain can prevent serious morbidity and mortality in the patient with myelomeningocele, especially those younger than 2 years old. Symptomatic CM II in the older child often presents with more subtle findings but rarely in acute crisis. Understanding of CM II continues to change as innovative techniques are applied to this challenging patient population.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for patients with Chiari malformation: surgical interventions [^114xcqmf]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chiari malformation type I (CIM) diagnoses have increased in recent years. Controversy regarding the best operative management prompted a review of the literature to offer guidance on surgical interventions.

Objective

To assess the literature to determine (1) whether posterior fossa decompression or posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty is more effective in preoperative symptom resolution; (2) whether there is benefit from cerebellar tonsillar resection/reduction; (3) the role of intraoperative neuromonitoring; (4) in patients with a syrinx, how long should a syrinx be observed for improvement before additional surgery is performed; and 5) what is the optimal duration of follow-up care after preoperative symptom resolution.

Methods

A systematic review was performed using the National Library of Medicine/PubMed and Embase databases for studies on CIM in children and adults. The most appropriate surgical interventions, the use of neuromonitoring, and clinical improvement during follow-up were reviewed for studies published between 1946 and January 23, 2021.

Results

A total of 80 studies met inclusion criteria. Posterior fossa decompression with or without duraplasty or cerebellar tonsil reduction all appeared to show some benefit for symptom relief and syrinx reduction. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether duraplasty or cerebellar tonsil reduction was needed for specific patient groups. There was no strong correlation between symptom relief and syringomyelia resolution. Many surgeons follow patients for 6–12 months before considering reoperation for persistent syringomyelia. No benefit or harm was seen with the use of neuromonitoring.

Conclusion

This evidence-based clinical guidelines for the treatment of CIM provide 1 Class II and 4 Class III recommendations. In patients with CIM with or without syringomyelia, treatment options include bone decompression with or without duraplasty or cerebellar tonsil reduction. Improved syrinx resolution may potentially be seen with dural patch grafting. Symptom resolution and syrinx resolution did not correlate directly. Reoperation for a persistent syrinx was potentially beneficial if the syrinx had not improved 6 to 12 months after the initial operation.

### Chiari type 1 malformation in a pseudotumour cerebri patient: is it an acquired or congenital Chiari malformation? [^112xasUq]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) is a developmental abnormality of the cerebellar tonsils. Patients with CM1 commonly present with headache. Papilloedema is rarely seen in CM1. However, a 52-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a headache and her ophthalmological examination revealed bilateral papilloedema. Her cranial MRI was compatible with borderline CM1. Bilateral papilloedema and headache suggested idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) as the preliminary diagnosis. IIH is a rare case in CM1. This article argues about this association and discusses as to whether it is an acquired or congenital Chiari malformation.

### Chiari type I malformation in a pediatric population [^1148uoZd]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The natural history of Chiari I malformation in children remains unclear. A population-based retrospective cohort study was therefore conducted. Radiology reports from all head and spine magnetic resonance imaging scans (n = 5248) performed among 741,815 children under age 20 within Kaiser Northern California, 1997–1998, were searched for Chiari I. Medical records and imaging studies were reviewed to determine clinical and radiographic predictors of significant neurologic symptoms, defined as moderate to severe headache, neck pain, vertigo, or ataxia. The 51 patients identified with Chiari I represented 1% of the children who had head or spine magnetic resonance imaging scans performed during the study period. Headache (55%) and neck pain (12%) were the most common symptoms. Syringomyelia was present in 6 patients (12%) at initial diagnosis; no new syrinxes developed during follow-up. Older age at time of diagnosis was associated with increased risk of headache (odds ratio OR = 1.3, 95% confidence interval CI = 1.1–1.5) and significant neurologic symptoms (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.04–1.4). Chiari I, an underrecognized cause of headaches in children, is also frequently discovered incidentally in children without symptoms. Larger and longer-term studies are needed to determine the prognosis and optimal treatment of pediatric Chiari I.

### Pediatric and adult Chiari malformation type I surgical series 1965–2013: a review of demographics, operative treatment, and outcomes [^112GgjqN]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Object

Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) is a hindbrain disorder associated with elongation of the cerebellar tonsils, which descend below the foramen magnum into the spinal canal. It occurs in children and adults. Clinical symptoms mainly develop from alterations in CSF flow at the foramen magnum and the common subsequent development of syringomyelia.

Methods

The authors reviewed English-language reports of pediatric, adult, and combined (adult and pediatric) surgical series of patients with CM-I published from 1965 through August 31, 2013, to investigate the following: 1) geographical distribution of reports; 2) demographics of patients; 3) follow-up lengths; 4) study durations; 5) spectrum and frequency of surgical techniques; 6) outcomes for neurological status, syrinx, and headache; 7) frequency and scope of complications; 8) mortality rates; and 9) differences between pediatric and adult populations. Research and inclusion criteria were defined, and all series that contained at least 4 cases and all publications with sufficient data for analysis were included.

Results

The authors identified 145 operative series of patients with CM-I, primarily from the United States and Europe, and divided patient ages into 1 of 3 categories: adult (> 18 years of age; 27% of the cases), pediatric (≤ 18 years of age; 30%), or unknown (43%). Most series (76%) were published in the previous 21 years. The median number of patients in the series was 31. The mean duration of the studies was 10 years, and the mean follow-up time was 43 months. The peak ages of presentation in the pediatric studies were 8 years, followed by 9 years, and in the adult series, 41 years, followed by 46 years. The incidence of syringomyelia was 65%. Most of the studies (99%) reported the use of posterior fossa/foramen magnum decompression. In 92%, the dura was opened, and in 65% of these cases, the arachnoid was opened and dissected; tonsillar resection was performed in 27% of these patients. Postoperatively, syringomyelia improved or resolved in 78% of the patients. Most series (80%) reported postoperative neurological outcomes as follows: 75% improved, 17% showed no change, and 9% experienced worsening. Postoperative headaches improved or resolved in 81% of the patients, with a statistical difference in favor of the pediatric series. Postoperative complications were reported for 41% of the series, most commonly with CSF leak, pseudomeningocele, aseptic meningitis, wound infection, meningitis, and neurological deficit, with a mean complication rate of 4.5%. Complications were reported for 37% of pediatric, 20% of adult, and 43% of combined series. Mortality was reported for 11% of the series. No difference in mortality rates was seen between the pediatric and adult series.

Conclusions

Before undergoing surgical treatment for CM-I, symptomatic patients and their families should be given clear information about the success of treatment and potential complications. Furthermore, surgeons may benefit from comparing published data with their own. In the future, operative CM-I reports should provide all details of each case for the purpose of comparison.

### Clinical, radiological, and genetic similarities between patients with Chiari type I and type 0 malformations [^112fP28o]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Object

Although Chiari Type I (CM-I) and Type 0 (CM-0) malformations have been previously characterized clinically and radiologically, there have been no studies focusing on the possible genetic link between these disorders. The goal of this study was to identify families in whom CM-0 and CM-I co-occurred and to further assess the similarities between these disorders.

Methods

Families were ascertained through a proband with CM-I. Detailed family histories were obtained to identify first-degree relatives diagnosed with CM-0. Several criteria were used to exclude individuals with acquired forms of CM-I and/or syringomyelia. Individuals were excluded with syndromic, traumatic, infectious, or tumor-related syringomyelia, as well as CM-I due to a supratentorial mass, hydrocephalus, history of cervical or cranial surgery unrelated to CM-I, or development of symptoms following placement of a lumbar shunt. Medical records and MR images were used to characterize CM-I and CM-0 individuals clinically and radiologically.

Results

Five families were identified in which the CM-I proband had a first-degree relative with CM-0. Further assessment of affected individuals showed similar clinical and radiological features between CM-0 and CM-I individuals, although CM-I patients in general had more severe symptoms and skull base abnormalities than their CM-0 relatives. Overall, both groups showed improvement in symptoms and/or syrinx size following craniocervical decompression surgery.

Conclusions

There is accumulating evidence suggesting that CM-0 and CM-I may be caused by a common underlying developmental mechanism. The data in this study are consistent with this hypothesis, showing similar clinical and radiological features between CM-0 and CM-I individuals, as well as the occurrence of both disorders within families. Familial clustering of CM-0 and CM-I suggests that these disorders may share an underlying genetic basis, although additional epigenetic and/or environmental factors are likely to play an important role in the development of CM-0 versus CM-I.

### Prevalence and impact of underlying diagnosis and comorbidities on Chiari 1 malformation [^112BcoQ5]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chiari malformation type 1 affects approximately one in 1,000 people symptomatically, although one in 100 meet radiological criteria, making it a common neurological disorder. The diagnosis of underlying conditions has become more sophisticated, and new radiological markers of disease have been described. We sought to determine the prevalence and impact of additional comorbidities and underlying diagnoses in patients with Chiari malformation type 1 on symptomatology and surgical treatment.

Methods

A retrospective review of 612 pediatric patients with a Chiari malformation type 1 diagnosis and imaging data evaluated between 2008 and 2018 was performed. Because of extensive clinical heterogeneity, patients were separated into four categories based on their primary comorbidities (nonsyndromic, central nervous system, skeletal, and multiple congenital anomalies) to identify associations with age of onset, radiographic measurements, syringomyelia, and surgical treatment.

Results

The largest group had nonsyndromic Chiari malformation type 1 (70%) and the latest age at diagnosis of any group. In the syndromic group, 6% were diagnosed with a known genetic abnormality, with overgrowth syndromes being the most common. Patients with multiple congenital anomalies had the earliest Chiari malformation type 1 onset, the most severe tonsillar ectopia and obex position, and were overrepresented among surgical cases. Although there were no statistically significant differences between groups and rates of syrinx, we observed differences in individual diagnoses.

Conclusion

The underlying diagnoses and presence of comorbidities in patients with Chiari malformation type 1 impacts rates of syringomyelia and surgery. Although most Chiari malformation type 1 cases are nonsyndromic, clinical evaluation of growth parameters, scoliosis, and joint hypermobility should be routine for all patients as they are useful to determine syringomyelia risk and may impact treatment.

### Costello syndrome and Chiari I malformation: apropos of a case with a review of the literature regarding a potential association [^112qzwNH]. Journal of Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

We report a child with Costello syndrome and Chiari I malformation. The medical literature has several case reports of findings peculiar for each of these two clinical entities that, when investigated, can actually be found in both processes. Recent reports have shown additional medical coincidences for the Chiari I malformation, which, unlike the Chiari II malformation, was once thought not to have many additional associations. We propose that both Costello syndrome and other clinical entities that have potential mesodermal or ectodermal deficiencies (eg, Chiari I malformation and phakomatoses, respectively) could have common dysgeneses. Further case reports from other institutions regarding Costello syndrome and Chiari I malformation are now necessary to confirm our findings. Our hope is that these data will potentially add to our knowledge of the etiology of both Costello syndrome and Chiari I malformation and potentially aid in the definition of a genetic locus for both entities.

Diagnosis and treatment of CMI is undergoing reexamination that includes redefinition of the anatomic Chiari malformation and refinement and redefinition of the clinical syndrome. Children with SMI present with head pain of some kind, a neurologic deficit, or with signs of spinal cord dysfunction from syrinx. Some will present with no clinical syndrome at all. Presence of anatomic Chiari malformation or compelling clinical Chiari syndrome should lead to evaluation by a neurologist or neurosurgeon experienced with the syndromes and their treatment. Treatment options are varied but usually result in resolution of symptoms. When symptoms persist after surgery, management is complex and not uniformly successful, even in the most experienced hands.

A single pathophysiological mechanism of Chiari Type I malformations (CM-I) has been a topic of debate. To help better understand CM-I, the authors review disorders known to be associated with CM-I. The primary methodology found among most of them is deformation of the posterior cranial fossa, usually with subsequent decrease in volume. Other mechanisms exist as well, which can be categorized as either congenital or acquired. In understanding the relationship of such disorders with CM-I, we may gain further insight into the process by which cerebellar tonsillar herniation occurs. Some of these pathologies appear to be true associations, but many appear to be spurious.

### Patients with "benign" Chiari I malformations require surgical decompression at a low rate [^115M1dpn]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

There are sparse published data on the natural history of "benign" Chiari I malformation (CM-I)-i.e. Chiari with minimal or no symptoms at presentation and no imaging evidence of syrinx, hydrocephalus, or spinal cord signal abnormality. The purpose of this study was to review a large cohort of children with benign CM-I and to determine whether these children become symptomatic and require surgical treatment.

Methods

Patients were identified from institutional outpatient records using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, diagnosis codes for CM-I from 1996 to 2016. After review of the medical records, patients were excluded if they 1) did not have a diagnosis of CM-I, 2) were not evaluated by a neurosurgeon, 3) had previously undergone posterior fossa decompression, or 4) had imaging evidence of syringomyelia at their first appointment. To include only patients with benign Chiari (without syrinx or classic Chiari symptoms that could prompt immediate intervention), any patient who underwent decompression within 9 months of initial evaluation was excluded. After a detailed chart review, patients were excluded if they had classical Chiari malformation symptoms at presentation. The authors then determined what changes in the clinical picture prompted surgical treatment. Patients were excluded from the multivariate logistic regression analysis if they had missing data such as race and insurance; however, these patients were included in the overall survival analysis.

Results

A total of 427 patients were included for analysis with a median follow-up duration of 25.5 months (range 0.17–179.1 months) after initial evaluation. Fifteen patients had surgery at a median time of 21.0 months (range 11.3–139.3 months) after initial evaluation. The most common indications for surgery were tussive headache in 5 (33.3%), syringomyelia in 5 (33.3%), and nontussive headache in 5 (33.3%). Using the Kaplan-Meier method, rate of freedom from posterior fossa decompression was 95.8%, 94.1%, and 93.1% at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively.

Conclusions

Among a large cohort of patients with benign CM-I, progression of imaging abnormalities or symptoms that warrant surgical treatment is infrequent. Therefore, these patients should be managed conservatively. However, clinical follow-up of such individuals is justified, as there is a low, but nonzero, rate of new symptom or syringomyelia development. Future analyses will determine whether imaging or clinical features present at initial evaluation are associated with progression and future need for treatment.

### Chiari malformation: diagnosis, classifications, natural history, and conservative management. world federation of neurosurgical societies spine committee recommendations [^114SUHWc]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed/EMBASE/MEDLINE databases. Inclusion criteria included publications between January 2011 and December 2022 on Chiari malformation (CM) diagnosis classification, natural history, and conservative management.

Objective

This study aims to offer an update on diagnosis classifications, natural history, and conservative management in CM.

Background

CM type 1 involves cerebellar tonsil herniation leading to neurological symptoms. There is controversy regarding its pathophysiology and optimal management, especially for asymptomatic cases. Previous research has focused on surgical outcomes with limited consensus on conservative strategies. Standardized guidelines are needed to enhance clinical decision-making.

Materials and Methods

The screening process involved reviewing abstracts, assessing full-text articles, and reviewing references. Eligibility criteria ensured the selection of relevant studies. Data extraction involved recording various variables. Results were discussed and voted on in 2 consensus meetings of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies Spine Committee, reaching a consensus using the Delphi method.

Results

A total of 164 abstracts were screened. Ninety-nine articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Headache, brainstem, and/or cerebellar/brainstem symptoms/signs were confirmed as the main typical neurological hallmarks of CM. Still, an accurate clinical assessment appeared to be the most reliable evaluation model available. Considering classification, the most common form in adults is type 1, whereas type 2 is associated with myelomeningocele and hydrocephalus from childhood. Magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard to show the extent of tonsillar herniation, overcrowded posterior fossa, or the absence of cisterna magna. Focusing on natural history, for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic radiologically positive patients conservative management is appropriate. Somatosensory, motor, brainstem auditory evoked potentials and polysomnography could be helpful to guide eventual surgical indication.

Conclusion

Further, higher-quality studies are recommended to establish more substantial evidence and recommendations.

### The perplexity surrounding Chiari malformations-are we any wiser now? [^114kPx1i]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chiari malformations are a diverse group of abnormalities of the brain, craniovertebral junction, and the spine. Chiari 0, I, and 1.5 malformations, likely a spectrum of the same malformation with increasing severity, are due to the inadequacy of the para-axial mesoderm, which leads to insufficient development of occipital somites. Chiari II malformation is possibly due to nonclosure of the caudal end of the neuropore, with similar pathogenesis in the rostral end, which causes a Chiari III malformation. There have been significant developments in the understanding of this complex entity owing to insights into the pathogenesis and advancements in imaging modalities and neurosurgical techniques. This article aims to review the different types and pathophysiology of the Chiari malformations, along with a description of the various associated abnormalities. We also highlight the role of ante- and postnatal imaging, with a focus on the newer techniques in the presurgical evaluation, with a brief mention of the surgical procedures and the associated postsurgical complications.

### Surgical treatment of Chiari I malformation: indications and approaches [^112PpnEX]. Neurosurgical Focus (2001). Low credibility.

Chiari I malformation is a well-described entity characterized by hindbrain herniation through the foramen magnum. Although the exact origin of congenital Chiari I malformation is unknown, it appears to be caused by a mismatch between the volume of the posterior fossa neural elements and the posterior fossa cranial content. Several theories have been proposed to describe the resultant pathophysiology of this mismatch. It is clear, however, that abnormal cerebrospinal fluid flow and velocity play a role in the symptoms and signs associated with this disorder. The authors will review the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment options for patients with Chiari I malformation.

### Indications for surgery and surgical options in Chiari malformation: WFNS spine committee recommendations [^116mWoZv]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A systematic literature review and consensus using Delphi method.

Objectives

This review aims to create recommendations on the surgical indications and approaches to treat Chiari malformation (CM) with or without syringomyelia.

Summary Of Background Data

Despite the growing body of knowledge on CM, there are diverse and sometimes contradicting perspectives about surgical indications and procedures in both pediatric and adult populations.

Methods

The authors reviewed the literature on CM published from 2011 to 2022. Two consensus conferences were organized by WFNS Spine Committee. The first one was held in Sao Paulo, Brazil on August 2022, and the second one was held in Porto, Portugal on December 2022. Using the Delphi method, a panel of expert spine surgeons and members of the WFNS Spine Committee examined the strength of the literature, elaborated and voted statements about the surgical management of CM.

Results

We present 11 consensus statements on the surgical management of CM. Surgery is recommended for patients who have symptoms or if an MRI shows progression in asymptomatic patients. In pediatrics, osteoligamentous decompression only is indicated, whereas adults can have foramen magnum decompression with duroplasty, which is usually sufficient to control the associated syringomyelia. Syrinx drainage is the last option. Arachnoid opening can be performed in patients who have previously failed surgery or if arachnoid morphological anomalies are identified during the initial procedure. Tonsillar shrinkage provides somewhat better clinical efficacy than decompression alone, but at a larger risk of complications. Only patients with concurrent basilar invagination and atlanto-axial instability are advised to undergo atlanto-axial fixation alone.

Conclusions

### Posterior fossa decompression with and without duraplasty for the treatment of Chiari malformation type I-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111izGfx]. Neurosurgical Review (2017). Low credibility.

The treatment of Chiari malformation type 1 (CM-I) with posterior fossa decompression without (PFD) or with duraplasty (PFDD) is controversial. Our aim is to compare the clinical outcome between the two methods for the treatment of CM-I. In this paper, the authors report a systematic review and meta-analysis of operation time, clinical improvement, and complications of PFD compared with PFDD for the treatment of CM-I. Randomized or non-randomized controlled trials of PFD and PFDD were considered for inclusion. Twelve published reports of eligible studies involving 841participants meet the inclusion criteria. There is significant difference in the operative time [mean difference = -74.63, 95% CI (-83.02, -66.25), p < 0.05] in favor of PFD compared with PFDD. There is significant difference in overall complication rates [mean difference = 0.34, 95% CI (0.19, 0.60), p < 0.05] and rates of CSF leak [mean difference = 0.24, 95% CI (0.07, 0.78), p < 0.05] in favor of PFD groups. However, there is significant difference in the clinical improvement rate in favor of the PFDD group [mean difference = 0.85, 95% CI (0.73, 0.99), p < 0.05]. Although PFDD is related with longer operation time and higher CSF leak rate, it can still be considered as a preferable treatment option for most CM-I patients for its higher improvement rate. More evidence from advanced multi-center studies are needed to provide illumination for the surgical decision making of CM-I.

### Chiari I deformity: beyond 5 mm below the foramen magnum [^114dh64v]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Although originally described as a consecutive series of pathologic changes, Chiari syndrome represents a spectrum of disease divided into two subsets: development deformities of the paraxial mesoderm manifesting after birth (types 0–1.5) and true congenital malformations due to failure of neural tube closure present in utero (types 2–5). Heterogeneity among patients with a Chiari deformity and incomplete understanding of its pathophysiologic characteristics have led to inconsistency in radiologic reporting and difficulty in defining appropriate management strategies tailored to an individual patient's condition. The radiologist is tasked with going beyond the criteria for cerebellar tonsillar herniation to define an individual patient's disease state, determine candidacy for surgery, and assist in selecting the proper surgical approach. In addition, the radiologist must be able to identify conditions that result in cerebellar tonsillar herniation that are not related to Chiari deformity to avoid inappropriate surgery. Last, the radiologist must be able to interpret postoperative imaging examinations to assess for adequacy of treatment and complications. The authors summarize recent literature regarding the pathophysiologic basis of Chiari 1 and related deformities and detail the ideal morphologic and physiologic imaging assessment, focusing on Chiari 1 and related deformities (Chiari 0, 0.5, and 1.5). Also discussed are surgical techniques and "pearls" of postsurgical imaging, including complications that must be recognized. This review provides clarity to a commonly encountered but less understood condition to optimize outcomes for patients with Chiari 1 and related deformities. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### Use of deep learning in the MRI diagnosis of Chiari malformation type I [^112kRCZu]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chiari malformations are a group of disorders characterized by anatomical abnormalities of the craniocervical junction (CCJ) with involvement of the cerebellum and brainstem. Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) is the most common Chiari malformation. The precise frequency of CM1 is not known; however, since the advent of MRI, CM1 has been increasingly detected with some studies estimating a prevalence of 1–3.6%. The precise natural history of CM1 has not been established and management is generally indicated for patients with severe symptoms, progressive neurological deficits, or those affected by significant syringomyelia with the goal of alleviating symptoms and preventing neurological deterioration. Diagnosis of CM1 rests on identification of displacement of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum. Currently, it is most widely accepted that a herniation of 5 mm or more is the minimum criterion for diagnosis of CM1. More recently, there has also been recognition of intermediate Chiari subtypes with clinical entities such as the Chiari 0 malformation that is not associated with any cerebellar tonsillar herniation, challenging the widely used 5 mm cutoff for CM1. There are other radiological findings that are known to be associated with CM1 such as syringomyelia, hydrocephalus, and skeletal anomalies such as platybasia and a hypoplastic posterior cranial fossa. As there are no other tissue or blood biomarkers for CM1, diagnosis currently relies on neuroimaging primarily through MRI and identification of the known associated neuroanatomical anomalies.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been applied to assist and improve the diagnosis of a number of pathologies across a range of anatomical regions with promising results, especially with regards to pathologies of neurosurgical interest. In particular, the use of machine learning techniques in the application of image-recognition tasks in radiology is a promising emerging technology with the potential to drastically improve the efficiency and ability of radiology in the clinical setting. In recent years, deep learning, an AI technique utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNN), has been shown to yield high sensitivity in automated detection of pathology on medical imaging with a similar (or even higher) performance to medical experts. A supervised learning approach is typically used to train CNNs where end-to-end labelled data is input into the network including cases with a known diagnosis.

### The Chiari I malformation [^115evbBp]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

As with many pathologies, the course of our understanding of the Chiari I malformation (CIM) has developed extensively over time. The early descriptions of the Chiari malformations by Hans Chiari in 1891 opened the door for future classification and research on this topic. However, even over a long timeframe, our understanding of the pathophysiology and, more importantly, treatment, remained in its infancy. As recently as the 1970s, CIM was not discussed in popular neurology textbooks. Syringomyelia is listed as a degenerative disorder with no satisfactory treatment. Radiation therapy was considered an option in treatment, and surgery was thought to play no role. During the last 40 years, equivalent to the duration of a neurosurgical career, our understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of CIM, coupled with modern MRI, has improved the treatment paradigm for this patient population. More importantly, it has given us evidence confirming that CIM is a disorder responsive to surgical intervention, giving patients once thought to be destined for lifelong disability a comparatively normal life after treatment. The purpose of this article is to offer a review of CIM and its important associated entities. The authors will discuss the evolution in understanding of the Chiari malformation and, importantly, distinguish between symptomatic CIM and asymptomatic tonsillar ectopia, based on imaging and presenting symptomatology. They will discuss techniques for surgical intervention, expected outcomes, and complications after surgery. Proper patient selection for surgery based on appropriate symptomatology is tantamount to achieving good surgical outcomes in this population, separating those who can be helped by surgery from those who are unlikely to improve. While our knowledge of the Chiari malformations continues to improve through the efforts of clinical and basic science researchers, surgeons, and patients, our current understanding of these entities represents a monumental improvement in patient care over a relatively short time period.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for patients with Chiari malformation: symptoms [^114uPACC]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chiari I malformation (CIM) is characterized by descent of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, potentially causing symptoms from compression or obstruction of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Diagnosis and treatment of CIM is varied, and guidelines produced through systematic review may be helpful for clinicians.

Objective

To perform a systematic review of the medical literature to answer specific questions on the diagnosis and treatment of CIM.

Methods

PubMed and Embase were queried between 1946 and January 23, 2021, using the search strategies provided in Appendix I of the full guidelines.

Results

The literature search yielded 430 abstracts, of which 79 were selected for full-text review, 44 were then rejected for not meeting the inclusion criteria or for being off-topic, and 35 were included in this systematic review.

Conclusion

Four Grade C recommendations were made based on Class III evidence, and 1 question had insufficient evidence. The full guidelines can be seen online at https://www.cns.org/guidelines/browse-guidelines-detail/2-symptoms.

### Chiari malformation type I surgery in children: French multicenter 10-year cohort [^116CM3ay]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) is frequent in children and remains a surgical challenge. Several techniques have been described for posterior fossa decompression. No decision algorithm has been validated, and strategies are highly variable between institutions. The goal of this study was to define therapeutic guidelines that take into consideration patient specificities.

Methods

The authors retrospectively collected data from patients who were < 18 years of age, were diagnosed with CM-I, and were treated surgically between 2008 and 2018 in 8 French pediatric neurosurgical centers. Data on clinical features, morphological parameters, and surgical techniques were collected. Clinical outcomes at 3 and 12 months after surgery were assessed by the Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale. The authors used a hierarchical clustering method to define clusters of patients by considering their anatomical similarities, and then compared outcomes between surgical strategies in each of these clusters.

Results

Data from 255 patients were collected. The mean age at surgery was 9.6 ± 5.0 years, syringomyelia was reported in 60.2% of patients, the dura mater was opened in 65.0% of patients, and 17.3% of patients underwent a redo surgery for additional treatment. The mean Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale score was 14.4 ± 1.5 at 3 months (n = 211) and 14.6 ± 1.9 at 12 months (n = 157). The hierarchical clustering method identified three subgroups with potentially distinct mechanisms underlying tonsillar herniation: bony compression, basilar invagination, and foramen magnum obstruction. Each cluster matched with specific outcomes.

Conclusions

This French multicenter retrospective cohort study enabled the identification of three subgroups among pediatric patients who underwent surgery for CM-I, each of which was associated with specific outcomes. This morphological classification of patients might help in understanding the underlying mechanisms and providing personalized treatment.

### Revision surgery for Chiari malformation decompression [^114yvNqd]. Neurosurgical Focus (2003). Low credibility.

Chiari malformations comprise four different hindbrain anomalies originally described by Hans Chiari, a professor of pathology at the German University in Prague. There are four basic Chiari malformations. The reasons for revision of Chiari malformation decompression may be for conservative or inadequate initial decompression or the development of postoperative complications. Another reason involves cases of both hindbrain herniation and syringomyelia in patients who have undergone adequate posterior fossa decompression without resolution of symptoms, signs, or radiological appearance of their syrinx cavity. Additionally, symptom recurrence has been reported in association with various types of dural grafts. Reoperation or revision surgery for patients with Chiari malformations is common and may not be due to technical error or inadequate decompression. The types of revision surgeries, their indications, and initial presentations will be reviewed.

### Chiari malformation and syringomyelia [^113CbLR3]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Chiari malformation was first described over a century ago, and consists of posterior fossa anomalies that generally share the feature of cerebellar tonsillar descent through the foramen magnum. Our understanding of this disorder was initially based on autopsy studies, and has been greatly enhanced by the advent of MRI. The surgical management of Chiari anomalies has also evolved in a parallel fashion. Although the exact surgical technique varies among individual surgeons, the goals of surgery remain constant and consist of relieving brainstem compression and cranial nerve distortion, restoring the normal flow of CSF across the foramen magnum, and reducing the size of any associated syrinx cavity. Syrinx cavities are most commonly associated with Chiari anomalies, yet primary spinal syringomyelia (PSS) can be caused by traumatic, infectious, degenerative, and other etiologies that cause at least a partial CSF flow obstruction in the spinal subarachnoid space. As with syringomyelia associated with Chiari anomalies, the main goal of PSS surgery is to reestablish CSF flow across the area of obstruction. In addition to MRI, myelography with CT can be very helpful in the evaluation and management of these patients by identifying focal regions of CSF obstruction that may be amenable to surgical intervention. Future directions for the treatment of Chiari anomalies and syringomyelia include the application of advanced imaging techniques, more widespread use of genetic evaluation, large-scale outcome studies, and the further refinement of surgical technique.

10. CHIARI I MALFORMATION

Basic Questions

What is the prevalence of Chiari I malformation in the different types of syndromic craniosynostosis?
What screening method (type and frequency) is indicated to timely detect Chiari I malformation?
How to prevent or treat this associated pathology?

Introduction

The risk of Chiari I malformation widely varies between the different types of syndromic craniosynostosis. The prevalence, causes, consequences, and need of preventive treatment are largely unclear — and even the definition is not unambiguous. Chiari I malformation is best demonstrated using MRI-scanning. The optimal frequency of scanning for the different types of craniosynostosis, however, is not known, and it is not clear what treatment is indicated — and when.

### Pediatric Chiari malformation management: WFNS spine committee recommendations [^115v8pEy]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A systematic literature review and consensus using Delphi method.

Objective

This review aims to provide an overview on Chiari malformation in pediatric patients, highlighting the specific clinical manifestations and surgical treatment options.

Summary Of Background

Chiari malformation in children presents a real difficulty to the general neurosurgeon because children are not smaller adults. In the absence of pediatric neurosurgeons, as in many countries of the world, a need for education of general neurosurgeons on the management of Chiari malformation in children was identified.

Material and Methods

The authors carried out an extensive review of the literature in PubMed database of the last 10 years addressing the topic of Chiari malformation in children. A total of 64 studies were selected for analysis and five statements were drawn to be voted by a panel of expert spine surgeons in two consensus meetings organized by the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) Spine Committee. A consensus was reached using the Delphi method.

Results

In children with CM1, a decompressive surgery with duraplasty before puberty may avoid scoliosis progression. In Chiari type 2, the recommendation is to perform urgently extensive decompression of the craniovertebral junction and cervical canal if there is no decompensation of hydrocephalus. Cranial vault expansion may be recommended in pediatric Chiari malformation associated with craniosynostosis. Children with Chiari type I can play sports because of the low risk of worsening.

Conclusion

Pediatric age is a modifier for the management of Chiari malformation (CM). Prompt diagnosis and appropriate decompressive surgery with duraplasty before puberty are essential to mitigate the impact of the condition on the child's well-being. Increased awareness among health care professionals, timely access to specialized expertise in neurosurgical interventions are crucial, especially for type 2 CM patients that require urgent decompression of CVJ and cervical spine.

### Prevalence and treatment of typical and atypical headaches in patients with Chiari I malformation: a meta-analysis and literature review [^111oafQE]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

A meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the incidence of typical and atypical headaches and outcomes following various treatments in patients with Chiari I malformation.

Background

Headache is the most common symptom of Chiari malformation, which can be divided into typical and atypical subgroups to facilitate management. Much controversy surrounds the etiology, prevalence and optimal therapeutic approach for both types of headaches.

Method

We identified relevant studies published before 30 July 2022, with an electronic search of numerous literature databases. The results of this study were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.

Result

A total of 1913 Chiari malformation type I CIM patients were identified, 78% of whom presented with headache, within this group cephalgia was typical in 48% and atypical in 29% of patients, and migraine was the most common type of atypical headache. The ratio of typical/atypical headaches with international classification of headache disorders diagnosis was 1.53, and without international classification of headache disorders diagnosis was 1.56, respectively. The pooled improvement rates of typical headaches following conservative treatment, extradural decompression and intradural decompression were 69%, 88%, and 92%, respectively. The corresponding improvement rates for atypical headaches were 70%, 57.47%, and 69%, respectively. The complication rate in extradural decompression group was significantly lower than in intradural decompression group (RR, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.06–1.59, I² = 50%, P = 0.14). Low reoperation rates were observed for refractory headaches in extradural decompression and intradural decompression groups (1%).

Conclusion

The International Classification of Headache Disorders can assist in screening atypical headaches. extradural decompression is preferred for typical headaches, while conservative therapy is optimal for atypical headaches. A definite correlation exists between atypical headaches and Chiari Malformation Type I patients with higher prevalence than in the general population. Importantly, decompression is effective in relieving headaches in this particular patient population.

Background

Chiari I malformation (CIM) is characterized by descent of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, potentially causing symptoms from compression or obstruction of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Diagnosis and treatment of CIM is varied, and guidelines produced through systematic review may be helpful for clinicians.

Objective

To perform a systematic review of the medical literature to answer specific questions on the diagnosis and treatment of CIM.

Methods

PubMed and Embase were queried between 1946 and January 23, 2021, using the search strategies provided in Appendix I of the full guidelines.

Results

The literature search yielded 567 abstracts, of which 151 were selected for full-text review, 109 were then rejected for not meeting the inclusion criteria or for being off-topic, and 42 were included in this systematic review.

Conclusion

Three Grade C recommendations were made based on Level III evidence. The full guidelines can be seen online at https://www.cns.org/guidelines/browse-guidelines-detail/1-imaging.
