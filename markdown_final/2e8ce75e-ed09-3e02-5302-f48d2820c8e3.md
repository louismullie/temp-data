## Question

when is the optimal time to check a testosterone level on a patient receiving testosterone injections?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when the optimal time is to check a testosterone level on a patient receiving testosterone injections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formulation-specific pharmacokinetics because timing differs for short-acting versus long-acting injectables. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (Endocrine Society, AUA, EAA) recommend for each formulation. Next, I will consider the clinical rationale for peak versus trough sampling and how to interpret results. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, formulation-specific recommendation and note special scenarios like transgender care and dose adjustments, making sure I cite the strongest sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: testosterone injections include short-acting esters (enanthate, cypionate) given every 1–2 weeks and long-acting undecanoate given every 10 weeks, and the timing of blood draws must align with their pharmacokinetics to avoid misleading peaks or troughs that could drive inappropriate dose changes [^d17218f1] [^e56b2545].

> For short-acting intramuscular testosterone (enanthate or cypionate), I should confirm the classic teaching: measure midway between injections to approximate the average exposure, and avoid sampling at the immediate post-injection peak or at the pre-injection nadir, which can mislead interpretation. The Endocrine Society explicitly recommends measuring midway between injections and adjusting dose if mid-interval testosterone is above about 600 ng/dL or below about 350 ng/dL, which operationalizes this midpoint strategy [^d17218f1] [^54b715ae].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for not using peak or trough routinely with short-acting esters: the AUA notes that while measuring at day 3–4 captures a mid-cycle value, it misses peak and trough, and there may be value in selectively assessing peak (about 18–36 hours post-injection) or trough (just before injection) when symptoms suggest overdosing or underdosing; however, for routine monitoring, the midpoint remains standard to guide dose titration toward the mid-normal range [^bfa2162c] [^d17218f1].

> For long-acting testosterone undecanoate, I need to ensure I get the timing right: the AUA advises measuring at the end of the dosing interval, just before the next injection, to assess the nadir and ensure adequate suppression of gonadotropins and symptom control. This trough-guided approach allows interval adjustments if the nadir is too low or too high, consistent with manufacturer and guideline dosing strategies [^3666768d] [^d641d002].

> Hold on, I should verify the broader monitoring cadence so I don't overgeneralize timing without context: guidelines converge on reassessing testosterone (and hematocrit) at 3–6 months after initiation, then every 6–12 months once stable, with earlier checks after dose changes. This applies across formulations and supports iterative dose titration to a mid-normal target rather than chasing transient peaks or troughs [^cd11b9b6] [^c2c8f7de] [^bfbb5b99].

> I will now examine special populations to ensure consistency: in transgender men on parenteral testosterone, WPATH/SOC 8 recommends measuring total testosterone midway between injections with a 400–700 ng/dL target, and for undecanoate, measuring just before injection with dose adjustments if the trough is below 400 ng/dL. This aligns with the same pharmacologic principles used in cisgender men [^f346a55a] [^27b37431].

> Let me consider practical interpretation so I don't jump to conclusions: if the mid-interval short-acting level is high, I should reduce dose or increase injection frequency. If it is low, I should increase dose or shorten the interval. If the undecanoate trough is high, I should extend the interval. If it is low, I should shorten the interval. Throughout, I should correlate with symptoms and hematocrit, and avoid reacting to a single outlier by repeating testing when results are discordant with the clinical picture [^d17218f1] [^d641d002] [^f22e0f81].

> But wait, what if the patient reports cyclic mood or libido changes with short-acting injections? In that case, I should double-check whether selective peak or trough sampling would clarify whether supraphysiologic peaks or subtherapeutic nadirs are contributory, recognizing that routine care still relies on midpoint levels for dose titration while targeted peak/trough assessments can be adjunctive in symptomatic patients [^bfa2162c] [^d17218f1].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the formulation before I advise timing: for short-acting enanthate/cypionate, draw midway between injections to estimate average exposure and titrate to mid-normal. For long-acting undecanoate, draw just before the next injection to assess the nadir and adjust the interval. And for all formulations, reassess at 3–6 months and then every 6–12 months, with earlier checks after dose changes, aligning with Endocrine Society, AUA, and EAA guidance [^d17218f1] [^c2c8f7de] [^bfbb5b99].

---

The best time to check testosterone levels during injection therapy is **midway between injections** for short-acting formulations (cypionate/enanthate) to assess the average exposure and guide dose adjustments [^d17218f1] [^bfa2162c]. For long-acting undecanoate, **measure just before the next injection** to evaluate the nadir and ensure levels remain therapeutic [^3666768d] [^d641d002]. Avoid checking immediately after injection to prevent misinterpretation from transient peaks [^bfa2162c]. Routine monitoring should occur at 3–6 months after initiation, then every 6–12 months, or sooner if symptoms or adverse effects arise [^cd11b9b6] [^c2c8f7de].

## Pharmacokinetics of testosterone injections

Testosterone injections have distinct pharmacokinetic profiles that influence **timing of monitoring**:

- **Short-acting injections (testosterone cypionate or enanthate)**: These formulations typically peak within 24–72 hours post-injection and decline to a trough before the next dose, causing fluctuations in serum testosterone levels [^54b715ae] [^e77421ac].

- **Long-acting injections (testosterone undecanoate)**: This formulation maintains more stable serum testosterone levels with a longer interval between injections, typically every 10–14 weeks [^e56b2545] [^d641d002].

---

## Clinical guidelines for testosterone level monitoring

Several professional organizations provide **guidelines on when to check testosterone levels** during injection therapy:

| **Guideline** | **Recommended timing for testosterone level checks** |
|-|-|
| Endocrine Society | - Short-acting injections: Midway between injections (approximately day 7–10 for a 14-day cycle) [^d17218f1] <br/> - Long-acting injections: Just before the next injection (trough level) [^d17218f1] |
| American Urological Association (AUA) | - Short-acting injections: Mid-cycle (day 3–4) or midway between injections [^bfa2162c] <br/> - Long-acting injections: Just before the next injection (trough level) [^3666768d] |
| European Academy of Andrology (EAA) | - Measure at each clinic visit to ensure mid-normal range levels [^84f747a9] <br/> - Adjust dosing based on these measurements [^84f747a9] |

---

## Rationale for timing testosterone level checks

The timing of testosterone level checks is **critical** for accurate assessment and dose adjustment:

- **Midway between injections**: This timing provides a representative average testosterone level, avoiding the peak immediately post-injection and the trough just before the next dose. It helps clinicians assess whether the current dosing regimen maintains testosterone within the therapeutic range [^d17218f1].

- **Just before the next injection (trough level)**: This timing is particularly important for long-acting formulations to ensure that testosterone levels remain within the therapeutic range throughout the dosing interval. It helps identify whether the dosing interval needs adjustment [^3666768d] [^d641d002].

---

## Clinical implications of improper timing

Checking testosterone levels at inappropriate times can lead to **misinterpretation and inappropriate dosing adjustments**:

- **Immediately post-injection**: Levels may appear supraphysiological, prompting unnecessary dose reductions.

- **Just before the next injection (for short-acting formulations)**: Levels may appear subtherapeutic, leading to unnecessary dose increases.

- **Inconsistent timing**: Variability in timing can obscure trends and complicate clinical decision-making.

---

## Frequency of testosterone level monitoring

Initial monitoring should occur **3–6 months after initiating therapy** to ensure testosterone levels are within the therapeutic range and symptoms have improved [^cd11b9b6]. Stable patients should be monitored **every 6–12 months**, or sooner if symptoms or adverse effects occur [^c2c8f7de]. After dose changes, reassess **within 3–6 months** to ensure stable levels and symptom control [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing testosterone level fluctuations

Several factors can influence **testosterone levels** and the timing of checks:

- **Injection technique**: Improper injection technique can affect absorption and lead to variability in testosterone levels.

- **Individual metabolism**: Variability in metabolism and clearance rates can influence testosterone levels and the timing of checks.

- **Concurrent medications**: Certain medications may interact with testosterone metabolism, affecting levels.

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with proper timing

Proper timing of testosterone level checks is associated with **improved clinical outcomes**, including:

- **Stable testosterone levels**: Maintaining testosterone within the therapeutic range reduces symptoms of hypogonadism and improves quality of life [^ca6bb9ea].

- **Reduced adverse effects**: Regular monitoring and timely adjustments minimize risks such as polycythemia, cardiovascular events, and prostate issues [^f22e0f81].

- **Enhanced patient satisfaction**: Consistent monitoring and dose adjustments improve patient adherence and satisfaction with therapy [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Short-acting injections (cypionate/enanthate)**: Check testosterone levels midway between injections (approximately day 7–10 for a 14-day cycle) [^d17218f1].

- **Long-acting injections (undecanoate)**: Check testosterone levels just before the next injection (trough level) [^3666768d].

- **Initial monitoring**: 3–6 months after initiating therapy [^cd11b9b6].

- **Stable patients**: Every 6–12 months, or sooner if symptoms or adverse effects occur [^c2c8f7de].

---

The best time to check testosterone levels during injection therapy is **midway between injections** for short-acting formulations and **just before the next injection** for long-acting formulations. This approach ensures accurate assessment of testosterone levels, guides appropriate dosing adjustments, and optimizes clinical outcomes.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^bfa2162c]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Injectable testosterone (short-acting) measurement timing and adverse effects are outlined as follows: testosterone levels have been measured mid-cycle (day three to four); however, such a measurement protocol misses the ability to define peak and trough levels, and there may be value in assessing peak level (18-36 hours after injection) and there might be value in defining the trough level (measured prior to injection on day one). The concept of testosterone “crash” is well recognized by clinicians with large differences between peak and trough levels potentially leading patients to become symptomatic towards the end of the cycle despite having therapeutic trough testosterone levels. Adverse effects that are more common with short acting injectable agents include local site reactions (7–33%) and abnormally elevated Hb/Hct (19–44%; mean 1.6 mg/dL in the current meta-analyses of RCTs).

For hypogonadal men treated with testosterone, the goal is to ensure that benefits are optimized, risks are minimized, and any adverse effects are identified early and managed appropriately. This can best be achieved by careful patient selection, excluding men with contraindications and addressing any modifiable risk factors in those at increased risk. A standardized plan should be used for monitoring that includes evaluation of symptoms, side effects, adherence, and measurement of testosterone and hematocrit. Shared decision making should be used to determine whether to screen for prostate cancer and informed by age, baseline cancer risk, and patient preference.

### Efficacy over time of LHRH analogs in the treatment of PCa – a prospective analysis using serum testosterone to determine dosing intervals [^c360bb98]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the duration of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen suppression after each dose of a 4-month depot leuprolide acetate for 18 months and to assess the potential for using serum testosterone as a guide for redosing the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs instead of using fixed dosing intervals. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs are well established for the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). However, many open questions remain regarding the optimal dosing.

Methods

Thirteen patients with PCa were enrolled in a longitudinal study. Serum testosterone levels were obtained at baseline and then monthly beginning 4 months after the first injection and every 2 months after the subsequent injections, for a total of 18 months. The median number of days from injection to the first serum testosterone level > or = 50 ng/dL was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method.

Results

The median duration of effect was 159, 189, and 163 days for the first, second, and third treatment cycle, respectively. The prostate-specific antigen values from entry to completion decreased in all subjects. The total number of injections was reduced in all but one subject who completed the 18-month trial. One patient developed hormone-refractory PCa.

Conclusions

Serum testosterone measurement might be a useful method for redosing luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs. Using testosterone levels to determine the time of reinjection has a significant economic impact. Monitoring serum testosterone not only helps to identify patients who fail to achieve testosterone suppression but also provides close monitoring for the potential development of hormone-refractory PCa.

### Determining dosing intervals for luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists based on serum testosterone levels: a prospective study [^8829e82c]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Long acting luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists are the predominant form of androgen suppression in the treatment of prostate cancer with the goal of maintaining castrate levels of testosterone. Current dosing of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists does not include monitoring the end organ response of serum testosterone. Recent evidence suggests standard dosing regimens fail to achieve castrate levels of testosterone in some patients while in other patients testosterone can remain at castrate levels longer than the manufacturer recommended dosing interval. We prospectively evaluated patients with prostate cancer receiving luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist hormonal therapy to determine the length of time that serum testosterone remains at or below castrate levels.

Materials and Methods

A 3-month dose of 22.5 mg leuprolide was administered to all patients as a first dose followed by a second dose 3 months later. Serum testosterone and prostate specific antigen were measured prospectively before starting hormonal therapy, after the first dose (12 weeks) and again following the second dose (24 weeks) to assess if castrate levels of testosterone (50 ng/dl or less) had been reached. At 24 weeks if patient serum testosterone was 50 ng/dl or less, then 22.5 mg leuprolide were not administered, and serum testosterone and prostate specific antigen were checked monthly. When serum testosterone was greater than 50 ng/dl a subsequent dose of 22.5 mg leuprolide was given. Serum testosterone and prostate specific antigen were then checked 3 months later and monthly thereafter until testosterone was greater than 50 ng/dl. Thus, the time that testosterone remained at castrate levels could be accurately established.

Results

From February 2003 to August 2005, 42 patients were treated in this manner with a median followup of 18 months (range 10 to 30). Average patient age was 77 years. Median Gleason grade was 7 (range 6 to 9). Median pretreatment prostate specific antigen was 15.1 ng/ml (range 0.6 to 433) and median posttreatment prostate specific antigen was 0.74 (less than 0.1 to 120). The median dosing interval was 6 months (range 5 to 12). Three patients had an increase in prostate specific antigen while receiving treatment despite castrate levels of testosterone. No patient required more frequent dosing than every 5 months.

Conclusions

Testosterone based luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist therapy makes empirical sense. It represents continuous androgen ablation based on the patient physiological end point, namely testosterone. Early data suggest that using serum testosterone to guide luteinizing hormone releasing hormone dosing is safe, efficacious and cost-effective. By following end organ response, patients receive individualized care and more accurate androgen suppression therapy.

Short‑acting injectable testosterone enanthate—subcutaneous (SQ) versus intramuscular (IM) delivery—shows differing pharmacokinetics: in a study comparing SQ 50 or 100 mg weekly with a single IM 200 mg dose, IM achieved the highest peak testosterone (mean 2,261 ng/dL) followed by SQ 100 mg (1,345 ng/dL) and SQ 50 mg (622 ng/dL); time‑to‑peak was 33 hours for IM versus 36 hours and 45 hours for SQ 100 and SQ 50, respectively; half‑life was 173 hours for IM versus 240 hours for SQ; and 7‑day mean testosterone values were 1,659, 896, and 422 ng/dL for IM, SQ 100, and SQ 50, respectively. The optimal dosing strategy has not been defined for short‑acting IM preparations; in general, smaller dosages at more frequent intervals are preferred, with an example starting dose of 100 mg weekly preferred to 200 mg every 2 weeks or 300‑400 mg monthly; the best time to obtain monitoring blood tests for IM testosterone has not been definitively established.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline—diagnosis of testosterone deficiency directs that clinicians should use a total testosterone level below 300 ng/dL as a reasonable cut-off in support of the diagnosis of low testosterone (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B), and that the diagnosis of low testosterone should be made only after two total testosterone measurements are taken on separate occasions with both conducted in an early morning fashion (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). The clinical diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is only made when patients have low total testosterone levels combined with symptoms and/or signs (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should consider measuring total testosterone in patients with a history of unexplained anemia, bone density loss, diabetes, exposure to chemotherapy, exposure to testicular radiation, HIV/AIDS, chronic narcotic use, male infertility, pituitary dysfunction, and chronic corticosteroid use even in the absence of symptoms or signs associated with testosterone deficiency (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). The use of validated questionnaires is not currently recommended to either define which patients are candidates for testosterone therapy or to monitor symptom response in patients on testosterone therapy (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

Testosterone therapy—prostate cancer risk evaluation and monitoring—In hypogonadal men 55 to 69 years old being considered for testosterone therapy and with a life expectancy > 10 years, we suggest discussing the potential benefits and risks of evaluating prostate cancer risk and engaging the patient in shared decision making regarding prostate cancer monitoring; for patients who choose monitoring, clinicians should assess prostate cancer risk before starting testosterone treatment and 3 to 12 months after starting testosterone. In hypogonadal men being considered for testosterone therapy who are 40 to 69 years old and at increased risk of prostate cancer, we suggest discussing prostate cancer risk with the patient and offering monitoring options, and we suggest that clinicians offer evaluation of prostate cancer risk beginning at age 40 in high-risk men; in patients who agree to monitoring, clinicians should evaluate PSA levels and perform a digital prostate examination at baseline and at 3 to 12 months after starting testosterone treatment, and after 1 year of testosterone-replacement therapy, we suggest clinicians follow guidelines for prostate cancer screening based on the age and race of the patient.

### Testosterone enanthate [^7d2805de]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Prior to initiating testosterone enanthate injection, confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism by ensuring that serum testosterone concentrations have been measured in the morning in the morning on at least two separate days and that these serum testosterone concentrations are below the normal range.

Dosage and duration of therapy with testosterone enanthate injection will depend on age, sex, diagnosis, patient’s response to treatment, and appearance of adverse effects. When properly given, injections of testosterone enanthate are well tolerated. Care should be taken to slowly inject the preparation deeply into the gluteal muscle, being sure to follow the usual precautions for intramuscular administration, such as the avoidance of intravascular injection (see PRECAUTIONS).

In general, total doses above 400 mg per month are not required because of the prolonged action of the preparation. Injections more frequently than every two weeks are rarely indicated. NOTE: Use of a wet needle or wet syringe may cause the solution to become cloudy; however this does not affect the potency of the material. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Testosterone enanthate injection is a clear, colorless to pale yellow color oily solution.

 Male hypogonadism : As replacement therapy, i.e., for eunuchism, the suggested dosage is 50 to 400 mg every 2 to 4 weeks.

 In males with delayed puberty : Various dosage regimens have been used; some call for lower dosages initially with gradual increases as puberty progresses, with or without a decrease to maintenance levels. Other regimens call for higher dosage to induce pubertal changes and lower dosage for maintenance after puberty. The chronological and skeletal ages must be taken into consideration, both in determining the initial dose and in adjusting the dose. Dosage is within the range of 50 to 200 mg every 2 to 4 weeks for a limited duration, for example, 4 to 6 months. X-rays should be taken at appropriate intervals to determine the amount of bone maturation and skeletal development (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE, and WARNINGS).

 Palliation of inoperable mammary cancer in women : A dosage of 200 to 400 mg every 2 to 4 weeks is recommended. Women with metastatic breast carcinoma must be followed closely because androgen therapy occasionally appears to accelerate the disease.

### Optimizing the role of androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer: challenges beyond the guidelines [^c76cda5b]. The Prostate (2020). Medium credibility.

The panel reached a consensus on the three options to achieve castration (bilateral orchiectomy, LHRH agonists, and LHRG antagonists), as recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. 54, 55 The panel did not reach consensus on whether combined androgen blockade (CAB) is superior to castration alone, but CAB was considered a reasonable alternative to castration alone, in agreement with the NCCN guideline. 9, 56

Unanimous consensus was reached on the role of monitoring serum testosterone (T) (Table 3). Obtaining a baseline T level before initiating ADT is essential. Subsequently, in the patient with mCSPC and CRPC, the optimal T level should be <20 ng/dL, based on several studies reviewed. 57, 58 Of note, the NCCN guideline defines castration as testosterone <50 ng/dL. 9 The panel felt that T levels should be checked 1 to 4 months after initiation of ADT, regardless of PSA levels. Once ADT is initiated and a PSA rise occurs, T levels should be obtained to distinguish noncastrate vs castrate‐resistant progression. If T levels are >20 ng/dL, clinicians should check luteinizing hormone levels to determine whether ADT was administered effectively. If T levels are >20 ng/dL despite low luteinizing hormone, consider switching to an alternative agent.

### Testosterone therapy in men with androgen deficiency syndromes: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^839a8511]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to update the guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men published previously in 2006.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and, in some men in whom total testosterone is near the lower limit of normal or in whom SHBG abnormality is suspected by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using validated assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for men with symptomatic androgen deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml or greater than 3 ng/ml in men at high risk for prostate cancer such as African-Americans or men with first-degree relatives with prostate cancer without further urological evaluation, hematocrit greater than 50%, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score above 19, or uncontrolled or poorly controlled heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

### What is the optimal therapy for young males with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism? [^020b5c6e]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), consequent to congenital or acquired disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, presents as absent/delayed/arrested sexual maturation and infertility. Optimal management includes: (a) confirmation of the diagnosis and prognosis, (b) timing and choice of therapeutic intervention and (c) consideration of future fertility prospects. Therapy is usually initiated with testosterone to induce development of secondary sexual characteristics, taking the patient (often diagnosed late) through puberty. Monitoring of the impact of the condition on long-term health and psychosocial function is necessary. Treatment is likely to be life-long, requiring regular monitoring for its optimization and avoidance of adverse responses. Induction of spermatogenesis requires either pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) or gonadotropin administration. Gonadotropins can be self-administered subcutaneously and are not inferior to the more costly GnRH. 'Reversible genetic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism' is a recently described entity which has implications for the long-term management of patients with HH.

Subcutaneous testosterone pellets (AUA guideline)—Individual pellets consist of 75 mg of testosterone, with peak total testosterone achieved 1 week after implantation (845 ng/dL) and conserved until at least week 4 (838 ng/dL); the percentage of men with total testosterone >315 ng/dL declines from 100% at 4 weeks to 86%, 75%, and 14% by 12, 20, and 24 weeks, respectively. Mean peak total testosterone levels are dose-dependent, averaging 746, 866, and 913 ng/dL with 8, 10, and 12 pellets, and most men required re-implantation after four months, with all men returning to sub therapeutic levels by six months. For re-dosing, peak level >1,000 ng/dL, reduce by 2 pellets at next insertion; <500 ng/dL, increase by 2 pellets; with this dosing, mean testosterone declined to 275 ng/dL by week 16, with only 32% having levels >315 ng/dL. Currently, the FDA recommends placement of two 75 mg pellets. Testosterone levels should be obtained at one to four weeks after insertion; subsequent levels should be assessed around three months after implantation and re-checked every two to four weeks thereafter if persistently therapeutic levels are found; although no consensus exists, it is reasonable to perform re-implantation when total testosterone levels are <400 ng/dL, and it is recommended to obtain end-of-cycle testosterone measurements prior to implantation to ensure that levels are sub-therapeutic. In a large, multi-institutional series using varied protocols (inserted pellet number ranged from 6 to >10 pellets), therapeutic levels were observed in 100% of men at 4 weeks and levels >300 ng/dL were maintained at 4 months.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^37f7ea59]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy—hemoglobin/hematocrit monitoring and polycythemia risk: Prior to offering testosterone therapy, clinicians should measure hemoglobin and hematocrit and inform patients regarding the increased risk of polycythemia (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Prior to commencing therapy, all patients should undergo a baseline measurement of Hb/Hct; if the Hct exceeds 50%, clinicians should consider withholding testosterone therapy until the etiology is explained, and while on therapy, a Hct ≥54% warrants intervention. In men with elevated Hct and high on-treatment testosterone levels, dose adjustment should be attempted as first-line management; in men with elevated Hct and low/normal on-treatment testosterone levels, measuring a SHBG level and a free testosterone level using a reliable assay is suggested. If SHBG levels are low/free testosterone levels are high, dose adjustment of the testosterone therapy should be considered, and men with elevated Hct and on-treatment low/normal total and free testosterone levels should be referred to a hematologist for further evaluation and possible coordination of phlebotomy. Polycythemia is generally defined as a hematocrit (Hct) >52%. Elevation of Hb/Hct is the most frequent adverse event related to testosterone therapy, and Hb/Hct generally rise for the first six months and then tend to plateau. Across 5 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of men with mean baseline testosterone <300 ng/dL treated for 12 weeks to 1 year, elevated Hct was more common with testosterone (OR=6.46; CI: 1.86, 22.40). Trials indicate injectable testosterone is associated with the greatest treatment-induced increases in Hb/Hct, and a meta-analysis found mean Hb increases of 1.4 mg/dL (long-acting IM), 1.6 mg/dL (short-acting IM), 0.9 mg/dL (transdermal), and 0.7 mg/dL (topical patches).

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^f0371a33]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the "Testosterone Therapy in Men With Androgen Deficiency Syndromes" guideline published in 2010.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of 10 medical content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees and members and the cosponsoring organization were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone-binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula. In men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism after discussing the potential benefits and risks of therapy and of monitoring therapy and involving the patient in decision making. We recommend against starting T therapy in patients who are planning fertility in the near term or have any of the following conditions: breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, prostate-specific antigen level > 4 ng/mL, prostate-specific antigen > 3 ng/mL in men at increased risk of prostate cancer (e.g., African Americans and men with a first-degree relative with diagnosed prostate cancer) without further urological evaluation, elevated hematocrit, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. We suggest that when clinicians institute T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in the mid-normal range during treatment with any of the approved formulations, taking into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^709187e2]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Monitoring

Total testosterone levels should be measured before initiating therapy to exclude women with midrange to high baseline testosterone concentrations. SHBG should also be measured as women with levels greater than the normal range are less likely to benefit from therapy.High SHBG can be seen in healthy women but is also associated with the use of oral estrogens, including estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives, thyroid replacement,, and untreated hyperthyroidism.In women with high SHBG with unmodifiable factors (e.g. essential thyroid replacement), a trial of testosterone therapy is still worthwhile.

Total testosterone levels should be assessed 3–6 weeks after initiating therapy to enable titration and ensure the patient is not applying an excessive dose. If the dose is increased, based on clinical response and blood level, total testosterone should be repeated within 6 weeks. Different preparations will have different absorption rates and hence different pharmacokinetics that determine when the peak blood level is achieved. As this is unknown for most products in women, the goal of testing blood levels is to prevent excessive dosing but not to treat to a target blood level of testosterone. Clinicians should ensure that the total testosterone does not significantly exceed the upper limit of the reference range for normal premenopausal women indicated by the patient's laboratory. When testosterone levels are maintained in the premenopausal range, androgenic side effects are rare. At supraphysiological levels testosterone can cause acne, hirsutism, deepening of the voice, and androgenic alopecia.Based on available safety data, if the level is supraphysiological, even in the absence of androgenic side effects, the patient should be instructed to titrate down the dose with a repeat blood test after 2–3 weeks. Serum testosterone concentrations should be monitored every 4–6 months once stable levels are achieved to screen for overuse with the inherent downstream androgenic consequences.

Further individualization may be considered based on trough testosterone levels at the end of a 10-week injection cycle. For trough total testosterone levels <300 ng/dL, the interval may be decreased by 1 week (to 9 weeks) until trough total testosterone levels >300 ng/dL are achieved at the end of an injection period; for trough total testosterone levels >600 ng/dL, the interval may be prolonged by 1 week (11 weeks) until trough total testosterone levels <600 ng/dL are noted at the end of an injection period.

### Testosterone cypionate [^7625228f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Prior to initiating testosterone cypionate, confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism by ensuring that serum testosterone concentrations have been measured in the morning on at least two separate days and that these serum testosterone concentrations are below the normal range.

Testosterone cypionate injection is for intramuscular use only.

It should not be given intravenously. Intramuscular injections should be given deep in the gluteal muscle.

The suggested dosage for testosterone cypionate injection varies depending on the age, sex, and diagnosis of the individual patient. Dosage is adjusted according to the patient's response and the appearance of adverse reactions.

Various dosage regimens have been used to induce pubertal changes in hypogonadal males; some experts have advocated lower dosages initially, gradually increasing the dose as puberty progresses, with or without a decrease to maintenance levels. Other experts emphasize that higher dosages are needed to induce pubertal changes and lower dosages can be used for maintenance after puberty. The chronological and skeletal ages must be taken into consideration, both in determining the initial dose and in adjusting the dose.

For replacement in the hypogonadal male, 50 to 400 mg should be administered every two to four weeks.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Warming and shaking the vial should redissolve any crystals that may have formed during storage at temperatures lower than recommended.

### Bipolar androgen therapy (BAT): a patient's guide [^2bcf136b]. The Prostate (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4 What is BAT?

BAT is a new treatment approach for asymptomatic men with castration‐resistant prostate cancer. BAT involves administration of sufficient amounts of testosterone to rapidly achieve a higher than normal level (i.e. supraphysiologic) of testosterone in the blood (Figure 3). The normal level of testosterone in the blood of a 70‐year‐old‐man is 300–400 ng/dl. The testosterone level in a man on ADT is <50 ng/dl. BAT is achieved by injecting a long‐lasting (depot) generic form of testosterone known as testosterone cypionate into the muscle of the buttocks every 28 days. The dose of testosterone cypionate is 400 mg. This is considered a high dose of testosterone but this dosage is within the FDA‐approved dose range of this drug. The term “bipolar androgen therapy” was coined to reflect the fact that over a 28‐day treatment cycle, the blood levels of testosterone oscillate between the polar extremes of supraphysiologic (1000–3000 ng/dl) to nearly castrate (100–200 ng/dl). In order for this to occur, all patients should continue to receive concurrent ADT throughout treatment with BAT, and ADT should not be stopped when BAT is administered.

American Urological Association (AUA) testosterone deficiency—therapeutic targets and dose escalation: The target levels suggested here are physiological (eugonadal) not supraphysiological, and the Panel found no data to support dose escalation into the supraphysiological range in the pursuit of greater efficacy. Clinicians are encouraged to aim for on-treatment total testosterone levels in the 450-600 ng/dL target range and re-evaluate signs after reaching the therapeutic range. For men whose on-treatment testosterone levels fall below the suggested target range but who have complete resolution of symptoms, there is no need to titrate dosing. In healthy older men given graded intramuscular testosterone enanthate doses (25, 50, 125, 300 and 600 mg weekly), higher rates of serious adverse events occurred with the 300 mg and 600 mg weekly doses.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Prior to initiating, TESTOPEL®(testosterone pellets) confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism by ensuring that serum testosterone concentrations have been measured in the morning on at least two separate days and that these serum testosterone concentrations are below the normal range.

The suggested dosage for androgens varies depending on the age,
and diagnosis of the individual patient. Dosage is adjusted according to
the patient’s response and the appearance of adverse reactions. The
dosage guideline for the testosterone pellets for replacement therapy in
androgen-deficient males is 150mg to 450mg subcutaneously every 3 to 6
months. Various dosage regimens have been used to induce pubertal
changes in hypogonadal males; some experts have advocated lower doses
initially, gradually increasing the dose as puberty progresses, with or
without a decrease in maintenance levels. Other experts emphasize that
higher dosages are needed to induce pubertal changes and lower dosages
can be used for maintenance after puberty. The chronological and
skeletal ages must be taken into consideration, both in determining the
initial dose and in adjusting the dose.

Dosages in delayed puberty generally are in the lower range of
that listed above and, for a limited duration, for example 4 to 6
months.

The number of pellets to be implanted depends upon the minimal
daily requirements of testosterone propionate determined by a gradual
reduction of the amount administered parenterally. The usual dosage is
as follows: implant two 75mg pellets for each 25mg testosterone
propionate required weekly. Thus when a patient requires injections of
75mg per week, it is usually necessary to implant 450mg (6 pellets).
With injections of 50mg per week, implantation of 300mg (4 pellets) may
suffice for approximately three months. With lower requirements by
injection, correspondingly lower amounts may be implanted. It has been
found that approximately one-third of the material is absorbed in the
first month, one-fourth in the second month and one-sixth in the third
month. Adequate effect of the pellets ordinarily continues for three to
four months, sometimes as long as six months.

### Study of testosterone-guided androgen deprivation therapy in management of prostate cancer [^93905d79]. The Prostate (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists is an effective initial therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer. LHRH agonists are usually administered indefinitely at a fixed interval.

Methods

We recruited men with advanced prostate cancer who had been on fixed-schedule injections of an LHRH agonist for ≥1 year and had castrate serum testosterone [<1.75nmol/l (approx. 50ng/ml)]. Testosterone levels were measured at 6-week intervals and ADT was withheld until testosterone levels were no longer in the castrate range and then reinstituted. Time to reinstitution of ADT was the primary outcome and was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method; Cox regression was used to identify factors predicting delay in reinstitution of treatment. Influence on quality-of-life (QoL) was evaluated by the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC).

Results

Forty-six evaluable men who had received LHRH agonist injections every 12 weeks were recruited. Median time to testosterone recovery (defined as testosterone outside the defined castrate level) after previous injection was >1 year. In univariable analysis, lower baseline testosterone [≤1 vs. >1nmol/l (approx. 30ng/dl)] and longer time on ADT (>5 vs. ≤5 years) predicted for prolonged time to testosterone recovery, but only lower baseline testosterone remained significant in multivariable analysis (Hazard Ratio=5.2, P=0.03). Overall EPIC scores remained stable but improvement from baseline was observed in the hormonal domain (P=0.002). Median per-patient saving in cost was approximately USD 3,100 (1,050-6,200).

Conclusions

Testosterone-guided ADT reduces exposure to LHRH agonists, with reduction in cost and improvement in some symptoms from ADT. Testosterone-guided ADT should be considered an alternative to fixed schedule treatment by physicians and policy makers.

### Testosterone therapy and prostate cancer: incorporating low-level evidence into practical recommendations [^e3efd093]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The widely accepted absolute contraindication for administration of testosterone in hypogonadal men with prostate cancer has been questioned. Although recommendations from some professional associations still adhere to the traditional concepts, there is increasing relaxation of such positions. Currently, the evidence for definitive guidelines is unavailable and the clinician has to rely on incomplete but best attainable information. Under certain circumstances (successfully treated prostate cancer or active surveillance for low risk disease), testosterone administration is warranted. For those with intermediate or high-risk cancer, extreme caution seems advisable. The benefits must heavily outweigh the hazards. Ideally, these men should participate in clinical trials and registries. Competent initial assessment of individual circumstances and follow-up are mandatory.

### Optimizing diagnostic accuracy and treatment decisions in men with testosterone deficiency [^3a82bb0a]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This narrative review offers a guideline-based approach for optimizing diagnostic evaluation and treatment decision making in men being evaluated for testosterone deficiency.

Methods

A narrative review.

Results

Testosterone deficiency is a clinical syndrome that results from the inability of the testes to produce normal amounts of testosterone and is characterized by a constellation of symptoms and signs associated with consistently low testosterone concentrations. The diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is made by the ascertainment of symptoms and signs; the measurement of total and, if indicated, free testosterone levels in early-morning fasting samples on ≥2 days; the measurement of luteinizing hormone and follicular-stimulating hormone levels to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism; and an additional evaluation to ascertain the cause of testosterone deficiency. Nonspecificity of symptoms and signs, variations in testosterone levels over time, inaccuracy in the measurement of total and free testosterone levels, variations in binding protein concentrations, and suboptimal reference ranges contribute to diagnostic inaccuracy. Testosterone treatment is indicated for men with symptomatic testosterone deficiency. Testosterone treatment should be avoided in men with prostate or breast cancer, erythrocytosis, thrombophilia, increased risk of prostate cancer or severe lower urinary tract symptoms without prior urologic evaluation, a recent major adverse cardiovascular event, uncontrolled heart failure, or severe untreated sleep apnea. Testosterone replacement therapy should be accompanied by a standardized monitoring plan.

Conclusion

A shared decision of the patient and physician to treat should be guided by the consideration of the burden of symptoms, potential benefits and risks, patient's values, and the cost and burden of long-term treatment and monitoring.

American College of Physicians GRADE framework—grading certainty of evidence and recommendations is defined as follows: High certainty is described as “Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect,” Moderate certainty is “Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different,” and Low certainty is “Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect.” Recommendation strength includes Strong, where there is “Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa,” it “Applies to most patients in most circumstances,” and “Only strong recommendations should be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs”; and Conditional, where “Benefits probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty,” it “Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients’ values and preferences,” and “Policy making will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place.”

### The current status of therapy for symptomatic late-onset hypogonadism with transdermal testosterone gel [^f6bb8970]. European Urology (2005). Low credibility.

For over 50 years, testosterone therapy has been used for the treatment of hypogonadism. In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of testosterone therapy for men with late-onset hypogonadism, as more convenient and effective modes of application are developed. Testosterone therapy in these men can significantly improve their sense of well-being, and lead to increases in muscle and bone mass, upper body strength, virility and libido [Gruenewald, Matsumoto. J Am Geriatr Soc 2003;51:101; Morales. Aging Male 2004; in press]. However, ensuring that optimal testosterone therapy is achieved in men with hypogonadism remains challenging. Oral delivery of unmodified testosterone is not possible, due to rapid first-pass metabolism and its short half-life. Therefore, different derivatives and formulations of testosterone have been developed to enhance potency, prolong duration of action or improve bioavailability. In addition, several different routes of administration have now been evaluated, including intramuscular injections, oral formulations, transdermal patches, transbuccal systems and transdermal testosterone gel. Despite the broad range of testosterone therapy on offer, each form has its benefits and limitations, and some will suit one patient more than another. An important concern among clinicians is that testosterone therapy may cause or promote prostate cancer. While current evidence supports the safety of testosterone therapy, androgens are growth factors for pre-existing prostate cancer. Therefore, before therapy is initiated, careful digital rectal examination and determination of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in serum should be performed, in order to exclude evident or suspected prostate cancer. The first 3-6 months after initiating testosterone therapy is the most critical time for monitoring effects on the prostate. Therefore, it is important to monitor PSA levels every 3 months for the first year of treatment; thereafter, regular monitoring (mostly for prostate safety but also for cardiovascular and haematological safety) during therapy is mandatory.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hypogonadism in adult male patients – 2002 update [^d40bff06]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

In these clinical practice guidelines, specific recommendations are made for determining the most effective methods of diagnosing and treating hypogonadism in adult male patients. The target populations for these guidelines include the following: (1) men with primary testicular failure requiring testosterone replacement (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism); (2) male patients with gonadotropin deficiency or dysfunction who may have received testosterone replacement therapy or treatment for infertility (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism); and (3) aging men with symptoms relating to testosterone deficiency who could benefit from testosterone replacement therapy. Initial hormonal evaluation generally consists of a testosterone determination, in conjunction with a free testosterone or sex hormone-binding globulin level, inpatients with clear symptoms and signs but normal-range total testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin levels. Other possible tests include semen analysis, pituitary imaging studies, genetic studies, bone densitometry, testicular ultrasonography,testicular biopsy, and specialized hormonal dynamic testing. Therapeutic options generally consist of testosterone replacement by injections, patches, or topically applied gel in hypergonadotropic patients and in hypogonadotropic patients not interested in fertility. In hypogonadotropic patients interested in fertility, gonadal stimulation option scan be considered, including human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation therapy with or without human menopausal gonadotropin (or follicle-stimulating hormone) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone pump therapy. These therapies may be combined with assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection, which may allow pregnancy to occur with very low numbers of sperm.

### Testosterone therapy in adult men with androgen deficiency syndromes: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^5761005d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a professional writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

The Task Force used systematic reviews of available evidence to inform its key recommendations. The Task Force used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of recommendation and the quality of evidence, using the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during three group meetings, several conference calls, and e-mail communications. The drafts prepared by the panelists with the help of a professional writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Committee, and Council. The version approved by the Council was placed on The Endocrine Society's web site for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and in some patients by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using accurate assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for symptomatic men with androgen deficiency, who have low testosterone levels, to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 3 ng/ml without further urological evaluation, erythrocytosis (hematocrit > 50%), hyperviscosity, untreated obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) greater than 19, or class III or IV heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

### The chronobiology of hormone administration: "Doctor, what time should I take my medication? " [^29c95845]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 3. 
Testosterone formulations

In regards to chronotherapy, morning administration of transdermal formulations is theoretically more advisable, as this better mimics the physiological diurnal rhythm of testosterone. However, since bedtime administration may be associated with higher patients’ compliance, more studies are needed to clarify if this may represent a feasible and effective alternative. Long-acting, depot preparations offer the significant benefit of bimonthly or quarterly administration, but they inherently lack the ability to accommodate diurnal rhythms, and there is no guidance on the daily timing of their administration. While this characteristic might make them less suitable for chronotherapy, the practical benefits of less frequent dosing often outweigh this limitation (Fig. 1B).

Values and preferences in diagnosis: Our diagnostic strategy reflects our preference to avoid labeling men as having hypogonadism and requiring T therapy based on low T concentrations due to transient medical disorders, biological variations in T concentrations, technical variations and inaccuracy in T measurements, or SHBG abnormalities. Our strategy also reflects our preference to avoid treating men without symptoms and signs of T deficiency or without unequivocally low T concentrations when the benefits and risks of T therapy remain unclear.

### Circulating testosterone as the hormonal basis of sex differences in athletic performance [^3a1d918d]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

In addition, the effects of testosterone are modulated in a form of fine tuning by the patterns of exposure, such as whether the circulating testosterone is delivered in the unphysiological steady-state format (e.g. quasi–steady-state delivery by implant or transdermal products) or by the peak-and-trough delivery of injections, as opposed to the natural state of endogenous fluctuations in serum testosterone around the average adult male levels. However, these latter pattern effects are subtle and the dominant effect remains that of dose and average testosterone concentrations in blood, however they arise. Furthermore, there is evidence that the androgen sensitivity of responsive tissues differs and may be optimal at different circulating testosterone concentrations.

Male sexual function is maintained by endogenous testosterone at adult male circulating concentrations. These effects can be replicated by exogenous testosterone if and only if it achieves comparable circulating testosterone concentrations. For example, in a well-controlled prospective study of older men with prostate cancer, androgen deprivation achieving castrate levels of circulating testosterone sustained during 12 months markedly suppressed sexual desire and function, whereas those effects did not occur in age-matched men having nonhormonal treatment of prostate cancer or those without prostate cancer. In healthy younger men whose endogenous testosterone was fully suppressed, sexual function completely recovered when circulating testosterone was restored to the physiological male range by administration of exogenous testosterone. Similar effects were also observed in healthy, middle-aged men in whom male sexual function was fully maintained (compared with placebo) during 2 years of treatment with an exogenous androgen (DHT) despite that treatment causing sustained, complete suppression of endogenous testosterone. This further supports the key interpretation that the biological effects of exogenous or endogenous testosterone are the same at comparable circulating levels.

Subsequent trial assessments

Once the baseline visit is completed and he has received his first testosterone injection, every subject will be asked to return to either our centre or his local doctor every 4 weeks for further injections, see also Fig. 1. Every 24–28 weeks, he will also have a follow-up visit at the same time. The evaluations in this study will be carried out as part of standard care for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy but will also be part of the study protocol and follow-up. Both medical care and research will be carried out at the same visit.

Fig. 1 
Testosterone study flowchart

At each 4-weekly visit, the dosage of the testosterone may be increased depending on the regimen. This is the normal way to give testosterone to boys with pubertal delay, to try and match what the body would normally do, as closely as possible. If a subject experiences side effects due to the study drug, this will be documented and the study doctor may decide to interrupt or reduce the testosterone dose that he is receiving. Where possible, testosterone injections will also be given at study visits, to minimise inconvenience to participants.

12 weekly follow-up visits at 12, 40, 64 and 92 weeks: (at CRF or with local doctor)

Testosterone level
Pulse and blood pressure, skin examination
Concomitant medications and adverse events recorded

### The chronobiology of hormone administration: "Doctor, what time should I take my medication? " [^e77421ac]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Intramuscular (IM) preparations of T are available, thanks to the esterification of the 17β carbon of natural T, which otherwise would have lower solubility and an approximate t 1/2 of 10 minutes when injected. Approved IM preparations are T cypionate, T enanthate, T propionate, and T undecanoate. They are injected at a frequency of once weekly to once every 14 weeks, depending on the formulation, with the most rapid and significant peaks in serum T levels reached within days of the injection when administering short-acting formulations. The PK of short-acting and very short-acting formulations, such as propionate, cypionate, and enanthate parental T formulations, might cause significant fluctuations in serum T concentrations over the period of administration. Supraphysiological peaks might increase the risk of adverse effects, especially polycythemia, but even changes in libido and mood, particularly in fragile populations. These effects are the same experienced by anabolic steroid androgen abusers and include the inhibition of the gonadotropic axis responsible for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and infertility in men and masculinization, hirsutism, and anovulation in women. On the other hand, long-acting parental T formulation, such as T undecanoate, seems to restore serum T concentrations in the normal range, with a better safety profile and without showing supratherapeutic peaks, and with fewer administrations needed, a fact that might relieve the patient from having daily reminders of having a chronic disease. Using longer-lasting formulations and increasing the interval between administrations is a common strategy, particularly when hematocrit and T levels are at the upper limit of the reference range or when LH is suppressed, to overcome supraphysiological levels caused by IM injections. Moreover, it has been suggested that T undecanoate, due to its PK, when employed in the gender-affirming hormonal therapy of assigned females at birth transgender patients, may provide a more sustained gonadotropin suppression and result in less aromatization to estradiol, compared with gel formulations (Table 3).

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^53e38d9c]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

There has been a marked increase in testosterone prescriptions in the past decade resulting in a growing need to give practicing clinicians proper guidance on the evaluation and management of the testosterone deficient patient.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review utilized research from the Mayo Clinic Evidence Based Practice Center and additional supplementation by the authors. Evidence-based statements were based on body of evidence strength Grade A, B, or C and were designated as Strong, Moderate, and Conditional Recommendations with additional statements presented in the form of Clinical Principles or Expert Opinions (table 1 in supplementary unabridged guideline, http://jurology.com/).

Results

This guideline was developed by a multi-disciplinary panel to inform clinicians on the proper assessment of patients with testosterone deficiency and the safe and effective management of men on testosterone therapy. Additional statements were developed to guide the clinician on the appropriate care of patients who are at risk for or have cardiovascular disease or prostate cancer as well as patients who are interested in preserving fertility.

Conclusions

The care of testosterone deficient patients should focus on accurate assessment of total testosterone levels, symptoms, and signs as well as proper on-treatment monitoring to ensure therapeutic testosterone levels are reached and symptoms are ameliorated. Future longitudinal observational studies and clinical trials of significant duration in this space will improve diagnostic techniques and treatment of men with testosterone deficiency as well as provide more data on the adverse events that may be associated with testosterone therapy.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline—testosterone measurement timing, variability, and illness effects—Among men with traditional (10p.m. to 6a.m.) sleep patterns, peak testosterone values occur around 8a.m., with 32-39% of the diurnal total decline occurring within the first 30 minutes of waking, and total testosterone values obtained at 4p.m. in men aged 30-40 years were 20-25% lower than measurements taken at 8a.m., while men aged 70 years experienced only a 10% decline between the two time points. Intra-individual testosterone variability is significant, as repeat measures can fluctuate 65-153% between tests and using 2 or 3 measures can reduce this variability by 30-43%, respectively; to minimize these effects, two morning draws for testosterone are recommended before any clinical intervention. In acute respiratory infections in young men, mean total testosterone levels declined by 10%, with some cohorts experiencing reductions of up to 30%.

### How would you manage this male patient with hypogonadism?: grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^1c0decb1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Male hypogonadism is defined as an abnormally low serum testosterone concentration or sperm count. As men age, often in the context of obesity and other comorbid conditions, serum testosterone levels may decrease. Normalizing serum testosterone levels in male adults with hypogonadism may improve symptoms related to androgen deficiency, but controversies exist regarding the long-term benefits and risks of hormone supplementation in this setting. In 2020, the American College of Physicians published a clinical guideline for the use of testosterone supplementation in adult men based on a systematic review of available evidence. Among their recommendations were that clinicians discuss whether to initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction who want to improve sexual function and not initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone to improve energy, vitality, physical function, or cognition. Here, two clinicians with expertise in this area, one a generalist and the other an endocrinologist, debate the management of a patient with sexual symptoms and a low serum testosterone level. They discuss the diagnosis of male hypogonadism, the indications for testosterone therapy, its potential benefits and risks, how it should be monitored, and how long it should be continued.

3.7 The role of ADT in metastatic castrate‐resistant prostate cancer

Metastatic castrate‐resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) has been defined as men with PC on ADT with T level <50 ng/dL, a rising PSA (defined as two consecutive rises, ≥4 weeks apart), and radiographic evidence of metastatic disease on imaging studies. 72 However, based on current literature, the panel agreed unanimously that the goal of ADT should be to achieve a T level <20 ng/dL, which differs from the NCCN guideline treatment goal of maintain T levels <50 ng/dL. 9 There was no consensus on a value‐based model of ADT continuation, that is, whether ADT could be stopped once castrate levels are reached and then to check T levels every 3 months (restarting ADT if T rises ≥20 ng/dL). The American Society of Clinical Oncology and NCCN recommend that ADT should be continued indefinitely in the setting of mPC despite the development of castration resistance. 9, 73 But a survey of PC physicians from five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) found that up to one third of physicians used chemotherapy as a monotherapy and stopped administering ADT after the development of castration resistance. 74 The panel did not endorse discontinuing ADT after emergence of castration‐resistant disease.

In the context of mCRPC, the panel agreed unanimously that T should be checked at the time of diagnosis of castration resistance, when changing therapy, and if PSA is rising (to confirm castrate levels of T, ie, <20 ng/dL). PSA measures and CT/bone scans should also be obtained at regular intervals (Table 5). These recommendations are in accordance with the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group recommendations. 72, 75

### The impact of late luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist dosing on testosterone suppression in patients with prostate cancer: an analysis of United States clinical data [^b1f0bef4]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the timeliness of androgen deprivation therapy dosing, the impact of dosing nonadherence on testosterone, and the frequency of testosterone and prostate specific antigen testing in patients with prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the records of 22,860 patients with prostate cancer treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists. Analyses were done using 2 definitions of month, including a 28-day month (late dosing after day 28, 84, 112 or 168) and an extended month (late after day 32, 97, 128 or 194) for 1, 3, 4 and 6-month formulations, respectively. The prevalence of late dosing, associated testosterone values, and the frequency of testosterone and prostate specific antigen testing were assessed. Statistical significance was assessed with the unpaired t-test.

Results

Of the injections 84% and 27% were late for the 28-day and extended month analyses, respectively. For the 28-day month 60% and 29% of injections were late by more than 1 and more than 2 weeks, respectively. Of testosterone values 4% were greater than 50 ng/dl for early/on time injections using both definitions, and 15% and 27% were greater than 50 ng/dl when late, and for the 28-day month and the extended month, respectively. For early/on time vs late injections 22% vs 31% of testosterone values were greater than 20 ng/dl for the 28-day month and 21% vs 43% for the extended month. Mean testosterone was higher when late ( 49 ng/dl for 28-day month, 79 ng/dl for extended month) vs early/on time (both 21 ng/dl). Of the injections prostate specific antigen measurements were performed in 83% and testosterone assessment was done in only 13%.

Conclusions

Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists were frequently (84%) administered later than the schedules used in pivotal trials. Nearly half of the late testosterone values for the extended month were greater than 20 ng/dl and mean testosterone was almost double the castration level. Elevated testosterone remained unidentified with infrequent testing.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^ae5d6ba5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary and Key Messages

The international panel concluded the only evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy for women is for the treatment of HSDD, with available data supporting a moderate therapeutic effect. There are insufficient data to support the use of testosterone for the treatment of any other symptom or clinical condition, or for disease prevention.

Meta-analyses of the available data show no severe adverse events during physiological testosterone use, with the caveat that women at high cardiometabolic risk were excluded from study populations. The safety of long-term testosterone therapy has not been established.

It was considered of utmost importance that the diagnosis of HSDD involves a full clinical assessment and that other factors contributing to FSD must be identified and addressed before testosterone therapy is initiated. A blood total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD. Treatment should only be with formulations that achieve blood concentrations of testosterone that approximate premenopausal physiological concentrations. Because no approved female product is presently approved by a national regulatory body, male formulations can be judiciously used in female doses and blood testosterone concentrations must be monitored regularly. The panel recommended against the use of compounded testosterone.

The panel highlighted the pressing need for more research into testosterone therapy for women and the development and licensing of products indicated specifically for women.

### Testosterone measurement in patients with prostate cancer [^8f296fd8]. European Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Serum testosterone measurement has no widely accepted place in the management of patients with prostate cancer (PCa). However, several potential clinical applications of serum testosterone determination can be envisaged.

Objective

To review the role of testosterone and the androgen axis in the natural history of PCa and evaluate the evidence for the clinical application of serum testosterone measurement in patient screening, diagnosis, and management.

Evidence Acquisition

A Medline search retrieved original research and review articles relating to the androgen axis in PCa and the use of testosterone measurement for (1) assessing PCa risk in the general population, (2) adding to the specificity of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, (3) determining tumour aggressiveness, (4) assessing the efficacy of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), and (5) optimising the scheduling of intermittent ADT. Relevant data were reviewed during a roundtable discussion, and consensus recommendations were agreed.

Evidence Synthesis

A body of data implicates the androgen axis in PCa throughout its natural history. Based on current evidence, serum testosterone measurement cannot be recommended for determining PCa risk, increasing specificity of PSA testing, or assessing tumour aggressiveness. In contrast, for patients receiving ADT, there is a clear rationale for serum testosterone monitoring to ensure that castration levels are achieved. Practical recommendations for testosterone measurement during ADT are outlined. If PSA is rising while on ADT, castration levels of serum testosterone must be demonstrated before hormonal independence can be assumed. Serum testosterone levels might be considered an additional trigger for therapy reinitiation in intermittent ADT schedules. Finally, future prospective studies should further evaluate the potential relevance of testosterone measurement as an independent assessment of prognosis and treatment decision in different disease stages.

Conclusions

As a therapeutic target, serum testosterone levels should be monitored to verify response to ADT and confirm suspected castration independence.

III. Clinical care of postmenopausal women

(11) Recommendations regarding full assessment of FSD before commencing testosterone therapy FSD including HSDD, FSAD, and orgasmic disorder/dysfunction have multiple etiologies including biopsychosocial factors such as neuroendocrine imbalance, physical ill health or disease, interpersonal difficulties, psychological distress, and sexually repressive cultural or religious values (Grade C). Treatments should follow this biopsychosocial model and include pharmacologic options (hormone therapies and other pharmacologic agents), psychotherapy, or multimodal treatments that combine both (Grade B).

(12) Recommendations regarding current testosterone therapy and postmenopausal women The only evidence-based indication for the use of testosterone in women is for the treatment of postmenopausal women who have been diagnosed as having HSDD after formal biopsychosocial assessment (Level I, Grade A). There is an unmet need for the provision and approval of testosterone treatments specific to women, formulated with the aim of approximating physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women (Expert Opinion). Where an appropriate approved female testosterone preparation is not available, off-label, prescribing of an approved male formulation is reasonable, provided hormone concentrations are maintained in the physiologic female range (Expert Opinion). Compounded “bioidentical” testosterone therapy cannot be recommended for the treatment of HSDD because of the lack of evidence for efficacy and safety, unless an authorized equivalent preparation is not available (Expert Opinion). In the absence of an available approved product, if a compounded product is needed, the compounding pharmacy should be compliant with purity of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Good Manufacturing Practice to meet industry standards for quality and safety. Dosing should be limited to achieving testosterone concentrations in the physiologic premenopausal range. Use of any testosterone preparation that results in supraphysiologic concentrations of testosterone, including pellets and injections, is not recommended (Expert Opinion). Should a trial of testosterone therapy be given for HSDD, a baseline total testosterone concentration should be measured before commencement, with a repeat level 3–6 weeks after treatment initiation (Level IIA, Grade C). Patients should be monitored for their clinical response to treatment and assessed for signs of androgen excess with a serum total testosterone level every 6 months, to screen for overuse (Expert Opinion). If no benefit is experienced by 6 months, treatment should be ceased (Level IB, Grade C).

### Testosterone cypionate (depo-testosterone) [^2bf4bd45]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Prior to initiating DEPO-Testosterone (testosterone cypionate), confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism by ensuring that serum testosterone concentrations have been measured in the morning on at least two separate days and that these serum testosterone concentrations are below the normal range.

DEPO-Testosterone Injection is for intramuscular use only.

It should not be given intravenously. Intramuscular injections should be given deep in the gluteal muscle.

The suggested dosage for DEPO-Testosterone Injection varies depending on the age, sex, and diagnosis of the individual patient. Dosage is adjusted according to the patient’s response and the appearance of adverse reactions.

Various dosage regimens have been used to induce pubertal changes in hypogonadal males; some experts have advocated lower dosages initially, gradually increasing the dose as puberty progresses, with or without a decrease to maintenance levels. Other experts emphasize that higher dosages are needed to induce pubertal changes and lower dosages can be used for maintenance after puberty. The chronological and skeletal ages must be taken into consideration, both in determining the initial dose and in adjusting the dose.

For replacement in the hypogonadal male, 50 - 400 mg should be administered every two to four weeks.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Warming and shaking the vial should redissolve any crystals that may have formed during storage at temperatures lower than recommended.

### Testosterone therapy with subcutaneous injections: a safe, practical, and reasonable option [^f43e7a0d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Injections with intramuscular (IM) testosterone esters have been available for almost 8 decades and not only result in predictable serum testosterone levels but are also the most inexpensive modality. However, they are difficult to self-administer and associated with some discomfort. Recently, subcutaneous (SC) administration of testosterone esters has gained popularity, as self-administration is easier with this route. Available data, though limited, support the feasibility of this route. Here we review the pharmacokinetics and safety of SC testosterone therapy with both long- and ultralong-acting testosterone esters. In addition, we provide guidance for clinicians on how to counsel and manage their patients who opt for the SC route.

Evidence Acquisition

Systematic review of available literature on SC testosterone administration including clinical trials, case series, and case reports. We also review the pharmacology of testosterone absorption after SC administration.

Evidence Synthesis

Available evidence, though limited, suggests that SC testosterone therapy in doses similar to those given via IM route results in comparable pharmacokinetics and mean serum testosterone levels. With appropriate training, patients should be able to safely self-administer testosterone esters SC with relative ease and less discomfort compared with the IM route.

Conclusion

Although studies directly comparing the safety of SC vs IM administration of testosterone esters are desirable, clinicians should consider discussing the SC route with their patients because it is easier to self-administer and has the potential to improve patient adherence.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^38357140]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

There are no clearly established indications for testosterone therapy for women. Nonetheless, clinicians have treated women with testosterone for decades, with the intention of alleviating a variety of symptoms, with uncertain benefits and risks. In most countries, testosterone therapy is prescribed off-label such that women are using either testosterone formulations approved for men with dose modification, or compounded therapies. Because of these issues, there is a compelling case for a global consensus Position Statement on testosterone therapy for women based on the available evidence from placebo/comparator randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

This Position Statement was developed, by consensus between the participating organizations, to inform health care professionals of the known benefits and potential risks of testosterone therapy for women. The aims were to provide clear guidance as to which women might benefit from testosterone therapy, to identify symptoms, signs, and conditions for which evidence does not support the prescribing of testosterone, to explore areas of uncertainty, and to identify any prescribing practices that have the potential to cause harm.

### Use of hormone testing for the diagnosis and evaluation of male hypogonadism and monitoring of testosterone therapy: application of hormone testing guideline recommendations in clinical practice [^d1865959]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clinical practice guidelines recommend that testosterone (T) levels be measured on ≥2 occasions to confirm a diagnosis of hypogonadism, gonadotropins be measured to determine whether hypogonadism is primary or secondary, and T levels be measured to monitor the adequacy of T therapy. However, it is not known whether hormone testing as recommended by guidelines is routinely performed in real-world clinical practice.

Aim

The aim of this study was to assess the use of hormone testing for the diagnosis and evaluation of hypogonadism and monitoring of T therapy in clinical practice.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study of the Truven Health Marketscan(®) Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Insurance Databases during 2010-2012, 63,534 men over 18 years old who received T therapy and had continuous medical benefit enrollment for 1 year prior to and 6 months after T therapy initiation were included in this analysis.

Main Outcome Measures

Proportion of patients who received ≥2, 1, or no T-level determinations prior to or following T therapy initiation.

Results

Seventy-one percent of hypogonadal men had T measured at least once and 40% had≥2 tests, but only 12% of men had luteinizing hormone and/or follicle-stimulating hormone levels measured prior to T therapy initiation. Following T therapy initiation, 46% had ≥1 follow-up T measurements.

Conclusions

Appropriate use of T and gonadotropin levels in clinical practice as recommended by guidelines is suboptimal, increasing the possibility of overdiagnosis of male hypogonadism, underdiagnosis of secondary hypogonadism, and inappropriate T therapy use and management. Further investigation is needed into reasons for nonadherence to guidelines for appropriate hormone testing to inform future quality improvement efforts.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^51c064c9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index >25 kg/m2 and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### The use of injectable estradiol in transgender and gender diverse adults: a scoping review of dose and serum estradiol levels [^d035ee4c]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy is the mainstay of treatment for many transgender and gender diverse people. Injectable estradiol preparations are recommended by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health Standards of Care 8 and the Endocrine Society guidelines. Many patients prefer this route of administration, but few studies have rigorously assessed optimal dosing or route.

Methods

We performed a scoping review of the available data on estradiol levels achieved with various dosages of estradiol injections in transgender and gender diverse adults on feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy. We also report on testosterone suppression, route (ie, subcutaneous vs intramuscular), and type of injectable estradiol ester as well as timing of blood draw relative to the most recent dose, where available.

Results

The data we reviewed suggest that the current guidelines, which recommend starting doses 2 to 10 mg weekly or 5 to 30 mg every 2 weeks of estradiol cypionate or valerate, are too high and likely lead to patients having supraphysiologic levels across much of their injection cycle.

Conclusions

The optimal starting dose for injectable estradiol remains unclear and whether it should differ for cypionate and valerate. Based on the data available, we suggest that clinicians start injectable estradiol cypionate or valerate via subcutaneous or intramuscular injections at a dose ≤5 mg weekly and then titrate accordingly to keep levels within guideline-recommended range. Future studies should assess timing of injections and subsequent levels more precisely across the injection cycle and between esters.

### Adverse cardiovascular events and mortality in men during testosterone treatment: an individual patient and aggregate data meta-analysis [^cb6af744]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2022). High credibility.

Background

Testosterone is the standard treatment for male hypogonadism, but there is uncertainty about its cardiovascular safety due to inconsistent findings. We aimed to provide the most extensive individual participant dataset (IPD) of testosterone trials available, to analyse subtypes of all cardiovascular events observed during treatment, and to investigate the effect of incorporating data from trials that did not provide IPD.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials including IPD. We searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, Embase, Science Citation Index, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Review of Effects for literature from 1992 onwards (date of search, Aug 27, 2018). The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) men aged 18 years and older with a screening testosterone concentration of 12 nmol/L (350 ng/dL) or less; (2) the intervention of interest was treatment with any testosterone formulation, dose frequency, and route of administration, for a minimum duration of 3 months; (3) a comparator of placebo treatment; and (4) studies assessing the pre-specified primary or secondary outcomes of interest. Details of study design, interventions, participants, and outcome measures were extracted from published articles and anonymised IPD was requested from investigators of all identified trials. Primary outcomes were mortality, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular events at any time during follow-up. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We did a one-stage meta-analysis using IPD, and a two-stage meta-analysis integrating IPD with data from studies not providing IPD. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018111005.

Findings

9871 citations were identified through database searches and after exclusion of duplicates and of irrelevant citations, 225 study reports were retrieved for full-text screening. 116 studies were subsequently excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria in terms of study design and characteristics of intervention, and 35 primary studies (5601 participants, mean age 65 years, [SD 11]) reported in 109 peer-reviewed publications were deemed suitable for inclusion. Of these, 17 studies (49%) provided IPD (3431 participants, mean duration 9·5 months) from nine different countries while 18 did not provide IPD data. Risk of bias was judged to be low in most IPD studies (71%). Fewer deaths occurred with testosterone treatment (six [0·4%] of 1621) than placebo (12 [0·8%] of 1537) without significant differences between groups (odds ratio [OR] 0·46 [95% CI 0·17-1·24]; p=0·13). Cardiovascular risk was similar during testosterone treatment (120 [7·5%] of 1601 events) and placebo treatment (110 [7·2%] of 1519 events; OR 1·07 [95% CI 0·81-1·42]; p=0·62). Frequently occurring cardiovascular events included arrhythmia (52 of 166 vs 47 of 176), coronary heart disease (33 of 166 vs 33 of 176), heart failure (22 of 166 vs 28 of 176), and myocardial infarction (10 of 166 vs 16 of 176). Overall, patient age (interaction 0·97 [99% CI 0·92-1·03]; p=0·17), baseline testosterone (interaction 0·97 [0·82-1·15]; p=0·69), smoking status (interaction 1·68 [0·41-6·88]; p=0.35), or diabetes status (interaction 2·08 [0·89-4·82; p=0·025) were not associated with cardiovascular risk.

Interpretation

We found no evidence that testosterone increased short-term to medium-term cardiovascular risks in men with hypogonadism, but there is a paucity of data evaluating its long-term safety. Long-term data are needed to fully evaluate the safety of testosterone.
