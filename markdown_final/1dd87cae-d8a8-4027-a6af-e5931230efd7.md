## Question

where does inclusion body myositis fit in the differential in vindicate for hmgcr myopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking where inclusion body myositis (IBM) fits within the VINDICATE differential framework for anti-HMGCR immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how these two entities are classified within the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Then, I should compare their clinical phenotypes and tempo. Next, I will verify laboratory signatures, especially CK patterns and autoantibodies. After that, I'll examine muscle biopsy hallmarks. Then, I need to consider areas of overlap and diagnostic pitfalls. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach to show when IBM moves up or down the differential relative to anti-HMGCR IMNM.

> Let me first confirm classification so I don't anchor on the wrong framework. Anti-HMGCR myopathy is part of IMNM, a distinct autoimmune myopathy defined by proximal weakness, high CK that persists despite statin discontinuation, anti-HMGCR positivity, necrotizing biopsy changes, and steroid-responsive disease, whereas IBM is a separate IIM subtype, classically presenting after age 50 with combined proximal–distal weakness and characteristic biopsy features; these are not the same disease families, which already signals different diagnostic probabilities and treatment expectations [^113nydjC] [^112eNm84] [^114GSyjC] [^111KikvU] [^1154gXNN] [^112JBA3u] [^116d7z3i].

> Now, I need to compare clinical presentations side-by-side to see where IBM should rise in the differential. Anti-HMGCR IMNM often shows subacute to chronic, symmetric proximal limb weakness and is frequently, though not invariably, linked to prior statin exposure, including cases that persist long after statin cessation, while IBM evolves slowly over years with a signature pattern of distal finger flexor and quadriceps weakness in people over 50, frequently leading to mislabeling as "treatment-resistant polymyositis" when immunosuppression fails; that clinical divergence is an early triage point in thinking IBM vs anti-HMGCR IMNM [^113nydjC] [^112eNm84] [^116d7z3i] [^111KikvU] [^112JBA3u] [^111CNTp1].

> Hold on, let me verify the lab anchors next, because they often tilt the scale quickly. In anti-HMGCR IMNM, CK is usually markedly elevated, frequently in the thousands, and anti-HMGCR antibody positivity is the serologic hallmark that supports the diagnosis and guides immunotherapy, whereas IBM typically lacks anti-HMGCR and may instead have anti-cN1A antibodies; CK in IBM is often elevated but more modestly than in IMNM, so a very high CK plus anti-HMGCR positivity should push IBM down the list unless other data contradict this [^114GSyjC] [^113nydjC] [^1132bAFL].

> Next, I should review biopsy patterns because pathology often clinches the distinction. Anti-HMGCR IMNM classically shows scattered fiber necrosis and regeneration with minimal inflammation and frequent perimysial changes or C5b-9 on necrotic fibers, while IBM shows endomysial inflammatory infiltrates with CD8+ T cells invading non-necrotic fibers and the presence of rimmed vacuoles and abnormal protein aggregates; seeing rimmed vacuoles strongly directs toward IBM rather than IMNM [^112QCZDU] [^112JBA3u] [^116nCFUB]. Wait, I should be careful with the word "pathognomonic" and "excludes" here, because rare reports describe HMGCR-positive patients with biopsy read as "suggestive of IBM" and an isolated HMGCR-positive patient within an IBM cohort; these are exceptional and likely reflect diagnostic complexity rather than true overlap, but they do mean I must not overstate absolutes when biopsy and serology appear discordant [^114GSyjC] [^114r8UYY].

> I will now examine special nuances and mimics, because IBM can be misread when typical biopsy features are incomplete and anti-HMGCR IMNM can masquerade as muscular dystrophy. Anti-HMGCR myopathy may present chronically with limb-girdle phenotypes and dystrophic-appearing biopsies, which leads to frequent misclassification as LGMD until antibody testing reveals the autoimmune culprit, whereas IBM is the prototypical cause of slowly progressive distal weakness in older adults and is often mislabeled as "steroid-resistant polymyositis" or even a dystrophy when vacuoles are sparse; imaging and ultrasound can add pattern-recognition value in tough cases by showing selective muscle involvement that supports IBM [^112EtoYG] [^113Nv5rG] [^111SHyaT] [^114sxLoV].

> Let me think about therapeutic response as a diagnostic clue, but I should not let it delay appropriate treatment. Anti-HMGCR IMNM generally improves with immunosuppression, aligning with its autoimmune necrotizing biology, while IBM is notorious for refractoriness to steroids and other immunosuppressants; thus, progression despite adequate immunosuppressive therapy in an older adult with distal involvement should prompt me to reconsider IBM rather than escalating immunosuppression indefinitely [^113nydjC] [^112JBA3u] [^111CNTp1].

> Next, I should synthesize a practical diagnostic approach that shows where IBM sits relative to anti-HMGCR IMNM. In an older patient with slowly progressive weakness that includes finger flexor involvement, a modest CK, and anti-HMGCR negativity, IBM should climb toward the top of the differential, and muscle biopsy seeking endomysial CD8+ invasion and rimmed vacuoles becomes decisive, whereas in a patient with marked CK elevation, anti-HMGCR positivity, and a necrotizing pattern on biopsy with minimal inflammation, anti-HMGCR IMNM predominates; antibody panels per guideline-based practice and consideration of cN1A can refine pretest probabilities, but discordant serology–biopsy scenarios warrant re-review of tissue and clinical course before making a final call [^116d7z3i] [^112QCZDU] [^116xxHVi] [^1132bAFL].

> But wait, what if the data conflict, for example anti-HMGCR positivity with IBM-like biopsy features or an IBM clinical pattern with high-titre anti-HMGCR. I should double-check assay specificity and cutoffs, confirm the biopsy with ancillary stains and expert review, and integrate longitudinal response to therapy; earlier I implied a "definitive distinction" where anti-HMGCR positivity equals anti-HMGCR IMNM, yet I need to ensure I temper that with the rare but reported discordant cases, recognizing they likely represent misclassification rather than true pathobiologic overlap, which means re-evaluating the biopsy and clinical evolution is essential before cementing the label [^114GSyjC] [^114r8UYY] [^111LGLPx].

> Stepping back, I should summarize where IBM fits in the differential against anti-HMGCR IMNM. IBM rises to the top when the patient is over 50, the weakness pattern prominently involves distal finger flexors with concomitant quadriceps involvement, the course is slowly progressive and refractory to immunosuppression, CK elevation is modest, anti-HMGCR is negative, and biopsy shows endomysial CD8+ invasion with rimmed vacuoles, whereas anti-HMGCR IMNM moves to the forefront with marked CK elevation, anti-HMGCR positivity, symmetric proximal weakness, and a necrotizing biopsy with minimal inflammation; rare serology–histology discordances exist, so I need to verify each pillar — phenotype, serology, and pathology — before finalizing the diagnosis [^112JBA3u] [^114aWr1T] [^113nydjC] [^112QCZDU] [^114GSyjC] [^114r8UYY].

In the VINDICATE framework for HMGCR myopathy, inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a key **degenerative** mimic and must be distinguished from HMGCR myopathy because IBM is **immunotherapy-resistant** while HMGCR myopathy is immunotherapy-responsive [^113nydjC]. IBM presents with **asymmetric distal weakness** [^114aWr1T], low/normal CK, and rimmed vacuoles with endomysial inflammation on biopsy, whereas HMGCR myopathy shows **symmetric proximal weakness**, very high CK [^112pUiF1], and necrosis with minimal inflammation [^112QCZDU]. Accurate differentiation relies on **clinical pattern, CK, autoantibodies, and biopsy** [^116eo1hQ], as misdiagnosis leads to inappropriate management [^113Nv5rG].

## Clinical features and diagnostic criteria

### Inclusion body myositis (IBM)

- **Clinical presentation**: IBM typically presents in patients over 50 years old with slowly progressive, asymmetric weakness, predominantly affecting distal muscles such as finger flexors and quadriceps [^114aWr1T]. Dysphagia is common, and CK levels are usually normal or mildly elevated.

- **Histopathology**: Muscle biopsy reveals characteristic rimmed vacuoles [^112JBA3u], endomysial inflammation with CD8+ T-cell infiltration [^116nCFUB], and mitochondrial abnormalities [^112Wojiw]. These features are distinct and diagnostic for IBM [^116d7z3i].

- **Autoantibodies**: IBM is associated with anti-cN1A (NT5C1A) autoantibodies [^1132bAFL], although these are not specific and can be present in other conditions.

---

### HMGCR myopathy

- **Clinical presentation**: HMGCR myopathy typically presents with symmetric proximal muscle weakness, markedly elevated CK levels (often > 10 times normal), and persistent symptoms despite statin discontinuation [^113nydjC]. It is strongly associated with statin exposure [^113gyShc] but can occur without it [^111HrUyp].

- **Histopathology**: Muscle biopsy shows necrotizing myopathy with minimal inflammation [^112QCZDU] [^113nydjC], distinguishing it from IBM and other inflammatory myopathies [^112pUiF1].

- **Autoantibodies**: The presence of anti-HMGCR autoantibodies is highly specific for this condition [^113nydjC] and is a key diagnostic marker [^112pUiF1] [^116eo1hQ].

## Differential diagnosis within the VINDICATE framework

The **VINDICATE framework** provides a structured approach to differential diagnosis and categorizes potential causes of myopathy as follows:

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Relevance to HMGCR myopathy** |
|-|-|-|
| Vascular | - Vasculitis <br/> - Ischemic myopathy | Rarely associated with HMGCR myopathy |
| Infectious | - HIV <br/> - HTLV-1 <br/> - Viral myositis | Infectious myopathies must be excluded through serological testing [^1154gXNN] |
| Neoplastic | - Paraneoplastic myopathy | Cancer-associated myopathy should be considered, especially in older patients [^1154gXNN] |
| Degenerative | - Inclusion body myositis <br/> - Muscular dystrophies | IBM is a key degenerative mimic of HMGCR myopathy [^113Nv5rG] |
| Idiopathic | - Polymyositis <br/> - Dermatomyositis <br/> - Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy | HMGCR myopathy falls within this category |
| Congenital | - Congenital myopathies <br/> - Metabolic myopathies | Genetic testing may be required to exclude these conditions [^111hqdTo] |
| Autoimmune | - Anti-SRP myopathy <br/> - Antisynthetase syndrome | Autoimmune myopathies must be differentiated through autoantibody testing [^116xxHVi] |
| Toxic | - Statin-induced myopathy <br/> - Drug-induced myopathy | Statin exposure is a key factor in HMGCR myopathy [^113nydjC] |

---

## Distinguishing IBM from HMGCR myopathy

Because of overlapping clinical features, distinguishing IBM from HMGCR myopathy requires **careful evaluation** of clinical, laboratory, and histopathological findings:

| **Feature** | **IBM** | **HMGCR myopathy** |
|-|-|-|
| Age of onset | > 50 years [^114hZmBB] | - Any age <br/> - Often middle-aged [^114r8UYY] |
| Muscle weakness | - Asymmetric <br/> - Distal (finger flexors, quadriceps) [^114aWr1T] | - Symmetric <br/> - Proximal [^1154gXNN] |
| CK levels | Normal or mildly elevated [^112JBA3u] | Markedly elevated (> 10x normal) [^112pUiF1] |
| Autoantibodies | Anti-cN1A (NT5C1A) [^1132bAFL] | Anti-HMGCR [^113nydjC] |
| Muscle biopsy | - Rimmed vacuoles <br/> - Endomysial inflammation <br/> - Mitochondrial abnormalities | - Necrotizing myopathy <br/> - Minimal inflammation [^112QCZDU] |
| Response to immunotherapy | Poor [^114hZmBB] | Good [^113nydjC] |

## Clinical implications of misdiagnosis

Misdiagnosing IBM as HMGCR myopathy or vice versa can have **significant clinical consequences**. IBM misdiagnosed as HMGCR myopathy may lead to **unnecessary immunosuppressive therapy**, which is generally ineffective in IBM [^112JBA3u] and can cause significant side effects [^114hZmBB]. Conversely, **misdiagnosing HMGCR myopathy as IBM** may result in withholding effective immunosuppressive therapy [^113nydjC], leading to continued muscle damage and disability [^112pUiF1].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

To accurately differentiate IBM from HMGCR myopathy, the following **diagnostic approach** is recommended:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Detailed assessment of muscle weakness pattern, CK levels, and statin exposure history [^1154gXNN].

- **Autoantibody testing**: Anti-HMGCR and anti-cN1A (NT5C1A) antibodies [^116xxHVi].

- **Muscle biopsy**: Histopathological examination to identify characteristic features of IBM or HMGCR myopathy [^114CKLM1].

- **Imaging**: MRI [^114sxLoV] or ultrasound [^111SHyaT] to assess muscle involvement patterns.

---

IBM is a key **degenerative mimic** of HMGCR myopathy within the VINDICATE framework [^113Nv5rG]. Accurate differentiation relies on **clinical features, laboratory tests, and histopathological findings**, as misdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment and significant clinical consequences [^114CKLM1].

### Livalo [^113nydjC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue Livalo if IMNM is suspected.

- **Hepatic dysfunction**: Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with Livalo. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or following a brief interruption in therapy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including Livalo.

	- Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury. Consider liver enzyme testing before the initiation of Livalo and when clinically indicated thereafter. Livalo is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, further evaluation is necessary.

### Inclusion body myositis: An underdiagnosed myopathy of older people [^112JBA3u]. Age and Ageing (2006). Low credibility.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM), a condition characterized by progressive muscle weakness and inclusion bodies visible on muscle biopsy, is the most common type of myopathy in patients over 50 years of age. However, it is not only underdiagnosed but also frequently misdiagnosed as polymyositis, leading to incorrect treatment with steroids. In the evaluation of progressive weakness in older Caucasian males, IBM should be an important diagnostic consideration.

- **Treatment challenges**: Treatment-resistant 'polymyositis' in patients over 50 years of age is often IBM. If there is no histological confirmation, the diagnostic criteria allow for a category of 'possible IBM'.
Sometimes, the diagnosis is missed due to the slow progression of the disease and a lack of suspicion on the part of physicians. The following case report and literature review will explore many of these issues.

### Clinicopathological features of anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP myopathies that do not satisfy the EULAR/ACR criteria of inflammatory myopathies [^111AKbCn]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Antibody titres were not different between the possible group and the definite-possible group in both anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP antibody-positive cases. Our results are concordant with previous findings that antibody titres are useful for intra-case comparisons, but not for inter-case comparisons, and are not applicable to the inference of disease severity.

It is difficult to determine the prognosis of the possible group because most cases in this group were administered some immunosuppressants. However, two cases were followed up without treatment with any immunosuppressants, and five cases were followed up with treatment with prednisolone alone. This suggests favorable prognoses, considering that IMNM is often refractory to treatment and requires multiple immunosuppressants.

Recently, efforts have been made to optimize the myositis classification criteria. Some studies show the possibility that adding other MSAs or further diagnostic procedures, including muscle MRI, PET-CT, or EMG, may improve the sensitivity of the criteria. Considering the difficulty of classifying IMNM cases as IIMs, anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP antibodies should be included in the next classification criteria.

The limitations of this study include the following issues. First, the measurements of anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP antibodies were performed only in cases where IMNM was clinically or pathologically suspected, potentially introducing selection bias. Furthermore, we did not comprehensively measure MSAs other than anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP antibodies or myositis-associated antibodies (MAAs).

### Recurrent focal myositis developing into a generalised idiopathic inflammatory myopathy with anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase autoantibodies [^1165Nday]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 43-year-old woman with generalised idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) with anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) autoantibodies (Abs) that developed following focal myositis. Anti-HMGCR Abs are myositis-specific Abs associated with immune-mediated necrotising myopathy, a subtype of IIM characterised by relatively prominent and severe muscle involvement, generally necessitating multimodal immunosuppressant treatment. While earlier reports have described patients developing polymyositis following focal myositis, this is the first report to describe a patient developing IIM with anti-HMGCR Abs following focal myositis. Thus, clinicians should be aware of the possibility that focal myositis may develop into a generalised IIM and should instruct and monitor the patient accordingly.

### Fenofibrate [^114Smt4q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The combined use of fibric acid derivatives and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors has been associated, in numerous case reports, with rhabdomyolysis, markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, and myoglobinuria. This can lead to acute renal failure in a high proportion of cases, even in the absence of a marked pharmacokinetic interaction.

Use of fibrates alone, including fenofibrate, may occasionally be associated with myositis, myopathy, or rhabdomyolysis. Patients receiving fenofibrate and reporting muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness should undergo a prompt medical evaluation for myopathy, including serum creatine kinase level assessment. If myopathy or myositis is suspected or diagnosed, fenofibrate therapy should be discontinued.

- **Mortality**: The impact of fenofibrate on coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality, as well as non-cardiovascular mortality, has not been established.

- **Other considerations**: The Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study was a 5-year randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 9,795 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with fenofibrate. Fenofibrate demonstrated a non-significant 11% relative reduction in the primary outcome of coronary heart disease events (hazard ratio [HR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.05, p = 0.16) and a significant 11% reduction in the secondary outcome of total cardiovascular disease events (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99, p = 0.04). There was a non-significant 11% (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.29, p = 0.18) and 19% (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.57, p = 0.22) increase in total and coronary heart disease mortality, respectively, with fenofibrate.

### Muscle transcriptomics shows overexpression of cadherin 1 in inclusion body myositis [^112j25vT]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

This study aimed to elucidate the molecular features of inclusion body myositis (IBM). We performed RNA sequencing analysis of muscle biopsy samples from 67 participants, consisting of 58 myositis patients with the pathological finding of CD8-positive T cells invading non-necrotic muscle fibers expressing major histocompatibility complex class I (43 IBM, 6 polymyositis, and 9 unclassifiable myositis), and 9 controls.

Cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and pathway analysis showed that differentially expressed genes and pathways identified in IBM and polymyositis were mostly comparable. However, pathways related to cell adhesion molecules were upregulated in IBM as compared with polymyositis and controls (p < 0.01). Notably, CDH1, which encodes the epidermal cell junction protein cadherin 1, was overexpressed in the muscles of IBM. This was validated by another RNA sequencing dataset from previous publications. Western blotting confirmed the presence of mature cadherin 1 protein in the muscles of IBM. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the positivity for anti-cadherin 1 antibody in the muscles of IBM, whereas there was no muscle fiber positive for anti-cadherin 1 antibody in immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, antisynthetase syndrome, and controls. The fibers stained with anti-cadherin 1 antibody did not have rimmed vacuoles or abnormal protein accumulation. Experimental skeletal muscle regeneration and differentiation systems showed that CDH1 is expressed during skeletal muscle regeneration and differentiation.

### Highly differentiated cytotoxic T cells in inclusion body myositis [^116nCFUB]. Brain (2019). Low credibility.

Inclusion body myositis is a late-onset, treatment-refractory autoimmune disease of skeletal muscle associated with a blood autoantibody (anti-cN1A), an HLA autoimmune haplotype, and muscle pathology characterized by cytotoxic CD8+ T cell destruction of myofibres. Here, we report on translational studies of inclusion body myositis patient muscle compared with a diverse set of other muscle disease samples. Using available microarray data on 411 muscle samples from patients with inclusion body myositis (n = 40), other muscle diseases (n = 265), and without neuromuscular disease (normal, n = 106), we identified a signature of T-cell cytotoxicity in inclusion body myositis muscle coupled with a signature of highly differentiated CD8 T-cell effector memory and terminally differentiated effector cells.

Further, we examined the killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) as a marker of this population of cells, demonstrated the correlation of KLRG1 gene expression with lymphocyte cytotoxicity across 28,870 human tissue samples, and identified the presence of KLRG1 on pathogenic inclusion body myositis muscle invading T cells and an increase in KLRG1-expressing T cells in inclusion body myositis blood. We examined inclusion body myositis muscle T-cell proliferation by Ki67 immunohistochemistry, demonstrating that diseased muscle-invading T cells are minimally or non-proliferative, in accordance with known properties of highly differentiated or terminally differentiated T cells. We found low expression of KLRG1 on infection-protective human lymphoid tissue central memory T cells and autoimmunity-associated T cells.

### Myopathy with anti-HMGCR antibodies: Perimysium and myofiber pathology [^112QCZDU]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The common myopathic features involved muscle fibers and perimysial connective tissue. Muscle fiber pathology showed evidence of ongoing damage, with fibers in varied stages of necrosis (52%) and regeneration or immaturity (66%). C 5b-9 complement stained the cytoplasm of some necrotic muscle fibers but was not typically deposited on the surface of non-necrotic muscle fibers. Large clusters of contiguous damaged fibers were not present. In some muscles, immature fibers and necrosis were most prominent at the edge of fascicles near damaged or cellular perimysial connective tissue. Focal invasion of muscle fibers by cells was present in a few patients (7%).

Myonuclear pathology (43%) included enlargement, irregular shapes, empty central regions, and clusters. Perimysial connective tissue pathology was present in 61% of biopsies, with diffuse alkaline phosphatase staining, histiocytic (acid phosphatase- and esterase-positive) cells, or damaged structure. The most common general pathologic pattern (57%) was for both muscle fiber and perimysial pathology to be present. Muscles with neither muscle fiber nor perimysial pathology occurred in 25%.

Weakness was more common (p = 0.017) in patients with perimysial damage (100%) than in those without perimysial damage (77%). Anti-HMGCR antibody titers were higher in patients with muscle biopsies showing muscle fiber necrosis (19,748 ± 4,509 vs. 6,538 ± 1,249; p = 0.001) and connective tissue damage.

### Clinical features and prognosis in anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR necrotising myopathy [^114r8UYY]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to elucidate the common and distinct clinical features of immune-mediated necrotising myopathy (IMNM), known as necrotising autoimmune myopathy associated with autoantibodies against signal recognition particle (SRP) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR).

Methods used in the study included examining a cohort of 460 patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) through a muscle biopsy-oriented registration study in Japan. Study entry was strictly determined by comprehensive histological assessment to exclude other neuromuscular disorders. Anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR antibodies were detected by RNA immunoprecipitation and ELISA, respectively.

The results indicated that of the 460 patients with IIM, 73 (16%) were diagnosed as having inclusion body myositis (IBM). Among the 387 patients with IIMs other than IBM, the frequencies of anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR antibodies were 18% and 12%, respectively. One patient had both autoantibodies. Severe limb muscle weakness, neck weakness, dysphagia, respiratory insufficiency, and muscle atrophy were more frequently observed in patients with anti-SRP antibodies compared to those with anti-HMGCR antibodies. Serum creatine levels were markedly higher in patients with autoantibodies than in those without. Histology was characterised by necrosis and regeneration of muscle fibres and was consistent with IMNM, except in one HMGCR-positive IBM patient. Most patients were initially treated with corticosteroids; however, additional immunosuppressive drugs were required, especially in patients with anti-SRP antibodies. Rates of unsatisfactory neurological outcomes were observed, requiring further investigation.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dermatomyositis and polymyositis, more specifically with respect to evaluation for cardiac involvement, the BSR 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining cardiac troponin I (not cardiac troponin T) as the preferred serum marker for screening and monitoring cardiac involvement.

### Investigation of the psychometric properties of the inclusion body myositis functional rating scale with rasch analysis [^113bzhjX]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Low credibility.

The Inclusion Body Myositis Functional Rating Scale (IBMRFS) is a 10-item clinician-rated ordinal scale developed for people with inclusion body myositis.

- **Methods**: Single observations of the IBMFRS were collected from 132 patients. After Rasch analysis, modifications were made to the scale to optimize fit to the Rasch model while maintaining clinical validity and utility.

- **Results**: The original IBMFRS did not fit the assumptions of the Rasch model because of multidimensionality of the scale. Items assessed local dependence, disordered step thresholds, and differential item functioning. Deconstructing the scale into upper limb (IBMFRS-UL) and lower limb (IBMFRS-LL) scales improved fit to the Rasch model. A 9-item scale with the swallowing item removed (IBMFRS-9) remained multidimensional but demonstrated the ability to discriminate patients along the severity continuum. IBMFRS-UL, IBMFRS-LL, and IBMFRS-9 scores were transformed to a 0–100 scale for comparability.

- **Discussion**: This analysis has led to the development of three optimized versions of the IBMFRS. Muscle Nerve 60: 161–168, 2019.

### Lovastatin [^113Dagqz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Lovastatin, like other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, occasionally causes **myopathy** manifested as muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) levels above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of myopathy increases with high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma.

The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is **dose related**. In the EXCEL clinical study, where patients were carefully monitored and some interacting drugs excluded, one case of myopathy was observed among 4,933 patients randomized to receive lovastatin 20 to 40 mg daily for 48 weeks. In contrast, four cases were noted among 1,649 patients randomized to 80 mg daily.

All patients starting therapy with lovastatin, or whose dose is being increased, should be advised of the risk of myopathy and instructed to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever, or if muscle symptoms persist after discontinuing lovastatin. Lovastatin therapy should be discontinued immediately if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. Periodic CK determinations may be considered in patients starting therapy with lovastatin or whose dose is being increased, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent myopathy.

### Statin use in patients with non-HMGCR idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: A retrospective study [^114WVWFq]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Four patients in our study had HMGCR-positive necrotizing myopathies with a history of statin use prior to the onset of muscle symptoms. Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) is a recently defined autoimmune myopathy associated with autoantibodies targeting the HMGCR protein. The majority of these cases have been associated with prior statin use, although 37% of patients in the initial cohort did not have a history of statin exposure. It should be noted that this condition is extremely rare, with an estimated incidence of two cases per million people per year. No routine screening for HMGCR antibodies prior to statin use is currently recommended in the general population or for patients with other known types of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM).

The type and intensity of statin therapy have been shown to affect tolerability. Studies in the general population have reported approximately 1.5 to 2 times the rate of treatment-related adverse events leading to drug discontinuation in patients on high-intensity statins compared to those on low to moderate-intensity statins. In the study, 31% (9/29) of non-HMGCR IIM patients received high-intensity statin therapy, which was tolerated in 8 out of 9 patients (all except 1 patient with statin-related myalgias). This suggests that high-intensity statins can be considered in non-HMGCR IIM patients when clinically indicated. Among different statin types, atorvastatin and pravastatin have been shown to have lower statin-associated muscular adverse events and be better tolerated compared to simvastatin. Most IIM patients in the study were placed on atorvastatin or rosuvastatin for moderate to high-intensity treatment.

### Is it really myositis? A consideration of the differential diagnosis [^113Nv5rG]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are an important and treatable group of disorders. However, the potential toxicity associated with the immune therapeutic regimens used to treat these disorders may be significant; therefore, accurate diagnosis before such treatment is essential. The differential diagnosis is potentially large. Accurate diagnosis usually depends on a combination of careful clinical assessment in conjunction with detailed laboratory investigations. Muscle biopsy remains essential in achieving an accurate diagnosis that will then guide treatment. This review describes the diagnostic approach used.

There has been debate over the requirements for an accurate diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy (i.e. polymyositis and dermatomyositis). It is increasingly recognized that there can be clinical and muscle histopathologic overlap between the features of inflammatory myopathies and those of other muscle disorders, in particular, the genetic muscular dystrophies. Pathologic findings of inflammation and major histocompatibility complex upregulation, although typical of inflammatory myopathies, have been shown to occur in some muscular dystrophies, complicating the diagnostic process. Inclusion body myositis is much less responsive to immunotherapy and is now recognized as the most common acquired muscle disease in those older than 50 years of age. It is likely that genetic muscular dystrophies and inclusion body myositis account for some cases of apparently "treatment-resistant" myositis.

### Fluvastatin sodium [^112eNm84]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy**: There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment. Other characteristics include positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody, muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy, and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Consider the risk of IMNM carefully prior to initiation of a different statin. If therapy is initiated with a different statin, monitor for signs and symptoms of IMNM.

- **Liver enzymes**: Increases in serum transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]/serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, or alanine aminotransferase [ALT]/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase) have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including fluvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or following a brief interruption in therapy. Approximately 1.1% of patients treated with fluvastatin capsules in worldwide trials developed dose-related, persistent elevations of serum transaminase levels to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal. Fourteen of these patients (0.6%) were discontinued from therapy. In all clinical trials, a total of 33/2969 patients (1.1%) had persistent transaminase elevations with an average fluvastatin exposure of approximately 71.2 weeks.

### Diagnosis and classification of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^114CKLM1]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases, collectively termed myositis, that share symptoms of muscle weakness, fatigue, and inflammation. Other organs are frequently involved, supporting the notion that these are systemic inflammatory diseases. The IIMs can be subgrouped into dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and inclusion body myositis.

Myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) identify other, often more distinct, clinical phenotypes, such as the antisynthetase syndrome with antisynthetase autoantibodies and frequent interstitial lung disease, as well as anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR autoantibodies that identify necrotizing myopathy. The MSAs are important both to support myositis diagnosis and to identify subgroups with different patterns of extramuscular organ involvement, such as interstitial lung disease.

Another cornerstone in the diagnostic procedure is the muscle biopsy, which is used to identify inflammation and to exclude noninflammatory myopathies. Treatment effects and prognosis vary by subgroup.

To develop new and better therapies, validated classification criteria that identify distinct subgroups of myositis are critical. The lack of such criteria was the main rationale for the development of new classification criteria for IIMs, which are summarized in this review. The historical background regarding previous diagnostic and classification criteria is also reviewed.

As the IIMs are rare diseases with a prevalence of 10 in 100,000 individuals, an international collaboration was essential. This effort necessitated the interdisciplinary involvement of experts in adult and pediatric medicine.

### The spectrum of statin myopathy [^113gyShc]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

This review discusses the spectrum of myopathies associated with statin use, with special attention given to a recently identified statin-associated autoimmune-necrotizing myopathy. The clinical characteristics of these patients, pathologic findings, associated autoantibody, and immunogenetic risk factors are discussed.

In the past several years, a novel form of autoimmune myopathy associated with statin use has been described. Patients with this form of myositis have unique clinical, pathologic, and pathophysiologic features when compared with those with self-limited statin toxic myopathy. An autoantibody directed against HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the pharmacologic target of statins, characterizes the disease and can be used in clinical practice to identify these patients and direct therapy. Still, many questions remain to be answered regarding the pathogenic mechanisms at play, risk factors for developing the disease, long-term prognosis, and effects of rechallenge with statins or other cholesterol-lowering drugs.

Statins can cause a spectrum of muscle diseases, most of which are self-limited and improve with discontinuation of the offending agent. In a subgroup, an autoimmune necrotizing myopathy develops that persists after discontinuation of statins. Specific autoantibody testing can help identify these patients in clinical practice and determine the need for immunosuppressive therapy.

### Pediatric case of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy with anti-HMGCR antibodies and dermatomyositis skin rash [^113f8idk]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) is a subgroup of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), characterized by muscle weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. Juvenile IMNM is noted for its insidious course, muscle atrophy, proximo-distal muscle weakness, high CK elevation, and resistance to treatments that often involve a combination of immunosuppressants. Diagnosis relies on a wide range of assessments, including specific biomarkers, such as anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP antibodies, and muscle biopsy. This presentation in children is thought to account for 3% of IIM cases, compared to 19% in adults.

### Recent developments in classification criteria and diagnosis guidelines for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^117GZhty]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

The newly developed classification criteria provide robust methods for identifying idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) cases for research purposes; however, their use is not designed nor recommended for clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis of an IIM is key to appropriate treatment instigation, prognostication, and prevention of complications. However, diagnosis and subtype identification in clinical settings can be challenging, in part due to potential multisystem involvement and wide variations between subtype manifestations. Currently, no clear diagnostic criteria for the IIMs exist. Findings from clinically focused research studies can aid a clinician's diagnostic accuracy, identification of factors associated with prognosis, and guide investigation of multisystem involvement.

### Anti-HMGCR myopathy: A rare and serious side effect of statins [^114S1YRJ]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Since their discovery, statins have become the first-line treatment for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although they are typically well tolerated, side effects do occur and tend to affect the musculature. Most side effects are benign and resolve after discontinuing the statin.

A subset of immune-mediated necrotizing myositis, anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) myopathy, is a rare disease that occurs in 0.9 to 1.4 cases per 100,000 people. It causes significant muscle weakness that does not resolve with discontinuation of the statin. Unlike other known complications, it has a late onset, occurring years after the statin was initially prescribed. It can also present in patients previously treated with statins who have not taken them for several years.

This case report details the case of a 54-year-old woman who developed anti-HMGCR myopathy after several years of uncomplicated statin use. Differences between other reported cases and this one are discussed, including the patient's strong response to steroid therapy, which resulted in the normalization of her serum creatinine kinase and alleviation of her muscle weakness.

This case highlights the need for clinicians to be aware of anti-HMGCR myopathy and to consider it as a potential cause of proximal muscle weakness and persistent serum creatinine kinase elevations in patients exposed to statins, even if they were previously well tolerated by the patient.

### Diagnostic criteria for inclusion body myositis [^116d7z3i]. Journal of internal medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) was first identified as a specific disorder about 40 years ago and is now recognized as the most frequently presenting primary myopathy in middle age and beyond. The initial characterization was based on the observation of specific pathological features distinguishing it from polymyositis. It was soon appreciated that there were also distinguishing clinical features. The earliest diagnostic criteria were heavily biased towards pathological features, but over time, revised criteria have given increasing importance to certain clinical features.

Until the specific cause of IBM is determined and the basic pathogenetic mechanisms are better understood, there can be no diagnostic gold standard against which to compare the sensitivity and specificity of any proposed diagnostic criteria. Such criteria are essential to ensure that patients entering clinical, epidemiological, genetic, pathological, or therapeutic studies represent a homogeneous population. It is likely that any currently accepted diagnostic criteria will, once a gold standard is eventually established, be shown to have 'missed' patients with atypical features, but that has to be accepted to ensure that studies are not contaminated by patients who do not have IBM.

In everyday clinical practice, there will be the occasional patient who an experienced myologist strongly suspects has IBM but does not meet the criteria. This occurs because the criteria lack sensitivity. However, if the criteria are so broad as to include all such atypical cases, they would likely include patients who do not actually have IBM.

### Imaging: Seeing muscle in new ways [^114sxLoV]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are diseases that can be difficult to diagnose and evaluate, but diagnosis has been improved by modern imaging techniques. Advances in imaging continue to be made, necessitating an evaluation of their implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and management of muscle diseases.

- **Recent findings**: There have been advances in imaging across multiple modalities. Several new radiotracers show an improved ability to focus on inflammation better than older agents. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has demonstrated the capability to diagnose several idiopathic inflammatory myopathy mimics. MRI reveals previously unknown areas of disease when used for full-body imaging. Ultrasound can differentiate inclusion body myositis from other myopathies.

- **Summary**: Currently, MRI and ultrasound offer the most information about these diseases in a given patient, and new advances in these fields have only increased their utility. New advancements in nuclear imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy are also showing potential utility and may eventually lead them to the forefront in evaluating difficult idiopathic inflammatory myopathy patients.

### Expression of calcium-binding proteins MRP8 and MRP14 in inflammatory muscle diseases [^114YvpSP]. The American Journal of Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

The pathophysiological role of infiltrating macrophages and their subtypes in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, such as dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and inclusion body myositis, is not fully clear. Monocytes exhibit various phenotypes with different functional properties, such as the release of pro- or anti-inflammatory mediators. Expression of myeloid-related proteins MRP8 and MRP14, two calcium-binding S100-proteins, characterizes a proinflammatory subtype of macrophages.

We immunohistochemically investigated the expression of MRP8 and MRP14 in muscle biopsies of 33 patients with dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and inclusion body myositis. We found a clear association of the expression of MRP8 and MRP14 by infiltrating macrophages with degeneration of myofibers. Because MRP8 and MRP14 are secreted by activated macrophages, we investigated if these proteins would have direct extracellular effects on myocytes.

We found that the purified MRP8/MRP14 complex inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and that it induced apoptosis via activation of caspase-3 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that in the course of inflammatory myopathies, activated macrophages can promote destruction and impair regeneration of myocytes via secretion of MRP8/MRP14.

### Iqirvo [^1129mBdK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Myalgia, myopathy, and rhabdomyolysis**: Rhabdomyolysis resulting in acute kidney injury occurred in one IQIRVO-treated patient who had cirrhosis at baseline and was also taking a stable dose of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin). Myalgia or myopathy, with or without CPK elevations, occurred in patients treated with IQIRVO alone or concomitantly with a stable dose of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Assess for myalgia and myopathy prior to IQIRVO initiation. Consider periodic assessment (clinical exam, CPK measurement) during treatment with IQIRVO, especially in those who have signs and symptoms of new onset or worsening of muscle pain or myopathy. Interrupt IQIRVO treatment if there is new onset or worsening of muscle pain, myopathy, or rhabdomyolysis.

- **Fractures**: Fractures occurred in 6% of IQIRVO-treated patients compared to no placebo-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Consider the risk of fracture in the care of patients treated with IQIRVO and monitor bone health according to standards of care.

- **Adverse effects on fetal and newborn development**: Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, IQIRVO may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Treatment of pregnant rats with elafibranor at maternal plasma drug exposures lower than or approximately equal to human exposure at the recommended dose resulted in stillbirths, reduced survival, decreased pup body weight, and/or blue/black discoloration of the caudal section of the body.

### Clinicopathological features of anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP myopathies that do not satisfy the EULAR/ACR criteria of inflammatory myopathies [^116sbzKE]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Cohort studies indicate that IMNM represents a substantial group within IIMs, highlighting the significant need for its accurate diagnosis. Serum antibody tests are extremely useful in diagnosing anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP myopathies; however, diagnosis is sometimes complicated. This complexity arises because IIMs are not considered based on the chronic course and scarce inflammatory changes on muscle pathology, and serum antibody tests are not conducted. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the clinicopathological features of anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP antibody-positive cases not classified as IIMs by the widely used EULAR/ACR classification criteria.

Various performance studies on the EULAR/ACR classification criteria have been reported, with sensitivity ranging from 65% to 92.7% and specificity from 65.5% to 95% with muscle biopsy, and sensitivity ranging from 68% to 88.1% and specificity from 90.2% to 98% without muscle biopsy. However, in most of these studies, cases in the probable or definite group were classified as IIMs, suggesting that sensitivity and specificity might differ when the possible group is also included as IIMs. In a performance study that included the possible group as IIMs, the sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 86% and 85% for diagnosing DM and 73% and 87% for diagnosing PM. The lower sensitivity for PM than for DM is attributed to the fact that the presence of rashes is emphasized in the EULAR/ACR classification criteria. Regarding IMNM, we should keep in mind that the EULAR/ACR classification criteria…

### Myopathy with anti-HMGCR antibodies: Perimysium and myofiber pathology [^111HrUyp]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Serum autoantibodies and myopathology features are useful for the characterization and classification of acquired immune and inflammatory myopathy (IIM) syndromes. Serum IgG binding to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) has been identified in patients with presumed immune myopathies that usually have no lymphocytic cell foci. Myopathies with HMGCR antibodies have been suggested to be statin-induced, but statin histories are not universal, and the strength of association with statin use varies among reports.

Previous pathologic descriptions of myopathies with HMGCR antibodies have noted active necrosis and regeneration of scattered muscle fibers without inflammation, but some series mainly screened for HMGCR antibodies in groups of patients with "necrotizing myopathies". Involvement of other components of muscle tissue has not been systematically evaluated. We have found that IIM syndromes often have characteristic pathology that involves several tissues in muscle, including muscle fibers, connective tissue, and vessels, and patterns of humoral and cellular immunity. In this study, we evaluated clinical and pathologic features of 49 patients with acquired myopathies associated with serum IgG binding to HMGCR. Clinically, our patients exhibited symmetric, proximal weakness and often had a high serum creatine kinase (CK). Only a minority had a history of statin use. Pathologic features in HMGCR antibody-associated myopathies often include damage to both perimysial connective tissue and muscle fibers.

### Anti-HMGCR autoantibodies in juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies identify a rare but clinically important subset of patients [^117NjhwH]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective was to establish the prevalence and clinical associations of anti-HMG-CoA reductase (anti-HMGCR) in a large UK cohort with juvenile myositis. The methods involved investigating 381 patients for anti-HMGCR using ELISA.

- **Results**: Anti-HMGCR autoantibodies were detected in 4 patients (1%). These children exhibited no or minimal rash and significant muscle disease. Muscle biopsies were distinctive, showing widespread variation in fiber size, necrotic fibers, and chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates. All patients had prolonged elevation of creatine kinase and ultimately received biologic therapies.

- **Conclusion**: Anti-HMGCR in UK children with myositis are associated with severe disease that is poorly responsive to standard treatments.

The study "Abatacept for IIM" was published by Rohit Aggarwal and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatology. This study addresses diseases such as dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and inclusion body myositis. The trial investigated the effect of abatacept on patients with active, refractory idiopathic inflammatory myopathy.

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- **Population**: 148 patients (106 female, 42 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with active, refractory idiopathic inflammatory myopathy.

- **Key exclusion criteria**:
	- Inclusion body myositis or myositis other than idiopathic inflammatory myopathy.
	- Use of penicillamine or zidovudine in the past 3 months.
	- Use of rituximab in the past 6 months.
	- Uncontrolled or rapidly progressive ILD.
	- Severe muscle damage or permanent weakness due to a non-idiopathic inflammatory myopathy cause, or myositis with cardiac involvement.
	- Cancer-associated myositis.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Abatacept (n = 75)**: Subcutaneous dose of 125 mg weekly plus standard of care.
	- **Placebo (n = 73)**: Matching placebo plus standard of care.

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies definition of improvement at week 24 (56% vs. 42.5%; OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.9 to 3.5).

- **Secondary outcomes**: A borderline significant increase in mean improvement in myositis.

### Clinicopathological features of anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP myopathies that do not satisfy the EULAR/ACR criteria of inflammatory myopathies [^1114E5vf]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

The clinicopathological features of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) sometimes mimic muscular dystrophy, complicating accurate diagnosis. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are superior in terms of sensitivity and specificity; however, the sensitivity is reported to be relatively low in IMNM. We examined the clinicopathological characteristics and the prognoses of anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) antibody-positive and anti-signal recognition particle (SRP) antibody-positive cases that do not satisfy the EULAR/ACR classification criteria.

- **Methods**: Seventy-one anti-HMGCR antibody-positive cases and 94 anti-SRP antibody-positive cases were included. We compared the clinicopathological characteristics of the groups that were not classified as IIMs (possible group) with those classified as IIMs (definite-possible group) based on the EULAR/ACR classification criteria. For the possible group whose follow-up data were available, their clinical features were assessed up to 24 months.

- **Results**: Nineteen anti-HMGCR antibody-positive cases (26%) and 19 anti-SRP antibody-positive cases (20%) were classified as the possible group. The possible group had milder weakness, less frequent dysphagia, lower serum creatine kinase and aldolase levels, and fewer necrotic fibers and granular p62-positive fibers than the definite-possible group. Of the 26 cases in the possible group that could be followed up, only three cases…

### Interstitial lung disease is not rare in immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy with anti-signal recognition particle antibodies [^115YyBEq]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a group of clinically heterogeneous, autoimmune inflammatory disorders characterized by muscular weakness and multi-system involvement such as the lung and skin. Dermatomyositis (DM), antisynthetase syndrome (ASS), and inclusion body myositis (IBM) have long been recognized as distinct subtypes of IIMs. However, in recent years, it has been recognized that muscle biopsies from some patients with myositis have significant myofiber necrosis yet minimal, if any, lymphocytic infiltrates. These patients are now widely recognized to have immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM).

The presence of myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) and myositis-associated autoantibodies (MAAs) has become key features for the classification and diagnosis of IIMs. At the time of writing, two different autoantibodies have been described in association with IMNM: those recognizing the signal recognition particle (SRP) and those targeting hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR).

Autoantibodies recognizing the SRP were first identified in the 1980s. Recently, it has been shown that the anti-SRP antibody is significantly associated with necrotizing myopathy, and the antibody is now recognized as a marker of IMNM.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is frequently associated with IIMs, especially in ASS and anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (anti-MDA5) antibody-positive DM. Because ILD significantly contributes to the morbidity and mortality in patients with IIMs, it is important to clarify the clinical characteristics of ILD in such patients.

### Myopathy with anti-HMGCR antibodies: Perimysium and myofiber pathology [^112jaHWo]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

We retrospectively reviewed clinical and myopathology features of 49 patients with serum anti-HMGCR antibodies. Some clinical features in our patients with serum IgG binding to HMGCR were similar to those in previous studies. We observed a moderate female predominance. Onset ages varied widely, from childhood to older adulthood. Presenting features often included proximal, symmetric weakness, myalgia, and a high serum CK. The disease course varied from acute to very chronic. Three patients with slowly progressive proximal weakness were initially thought to have limb-girdle muscular dystrophies but had no histologic or molecular diagnosis despite extensive testing. Patients with previous exposure to statin drugs were older, but clinical and laboratory findings were similar to those in patients without statin exposure.

Differences in our cohort from prior studies included a small group of HMGCR antibody patients who presented with myalgia, cramps, and elevated CK but no weakness. Systemic manifestations, including skin rash and interstitial lung disease, were more frequent than previously reported. Interstitial lung disease, ascertained by chest imaging, was found in 20% of our cohort. Other myositis-associated antibodies were identified in 33% of our patients. The wider spectrum of clinical and laboratory features seen in our series likely reflects our inclusive pattern of serum testing (i.e. most patients with acquired myopathies). The initial series of HMGCR antibody patients excluded patients with inflammation in the muscle biopsy and selectively studied patients.

### Pediatric necrotizing myopathy associated with anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase antibodies [^112HTAQW]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Antibodies against 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) have recently been associated with immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, especially in patients with statin exposure. As the data are very limited concerning phenotypes and treatment in pediatric patients, we aimed to identify the pediatric patients positive for anti-HMGCR antibodies and clarify their features and therapeutic strategies.

- **Methods**: We screened 62 pediatric patients who were clinically and/or pathologically suspected to have inflammatory myopathy for anti-HMGCR antibodies. We further re-assessed the clinical and histological findings and the treatment of the patients positive for anti-HMGCR antibodies.

- **Results**: We identified nine pediatric patients with anti-HMGCR antibodies (15%) — this was more frequent than anti-signal recognition particle antibodies, present in four patients (6%) in our cohort. The onset age ranged from infancy to 13 years. Five patients were initially diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, including congenital muscular dystrophy. Most patients responded to high-dose corticosteroid therapy first but often needed adjuvant immunosuppressants to become stably controlled.

- **Conclusion**: Pediatric necrotizing myopathy associated with anti-HMGCR antibodies may not be very rare. Phenotypes are similar to those of adult patients, but a chronic slowly progressive course may be more frequent. Some patients share the clinicopathological features of muscular dystrophy, indicating that recognizing inflammatory etiology would be challenging without autoantibody information.

### Anti-HMGCR antibody-associated necrotising myopathy and its association with statin use [^112mxmiT]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old man presented with chest pain and a one-year history of generalized weakness, accompanied by generalized aches and pains. Symptoms worsened when he was initiated on statins. Investigations revealed high creatine kinase, high HMG-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) antibody titre, myopathic features on electromyography, muscle biopsy, and muscle atrophy on MRI. These results were consistent with anti-HMGCR antibody myopathy. The patient responded well to immunosuppressive therapy.

### Ultrasound can differentiate inclusion body myositis from disease mimics [^111SHyaT]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of inclusion body myositis (IBM) can be challenging for clinicians, as its clinical presentation can be confused with other forms of myositis or other neuromuscular disorders. Currently, the diagnosis of IBM is based on clinical, laboratory, and pathological features; however, each of these may be inconclusive. Thus, there is still a need for additional diagnostic tools that are widely available, noninvasive, and easily deployed in a variety of settings. Quantitative muscle ultrasound (US) has the potential to differentiate between IBM and its mimicking diseases. Affected muscles show increased echogenicity (EI) on the US image, reflecting the replacement of muscle tissue with fat and fibrosis. Given that IBM shows a specific pattern of muscle involvement — most commonly affecting the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP), gastrocnemius, and quadriceps muscles — it may be possible to differentiate IBM from other diseases using this pattern.

The aim of this study was to compare quantitative muscle US in IBM with other inflammatory myopathies and other clinically similar neuromuscular disorders.

IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite the discontinuation of statin treatment, a positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody, muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy, and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Consider the risk of IMNM carefully prior to initiation of a different statin. If therapy is initiated with a different statin, monitor for signs and symptoms of IMNM.

- **Liver dysfunction**: Persistent increases (to more than three times the upper limit of normal) in serum transaminases occurred in 1.9% of adult patients who received lovastatin for at least one year in early clinical trials.

### Muscle transcriptomics shows overexpression of cadherin 1 in inclusion body myositis [^112oVz7N]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Figure 4**: The expression of CDH1 in the RNA sequencing dataset of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies from previous publications. We used the RNA sequencing dataset of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies from previous publications. The expression of CDH1 (log 2 [fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads + 1]) in inclusion body myositis (IBM) was compared with immune‐mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), antisynthetase syndrome (AS), dermatomyositis (DM), and controls.

- **Expression in skeletal muscle differentiation and regeneration**: The expression levels of CDH1 were also analyzed using the RNA sequencing datasets of proliferating human myoblasts and cardiotoxin‐injured skeletal muscle of C57BL/6 mice reported previously. The expression levels of CDH1 were upregulated in both experimental systems. In the cardiotoxin‐injured mice, the expression level of CDH1 rose and was shown to peak at 7 days after the injection. Then, it returned to zero at 28 days after cardiotoxin injection into the skeletal muscle of mice.

- **Figure 5**: The expression of CDH1 in the experimental systems of muscle differentiation and regeneration. We used the RNA sequencing datasets of proliferating human myoblasts (A) and cardiotoxin injected mouse muscle (B) from previous publications.

### Pravastatin sodium [^113Uwt3y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pravastatin may cause myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including pravastatin. Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CK) to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), occurred in less than 0.1% of pravastatin-treated patients in clinical trials.

- **Risk factors for myopathy**: Risk factors include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher pravastatin dosage [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Steps to prevent or reduce the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis**: Pravastatin is not recommended for patients taking gemfibrozil [see Drug Interactions (7)]. There are pravastatin dosage restrictions for patients taking cyclosporin and select macrolide antibiotics [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. The following drugs, when used concomitantly with pravastatin, may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis: niacin, fibrates, and colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinue pravastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if pravastatin is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue pravastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis.

### Mitochondrial pathology in immune and inflammatory myopathies [^112Wojiw]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Acquired immune and inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are typically subdivided into dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and inclusion body myositis. However, many types of IIMs do not fit well into this scheme. Several myopathologic and autoantibody features of IIMs, which are not considered in standard classifications, are useful for defining individual disorders. We will review one set of myopathologic features that occur in some IIMs, specifically mitochondrial abnormalities, and consider its diagnostic, treatment-related, and pathogenic implications.

Myopathologic changes indicating mitochondrial disorders are often widespread in regions of muscle fiber abnormality in dermatomyositis. They distinguish dermatomyositis with vascular pathology from other inflammatory myopathies with skin changes that have prominent perimysial connective tissue lesions but no mitochondrial abnormalities. Mitochondrial abnormalities in scattered muscle fibers occur in sporadic inclusion body myositis and clinically similar disorders. Mitochondrial abnormalities in scattered nonnecrotic muscle fibers in IIM biopsies predict a poor response to immunosuppression.

Muscle biopsy, including evaluation of mitochondrial stains, is important for the correct diagnosis of inflammatory myopathies. By recognizing the full range of distinctive myopathologic changes in the diverse group of IIMs, the clinician can improve diagnostic accuracy and apply appropriate treatment.

### Epidemiology, survival, and clinical characteristics of inclusion body myositis [^1132bAFL]. Annals of Neurology (2022).

Detection of myositis‐specific and myositis‐associated antibodies: Serum samples from a group of 50 patients with IBM and a control group of blood donors from VGR matched for age and sex were investigated. The commercial myositis line blot assay, EUROLINE Autoimmune Inflammatory Myopathies 16 Ag (IgG) Profile (Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany), was used.

This assay consists of a membrane strip coated with autoantigens:

- **Nucleosome remodeling deacetylase**: α (Mi‐2α), β (Mi‐2β)
- **Transcriptional and matrix proteins**: Transcriptional intermediary factor 1 gamma (TIF1γ), nuclear matrix protein‐2 (NXP2)
- **Melanoma differentiation-related**: Melanoma differentiation‐associated gene 5 (MDA5)
- **Exosome protein complexes**: 100 (PM‐Scl‐100), 75 (PM‐Scl‐75)
- **Protein kinases and enzymes**: DNA‐dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit (Ku), small ubiquitin‐like modifier activating enzyme subunit 1 (SAE1)
- **tRNA synthetases**: Histidyl‐tRNA synthetase (Jo‐1), threonyl‐tRNA synthetase (PL‐7), alanyl‐tRNA synthetase (PL‐12), glycyl‐tRNA synthetase (EJ), isoleucyl‐tRNA synthetase (OJ)
- **Sjögren's syndrome-related**: Sjögren's syndrome‐related antigen A (SSA/Ro‐52)

The incubated strips were automatically photographed, and the band intensity was evaluated by the EUROLine‐Scan program. Results that were borderline according to the manufacturer's system were considered negative.

Antibodies against cytosolic 5′‐nucleotidase 1A (cN1A) were measured using a commercially available enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany). Antibodies of IgG subclass against 3‐Hydroxy‐3‐Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMGCR) were measured using QUANTA Lite HMGCR.

### An unusual case of statin-induced myopathy: Anti-HMGCoA necrotizing autoimmune myopathy [^1146Fpcf]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Statins are some of the most widely prescribed medications and, though generally well tolerated, can lead to a self-limited myopathy in a minority of patients. Recently, these medications have been associated with a necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (NAM). Statin-associated NAM is characterized by irritable myopathy on electromyography (EMG) and muscle necrosis with minimal inflammation on muscle biopsy.

The case presented is a 63-year-old woman who has continued elevation of creatine kinase (CK) after discontinuation of statin therapy. She has irritable myopathy on EMG, and NAM is confirmed by muscle biopsy. She subsequently tests positive for an experimental anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (anti-HMGCoA) antibody that is found to be present in patients with statin-associated NAM. Though statin-associated NAM is a relatively rare entity, it is an important consideration for the general internist in patients who continue to have CK elevation and weakness after discontinuation of statin therapy. Continued research is necessary to better define statin-specific and dose-dependent risk, as well as optimal treatment for this condition.

### The incidence of anti-HMGCR immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy: an Australian and UK retrospective multi-site cohort study [^114GSyjC]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

All patients in this cohort had elevated CK during the disease course, with a median peak CK of 7020 IU/l (range: 964–39,076).

Myositis-specific and myositis-associated antibodies, in addition to anti-HMGCR, were rare, occurring in nine (8.3%) patients. Here is a categorization of the antibodies observed:

- **Myositis-specific antibodies**: anti-Mi2, NXP2, SAE1, MDA5, TIF1γ, Jo1, PL7, PL12, EJ, OJ, KS, Zo, Ha, SRP
- **Myositis-associated antibodies**: anti-Ro52, U1RNP, Ku, PmScl, cN1A

Two patients had anti-TIF1γ antibodies, typically associated with dermatomyositis and CAM. Neither of these patients had a rash, although one had locally advanced bladder/prostate cancer, resected one month prior to anti-HMGCR testing.

Anti-HMGCR titres were available for 83 of 109 patients (76.1%), with the remainder being reported as positive without an exact titre. Where available, anti-HMGCR titres were strongly positive:

- **UK**: The median was 150.9 CU (IQR 105.5–200, positive reported at > 20 CU)
- **Australia**: The median was 33.1 RU (IQR 25.5–35.7, positive reported at > 11 RU)

Muscle biopsy was performed in 58 patients (53.2%), with 46 (78%) biopsies having a histological diagnosis of IMNM. Of the remaining 12 biopsies:

- **Inflammatory myopathy without specific histological subtype**: 8 cases
- **Non-specific myopathic changes**: 2 cases
- **Suggestive of inclusion body myositis (IBM)**: 1 case

### Peculiar clinicopathological features of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathies [^115UpX2Y]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

In the past decade, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathies have emerged as a separate entity in the heterogeneous group of autoimmune myopathies. This group is characterized by clinical manifestations restricted to the muscle tissue, and until recently, the definition was based on muscular pathological features.

Recent findings have shown that these are the most severe autoimmune myopathies in terms of muscle damage. They have been associated with two myositis-specific antibodies: either anti-signal recognition particle (anti-SRP) or anti-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (anti-HMGCR) antibodies. These two antibodies are now considered diagnostic criteria for immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM). Each antibody delineates a homogeneous subgroup of IMNM patients in terms of severity, and IMNM without myositis-specific antibodies have a high risk of malignancy. In addition, pathological observations and in-vitro experiments suggest the pathogenic role of anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR antibodies.

IMNM are muscle-specific autoimmune diseases associated with severe weakness and a risk of poor muscle strength recovery. Anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR antibodies are specifically associated with this condition and are crucial for the diagnosis and prognosis. The muscle biopsy remains necessary for IMNM diagnosis in the absence of myositis-specific antibodies.

### Biaxin [^115kxvrr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

**HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors**: Concomitant use of clarithromycin with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). As with other macrolides, clarithromycin has been reported to increase concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking these drugs concomitantly. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have also been reported in patients taking atorvastatin or rosuvastatin concomitantly with clarithromycin. When used with clarithromycin, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin should be administered in the lowest possible doses. Adjustment of the statin dose or use of a statin that is not dependent on CYP3A metabolism (e.g. fluvastatin or pravastatin) should be considered.

### Anti-HMGCR myopathy may resemble limb-girdle muscular dystrophy [^112EtoYG]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical features of anti-HMGCR myopathy among patients with presumed limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) in whom genetic testing has failed to elucidate causative mutations.

- **Methods**: Patients with presumed LGMD and uninformative genetic testing were selected based on several clinico-pathologic features and tested for anti-HMGCR autoantibodies (n = 11). These clinico-pathologic features included a peak creatine kinase (CK) level greater than 1,000 IU/L and at least three of the following: (1) limb-girdle pattern of weakness, (2) selective involvement of the posterior thigh on clinical examination or muscle imaging, (3) dystrophic changes on muscle biopsy, and (4) no family history of muscular dystrophy.

- **Results**: Six patients tested positive for anti-HMGCR autoantibodies. In four patients, a presymptomatic phase lasting as long as ten years was characterized by elevated CK levels without weakness. Muscle biopsies revealed varying degrees of dystrophic pathology without prominent inflammation. In an independent cohort of patients with anti-HMGCR myopathy, 17 of 51 (approximately 33%) were initially presumed to have a form of LGMD based on clinico-pathologic features but were ultimately found to have anti-HMGCR myopathy. Most of these patients responded favorably to immunomodulatory therapies, as evidenced by reduction of CK levels and improved strength.

- **Conclusions**: Anti-HMGCR myopathy can closely resemble LGMD. Diagnosing patients with a LGMD-like presentation of anti-HMGCR myopathy is critical because these patients may respond favorably to immunotherapy.

### Anti-HMGCR myopathy may resemble limb-girdle muscular dystrophy [^114Xh5Mf]. Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) encompass a heterogeneous group of hereditary, degenerative myopathies that pose a major diagnostic challenge. Genomic approaches do not identify a definitive genetic abnormality in 40%–60% of these patients. Although most patients presenting with chronic, slowly progressive myopathies will be presumed to have a hereditary myopathy, and in most cases an LGMD, autoimmune myopathies can also present with a similar chronic disease course.

Autoimmune anti-HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase) myopathy typically has an acute or subacute disease course in older adults with a history of statin exposure and is defined by the presence of serum anti-HMGCR autoantibodies. Yet, young adults and children without statin exposure may also develop anti-HMGCR myopathy, some of whom are anecdotally reported to present with a chronic, LGMD-like phenotype. Thus, we hypothesized that some patients with presumed LGMD, specifically those in whom genetic testing has failed to elucidate causative mutations (i.e. "unrevealing genetic testing"), may actually have anti-HMGCR myopathy. We use the term "anti-HMGCR myopathy" to refer to a myopathy associated with anti-HMGCR autoantibodies.

Using a few clinico-pathologic criteria, followed by autoantibody testing, we screened our cohort of patients with clinically suspected LGMD and unrevealing genetic testing and identified 6 patients (1 previously reported) with anti-HMGCR myopathy. Furthermore, in a separate cohort, 17 patients with anti-HMGCR myopathy were identified.

### Polymyositis and dermatomyositis [^114hZmBB]. Lancet (2003). Low credibility.

The inflammatory myopathies, commonly described as idiopathic, are the largest group of acquired and potentially treatable myopathies. Based on unique clinical, histopathological, immunological, and demographic features, they can be differentiated into three major and distinct subsets: dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and inclusion-body myositis. The use of new diagnostic criteria is essential to discriminate between them and to exclude other disorders.

Dermatomyositis is a microangiopathy affecting the skin and muscle; activation and deposition of complement cause lysis of endomysial capillaries and muscle ischaemia. In polymyositis and inclusion-body myositis, clonally expanded CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells invade muscle fibres that express MHC class I antigens, leading to fibre necrosis via the perforin pathway. **Inclusion-body myositis**: Vacuolar formation with amyloid deposits coexists with the immunological features. The causative autoantigen has not yet been identified. Upregulated vascular-cell adhesion molecule, intercellular adhesion molecule, chemokines, and their receptors promote T-cell transgression, and various cytokines increase the immunopathological process.

Early initiation of therapy is essential, since both polymyositis and dermatomyositis respond to immunotherapeutic agents. New immunomodulatory agents currently being tested in controlled trials may prove promising for difficult cases.

### Inclusion body myositis: Laser microdissection reveals differential up-regulation of IFN-γ signaling cascade in attacked versus nonattacked myofibers [^111CNTp1]. The American Journal of Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is the most common inflammatory myopathy in adults over 50 years, presenting with progressive weakness and atrophy of both proximal and distal muscle groups. This condition typically leads to disability within 5 to 10 years after diagnosis. Because sIBM, in contrast to polymyositis (PM) or dermatomyositis (DM), is notoriously refractory to immunosuppressive therapies, it is assumed that sIBM is not a primary autoimmune myopathy. Instead, the inflammatory changes are considered secondary to as yet unknown viral or degenerative triggers. Therefore, sIBM is regarded as the paradigm of a myopathy with distinct degenerative and inflammatory pathogenetic components.

- **Unique mechanism of inflammatory myofiber injury**: The mechanism of inflammatory myofiber injury is unique in that CD8+ T cells and macrophages focally surround and invade initially nonnecrotic myofibers. Several articles provide a review of this information. The myoinvasive CD8+ cytotoxic T cells likely recognize (still unknown) antigens presented by HLA class I (HLA-I) molecules on the myofiber surface. Antigen-driven recruitment of the myocytotoxic CD8+ T cells is supported by evidence that the T cells are clonally expanded, using a restricted repertoire of T-cell receptors, and they persist over time in individual patients. Moreover, the CD8+ T cells form specific immunological synapses with vectorial excretion of perforin toward the attacked myofibers. This cytotoxicity cannot be assessed with in vitro co-culturing experiments because only alloreactive CD8+ T cells were strongly cytotoxic to allogenic myotubes in co-cultures.

### Cancer association as a risk factor for anti-HMGCR antibody-positive myopathy [^116RTjPj]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

- **Patients**: We screened 621 consecutive adult patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) who were 16 years or older. These patients were pathologically diagnosed at the University of Tokyo Hospital between 2000 and 2015, and their serum samples at biopsy were available. In screening, patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis or sarcoid myopathy were excluded based on clinical and pathological findings. Clinical information was retrospectively analyzed by reviewing the patients' clinical records. The disease onset was defined as the initial awareness of muscular symptoms or the detection of elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) level. The disease duration was defined as the duration between the time of disease onset and muscle biopsy for histopathologic diagnosis.

- **Definition of the association with cancers**: With regard to the association with cancers, we defined patients with cancer association as patients with cancers detected within 3 years of myopathy diagnosis based on commonly used criteria for cancer-associated myopathy (CAM). Patients with a cancer history were those in whom cancers were detected more than 3 years before the time of myopathy diagnosis. Among the patients in whom cancers were not detected, we defined cancer-free patients as those without cancer detection who were followed up for more than 3 years after myopathy diagnosis.

- **Detection of anti-HMGCR Ab and other MSAs**: For the detection of anti-HMGCR Ab, we performed ELISA, as reported elsewhere. In patients found to be positive by ELISA, we additionally performed Western blot analysis.

### Vytorin [^112pUiF1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue Vytorin if IMNM is suspected.

### Anti-HMGCR myopathy overlaps with dermatomyositis-like rash: a distinct subtype of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy [^111LGLPx]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

To characterize the clinical and pathological features of anti-HMGCR myopathy, the presence of anti-HMGCR antibody was assessed in the serum of 227 patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) and 100 healthy control individuals by ELISA. All ELISA-positive samples were retested using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA) on HEK293 cells. The clinical findings, muscle pathological features, and treatment outcomes of patients with anti-HMGCR myopathy were analyzed, including comparisons between patients with and without dermatomyositis (DM)-like skin rashes and among MSA-based subgroups.

An optimized ELISA cutoff for anti-HMGCR antibody positivity was established as ≥ 5.28 U with an overall concordance of 96.83% between ELISA and IIFA. Among the 227 IIM patients, 21 were anti-HMGCR-positive by both assays. Of these, 9 had DM-like skin rashes, and 16 showed significant muscle inflammation. Five patients had juvenile-onset, and two received statin treatment. Muscle biopsies revealed variable muscle necrosis and T cell infiltration. Most anti-HMGCR-positive patients achieved favorable outcomes following prednisone and additional immunotherapies. Those with DM-like rashes were generally younger and had a shorter disease duration compared to those without rashes.

Optimizing the cutoff of anti-HMGCR antibody assays with confirmation by alternative assays can result in higher sensitivity and specificity. DM-like skin rashes and lymphocytic infiltrates were observed in the study.

### Myositis-specific autoantibodies: An important tool to support diagnosis of myositis [^116eo1hQ]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are characterized by muscle weakness, skin disease, and internal organ involvement. Autoimmunity is known to play a role in myositis pathogenesis. Myositis-specific autoantibodies, which target important intracellular proteins, are regarded as key biomarkers aiding in the diagnosis of patients. Recent years have seen the identification of several novel myositis autoantibodies, including anti-TIF1, anti-NXP2, anti-MDA5, anti-SAE, anti-HMGCR, and anti-cN1A, in both adult and juvenile patients. These autoantibodies correlate with distinct clinical manifestations and are notably found in inclusion body, statin-induced, clinically amyopathic, and juvenile groups of myositis patients that were previously thought to be mainly autoantibody negative.

This review describes the main myositis-specific and myositis-associated autoantibodies, outlining their frequencies and clinical associations across different ages and ethnic groups. Additionally, preliminary studies exploring correlations between specific myositis autoantibody titers and clinical markers of disease course are discussed. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the utility of myositis autoantibodies as both diagnostic and prognostic markers of disease.

### Myopathies with finger flexor weakness: Not only inclusion-body myositis [^114aWr1T]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Low credibility.

Muscle disorders are characterized by differential involvement of various muscle groups. Among these, weakness predominantly affecting finger flexors is an uncommon pattern, most frequently found in sporadic inclusion-body myositis. This finding is particularly significant when the full range of histopathological findings of inclusion-body myositis is not found on muscle biopsy. Prominent finger flexor weakness, however, is also observed in other myopathies. It occurs commonly in myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2. In addition, individual reports and small case series have documented finger flexor weakness in sarcoid and amyloid myopathy, and in inherited myopathies caused by ACTA1, CRYAB, DMD, DYSF, FLNC, GAA, GNE, HNRNPDL, LAMA2, MYH7, and VCP mutations. Therefore, the finding of finger flexor weakness requires consideration of clinical, myopathological, genetic, electrodiagnostic, and sometimes muscle imaging findings to establish a diagnosis.

### Classification, diagnosis, and management of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^1154gXNN]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). High credibility.

The detection and characterization of a large array of autoantibodies, including at least eight different antisynthetase, anti-SRP, -200/100 (HMGCR), -Mi-2, -CADM-140 (MDA5), -SAE, -p155, -MJ (NXP-2), and -PMS1, frequently associated with distinct and well-defined clinicopathological features, have significantly improved the definition and diagnosis of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM). Classification remains difficult, with lingering divergence between the specialties involved in IIM care. However, several categories clearly stand out, including dermatomyositis (DM), overlap myositis (OM), polymyositis, necrotizing myositis, and sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM).

Biopsy and histological analysis remain crucial, particularly in the absence of autoantibodies, to accurately specify the diagnosis and rule out mimics such as muscular dystrophies and metabolic myopathies. Numerous infectious agents, in particular human immunodeficiency virus and human T cell lymphotropic virus-1, and drugs such as statins, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and proton pump inhibitors, can mimic IIM and must also be excluded.

Pharmacological treatment, in addition to glucocorticoids and immunoglobulins, now includes mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab, which have proven helpful in resistant cases, particularly rituximab in DM and OM. Exercise, initially seen as potentially deleterious, has recently been shown to be efficacious and safe. IIM can thus be reasonably well controlled in most cases, although aggressive disease remains refractory to treatment, including some cases of necrotizing myositis.
