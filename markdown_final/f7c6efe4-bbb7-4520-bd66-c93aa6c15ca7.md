## Question

Low intensity statin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of when and how to use low-intensity statins, including definitions, guideline-based indications, special populations, safety, adherence, and practical prescribing and monitoring steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition and expected LDL-C lowering of low-intensity statins. Then, I should verify guideline-based indications where low-intensity therapy is appropriate. Next, I will examine special populations where low-intensity may be preferred or required. After that, I need to review safety, tolerability, and adherence trade-offs. Then, I will consider combination strategies and treat-to-target approaches. Finally, I will synthesize practical prescribing and monitoring recommendations and close with a concise clinical take-home message.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misclassify doses. Low-intensity statins are those expected to lower LDL-C by less than 30% on average, with representative doses including simvastatin 10 mg, pravastatin 10–20 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, fluvastatin 20–40 mg, and pitavastatin 1 mg, whereas moderate-intensity agents typically achieve 30–49% reductions and high-intensity agents achieve at least 50% reductions [^111QwiYo] [^114ST8Up] [^1116swHG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about when low-intensity is "acceptable" versus "preferred". I should anchor to guideline indications. Low-intensity statins are generally not first-line for high-risk secondary prevention or for very high-risk primary prevention scenarios; instead, they are reserved for patients who cannot tolerate moderate- or high-intensity therapy due to adverse effects, drug–drug interactions, or frailty, with the overarching principle to use the maximally tolerated statin intensity and add nonstatins if LDL-C remains above goal [^112nizyu] [^115GAvN8] [^111vKS73].

> I need to check special populations where low-intensity may be particularly relevant. In adults older than 75 years, especially those with frailty or elevated fall risk, it is reasonable to initiate or de-escalate to moderate- or low-intensity statins after weighing benefits, adverse effects, and patient preferences; a treat-to-target approach with LDL-C goals around 50–70 mg/dL achieved similar outcomes to high-intensity therapy in older CAD patients, suggesting that lower-intensity regimens can be effective when guided by targets and adherence [^112nizyu] [^115zX3en] [^114wkEeP]. For patients with multiple comorbidities, polypharmacy, or high interaction risk, low-intensity statins may improve tolerability and persistence, though I should confirm that the absolute risk reduction still justifies therapy in each case [^113TtxoW].

> Wait, let me verify the safety and tolerability profile so I don't overstate risks. Low-intensity statins have a lower observed risk of myalgias and discontinuation compared with high-intensity regimens, and meta-analytic data suggest that combining ezetimibe with low/moderate-intensity statins yields fewer myalgias and less discontinuation than high-intensity monotherapy, albeit with similar MACE outcomes in some analyses, which is clinically meaningful for adherence [^114VQNXt] [^111QnvpL]. I should also note that while statins have a small, dose-dependent increase in new-onset diabetes, the absolute excess is modest and concentrated in those with baseline glycemic markers near diabetic thresholds, and the cardiovascular benefits still outweigh this risk in appropriately selected patients [^111M9EAW] [^115LtGRU].

> Let me consider adherence and persistence, because intensity without adherence undermines risk reduction. High-intensity therapy is associated with slightly lower adherence than low/moderate-intensity therapy in large observational cohorts, and real-world uptake of guideline-recommended intensities remains suboptimal, reinforcing that a tolerated, lower-intensity regimen may outperform an untaken high-intensity prescription in practice [^113TtxoW] [^116Xz77D]. I should double-check that this aligns with patient-centered guidance emphasizing persistence and percent LDL-C reduction achieved over time, which it does [^1154wzMH] [^111y4PTU].

> Next, I should review combination strategies because low-intensity statins can be paired with nonstatins to achieve greater LDL-C lowering without the tolerability burden of high-dose statins. Adding ezetimibe to low/moderate-intensity statins yields an additional roughly 20–25% LDL-C reduction and has favorable myalgia and discontinuation profiles compared with high-intensity monotherapy, and in some cohorts, low-intensity statin plus ezetimibe achieved similar cardiovascular outcomes to moderate-intensity statin monotherapy, which is useful when moderate/high-intensity statins are not tolerated or in Asian populations where lower statin doses are commonly used [^112nizyu] [^114VQNXt] [^111XuTP9]. But wait, what if I'm overstating outcome equivalence? I should confirm that MACE differences were not statistically significant in meta-analyses, which is correct, even though LDL-C lowering was greater with the combination, underscoring the importance of individualized risk–benefit discussions [^114VQNXt] [^111QnvpL].

> I will now examine treat-to-target as an alternative framework to fixed high-intensity dosing. The LODESTAR randomized trial showed that a treat-to-target strategy aiming for LDL-C 50–70 mg/dL was noninferior to high-intensity statin therapy for a composite of death, MI, stroke, or revascularization, with similar achieved LDL-C and fewer high-intensity prescriptions in the treat-to-target arm, supporting the idea that lower-intensity regimens guided by targets can be safe and effective when adherence is maintained [^111QzQMo] [^114EbKch]. Let me reconsider whether this applies to older adults; a post hoc analysis in those ≥ 75 years suggested comparable outcomes and reduced high-intensity statin use with the treat-to-target approach, which strengthens its applicability in geriatric practice [^114wkEeP].

> Now, I should translate this into practical prescribing. If a patient cannot tolerate moderate-intensity therapy, I would start or down-titrate to a low-intensity statin such as pravastatin 10–20 mg or pitavastatin 1 mg, screen for interactions, and promptly consider adding ezetimibe 10 mg if additional LDL-C lowering is needed, reassessing the percent reduction from baseline and absolute LDL-C at about 6–12 weeks to ensure the minimum 30% reduction threshold is approached when feasible or aligned with a treat-to-target goal [^111vKS73] [^112nizyu]. Hold on, I should verify that monitoring is still endorsed despite the move away from treat-to-target in some guidelines; contemporary expert perspectives emphasize measuring on-treatment LDL-C to document response and adherence, which I will incorporate into follow-up [^111FxykU] [^112f9wF2].

> Let me synthesize the clinical role of low-intensity statins so I don't miss the forest for the trees. Low-intensity statins are best viewed as a harm-reduction strategy to preserve some LDL-C lowering and cardiovascular benefit when moderate- or high-intensity therapy is not tolerated or is contraindicated, with the explicit plan to layer nonstatin therapy and, when appropriate, adopt a treat-to-target approach to achieve evidence-based LDL-C thresholds or percent reductions that correlate with event reduction, recognizing that percent LDL-C reduction itself carries prognostic value beyond dose or attained level [^112nizyu] [^117LiauX] [^115gAEZJ]. I should confirm that this aligns with the principle that greater LDL-C lowering yields greater risk reduction, which it does, supporting the clinical imperative to maximize tolerated intensity and consider combinations rather than abandoning therapy altogether [^113dPeES] [^114iwVRR].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and actionable. Low-intensity statins are appropriate when higher intensities are not tolerated or are inadvisable, particularly in older adults, those with multiple comorbidities or interactions, or patients who previously had statin-associated symptoms; pairing low-intensity statins with ezetimibe and using a treat-to-target strategy can achieve meaningful LDL-C lowering and, in some settings, comparable outcomes to high-intensity monotherapy, while improving adherence and persistence, which ultimately drives real-world risk reduction [^112nizyu] [^111QzQMo] [^114VQNXt] [^111y4PTU].

Low-intensity statins are indicated for patients who cannot tolerate moderate- or high-intensity therapy due to side effects or drug interactions, or for those at low cardiovascular risk who still require LDL-C lowering [^111vKS73]. They lower LDL-C by **< 30%** [^111QwiYo] and are less effective than higher-intensity regimens but are useful for maintaining some LDL-C reduction when higher intensities are not tolerated [^111QwiYo] [^111vKS73]. Common options include pravastatin 10–20 mg, simvastatin 10 mg, fluvastatin 20–40 mg, and lovastatin 20 mg [^1116swHG] [^111nMPzC]. Low-intensity statins have a favorable safety profile with lower rates of myalgia, liver enzyme elevation, and new-onset diabetes than higher-intensity regimens, and are often combined with ezetimibe to achieve greater LDL-C lowering when needed [^111M9EAW] [^114VQNXt].

---

## Definition and clinical indications

Low-intensity statins are defined by their **expected LDL-C reduction of less than 30%** [^111QwiYo] and are typically considered for the following clinical scenarios:

- **Statin intolerance**: Patients who experience significant side effects (e.g. myalgia, elevated liver enzymes) with moderate- or high-intensity statins may be switched to low-intensity regimens to maintain some LDL-C lowering benefit [^111vKS73].

- **Low cardiovascular risk**: Patients at low risk of ASCVD (e.g. 10-year ASCVD risk < 5%) who still have elevated LDL-C levels may be initiated on low-intensity statins to achieve modest LDL-C reduction without overtreatment [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: Patients taking medications that interact with statins (e.g. CYP3A4 inhibitors) may require low-intensity statins to minimize the risk of adverse effects [^notfound].

---

## Commonly prescribed low-intensity statins

| **Statin** | **Typical low-intensity dose** | **Expected ldl-c reduction** |
|-|-|-|
| Pravastatin | 10–20 mg daily | < 30% |
| Simvastatin | 10 mg daily | < 30% |
| Fluvastatin | 20–40 mg daily | < 30% |
| Lovastatin | 20 mg daily | < 30% |

---

These dosages are consistent with guideline definitions of low-intensity statin therapy and are commonly used in clinical practice [^1116swHG] [^111nMPzC].

---

## Clinical efficacy and cardiovascular outcomes

Low-intensity statins, while less potent than moderate- or high-intensity regimens, still provide meaningful reductions in LDL-C and cardiovascular risk. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (CTT) meta-analysis demonstrated that each 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C results in a **20% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events**, regardless of baseline LDL-C levels or statin intensity [^113dPeES]. However, low-intensity statins may not achieve the aggressive LDL-C targets recommended for high-risk patients, necessitating careful patient selection and monitoring [^116UxjEg].

---

## Safety profile and tolerability

Low-intensity statins are associated with a favorable safety profile, characterized by:

- **Lower incidence of myalgia**: Compared to higher-intensity statins, low-intensity regimens have a lower incidence of muscle-related side effects, improving patient adherence and persistence with therapy [^114VQNXt].

- **Reduced risk of liver enzyme elevation**: Low-intensity statins are less likely to cause significant liver enzyme elevations, making them suitable for patients with mild liver dysfunction or those at risk of hepatotoxicity [^111XuTP9].

- **Lower risk of new-onset diabetes**: Recent meta-analyses indicate a dose-dependent increase in new-onset diabetes with statin therapy, with low-intensity regimens conferring a lower risk compared to high-intensity regimens [^111M9EAW].

---

## Patient adherence and persistence

Adherence to statin therapy is critical for achieving cardiovascular risk reduction. Low-intensity statins, due to their favorable safety profile, are associated with **improved adherence and persistence** compared to higher-intensity regimens. A large Veterans Affairs cohort study found that adherence to statin therapy was significantly higher with low-intensity regimens compared to high-intensity regimens, particularly in patients with multiple comorbidities or those experiencing side effects [^113TtxoW].

---

## Combination therapy with ezetimibe

In patients who require additional LDL-C lowering beyond what low-intensity statins can achieve, combination therapy with ezetimibe is a viable option. Ezetimibe inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption and can provide an additional **15–25% LDL-C reduction** when combined with statins. Recent meta-analyses have demonstrated that low-intensity statins combined with ezetimibe can achieve greater LDL-C lowering and improved cardiovascular outcomes compared to statin monotherapy, with a favorable safety profile [^114VQNXt].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize individualized patient assessment and risk stratification when selecting statin intensity. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend **moderate- or high-intensity statins** for most patients with elevated cardiovascular risk, reserving low-intensity statins for those who cannot tolerate higher intensities or have specific clinical considerations [^112nizyu]. The National Lipid Association (NLA) similarly advocates for patient-centered management, emphasizing the importance of achieving at least a 30% reduction in LDL-C when feasible, even if this requires combination therapy [^1139u2U3].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While low-intensity statins offer several advantages, clinicians must consider the following limitations:

- **Limited LDL-C lowering**: Low-intensity statins may not achieve aggressive LDL-C targets required for high-risk patients, necessitating careful monitoring and potential escalation of therapy [^112nizyu].

- **Residual cardiovascular risk**: Patients on low-intensity statins may retain residual cardiovascular risk, particularly if baseline LDL-C levels are significantly elevated or if additional risk factors are present [^114YHkhW].

- **Need for regular monitoring**: Regular lipid monitoring is essential to assess treatment response and adjust therapy accordingly, particularly in patients with elevated cardiovascular risk [^111FxykU].

---

Low-intensity statins are a valuable therapeutic option for patients who cannot tolerate higher-intensity regimens or have low cardiovascular risk. They provide modest LDL-C reduction with a favorable safety profile, improved adherence, and can be combined with ezetimibe for additional LDL-C lowering. Clinicians should **individualize therapy** based on patient risk, tolerability, and treatment goals, with regular monitoring to ensure optimal cardiovascular risk reduction [^113qL1Ed].

### Is high-intensity statin therapy associated with lower statin adherence compared with low-to moderate-intensity statin therapy? Implications of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association cholesterol management guidelines [^113TtxoW]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The recent cholesterol guideline recommends high-intensity statins in cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients. High-intensity statins are associated with more frequent side effects. Therefore, it may be of concern that these recommendations might reduce statin adherence.

Hypothesis

High-intensity statins are associated with lower adherence compared with low- to moderate-intensity statins.

Methods

In a national database of 972,532 CVD patients from the Veterans Health Administration, we identified patients receiving statins between October 1, 2010, and September 30, 2011. We assessed statin adherence by calculating proportion of days covered (PDC) and determined whether high-intensity statin therapy was independently associated with a lower PDC.

Results

Statins were prescribed in 629,005 (64.7%). Of those, 229,437 (36.5%) received high-intensity statins. Mean PDC (0.87 vs 0.86, P < 0.0001) and patients with PDC ≥ 0.80 (76.3% vs 74.2%, P < 0.0001) were slightly higher for those receiving low- to moderate-intensity compared with high-intensity statins. In adjusted analyses, high-intensity statin use was associated with a significant but modest PDC reduction compared with low- to moderate-intensity statin use, whether PDC was assessed as a continuous (β-coefficient: -0.008, P < 0.0001) or categorical (PDC ≥ 0.80 [odds ratio: 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.93–0.96]) measure of statin adherence.

Conclusions

An approach of high-intensity statin therapy will lead to a significant practice change, as the majority of CVD patients are not on high-intensity therapy. However, this change may be associated with a very modest reduction in statin adherence compared with low- to moderate-intensity therapy that is unlikely to be of clinical significance.

Initiation of drug therapy — statin intensity and targets: Unless contraindicated, first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated atherogenic cholesterol levels is a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and a moderate-intensity statin will generally lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 30% to < 50% and a high-intensity statin by ≥ 50%, although individual patient responses should be expected to vary considerably. Some clinicians prefer to start with a high-intensity statin and reduce the dosage if the patient experiences intolerance, while others prefer to start with a moderate-intensity statin and titrate upward if additional lowering of atherogenic cholesterol is desired; if drug therapy is used, the panel consensus view was that at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted. Some patients have contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy, and for such patients, nonstatin drug therapy may be considered.

### To what extent do high-intensity statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in each of the four statin benefit groups identified by the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines? A VOYAGER meta-analysis [^1176kiRR]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines identify four patient groups who benefit from moderate- or high-intensity statin treatment; those with: 1) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); 2) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 190 mg/dl; 3) diabetes; or 4) a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%. High-intensity statins, anticipated to reduce LDL-C by ≥ 50%, were identified as rosuvastatin 20–40 mg and atorvastatin 40–80 mg.

Methods and Results

Individual patient data (32,258) from the VOYAGER database of 37 studies were used to calculate least-squares mean (LSM) percentage change in LDL-C during 8496 patient exposures to rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, and atorvastatin 40–80 mg in the four patient benefit groups. LSM percentage reductions in LDL-C with rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg were greater than with atorvastatin 40 mg, overall and in each statin benefit group, and with rosuvastatin 40 mg were greater than with atorvastatin 80 mg overall and in three of the four benefit groups (all p < 0.05). For example, in the ASCVD group, 40%, 59%, 57% and 71% of patients treated with atorvastatin 40 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg and rosuvastatin 40 mg, respectively, had a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C.

Conclusions

The choice and dose of statin have an impact both on the percentage LDL-C reduction and achievement of ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C, overall and within each of the four statin benefit groups outlined by the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines. This may be of importance for clinicians in their choice of treatment for individual patients.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^113uGQCP]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Very low LDL-C on high-intensity statins — in patients whose atherogenic cholesterol falls to very low levels (eg, LDL-C, < 40 mg/dL), at present, no evidence suggests harm, and therapy may be continued, particularly in those at very high ASCVD event risk, in the absence of signs or symptoms of intolerance; the limited amount of data available at these low levels is acknowledged.

### Combination therapy in dyslipidemia: where are we now? [^114YHkhW]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease: each 1.0 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C reduces the incidence of major coronary events, coronary revascularizations, and ischemic stroke by approximately 20%. Statins are a well-established treatment option for dyslipidemia, with LDL-C reduction in the range of 27–55%. Several lipid goal-driven guidelines recommend reducing LDL-C to < 2.59 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or < 1.81 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in very high-risk patients. Many patients treated with statins do not reach these goals, and remain at risk of future cardiovascular events. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines move away from advocating LDL-C treatment targets with focus placed on identifying patients most likely to benefit from high-intensity or moderate-intensity statin therapy. While increasing the statin dose can prove efficacious in some patients, this approach typically offers limited additional LDL-C lowering, and is associated with increased incidence of adverse side effects. Indeed, this has led to the investigation of statins in combination with other lipid-modifying agents for the treatment of dyslipidemia. This review of the evidence for statin use in combination with fibrates, niacin, bile acid sequestrants, and the cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, in dyslipidemic patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, explores the impact of such combination therapies on lipids, attainment of lipid targets, inflammatory markers, and on cardiovascular outcomes and pathology. Additionally, new and emerging dyslipidemia treatments are summarized.

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### Percent reduction in LDL cholesterol following high-intensity statin therapy: potential implications for guidelines and for the prescription of emerging lipid-lowering agents [^115gAEZJ]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

Current statin guidelines in Europe and Canada advocate achieving a fixed LDL target or the attainment of a ≥ 50% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), while current US guidelines advocate the use of statin therapies that reduce LDLC by < 50% (moderate intensity) or ≥ 50% (high intensity). Data are limited, however, linking the achievement of these % reduction thresholds to subsequent cardiovascular outcomes particularly for contemporary high-intensity regimens.

Methods and Results

In a randomized trial of 17 082 initially healthy men and women with median baseline LDLC of 108 mg/dL (interquartile range 94–119), we (i) used waterfall plots to assess the variability in LDLC response to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily and (ii) evaluated the impact of reaching ≥ 50% reductions in LDLC on risk of developing the first cardiovascular events. Among rosuvastatin allocated participants, 3640 individuals (46.3%) experienced an LDLC reduction ≥ 50%; 3365 individuals (42.8%) experienced an LDLC reduction > 0 but < 50%; and 851 individuals (10.8%) experienced no reduction or an increase in LDLC compared with baseline. These % LDLC reductions directly related to the risks of first cardiovascular events; at trial completion, incidence rates for the primary endpoint were 11.2, 9.2, 6.7, and 4.8 per 1000 person-years for those in the placebo, no LDLC reduction, LDLC reduction < 50%, and LDLC reduction ≥ 50% groups, respectively. Compared with placebo, the multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for sequentially greater on-treatment per cent reductions in LDLC were 0.91 (95%CI 0.54–1.53), 0.61 (95%CI 0.44–0.83), and 0.43 (95%CI 0.30–0.60) (P < 0.00001). Similar relationships between % reduction and clinical outcomes were observed in analyses focusing on non-HDLC or apolipoprotein B.

Conclusions

As documented for low- and moderate-intensity regimens, variability in % LDLC reduction following high-intensity statin therapy is wide yet the magnitude of this % reduction directly relates to efficacy. These data support guideline approaches that incorporate % reduction targets for statin therapy as well as absolute targets, and might provide a structure for the allocation of emerging adjunctive lipid-lowering therapies such as PCSK9 inhibitors should these agents prove broadly effective for cardiovascular event reduction.

### Uptake of statin guidelines to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease [^116Xz77D]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In December 2013, cholesterol treatment guidelines changed the approach to statin therapy by recommending fixed doses of low-, medium-, or high-intensity statins based on cardiovascular risk. We sought to evaluate the guideline's adoption in a diverse group of practices.

Methods

Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed electronic health record data the year before and 2years following guideline publication in 45 practices across 8 states. We examined associations based on patient, clinician, and practice characteristics and interviewed 24 clinicians and practice leaders to inform findings.

Results

The proportion of patients adherent with all recommendations 2 years after the guideline only increased from 18.5% to 20.3% (P&lt;.01). There were clinically insignificant increases in statin use across risk strata (1.7% to 3.5%) and small increases in high-intensity statin use (2.6% to 4.6%). Only half of patients with cardiovascular disease (52.9%) were on any statin, not much different from patients at moderate (49.6% to 50.9%) or low (41.6% to 48.7%) risk. Multiple patient (risk, use of health care), clinician (age), and practice (type, rurality) factors were associated with statin use. Clinicians reported patient resistance to statins but liked having a risk calculator to guide discussions.

Conclusion

Despite general agreement with statin benefit, the guideline was poorly implemented. Marginal differences in statin use between the highest and lower risk strata of patients is concerning. Rather than intensifying statin potency and recommending more patients take statins, guidelines may want to focus on ensuring that those who will benefit most get treatment.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA primary prevention — risk stratification for adults age 40–75 y and LDL-C 70–190 mg/dL (1.8–4.9 mmol/L) without diabetes mellitus uses 10-year ASCVD risk categories of < 5% 'Low Risk', 5% - < 7.5% 'Borderline Risk', ≥ 7.5% - < 20% 'Intermediate Risk', and ≥ 20% 'High Risk'. Corresponding actions are: emphasize lifestyle to reduce risk factors (Class I) for low risk; if risk enhancers present then risk discussion regarding moderate-intensity statin therapy (Class IIb) for borderline risk; if risk estimate + risk enhancers favor statin, initiate moderate-intensity statin to reduce LDL-C by 30% - 49% (Class I) for intermediate risk; and initiate statin to reduce LDL-C ≥ 50% (Class I) for high risk.

Intolerance to statin therapy — management steps include switching to a different high-intensity statin if indicated, switching to moderate- or low-intensity therapy, lowering the statin dose, or using nondaily dosing; in addition, the addition of nonstatin treatment plans to maximum tolerated statin therapy should be considered, as these are frequently associated with improved medication-taking behavior and achievement of LDL cholesterol goals.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111k11S8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction and ASCVD event risk — the primary endpoint incidence showed a stepwise pattern with 11.2, 9.2, 6.7, and 4.8 per 1000 person-years across placebo, no LDL-C reduction, LDL-C reduction of < 50%, and LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50%, respectively, and high-intensity statin prescription does not guarantee a robust lipid-lowering response or preclude the need to measure the response to ensure ongoing efficacy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — LDL-C thresholds and nonstatin considerations: Adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk should be treated first at the maximally tolerated statin intensity. If patients have achieved ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 85 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and monitor adherence and LDL-C response. In view of trial evidence and very low LDL-C levels achieved with nonstatin therapies, a lower LDL-C threshold of LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≤ 85 mg/dL) is recommended by the writing committee, and preference should be given to therapies with demonstrated cardiovascular outcomes benefits. Individuals who achieve LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL experience lower event rates than those with higher LDL-C, there appears to be no LDL-C level below which benefit ceases, and lifelong very low LDL-C levels in the range of 15–30 mg/dL are associated with a lower incidence of ASCVD without adverse effects.

### Combination therapy with statins: who benefits? [^116KNohX]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Many lipid-lowering drugs improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. However, when therapies have been studied in addition to statins, it has been challenging to show an additional clinical benefit in terms of CV event reduction, although overall safety seems acceptable. This debate has been complicated by recent guidelines that emphasize treatment with high-potency statin monotherapy. Combination therapy allows more patients to successfully reach their ideal lipid targets. Further testing of novel therapies may introduce an era of potent low-density lipoprotein decrease without dependence on statins, but until then, they remain the mainstay of therapy.

### Treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: synopsis of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association cholesterol guideline [^113qL1Ed]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2013, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released a clinical practice guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults. This synopsis summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2008, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) IV to update the 2001 ATP-III cholesterol guidelines using a rigorous process to systematically review randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs that examined cardiovascular outcomes. The panel commissioned independent systematic evidence reviews on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in secondary and primary prevention and the effect of lipid drugs on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and adverse effects. In September 2013, the panel's draft recommendations were transitioned to the ACC/AHA.

Recommendations

This synopsis summarizes key features of the guidelines in 8 areas: lifestyle, groups shown to benefit from statins, statin safety, decision making, estimation of cardiovascular disease risk, intensity of statin therapy, treatment targets, and monitoring of statin therapy.

Targeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with pharmacologic therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention in adults — the algorithm emphasizes lifestyle counseling and risk‑based statin use. Primary prevention begins with counseling to reduce ASCVD risk and risk assessment, recognizes risk enhancers such as "Metabolic syndrome/ MASLD", "CKD, chronic inflammatory diseases", and "Persistent LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L)", and advises to "Consider moderate- to high-intensity statin"; if "If LDL-C above goal on maximally tolerated statin, add ezetimibe". For secondary prevention (clinical ASCVD), it specifies "High-intensity statin", then "If LDL-C above goal or continues to have CV events, add ezetimibe", and to "Consider add-on therapy: bempedoic acid, PCSK9-based therapy, or bile acid resins", with the caveat, "Not all add-on agents have evidence for reducing ASCVD risk. Use shared decision-making to discuss the benefits and harms of the individual therapies". The figure also states, "AACE suggests treating individuals with ASCVD or increased risk of ASCVD to an LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL" and that "Potential impacts from polypharmacy and the increased costs with certain medications should be considered when determining appropriate treatment goals".

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^1139u2U3]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA recommendations — older adults with dyslipidemia: In primary prevention, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals of < 130 mg/dL and < 100 mg/dL are appropriate targets, and after a minimum 3–6 month trial on lifestyle modification moderate intensity statin therapy is recommended whenever feasible; the NLA high-risk thresholds are ≥ 15% 10-year risk for a hard ASCVD event using the Pooled Cohort Equations and ≥ 10% 10-year risk for a hard CHD event using the ATP III Framingham Risk Calculator, and in patients ≥ 65 years of age with uncertainty about drug therapy it is reasonable to recommend moderate intensity statin therapy when there is 1 or more major ASCVD risk factor or when risk exceeds 15% or 10% by the respective calculators; in situations requiring additional objective information, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring may be considered and a score of zero in asymptomatic patients may suggest that non-pharmacologic approaches are reasonable; for those ≥ 80 years of age with atherogenic lipoproteins above goals, a provider-patient discussion should be undertaken and if statin intolerance is the primary issue, consideration should be given to alternate statin regimens including low intensity or non-daily moderate intensity statin therapy, low dose statin combination therapy with ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, or niacin, or non-statin monotherapy, and in general, we recommend that providers try to achieve at least a 30% LDL-C reduction.

### Adherence to blood cholesterol treatment guidelines among physicians managing patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^114EAtB1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA blood cholesterol treatment guidelines recommend statin therapy for all patients after experiencing an acute cardiovascular event. Previous analyses have shown that physicians have been slow to adopt guidelines, and many patients remain untreated or undertreated with statins after a cardiovascular event. However, reasons for this remain unknown. This analysis used electronic medical records and patient chart data from Reliant Medical Group (Worcester, Massachusetts) to evaluate physician adherence to the 2013 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol guidelines when treating patients with evidence of acute atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and the reasons for the observed treatment decisions. Less than 50% of acute atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients were treated according to the ACC/AHA guidelines. Nearly 42% of patients not treated according to guidelines received a lower statin intensity than recommended. The most common reason cited by 41.8% of physicians for treating with a statin intensity below the recommended intensity was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol stable or at goal, despite ACC/AHA guidelines recommending specific statin intensities rather than specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In conclusion, physician and patient education on the importance of maximizing lipid-lowering therapy in this high-risk patient population should be emphasized.

ACC/AHA primary prevention — risk-based statin therapy and coronary artery calcium (CAC) use in adults: For age 40–75 y with LDL-C 70–190 mg/dL without diabetes mellitus, a 10-year ASCVD risk discussion is initiated and actions align with risk strata: < 5% "Low Risk" emphasizes lifestyle (Class I); 5% - < 7.5% "Borderline Risk" considers moderate-intensity statin if risk enhancers are present (Class IIb); ≥ 7.5% - < 20% "Intermediate Risk" favors initiating moderate-intensity statin to reduce LDL-C by 30% - 49% (Class I); and ≥ 20% "High Risk" initiates statin to reduce LDL-C ≥ 50% (Class I). When risk decision is uncertain, CAC = zero lowers risk and clinicians may consider no statin unless diabetes, family history of premature CHD, or cigarette smoking are present; CAC = 1–99 favors statin (especially after age 55); CAC = 100+ and/or ≥ 75th percentile indicates statin therapy. Additional branches specify LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL warrants high-intensity statin without risk assessment (Class I), diabetes mellitus age 40–75 y warrants moderate-intensity statin (Class I) with risk assessment to consider high-intensity statin (Class IIa), and age > 75 y requires clinical assessment and risk discussion.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and statin intensity in myocardial infarction patients and major adverse outcomes: a Swedish nationwide cohort study [^111Bpwcw]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Epidemiological, genetic, and interventional studies indicate that higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) events. Indeed, multiple clinical trials have shown a decreased risk of CV-related morbidity associated with lowering of LDL-C levels. Hence, a cornerstone for secondary prevention of CV disease is treatment with LDL-C-lowering therapies.

Data suggest that regardless of pre-treatment LDL-C concentrations, the relative CV risk reduction acquired per unit reduction of LDL-C is consistent. Clinical trials have shown that patients with higher baseline LDL-C levels appear to benefit the most from LDL-C-lowering therapy, with a larger absolute LDL-C lowering associated with the greatest reduction in mortality. However, studies assessing this relationship in trials of patients with predefined characteristics are often not representative of patients seen in real-world clinical practice. There is a paucity of information assessing the association between early changes in LDL-C level and intensity of statin therapy after a myocardial infarction (MI) with long-term prognosis from real-life patient populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between early LDL-C changes and statin intensity with mortality and major adverse CV outcomes after an MI.

ACC/AHA guideline recommendations for statin intensity in clinical ASCVD — High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men ≤ 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, unless contraindicated, and when high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or when characteristics predisposing to statin-associated adverse effects are present, moderate-intensity statin should be used as the second option if tolerated. In individuals with clinical ASCVD > 75 years of age, it is reasonable to evaluate the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction benefits and for adverse effects, drug-drug interactions and to consider patient preferences when initiating a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and it is reasonable to continue statin therapy in those who are tolerating it. Clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary syndromes, a history of MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, TIA, and peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin.

### A comparative analysis of current Lipid Treatment guidelines: nothing stands still [^113p5GKP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Lipid treatment guidelines have continued to evolve as new evidence emerges. We sought to review similarities and differences of 5 lipid treatment guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, Canadian Cardiovascular Society, European Society for Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and U.S. Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense. All guidelines utilize rigorous evidentiary review, highlight statin therapy for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and emphasize a clinician-patient risk discussion. However, there are differences in statin intensities, use of risk estimators, treatment of specific patient subgroups, and consideration of safety concerns. Clinicians should understand these similarities and differences in current and future guideline recommendations when considering if and how to treat their patients with statin therapy.

1 Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of global mortality and disability, with elevated serum lipid levels, particularly low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) as one of its major risk factors. Lowering LDL‐C is crucial in mitigating the negative outcomes of CVD, especially in patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Statins are the first‐line therapy for patients with ASCVD for LDL‐C elevations, but many patients on low/moderate‐intensity statin regimens fail to attain target LDL‐C levels. Contemporary guidelines recommend high‐intensity statins for hyperlipidemia treatment, but they come with challenges such as drug interactions and dose‐dependent adverse events. An alternative approach is combining ezetimibe, a non‐statin drug, with tolerated stain dosage. Ezetimibe has shown efficacy in lowering LDL‐C alongside a more favorable safety profile. However, previous meta‐analyses have shown conflicting information regarding the superiority in efficacy or safety profile of high‐intensity statin monotherapy compared to low/moderate‐intensity statin combined with ezetimibe therapy. Given the recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta‐analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of these two lipid‐lowering strategies in ASCVD patients.

### Is lower and lower better and better? A re-evaluation of the evidence from the cholesterol treatment trialists' collaboration meta-analysis for low-density lipoprotein lowering [^112MM9yq]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Researchers from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration have argued for maximal lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by the use of pharmacologic agents, with the strongest evidence coming from the five comparison statin studies in their second meta-analysis. The CTT meta-analysis has many strengths but also a number of limitations, which have not been discussed and which, given the clinical implications, require consideration. Among these are: (1) the impact and validity of including revascularizations within a composite primary end point; (2) the inclusion of the A-Z study, whose design does not allow for valid comparisons of two statin regimens; (3) the fact that baseline LDL-C levels in the comparison studies were not low enough to test whether statin therapy reduces risk significantly in groups with an initial low LDL-C; and, most important, (4) authors of the five studies compared doses at the extremes of statin regimens. However, the clinical choice is not between the lowest and the greatest dose of a statin statin regimens, for example, between 10 and 80 mg atorvastatin, but, more realistically, between intermediate and high dose, that is, between 40 and 80 mg atorvastatin. On the basis of the CTT meta-analysis, we calculate that any potential gain from increasing the dose from 40 to 80 mg atorvastatin would be very small, at best a further 2% further reduction in clinical events. The increase in dose, unfortunately, would likely be associated with increased side effects and decreased compliance. Accordingly, whether net benefit would be demonstrable cannot be assumed. It follows that definitive evidence supporting maximal lowering of LDL-C or maximal dose of statins is still lacking and guidelines, if they are to be evidence-based, should acknowledge this uncertainty.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low / moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114VQNXt]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

It remains controversial whether adding ezetimibe to low/moderate-intensity statins has a more beneficial impact on the treatment efficacy and safety of patients with existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) compared to high-intensity statin regimens.

Hypothesis

A combination of low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe might be more effective and safer than high-intensity statin monotherapy.

Methods

We searched databases for randomized controlled trials comparing lipid profile alterations, drug-related adverse events, and MACE components between high-intensity statin monotherapy and low/moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe combination therapy. Pooled risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using a random-effects model.

Results

Our comprehensive search resulted in 32 studies comprising 6162 patients treated with monotherapy against 5880 patients on combination therapy. Combination therapy was more effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels compared to monotherapy (MD = -6.6, 95% CI: -10.6 to -2.5); however, no significant differences were observed in other lipid parameters. Furthermore, the combination therapy group experienced a lower risk of myalgia (RR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13–0.57) and discontinuation due to adverse events (RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.51–0.74). The occurrence of MACE was similar between the two treatment groups.

Conclusions

Adding ezetimibe to low/moderate-intensity statins resulted in a greater reduction in LDL-C levels, a lower rate of myalgia, and less drug discontinuation compared to high-intensity statin monotherapy in patients with existing cardiovascular disease. However, according to our meta-analysis, the observed reduction in LDL-C levels in the combination group did not correlate with a reduction in MACE compared to the high-intensity statin group.

### The effects of lowering LDL cholesterol with statin therapy in people at low risk of vascular disease: meta-analysis of individual data from 27 randomised trials [^113dPeES]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Statins reduce LDL cholesterol and prevent vascular events, but their net effects in people at low risk of vascular events remain uncertain.

Methods

This meta-analysis included individual participant data from 22 trials of statin versus control (n = 134,537; mean LDL cholesterol difference 1·08 mmol/L; median follow-up 4·8 years) and five trials of more versus less statin (n = 39,612; difference 0·51 mmol/L; 5·1 years). Major vascular events were major coronary events (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death), strokes, or coronary revascularisations. Participants were separated into five categories of baseline 5-year major vascular event risk on control therapy (no statin or low-intensity statin) (< 5%, ≥ 5% to < 10%, ≥ 10% to < 20%, ≥ 20% to < 30%, ≥ 30%); in each, the rate ratio (RR) per 1·0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction was estimated.

Findings

Reduction of LDL cholesterol with a statin reduced the risk of major vascular events (RR 0·79, 95% CI 0·77–0·81, per 1·0 mmol/L reduction), largely irrespective of age, sex, baseline LDL cholesterol or previous vascular disease, and of vascular and all-cause mortality. The proportional reduction in major vascular events was at least as big in the two lowest risk categories as in the higher risk categories (RR per 1·0 mmol/L reduction from lowest to highest risk: 0·62 [99% CI 0·47–0·81], 0·69 [99% CI 0·60–0·79], 0·79 [99% CI 0·74–0·85], 0·81 [99% CI 0·77–0·86], and 0·79 [99% CI 0·74–0·84]; trend p = 0·04), which reflected significant reductions in these two lowest risk categories in major coronary events (RR 0·57, 99% CI 0·36–0·89, p = 0·0012, and 0·61, 99% CI 0·50–0·74, p < 0·0001) and in coronary revascularisations (RR 0·52, 99% CI 0·35–0·75, and 0·63, 99% CI 0·51–0·79; both p < 0·0001). For stroke, the reduction in risk in participants with 5-year risk of major vascular events lower than 10% (RR per 1·0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 0·76, 99% CI 0·61–0·95, p = 0·0012) was also similar to that seen in higher risk categories (trend p = 0·3). In participants without a history of vascular disease, statins reduced the risks of vascular (RR per 1·0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 0·85, 95% CI 0·77–0·95) and all-cause mortality (RR 0·91, 95% CI 0·85–0·97), and the proportional reductions were similar by baseline risk. There was no evidence that reduction of LDL cholesterol with a statin increased cancer incidence (RR per 1·0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 1·00, 95% CI 0·96–1·04), cancer mortality (RR 0·99, 95% CI 0·93–1·06), or other non-vascular mortality.

Interpretation

In individuals with 5-year risk of major vascular events lower than 10%, each 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol produced an absolute reduction in major vascular events of about 11 per 1000 over 5 years. This benefit greatly exceeds any known hazards of statin therapy. Under present guidelines, such individuals would not typically be regarded as suitable for LDL-lowering statin therapy. The present report suggests, therefore, that these guidelines might need to be reconsidered.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^1161CbN6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Preceding release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) cholesterol guidelines, prescribers aimed for specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The 2013 guidelines changed this focus to treating patients with appropriate statin intensity given their ASCVD risk. We examined statin use and LDL-C levels before and after the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines in patients with clinical ASCVD as defined in the guidelines.

Methods and Results

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult commercial and Medicare Advantage health plan enrollees in the Optum Research Database. Patients had ≥ 1 claim with a diagnosis of clinical ASCVD between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014 and were continuously enrolled 6 months before (baseline) and 7 months after (follow-up) the first ASCVD visit. Patients were assigned to monthly cohorts based on ASCVD event month. Statin use and intensity were measured at baseline and first month of follow-up. LDL-C changes were assessed using ordinary least squares regression. For 90 287 patients, mean (SD) age was 68 (12) years; 50% were female; and 30% had commercial insurance. Statin use remained consistent before and after guidelines (32% and 31%, respectively). Of patients receiving statins, high-intensity use increased by 4 percentage points 1 year after guidelines (P < 0.001). Mean LDL-C levels were 2.4 mmol/L (94 mg/dL) both pre- and postguidelines.

Conclusions

Statin use and mean monthly LDL-C before and after the guidelines remained largely unchanged; statin intensity increased modestly. More effort may be needed to increase guideline understanding and adherence to improve treatment of high-risk patients.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — intermediate and high risk targets: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended, and in intermediate risk patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more; for patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more.

### Transiently achieved very low LDL-cholesterol levels by statin and alirocumab after acute coronary syndrome are associated with cardiovascular risk reduction: the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial [^112BjDGy]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Cholesterol lowering is generally considered a chronic therapy with no defined time for attenuation of treatment intensity. Recognizing the limitations above, the current findings raise the possibility that a short period of very high-intensity cholesterol lowering with a PCSK9 inhibitor and statin resulting in very low LDL-C levels, followed by long-term statin monotherapy (i.e. an induction and maintenance regimen), may provide clinical efficacy with lower cost and complexity of care than indefinite dual-agent therapy. Future prospective randomized clinical trials could be designed to compare clinical outcomes with these two approaches.

Clinical practice impact of removing LDL-C targets — Removal of the LDL-C treatment goal in the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline led to widespread and unanticipated impacts across clinical practice and organizations. The elimination of LDL-C treatment goals and the classification of certain statins as "high intensity" led the medical community to assume incorrectly that on-treatment LDL-C measurement and monitoring were unnecessary, despite the fact that LDL-C measurement was a Class IA recommendation in the 2013 guideline, and elimination of LDL-C measurement and specific LDL-C goals was widespread and affected most guidelines related to ASCVD over the ensuing decade.

### 2013 cholesterol guidelines revisited: percent LDL cholesterol reduction or attained LDL cholesterol level or both for prognosis? [^117LiauX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol recommends moderate- to high-intensity statins for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease but departs from the traditional treat-to-target approach. Whether percent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction or attained LDL-C levels add incremental prognostic value to statin dose is not known.

Methods

Patients in the Treating to New Targets (TNT), Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL), and Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trials (patient-level data) randomized to a statin arm (atorvastatin 80 mg/10 mg or simvastatin 20 mg) were chosen. Patients were divided into groups based on attained LDL-C levels (≤ 70 vs > 70 mg/dL) and percent LDL-C reduction (≥ 50% vs < 50%). Primary outcome was major cardiovascular event defined as death due to coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or stroke. Incremental prognostic value was assessed by using a forward conditional Cox proportional hazards model. Two models were tested: Model 1: Step 1 statin dose; Step 2 add attained LDL-C levels (continuous variable); Step 3 add percent LDL-C reduction (continuous variable). Model 2: Steps 2 and 3 were reversed.

Results

Among 13,937 patients included in this study, percent LDL-C reduction added incremental prognostic value over both statin dose and attained LDL-C levels (global chi-square increased from 3.64 to 26.1 to 47.5; P < .0001). However, attained LDL-C level did not provide incremental prognostic value over statin dose and percent LDL-C reduction (global chi-square increased from 3.64 to 47.5 to 47.5; P < .0001 and .94, respectively). Among patients with attained LDL-C ≤ 70 mg/dL, those with percent LDL-C reduction of < 50% had a significantly higher risk of primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.16–1.97; p = 0.002) and stroke (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.46–2.93; P < .0001) and a numerically higher risk of death (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.98–1.90; p = 0.06) when compared with the group with percent LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50%.

Conclusions

In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, percent LDL-C reduction provides incremental prognostic value over statin dose and attained LDL-C levels. However, the attained LDL-C level does not provide additional prognostic value over statin dose and percent LDL-C reduction.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113ibFsf]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC 2022 ECDP — Adults with diabetes without ASCVD and baseline LDL-C < 190 mg/dL on statin therapy for primary prevention: The guideline recommends that all adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes receive at least a moderate-intensity statin, and higher-risk subgroups (including reduced eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and ankle brachial index < 0.9) are potential candidates for high-intensity statin therapy. For the small proportion with 10-year predicted ASCVD risk < 7.5% and no additional high-risk features, moderate-intensity statin therapy with anticipated LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) reduction 30%-49% is supported; soluble dietary fiber and phytosterols may also be considered. Because elevated non-HDL-C (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) is common in diabetes, non-HDL-C thresholds are important to consider. If, despite adherence to lifestyle recommendations and moderate-intensity statin therapy, patients have < 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), consideration of intensification of therapy is indicated and routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted. If the response reaches a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue current therapy. If still inadequate after these steps, the patient and clinician may consider increasing the statin dose to a high-intensity statin. If high-intensity statin therapy still results in inadequate percent LDL-C reduction or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), the clinician and patient should enter a discussion focused on adding a nonstatin; ezetimibe 10 mg daily may be considered as the initial nonstatin agent for most patients when additional LDL-C lowering is desired.

### Recent update to the US cholesterol treatment guidelines: a comparison with international guidelines [^1113ZDzD]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol guideline advocated several changes from the previous Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Assuming full implementation, the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline would identify ≈13 million Americans as newly eligible for consideration of statin therapy. Three features of the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline primarily responsible for these differences are the specific risk assessment tool endorsed, the risk threshold considered sufficient to warrant primary prevention statin therapy, and the decision not to include cholesterol treatment targets. There is no consensus among international guidelines on the optimal approach to these 3 components. The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline recommends assessing absolute risk with the Pooled Cohort equations, which were developed to improve on previous risk assessment models by including stroke as an outcome and by broadening racial and geographic diversity. Each of the leading international guidelines recommends a different equation for absolute risk assessment. The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline advises consideration of statin therapy for an estimated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease of ≥ 7.5%, which is lower than the thresholds recommended by other leading international guidelines. Lastly, the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline does not endorse a treat-to-target strategy but instead specifies the appropriate intensity of statin for each risk category. This approach is shared by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines but differs from other international guidelines. In this review, we summarize the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline recommendations and compare them with recommendations from Adult Treatment Panel III and other leading international guidelines.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1152jSna]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Statin therapy recommendations and risk considerations in people with HIV aged 40 to 75 years — The Panel's decision to recommend the use of at least moderate‑intensity statin therapy includes a strong recommendation for those with a 10‑year ASCVD risk score ≥ 5% to < 20% (AI). For those aged 40 to 75 years with low estimated ASCVD risk (< 5%), additional HIV‑related factors may be important to consider, and the Panel favors initiating at least moderate‑intensity statin therapy for those with a 10‑year ASCVD risk score < 5% (CI). Risk‑enhancing factors include history of prolonged HIV viremia and/or delayed ART initiation, low current or nadir CD4 count (< 350 cells/mm3), HIV treatment failure or nonadherence, and lipodystrophy/lipoatrophy, while people initiating ART at higher CD4 counts (e.g., > 500 cells/mm3) are likely to be at lower absolute ASCVD risk. Shared decision‑making should take into account the benefits along with side effects, costs, drug–drug interaction potential, and other patient‑centered factors, and for people at low (< 5%) 10‑year ASCVD risk it is particularly important to weigh potential benefits against risks.

### Effects of statin therapy on diagnoses of new-onset diabetes and worsening glycaemia in large-scale randomised blinded statin trials: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^115LtGRU]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

The annual rate of development of new-onset diabetes in the placebo group was substantially greater in higher versus lower quartiles of baseline glycaemia. Consequently, the majority (ie, approximately 62%) of excess cases of new-onset diabetes occurred among participants in the highest quarter of the baseline glycaemia distribution for both low-intensity or moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin therapy (figure 2). The proportion of excess cases in the top quarter increased only slightly to approximately 67% when baseline age, sex, BMI, triglycerides, eGFR, and HDL cholesterol were added to glycaemia in a diabetes risk score (figure 2).

Among people with diabetes at baseline, allocation to low-intensity or moderate-intensity statin resulted in a 10% relative increase in worsening glycaemia compared with placebo (6224 of 12 109 participants assigned to statin therapy [16·3% per year] vs 5902 of 11 941 participants assigned to placebo [15·4% per year]; RR 1·10 [95% CI 1·06 to 1·14]; absolute annual excess 1·49% [0·87 to 2·13]), and in the high-intensity trials, allocation to this group resulted in a 24% relative increase in worsening glycaemia (338 of 805 participants assigned to statin therapy [16·0% per year] vs 295 of 846 participants assigned to placebo [12·8% per year]; 1·24 [1·06 to 1·44]; absolute annual excess 3·02% [0·73 to 5·69]; figure 3). In the trials of low-intensity or moderate-intensity statin versus placebo and the trials of more versus less intensive statin versus placebo, the relative effects on worsening glycaemia were larger in the earlier than later years of follow-up (appendix pp 26–27). The mean increase in glucose concentration during the treatment period compared with participants assigned to receive placebo was 0·12 mmol/L (95% CI 0·04 to 0·21) for low-intensity or moderate-intensity statin therapy and 0·22 mmol/L (–0·02 to 0·45) for high-intensity statin therapy, and the corresponding increases in HbA 1c were 0·09% (0·05 to 0·14) for low-intensity or moderate-intensity statin therapy and 0·24% (0·09 to 0·38) for high-intensity statin therapy (appendix p 10).

### Sub-optimal cholesterol response to initiation of statins and future risk of cardiovascular disease [^114rEkXc]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death globally. The positive correlation between the incidence of CVD and levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration has been well-established. Statins are recognised as being effective in lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of future CVD events for both primary or secondary prevention.

Following a meta-analysis of cholesterol treatment trials, the percentage reductions in LDL-C achieved by specific statins (and their doses) have been established from the data of patients in whom statins reduced CVD events. Accordingly, national guidelines in the United States and UK recommend intended LDL-C reduction targets for statin therapy to reduce CVD. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines suggested a fixed dose (or intensity) of statin for each risk category, with an intended LDL-C reduction of 30–49% and ≥ 50% for moderate and high intensity statins, respectively. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines in the UK aim for > 40% reduction in non-HDL-C.

Both individual biological and genetic variability in LDL-C response to statin therapy, as well as variation in adherence, have been identified. However, there is limited evidence on variation in LDL-C response in the general population for patients initiated on statins for primary prevention of CVD.

In this large, prospective open population cohort study, we sought to assess differences in LDL-C response in primary care patients initiated on statins and their impact on future CVD events.

### Present status of statin therapy [^113CCdo8]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Statins are cardioprotective agents that reduce the adverse effects of increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. For significantly dyslipidemic persons, who are at higher cardiovascular risk, combined statin therapy substantially reduces the mortality risk, thus potentially being an ideal risk-reducing combination with added risk reduction by lifestyle changes. Decisions regarding the initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention where the absolute risk reduction is much less are more difficult, involving LDL-C levels and higher C-reactive protein levels. For significantly dyslipidemic persons, combined intense exercise and statin therapy substantially reduces the mortality risk, thus potentially being an ideal risk-reducing combination.

### The risk of hepatotoxicity, new onset diabetes and rhabdomyolysis in the era of high-intensity statin therapy: does statin type matter? [^116pGtXH]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on cholesterol management have placed greater emphasis on high-intensity statin dosing for those with known cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus. Differences in risk of hepatotoxicity, new onset diabetes and rhabdomyolysis specifically between the high-intensity statins and the most common moderate-intensity statin, simvastatin, were not found to a significant degree in this review. Rather, baseline characteristics and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) appear to be more important regarding the risk of these adverse effects. Pharmacogenetic differences in statin metabolism may explain individual susceptibility, however genetic testing is not felt to be cost effective at this time. More importantly, statin choice should consider concomitant use of the many prevalent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, and when present, rosuvastatin selection is recommended to reduce DDIs and risk of statin-induced adverse effects.

### Association between intensity of statin therapy and mortality in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^115rxdHG]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

High-intensity statin therapy is recommended for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Nevertheless, statin therapy in general, and high-intensity statin therapy in particular, is underused in patients with established ASCVD.

Objective

To determine the association between all-cause mortality and intensity of statin therapy in the Veterans Affairs health care system.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of patients aged 21 to 84 years with ASCVD treated in the Veterans Affairs health care system from April 1, 2013, to April 1, 2014. Patients who were included had 1 or more International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for ASCVD on 2 or more different dates in the prior 2 years.

Exposures

Intensity of statin therapy was defined by the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, and use was defined as a filled prescription in the prior 6 months. Patients were excluded if they were taking a higher statin dose in the prior 5 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was death from all causes adjusted for the propensity to receive high-intensity statins.

Results

The study sample included 509 766 eligible adults with ASCVD at baseline (mean [SD] age, 68.5 [8.8] years; 499 598 men and 10 168 women), including 150 928 (29.6%) receiving high-intensity statin therapy, 232 293 (45.6%) receiving moderate-intensity statin therapy, 33 920 (6.7%) receiving low-intensity statin therapy, and 92 625 (18.2%) receiving no statins. During a mean follow-up of 492 days, there was a graded association between intensity of statin therapy and mortality, with 1-year mortality rates of 4.0% (5103 of 126 139) for those receiving high-intensity statin therapy, 4.8% (9703 of 200 709) for those receiving moderate-intensity statin therapy, 5.7% (1632 of 28 765) for those receiving low-intensity statin therapy, and 6.6% (4868 of 73 728) for those receiving no statin (P < .001). After adjusting for the propensity to receive high-intensity statins, the hazard ratio for mortality was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88–0.93) for those receiving high- vs moderate-intensity statins. The magnitude of benefit of high- vs moderate-intensity statins was similar, for an incident cohort hazard ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85–1.01). For patients aged 76 to 84 years, the hazard ratio was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87–0.95). Patients treated with maximal doses of high-intensity statins had lower mortality (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87–0.94) compared with those receiving submaximal doses.

Conclusions and Relevance

We found a graded association between intensity of statin therapy and mortality in a national sample of patients with ASCVD. High-intensity statins were associated with a small but significant survival advantage compared with moderate-intensity statins, even among older adults. Maximal doses of high-intensity statins were associated with a further survival benefit.

### The efficacy of intensive lipid-lowering therapies on the reduction of LDLc and of major cardiovascular events [^115WtuXE]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Statins are the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) for reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) levels and high percentage of patients require LLT combinations or alternative treatments for adequate LDLc control.

Methods

We performed an intention-to-treat meta-analysis of published data of phase III trials evaluating LLT efficacy on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The primary endpoint was MACE incidence, as reported in each trial, and secondary analyses included myocardial infarction, stroke and mortality.

Results

Eleven clinical trials and 135,688 patients were included; seven trials tested high intensity LLT and 4 LLT combinations. Intensive LLT reduced MACE risk by 15% (12.03% vs. 13.79%, HR: 0.85 95% CI 0.80–0.90; p < 0.001). The number needed to treat was 56 patients. Meta-regression analyses showed a linear correlation between absolute LDLc reductions and the risk of MACE. Significant reductions in myocardial infarction (HR: 0.83, 95% CI 0.80–0.86) and stroke (HR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.75–0.87) were observed. Cardiovascular death rate was 3.32% in LLT treatment arm vs. 3.56% in controls, resulting in a HR: 0.94 (95% CI 0.88–0.99; p = 0.03); no effect on all-cause mortality was observed (HR: 0.97 95% CI 0.93–1.01; p = 0.09). The sensitivity analyses verified the lack of heterogeneity, except for MACE that was mainly driven by the divergent results of the 2 trials. Small study effect was detected for the assessment of mortality.

Conclusions

Current evidence consistently supports the efficacy of available intensity LLT for LDLc decrease on MACE and cardiovascular mortality reduction.

Table 3. High-, moderate-, and low-intensity statin therapy — statin therapy is divided into three categories, with high-intensity, moderate-intensity, and low-intensity therapies typically lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by ≥ 50%, 30%–49%, and < 30%, respectively. Representative high-intensity doses include Atorvastatin (40 mg†) 80 mg and Rosuvastatin 20 mg (40 mg). Moderate-intensity options include Atorvastatin 10 mg (20 mg), Rosuvastatin (5 mg) 10 mg, Simvastatin 20–40 mg§, Pravastatin 40 mg (80 mg), Lovastatin 40 mg (80 mg), Fluvastatin XL 80 mg, Fluvastatin 40 mg BID, and Pitavastatin 1–4 mg; a low-intensity example is Fluvastatin 20–40 mg. Boldface type indicates statins and doses evaluated in randomized controlled trials that demonstrated a reduction in major cardiovascular events. Although simvastatin 80 mg was evaluated, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not recommended by the FDA because of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Percent reductions are estimates from large populations and individual responses vary in clinical practice.

### New cholesterol guidelines for the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a comparison of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association cholesterol guidelines with the 2014 National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia [^114yVDBb]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

This review discusses the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults and compares it with the 2014 National Lipid Association (NLA) Recommendations for Patient-Centered Management of Dyslipidemia. The review discusses some of the distinctions between the guidelines, including how to determine a patient's atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, the role of lipoprotein treatment targets, the importance of moderate- and high-intensity statin therapy, and the use of nonstatin therapy in light of the IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) trial.

### Effects of statin therapy on diagnoses of new-onset diabetes and worsening glycaemia in large-scale randomised blinded statin trials: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^111M9EAW]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Previous meta-analyses of summary data from randomised controlled trials have shown that statin therapy increases the risk of diabetes, but less is known about the size or timing of this effect, or who is at greatest risk. We aimed to address these gaps in knowledge through analysis of individual participant data from large, long-term, randomised, double-blind trials of statin therapy.

Methods

We conducted a meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised controlled trials of statin therapy that participated in the CTT Collaboration. All double-blind randomised controlled trials of statin therapy of at least 2 years' scheduled duration and with at least 1000 participants were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. All recorded diabetes-related adverse events, treatments, and measures of glycaemia were sought from eligible trials. Meta-analyses assessed the effects of allocation to statin therapy on new-onset diabetes (defined by diabetes-related adverse events, use of new glucose-lowering medications, glucose concentrations, or HbA 1c values) and on worsening glycaemia in people with diabetes (defined by complications of glucose control, increased use of glucose-lowering medication, or HbA 1c increase of ≥ 0·5%). Standard inverse-variance-weighted meta-analyses of the effects on these outcomes were conducted according to a prespecified protocol.

Findings

Of the trials participating in the CTT Collaboration, 19 trials compared statin versus placebo (123940 participants, 25701 [21%] with diabetes; median follow-up of 4·3 years), and four trials compared more versus less intensive statin therapy (30724 participants, 5340 [17%] with diabetes, median follow-up of 4·9 years). Compared with placebo, allocation to low-intensity or moderate-intensity statin therapy resulted in a 10% proportional increase in new-onset diabetes (2420 of 39179 participants assigned to receive a statin [1·3% per year] vs 2214 of 39266 participants assigned to receive placebo [1·2% per year]; rate ratio [RR] 1·10, 95% CI 1·04–1·16), and allocation to high-intensity statin therapy resulted in a 36% proportional increase (1221 of 9935 participants assigned to receive a statin [4·8% per year] vs 905 of 9859 participants assigned to receive placebo [3·5% per year]; 1·36, 1·25–1·48). For each trial, the rate of new-onset diabetes among participants allocated to receive placebo depended mostly on the proportion of participants who had at least one follow-up HbA 1c measurement; this proportion was much higher in the high-intensity than the low-intensity or moderate-intensity trials. Consequently, the main determinant of the magnitude of the absolute excesses in the two types of trial was the extent of HbA 1c measurement rather than the proportional increase in risk associated with statin therapy. In participants without baseline diabetes, mean glucose increased by 0·04 mmol/L with both low-intensity or moderate-intensity (95% CI 0·03–0·05) and high-intensity statins (0·02–0·06), and mean HbA 1c increased by 0·06% (0·00–0·12) with low-intensity or moderate-intensity statins and 0·08% (0·07–0·09) with high-intensity statins. Among those with a baseline measure of glycaemia, approximately 62% of new-onset diabetes cases were among participants who were already in the top quarter of the baseline distribution. The relative effects of statin therapy on new-onset diabetes were similar among different types of participants and over time. Among participants with baseline diabetes, the RRs for worsening glycaemia were 1·10 (1·06–1·14) for low-intensity or moderate-intensity statin therapy and 1·24 (1·06–1·44) for high-intensity statin therapy compared with placebo.

Interpretation

Statins cause a moderate dose-dependent increase in new diagnoses of diabetes that is consistent with a small upwards shift in glycaemia, with the majority of new diagnoses of diabetes occurring in people with baseline glycaemic markers that are close to the diagnostic threshold for diabetes. Importantly, however, any theoretical adverse effects of statins on cardiovascular risk that might arise from these small increases in glycaemia (or, indeed, from any other mechanism) are already accounted for in the overall reduction in cardiovascular risk that is seen with statin therapy in these trials. These findings should further inform clinical guidelines regarding clinical management of people taking statin therapy.

### Statin diabetogenicity: guidance for clinicians [^112qDNX4]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

What does this mean for our patients?

The benefits of intensive versus standard statin therapy on CV outcomes in people with and without T2D have been clearly established. For example, the Treat to New targets (TNT) study (n = 10,001) found that the total number of CV events prevented per 5,000 patients treated with atorvastatin 80 mg versus atorvastatin 10 mg for 5 years was 608 (262 prevented for the first event, and 166, 92, 55 and 33 prevented for the second, third, fourth and fifth events); similar findings were observed in the subgroup of patients with T2D or metabolic syndrome (n = 5,854). These results are further corroborated by a meta-analysis carried out by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialist's Collaboration, in which more versus less intensive statin therapy was associated with a highly significant 15% (95% CI = 11 to 18; P < 0.0001) further reduction in major vascular events. Importantly, each 1.0 mmol/l decrease in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol reduced the annual rate of major CV events by 21% in patients both with and without T2D.

Based on these results, Sattar and colleagues found that treating 255 patients with standard-dose statin therapy for 4 years would, on average, avoid a composite of nine vascular events whilst leading to one case of statin-related T2D (9:1 benefit vs. risk ratio). Similarly, Preiss and colleagues found that, compared with standard therapy, the number needed to harm per year for intensive statin therapy was 498 for incident T2D whereas the number needed to treat per year was 155 for CV events. In absolute terms, intensive statin therapy accounted for 3.0 additional cases of T2D and 6.5 fewer first major CV events per 1,000 patient-years.

Together, these studies suggest that the overwhelming benefits for intensive-dose statins in reducing CV events far outweigh the small absolute risk for developing T2D. Authors therefore conclude that statins should still be considered as a first-line therapy for dyslipidaemia in the majority of patients with CV risk.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^115HERYE]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — statin intensity and LDL-C lowering in primary prevention describes that an RCT enrolling men ≥ 55 years and women ≥ 65 years with at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor had placebo 10-year 'hard ASCVD' risk 8.7% and expanded endpoint 10%, and after 5.6 years rosuvastatin 10 mg per day produced significant absolute risk reduction. If maximal ASCVD risk reduction is desired, it is reasonable to use a high-intensity statin to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50%, with increased benefit especially when 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 20%. In JUPITER, men ≥ 50 and women ≥ 60 with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2.0 mg/L and LDL-C < 130 mg/dL assigned rosuvastatin 20 mg per day achieved a median LDL-C reduction of 50% and highly significant ASCVD risk reduction at 1.9 years, and the magnitude of percent LDL-C reduction achieved determined benefit.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Randomized controlled trials — limitations and knowledge gaps: The guideline notes that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD and that most RCT data are with statin therapy, with limited add-on nonstatin data, leading to several priority questions including thresholds and indications for PCSK9 inhibitor use and statin intensity comparisons in primary prevention. Key statements include: "They have established that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD"; "Most of the data from RCTs have been obtained with statin therapy"; and questions such as "In secondary prevention, does a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exist, beyond which the incremental benefit attained is worth neither the risks nor the cost of additional therapy?", "In secondary prevention, what are the indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe as compared with moderate-intensity statins alone?", and "Is statin therapy efficacious and safe in older patients (> 75 years of age)?".

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115zX3en]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Statins in adults older than 75 years — A participant-level meta-analysis of 28 RCTs (median duration 4.9 years) including 186 854 participants (including 14 483 older than 75 years at randomization) found a significant 21% RR reduction in major vascular events per every 1.0 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C in adults older than 75 years at randomization. This RR reduction did not differ among the 6 subgroups by age (≤ 55, 56 to 60, 61 to 65, 66 to 70, 71 to 75, and > 75 years). These data suggest a benefit in continuing statin therapy in adults over the age of 75 who have an intermediate or high risk of ASCVD, and support consideration of using a moderate intensity statin at a lower dose, or a low intensity statin.

Strength of recommendation and evidence grading for IPE therapy for ASCVD risk reduction — Based primarily on REDUCE-IT, use of 4 g/d of icosapent ethyl (IPE) for ASCVD risk reduction in hypertriglyceridemic adults with ASCVD and/or diabetes mellitus on high-intensity or maximally tolerated statin therapy is considered a class I B-R recommendation. Although JELIS showed ASCVD risk reduction with 1.8 g/d of EPA ethyl esters, its lack of placebo control and use of exclusively low-intensity statin would not alone support a class 1A recommendation for the use of IPE; however, the results from JELIS were considered supportive of those from REDUCE-IT and did influence some elements of the recommendation.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Secondary ASCVD prevention — In patients who are 75 years of age or younger with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 50% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels; if high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or leads to statin-associated side effects, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are judged to be very high risk and considered for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy should include maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe. For very high risk patients on maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy with LDL-C 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) or a non-HDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), it is reasonable to add a PCSK9 inhibitor following a clinician-patient discussion about the net benefit, safety, and cost, and in those on maximally tolerated statin therapy who are judged to be at very high risk and have an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it is reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy. At mid-2018 list prices, PCSK9 inhibitors have a low cost value (> $150,000 per QALY) compared to good cost value (< $50,000 per QALY). In patients older than 75 years of age with clinical ASCVD, it is reasonable to initiate moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy after evaluation of the potential for ASCVD risk reduction, adverse effects, and drug-drug interactions, as well as patient frailty and preferences, and in those older than 75 years who are tolerating high-intensity statin therapy, it is reasonable to continue high-intensity statin therapy after similar evaluation. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy and whose LDL-C level remains 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy, and in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction attributable to ischemic heart disease who have a reasonable life expectancy (3 to 5 years) and are not already on a statin because of ASCVD, clinicians may consider initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy to reduce the occurrence of ASCVD events.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) primary prevention — statin therapy by age, diabetes status, and risk categories is specified as follows: For LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L), no risk assessment is performed and high-intensity statin (Class I) is used. For diabetes mellitus and age 40–75 y, moderate-intensity statin (Class I) is indicated, with risk assessment to consider high-intensity statin (Class IIa). In adults age 40–75 y without diabetes mellitus, 10-year ASCVD risk percent begins risk discussion with categories of < 5% "Low Risk" with emphasis on lifestyle (Class I); 5%– < 7.5% "Borderline Risk", where if risk enhancers are present then discuss moderate-intensity statin therapy (Class IIb); 7.5%– < 20% "Intermediate Risk", where risk enhancers favor statin and initiate moderate-intensity statin to reduce LDL-C by 30% - 49% (Class I); and ≥ 20% "High Risk", where initiating statin to reduce LDL-C ≥ 50% is advised (Class I). For age > 75 y, clinical assessment and risk discussion are recommended, and for age 20–39 y clinicians estimate lifetime risk to encourage lifestyle and consider statin if family history of premature ASCVD and LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL (≥ 4.1 mmol/L).

### Treat-to-target versus high-intensity statin treatment in patients with or without diabetes mellitus: a pre-specified analysis from the LODESTAR trial [^114KE93x]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Statin therapy is a cornerstone of the management of patients with both diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD), who are considered as the highest risk population among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Because the clinical benefits of sufficient lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in those patients are well-established, high-intensity statin therapy is strongly recommended in most patients with both DM and CAD. However, significant underuse of statins, poor drug adherence, and suboptimal dose titration are still common in real-world clinical practice and are associated with poor future clinical outcomes. These findings may be related to concerns regarding the side-effects of high-intensity statin treatment including the potential risk of new-onset DM or worsening of DM. Thus, identifying the optimal statin therapy and dose titration strategy to improve drug adherence and to achieve a sufficient reduction in LDL-C level is crucial. Recently, the LODESTAR trial (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-targeting statin therapy versus intensity-based statin therapy in patients with coronary artery disease) showed that a treat-to-target strategy with a goal LDL-C of 50–70 mg/dL was non-inferior to high-intensity statin therapy in terms of 3-year composite outcomes in patients with CAD. However, it remains unclear whether this treatment effect holds true for CAD patients regardless of DM status. Therefore, as one of the pre-specified analyses of the LODESTAR trial, we evaluated the effects of the treat-to-target strategy versus high-intensity statin therapy among patients with and without DM.

Regarding medical management for human immunodeficiency virus infection, more specifically with respect to statin therapy, CDC/HIVMA/IDSA/NIH 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy in patients with HIV infection and a 10-year ASCVD risk estimate of < 5%.
Recognize that the absolute benefit from statin therapy is modest in this population; therefore, consider the presence or absence of HIV-related factors that can increase ASCVD risk when deciding to initiate a statin. Use the same options for moderate-intensity statin therapy as recommended for 10-year ASCVD risk estimates of 5% to < 20%.

### Treat-to-target or high-intensity statin treatment in older adults with coronary artery disease: a post hoc analysis of the LODESTAR trial [^114wkEeP]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal statin treatment strategy that is balanced for both efficacy and safety has not been clearly determined in older adults with coronary artery disease (CAD).

Methods

In the post hoc analysis of the LODESTAR (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-targeting statin therapy versus intensity-based statin therapy in patients with coronary artery disease) trial, the impact between a treat-to-target strategy versus a high-intensity statin therapy strategy was compared in older adults (aged 75 years or older). The goal of treat-to-target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was 50–70 mg/dl. The primary endpoint comprised the three-year composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke or coronary revascularisation.

Results

Among 4,400 patients with CAD enrolled in the LODESTAR trial, 822 (18.7%) were aged 75 years or older. Poor clinical outcomes and risk factors for atherosclerosis were more frequently observed in older adults than in younger population (< 75 years old). Among these older adults with CAD, the prescription rate of high-intensity statin was significantly lower in the treat-to-target strategy group throughout the study period (P < 0.001). The mean LDL-C level for three years was 65 ± 16 mg/dl in the treat-to-target strategy group and 64 ± 18 mg/dl in the high-intensity statin group (P = 0.34). The incidence of primary endpoint occurrence was 10.9% in the treat-to-target strategy group and 12.0% in the high-intensity statin group (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.61–1.38, P = 0.69).

Conclusions

High-intensity statin therapy is theoretically more necessary in older adults because of worse clinical outcomes and greater number of risk factors for atherosclerosis. However, the primary endpoint occurrence with a treat-to-target strategy with an LDL-C goal of 50–70 mg/dl was comparable to that of high-intensity statin therapy and reduced utilisation of a high-intensity statin. Taking efficacy as well as safety into account, adopting a tailored approach may be considered for this high-risk population.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in older adults and ezetimibe add-on — It is reasonable to consider continuation of high-intensity therapy in patients > 75 years of age with ASCVD if they are tolerating the statin and have a low risk of competing morbidities. It may be reasonable to add ezetimibe to moderate-intensity therapy in patients with ASCVD for whom high-intensity therapy is indicated but cannot be used, provided their LDL-C level remains ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) on moderate-intensity therapy; the same reasoning holds for any patient whose LDL-C level remains ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated statin therapy.

### Relative contributions of statin intensity, achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and statin therapy duration to cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: population based cohort study [^111y4PTU]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend life-long use of statin for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), however, a number of patients discontinue statin therapy in clinical practice. We aimed to estimate the optimal statin therapy including statin therapy duration, statin intensity, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level among patients with T2D in a real-world setting.

Methods

From Korean National Health Insurance Service Cohort (2007–2015), 8937 patients with T2D (≥ 40 years of age) who received statin therapy for at least 90 days were included. Risk of major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) including ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death was estimated according to statin intensity, achieved serum LDL-C level, and statin therapy duration, respectively. The relative contributions of these factors to MACE risk were quantified by calculating the proportion of log-likelihood explained by each factor.

Results

The hazard ratio (HR) of MACE was lower in patients receiving moderate- or high-intensity statins than in those receiving low-intensity statins (HR, 0.72; p = 0.027). Among patients who received moderate- or high-intensity statins, lower achieved LDL-C level was associated with lower cardiovascular risk. Notably, the longer the patients received statins, the lower was the risk of MACE; the HR of MACE was significantly reduced after at least 18 months (adjusted HR, 0.70; p = 0.009) as a reference to 3–6 months of therapy. The proportion of explainable log-likelihood for MACE was greatest for statin duration (2.55), followed by achieved LDL-C level (2.18), and statin intensity (0.95).

Conclusions

Statin therapy duration is as important as or more crucial than statin intensity or achieved LDL-C level for the reduction of cardiovascular risk in T2D patients. The concept of "longer is better" regarding statin therapy should be considered in clinical practice.

### Treat-to-target or high-intensity statin in patients with coronary artery disease: a randomized clinical trial [^111QzQMo]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In patients with coronary artery disease, some guidelines recommend initial statin treatment with high-intensity statins to achieve at least a 50% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). An alternative approach is to begin with moderate-intensity statins and titrate to a specific LDL-C goal. These alternatives have not been compared head-to-head in a clinical trial involving patients with known coronary artery disease.

Objective

To assess whether a treat-to-target strategy is noninferior to a strategy of high-intensity statins for long-term clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, multicenter, noninferiority trial in patients with a coronary disease diagnosis treated at 12 centers in South Korea (enrollment: September 9, 2016, through November 27, 2019; final follow-up: October 26, 2022).

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the LDL-C target strategy, with an LDL-C level between 50 and 70 mg/dL as the target, or high-intensity statin treatment, which consisted of rosuvastatin, 20 mg, or atorvastatin, 40 mg.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end point was a 3-year composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization with a noninferiority margin of 3.0 percentage points.

Results

Among 4400 patients, 4341 patients (98.7%) completed the trial (mean [SD] age, 65.1 [9.9] years; 1228 females [27.9%]). In the treat-to-target group (n = 2200), which had 6449 person-years of follow-up, moderate-intensity and high-intensity dosing were used in 43% and 54%, respectively. The mean (SD) LDL-C level for 3 years was 69.1 (17.8) mg/dL in the treat-to-target group and 68.4 (20.1) mg/dL in the high-intensity statin group (n = 2200) (P = .21, compared with the treat-to-target group). The primary end point occurred in 177 patients (8.1%) in the treat-to-target group and 190 patients (8.7%) in the high-intensity statin group (absolute difference, -0.6 percentage points [upper boundary of the 1-sided 97.5% CI, 1.1 percentage points]; P < .001 for noninferiority).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with coronary artery disease, a treat-to-target LDL-C strategy of 50 to 70 mg/dL as the goal was noninferior to a high-intensity statin therapy for the 3-year composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization. These findings provide additional evidence supporting the suitability of a treat-to-target strategy that may allow a tailored approach with consideration for individual variability in drug response to statin therapy.

### Updated cholesterol guidelines and intensity of statin therapy [^116VyFcQ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In November 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released new cholesterol guidelines. Implications of these new guidelines for statin prescription remain uncertain, particularly in individuals already on statin therapy.

Objective

Our objective was to examine the impact of the guidelines on the intensity of statin therapy at a large academic medical center.

Methods

We queried the electronic health record at the University of Pennsylvania Health System to evaluate current practice patterns at a large academic institution in patients already on statin therapy.

Results

Among 40,036 statin-treated patients, 47% of patients may warrant an intensification of statin therapy according to the updated national cholesterol guidelines.

Conclusions

These findings highlight the magnitude of potential changes in statin prescription patterns favoring higher potency statin therapy, a sizable shift that parallels the predicted increase in statin initiation.

### Low-intensity statin plus ezetimibe versus moderate-intensity statin for primary prevention: a population-based retrospective cohort study in Asian population [^111XuTP9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

While moderate-intensity statin therapy is recommended for primary prevention, statins may not be utilized at a recommended intensity due to dose-dependent adverse events, especially in an Asian population. However, evidence supporting the use of low-intensity statins in primary prevention is limited.

Objective

We sought to compare clinical outcomes between a low-intensity statin plus ezetimibe and a moderate-intensity statin for primary prevention.

Methods

This population-based retrospective cohort study used the Korean nationwide claims database (2002–2019). We included adults without atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases who received moderate-intensity statins or low-intensity statins plus ezetimibe. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke. The safety outcomes were liver and muscle injuries and new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM). We used standardized inverse probability of treatment weighting (sIPTW) and propensity score matching (PSM).

Results

In the sIPTW model, 1717 and 36683 patients used a low-intensity statin plus ezetimibe and a moderate-intensity statin, respectively. In the PSM model, each group included 1687 patients. Compared with moderate-intensity statin use, low-intensity statin plus ezetimibe use showed similar risks of the primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.81–1.12 in sIPTW and HR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.87–1.56 in PSM model). Low-intensity statin plus ezetimibe use was associated with decreased risks of liver and muscle injuries (subHR [sHR] = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.74–0.96 and sHR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.77–0.97 in sIPTW; sHR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.72, 0.96 and sHR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.72–0.94 in PSM model, respectively). For new-onset DM and hospitalization of liver and muscle injuries, no difference was observed.

Conclusion and Relevance

Low-intensity statin plus ezetimibe may be an alternative to moderate-intensity statin for primary prevention. Our findings provide evidence on safety and efficacy of statin therapy in Asian population.

### High-intensity versus non-high-intensity statins in patients achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal after percutaneous coronary intervention [^116YpG7d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

High‐intensity statins have demonstrated consistent benefits for secondary prevention of adverse cardiovascular events compared with moderate‐intensity statins in several randomized trials. 1, 2 Therefore, the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline on treatment of blood cholesterol recommends high‐intensity statins, including atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg and rosuvastatin 20 or 40 mg, for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 3 However, whether beneficial effects of high‐intensity statins can be attributable to statin intensity per se or to merely lower low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) level achieved by high‐intensity statins compared with moderate‐intensity statins is uncertain. It has been reported that lowering of LDL‐C with statin therapy reduces major cardiovascular events regardless of types or intensities of statins. 4 Therefore, European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) guidelines for management of dyslipidemia still propose the target goal for LDL‐C of < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or a reduction of at least 50% from baseline for subjects at very high risk without specific recommendation for type or intensity of statin. 5 The differences between the 2 guidelines have caused many debates and much confusion in daily practice. 6 To date, it remains controversial whether outcomes differ according to statin intensity in patients with similar LDL‐C level. Therefore, we sought to investigate the association between statin intensity and long‐term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and achieving treatment target for LDL‐C.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low / moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111QnvpL]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

It remains controversial whether adding ezetimibe to low/moderate‐intensity statins has a more beneficial impact on the treatment efficacy and safety of patients with existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) compared to high‐intensity statin regimens.

Hypothesis

A combination of low/moderate‐intensity statins plus ezetimibe might be more effective and safer than high‐intensity statin monotherapy.

Methods

We searched databases for randomized controlled trials comparing lipid profile alterations, drug‐related adverse events, and MACE components between high‐intensity statin monotherapy and low/moderate‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe combination therapy. Pooled risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using a random‐effects model.

Results

Our comprehensive search resulted in 32 studies comprising 6162 patients treated with monotherapy against 5880 patients on combination therapy. Combination therapy was more effective in reducing low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels compared to monotherapy (MD = −6.6, 95% CI: −10.6 to −2.5); however, no significant differences were observed in other lipid parameters. Furthermore, the combination therapy group experienced a lower risk of myalgia (RR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13–0.57) and discontinuation due to adverse events (RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.51–0.74). The occurrence of MACE was similar between the two treatment groups.

Conclusions

Adding ezetimibe to low/moderate‐intensity statins resulted in a greater reduction in LDL‐C levels, a lower rate of myalgia, and less drug discontinuation compared to high‐intensity statin monotherapy in patients with existing cardiovascular disease. However, according to our meta‐analysis, the observed reduction in LDL‐C levels in the combination group did not correlate with a reduction in MACE compared to the high‐intensity statin group.

### High-dose versus low-dose pitavastatin in Japanese patients with stable coronary artery disease (REAL-CAD): a randomized superiority trial [^115kgUXZ]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

REAL-CAD is a pragmatic physician-initiated trial exploring the optimal dose of statins for patients with established stable CAD within the range of approved doses in Japan. Despite current guidelines recommendations, rates of use of high-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 40/80 mg, rosuvastatin 20/40 mg) in patients with established CAD have been reported to be low in Asia (0%–25%). – It is important to note that the statin dose in the high-dose group (pitavastatin 4 mg/d) in this study is equivalent to atorvastatin 20 mg/d in terms of LDL-C lowering, indicating that high-dose pitavastatin therapy in this study is what is generally considered moderate-intensity statin therapy in the international medical community. Most of the doses of high-intensity statin therapy defined in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline are not approved in Japan. Furthermore, maximum approved doses of statins are prescribed very infrequently in Japan, even for secondary prevention. The mean LDL-C before the run-in period was 93 mg/dL with 91% of patients taking statins, which decreased to 88 mg/dL after the run-in period on pitavastatin 1 mg. This minimal decrease in LDL-C during the run-in period suggests that the standard of care in Japan was low-intensity statin therapy, highlighting the results of the present study as practice changing. The present study clearly demonstrated that, even in a dose range lower than the dose levels defined as high-intensity statin therapy, the higher statin dose was associated with greater protection from cardiovascular events than the lower statin dose. Furthermore, the favorable effect of high-dose pitavastatin was observed regardless of the baseline LDL-C level dichotomized as ≥ 95 and < 95 mg/dL.

### Lower-intensity statins contributing to gaps in care for patients with primary severe hypercholesterolemia [^111ERG14]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Although severe hypercholesterolemia confers a 5-fold increased long-term risk for coronary artery disease, treatment guidelines may not be fully implemented, leading to underdiagnosis and suboptimal treatment. To further understand the clinical features and gaps in treatment approaches, we analyzed electronic medical record data from a midwestern US multidisciplinary healthcare system, between 2009 and 2020. Methods and Results We retrospectively assessed the prevalence, clinical presentation, and treatment characteristics of individuals currently treated with statin therapy having a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) value that is either (1) an actual maximum electronic medical record-documented LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (group 1, n = 7542) or (2) an estimated pretreatment LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (group 2, n = 7710). Comorbidities and prescribed lipid-lowering therapies were assessed. Statistical analyses identified differences among individuals within and between groups. Of records analyzed (n = 266 282), 7% met the definition for primary severe hypercholesterolemia. Group 1 had more comorbidities than group 2. More individuals in both groups were treated by primary care providers (49.8%-53.0%, 32.6%-36.4%) than by specialty providers (4.1%-5.5%, 2.1%-3.3%). High-intensity lipid-lowering therapy was prescribed less frequently for group 2 than for group 1, but moderate-intensity statins were prescribed more frequently for group 2 (65%) than for group 1 (52%). Conclusions Two percent of patients in our study population being treated with low- or moderate-intensity statins have an estimated LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (indicating severe hypercholesterolemia), but receive less aggressive treatment than patients with a maximum measured LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

### Treat-to-target LDL strategy of statin dosing is noninferior… [^114EbKch]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Bottom Line The study found that statin dosing based on a treat-to-target low-density lipoprotein level of 50 to 70 mg per dL is noninferior to a high-intensity strategy to reduce adverse events in adults with established CAD. Although the authors see this as an advantage that allows a tailored approach for individual dosing variability, it also serves as some of the best evidence yet that CAD can be managed with a high-intensity strategy and patients can avoid the costs and burdens of repeated LDL testing. Synopsis There is minimal evidence supporting the superiority or noninferiority of a high-intensity strategy of statin dosing vs. treating to a target LDL level. The investigators identified 4, 400 adults with CAD, including stable ischemic heart disease and acute coronary syndrome.

Eligible patients randomly received a statin using either a strategy of a treat-to-target LDL level between 50 and 70 mg per dL or a strategy of high-intensity therapy without a dose adjustment based on follow-up testing of LDL levels. An independent committee masked to treatment group assignment assessed outcomes. Complete follow-up occurred for 98. 7% of participants at three years. Using intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis, the primary end point occurred in 8. 1% of the treat-to-target group and
8. 7% in the high-intensity statin therapy group.

No significant group differences occurred for multiple prespecified secondary end points, including new-onset diabetes mellitus, elevated liver enzymes, hospitalizations, end-stage renal disease, and study drug discontinuation due to intolerance.

### Overview of new ACC / AHA lipid guidelines… [^115SCw1C]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Rather than a "fire and forget" strategy involving a risk-based prescription of a moderate- or high-intensity statin, we are supposed to go back to monitoring low-density lipoprotein levels and targeting a percentage reduction in LDL cholesterol — and in very high-risk patients targeting an LDL level of less than 70 mg per dL. Statins are divided into high intensity, moderate-intensity, and low-intensity groups. For patients 40 years and older, a high-intensity statin is recommended for an LDL level greater than 190 mg per dL and a moderate- or high-intensity statin for those with diabetes mellitus.

For all other patients, the Pooled Cohort Equations are used to place patients into one of four risk groups; the old guideline had only three. If the 10-year risk of an ASCVD event is less than 5%, no statin is recommended. If the 10-year risk is 5% to 7. 5%, consider a moderate-intensity statin if there is also a "risk enhancer, " such as LDL level greater than 160 mg per dL, family history of premature ASCVD, chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, South Asian ancestry, preeclampsia, HIV, rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriasis. For persons with a 7. 5% to 20% risk, they recommend a moderate-intensity statin for most patients to target a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL cholesterol. Finally, if the risk is greater than 20%, a statin to target a 50% or more reduction in LDL cholesterol is recommended. Patients in this category should be taking a high-intensity statin, adding ezetimibe if necessary, to target an LDL level of 70 mg per dL.

If that is not achieved, a PSK9 inhibitor should be considered.

### Cholesterol management: ACC / AHA updates guideline… [^114mpP3Y]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

- Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated without calculating a 10-year ASCVD risk for patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus.
- Patients without diabetes at intermediate risk of ASCVD with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin for a goal of 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. SECONDARY PREVENTION Based on high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials, high-intensity statin therapy should be instituted with a goal of lowering LDL-C levels by 50% or more in patients with ASCVD up to 75 years of age. If treatment is not tolerated, then moderate-intensity therapy should be used with a goal of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels.

Based on nonrandomized trials, patients at very high risk should be considered for treatment with maximally tolerated statin doses and ezetimibe before considering the addition of a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor. SEVERE HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA Based on moderate-quality evidence from RCTs, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended for patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg per dL or greater. High-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes who are at intermediate risk with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin. A 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels is recommended, and in high-risk patients a 50% or greater reduction is recommended.

Selected Moderate-Strength Recommendations Based on moderate-quality evidence from RCTs, the addition of nonstatin drug therapy should be considered at a threshold LDL-C level of at least 70 mg per dL on maximal statin therapy in patients with ASCVD at very high risk. Moderate-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years without diabetes who have a 10-year risk of 7. 5% to
19. 9% and risk-enhancing factors start or intensify statin therapy.

### Key recommendations on managing dyslipidemia for… [^116nDcCL]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary Prevention For secondary prevention, we recommend moderate-dose statins as the mainstay of treatment. This is consistent with trial evidence, and evidence is insufficient to show improved cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with higher-intensity treatment over moderate-dose statins. 11 Moderate-dose statins have fewer adverse effects than high-dose statins; therefore, we strongly recommend them as the first step in therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. 1, 6 The ACC/AHA recommends intensive therapy in secondary prevention unless medications cannot be tolerated.
2. We recommend offering more intensive therapy to patients who wish to further reduce their risk. 1 Switching to high-dose statins and adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statins reduces nonfatal cardiovascular events more than moderate-dose statins alone, each to a similar extent.

11 All were studied primarily in higher-risk populations, such as those with acute coronary syndrome, recurrent cardiac events, or tobacco use. Because of the uncertain long-term effects and high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors, we recommend increasing the statin dose and adding ezetimibe before considering the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.
1. Icosapent ethyl reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a single randomized trial among secondary prevention patients with elevated triglyceride levels. 2 The high rates of events in the control group and lack of corroborating studies limit our confidence in recommending this medication. Lipid Testing Although the ACC/AHA recommends treating to LDL-C targets, this paradigm has not been prospectively studied. 1, 2 All primary and secondary prevention trials compared medication doses, most often a medication compared with placebo.

Although post-hoc meta-analyses show that higher-intensity medications correlate with lower LDL-C levels and lower event rates, these secondary analyses do not add any specificity to existing trial results. 12 We recommend treatment based on medication intensity to match the evidence, which also simplifies monitoring. After starting medication based on treatment intensity, further measurement of cholesterol is unnecessary. 13 There is no need to repeatedly measure cholesterol more than once a decade for risk calculations. Using previous cholesterol values to calculate risk every two to five years offers the opportunity to decrease unnecessary testing. When cholesterol levels are measured, nonfasting samples have equivalent accuracy and should be used routinely. Indications for fasting samples are limited, such as verifying hypertriglyceridemia if considering icosapent ethyl.
