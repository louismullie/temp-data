## Question

Asthma pathophysiology

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about asthma pathophysiology. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational definition and clinical frame. Then, I should verify the initiating triggers and epithelial interface. Next, I will examine the inflammatory cascade, distinguishing type 2–high from type 2–low pathways. After that, I need to analyze structural remodeling and its functional consequences. Then, I should integrate the heterogeneity framework of phenotypes and endotypes. Finally, I will consider special populations, biomarkers, and therapeutic implications, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition so I don't anchor on outdated concepts. Asthma is best understood as a heterogeneous chronic airway disease defined by a history of respiratory symptoms that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation; it is usually associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation, but these are neither necessary nor sufficient for diagnosis, and airflow limitation may become persistent over time [^115nJaWi] [^1142YqeW].

> Wait, let me verify the initiating events before I jump into mechanisms. Environmental triggers such as allergens, pollutants, viral infections, and occupational exposures interact with a genetically susceptible host to initiate airway inflammation; early-life insults and epithelial barrier dysfunction appear central, with epithelial injury and impaired repair contributing to disease inception and persistence across the life course [^113Sqqrt] [^115AUCms].

> I will now examine the inflammatory cascade, starting with the classic type 2–high pathway. Sensitization to allergens drives Th2 polarization and collaboration with ILC2s, leading to IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 signaling; IL-4 and IL-13 promote IgE class switching and B-cell help, while IL-5 drives eosinophilopoiesis, recruitment, and survival, producing eosinophilic inflammation and characteristic remodeling features such as subepithelial fibrosis; clinically, this aligns with atopy, elevated FeNO, blood/sputum eosinophils, and responsiveness to corticosteroids and type 2–targeted biologics [^113pVRbB] [^113HWC35] [^111ho1Dj].

> Hold on, I should verify the type 2–low axis because it is often underappreciated. Neutrophilic and paucigranulocytic phenotypes reflect Th1/Th17 skewing, innate immune activation, and epithelial–immune crosstalk; these pathways are less steroid-responsive and may be enriched in smokers, older adults, and some severe asthma, underscoring the need for non–type 2 targeted strategies and better biomarkers [^113pVRbB] [^111i2D6f] [^113W68zQ].

> Let me consider the structural consequences next, because persistent inflammation drives remodeling that alters airway mechanics. Key features include subepithelial fibrosis, goblet cell hyperplasia, increased airway smooth muscle mass, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix changes; these alterations thicken airway walls, increase baseline resistance, and contribute to fixed airflow limitation and hyperresponsiveness, with remodeling detectable even in mild disease and potentially modifiable with early, sustained anti-inflammatory therapy [^115vSF3T] [^115WEknH] [^113aZMr2].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought airway hyperresponsiveness was simply a direct consequence of inflammation; let me reconsider and be more precise. AHR reflects both a variable inflammatory component and a persistent structural component, with remodeling contributing to a baseline hyperresponsive state that persists even between exacerbations; this dual-component model helps explain why some patients have ongoing symptoms despite quiescent inflammation and why anti-inflammatory therapy alone may incompletely normalize AHR [^112xgxoE] [^115vcAkL].

> Next, I should review the heterogeneity framework to avoid overgeneralization. Phenotypes cluster observable traits (age of onset, atopy, eosinophilia, obesity, smoking), whereas endotypes denote distinct pathobiologic mechanisms; clinically, type 2–high and type 2–low endotypes guide targeted therapy, and the field increasingly recognizes that patients may straddle categories or transition over time, reinforcing the need for longitudinal biomarker-informed reassessment [^117N7YSx] [^114Rshjo] [^111hpxsR].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and modifiers of pathophysiology. In children, early-onset allergic asthma predominates, but severe pediatric asthma includes distinct biology and warrants specialist referral; in older adults, aging-related changes and comorbid COPD features complicate phenotype and treatment response; obesity-related asthma often exhibits non–type 2 features and small-airway dysfunction; and occupational asthma adds sensitizer-driven IgE or irritant-driven nonallergic mechanisms that persist after exposure ends [^112vLMzf] [^116aWcD9] [^112ZSJHZ] [^115GVvTy].

> Let me first confirm the biomarker landscape that operationalizes these mechanisms. FeNO, blood and sputum eosinophils, IgE, and periostin enrich for type 2–high inflammation and predict response to ICS and biologics; in contrast, reliable non–type 2 biomarkers remain limited, and emerging tools such as multiomics, network analyses, and imaging of small airways are being explored to better phenotype and target therapy, especially in mild and severe disease [^114Rshjo] [^116GiQM7] [^115vjCsD].

> Hold on, I should verify therapeutic implications so the pathophysiology directly informs care. ICS remain foundational to suppress inflammation broadly, but type 2–high severe asthma benefits from targeted biologics such as anti-IgE, anti–IL-5/5R, and anti–IL-4/13 agents; non–type 2 pathways lack approved targeted therapies, though research into IL-17, IL-33, TSLP, and other axes is active; airway smooth muscle–directed approaches like bronchial thermoplasty and long-acting muscarinic antagonists address mechanical components of AHR and remodeling in selected patients [^1142YqeW] [^117TAYuQ] [^111QWsiu].

> But wait, what if the clinical course seems discordant with the presumed endotype; I should double-check for overlapping conditions. Asthma–COPD overlap reflects mixed pathophysiology with variable airflow limitation and type 2 inflammation superimposed on structural changes; recognizing ACO matters because it alters expected responses to bronchodilators, ICS, and biologics, and current guidance emphasizes careful phenotyping and pragmatic management while research continues [^114gFf3L] [^1179AP9W].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis remains clinically actionable: asthma pathophysiology arises from gene–environment interactions that injure the epithelium and activate innate and adaptive immune pathways, producing heterogeneous inflammatory endotypes with overlapping structural remodeling; this heterogeneity explains variable symptom control, treatment responsiveness, and disease trajectories, and it mandates a precision approach using biomarkers to align mechanism with therapy and to revisit phenotype over time as biology evolves [^1142YqeW] [^115nJaWi] [^111hpxsR].

Asthma is a **chronic inflammatory airway disease** characterized by variable airflow obstruction, airway hyperresponsiveness, and remodeling [^1142YqeW]. The core pathophysiology is **chronic airway inflammation** driven by type 2 (T2) and non–type 2 pathways, with T2-high asthma featuring eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, and IL-4/IL-5/IL-13 signaling, while T2-low asthma involves neutrophils and innate immune activation [^113pVRbB] [^113HWC35]. Inflammation causes bronchoconstriction, mucus hypersecretion, and structural changes (subepithelial fibrosis, smooth muscle hypertrophy, goblet cell hyperplasia) that increase hyperresponsiveness and can lead to fixed airflow limitation [^115vSF3T] [^117PsyfZ]. Exacerbations are commonly triggered by allergens, infections, pollutants, or exercise, and disease expression is shaped by gene–environment interactions and heterogeneous endotypes, explaining variability in severity and treatment response [^113Sqqrt] [^117N7YSx].

---

## Inflammatory mechanisms

### Type 2 (T2) inflammation

- **Key cytokines**: IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 drive eosinophilic inflammation, IgE class switching, and mucus production [^116GiQM7] [^1161MuzC].
- **Cellular players**: Th2 cells, ILC2s, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils mediate allergic inflammation and hyperresponsiveness [^113pVRbB] [^1149ASLG].
- **Biomarkers**: Elevated blood/sputum eosinophils, FeNO, IgE, and periostin indicate T2-high asthma [^116GiQM7].

---

### Non–type 2 inflammation

Neutrophilic inflammation is prominent in T2-low asthma and is associated with **corticosteroid resistance** [^111i2D6f]. Innate immune activation — including TLR signaling, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17 — contributes to **neutrophilic inflammation and hyperresponsiveness** [^113pVRbB].

---

## Structural airway changes (remodeling)

- **Subepithelial fibrosis**: Collagen deposition thickens airway walls, reducing elasticity [^115vSF3T] [^111dHd3N].
- **Smooth muscle hypertrophy**: Increased muscle mass enhances bronchoconstrictive responses [^1132SUXR] [^115vSF3T].
- **Goblet cell hyperplasia**: Excess mucus narrows airways and promotes plugging [^117PsyfZ] [^111dHd3N].
- **Angiogenesis**: Increased vascularity contributes to airway wall thickening and edema [^117PsyfZ] [^111dHd3N].

---

## Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR)

AHR is a **hallmark of asthma**, with both structural and inflammatory components. Structural components include remodeling and increased smooth muscle mass, while inflammatory components involve mediator release and epithelial injury that increase sensitivity to triggers [^112xgxoE] [^115vcAkL].

---

## Triggers and exacerbations

- **Allergens**: House dust mite, pollen, animal dander, and mold commonly trigger exacerbations [^116Vv5DN] [^1177XNRD].
- **Infections**: Respiratory viruses, especially rhinovirus, are major triggers of acute exacerbations [^1113LiLH] [^116Vv5DN].
- **Environmental factors**: Pollutants, tobacco smoke, and occupational exposures exacerbate symptoms [^1177XNRD] [^115GVvTy].
- **Exercise and cold air**: Induce bronchoconstriction via airway cooling and drying [^115GVvTy].

---

## Genetic and environmental interactions

Genetic predisposition includes **over 100 loci** (e.g. IL33, IL1RL1, GSDMB) that influence susceptibility and phenotype [^notfound]. Environmental exposures — including early-life infections, allergen exposure, pollution, and smoking — interact with genetic risk to shape disease expression [^113Sqqrt] [^1174PBKP].

---

## Heterogeneity and endotypes

Phenotypes such as allergic, eosinophilic, neutrophilic, obese, and exercise-induced asthma reflect **clinical diversity** [^114Rshjo] [^117N7YSx]. Endotypes are defined by distinct molecular mechanisms (e.g. T2-high vs T2-low) and guide targeted therapies [^113HWC35] [^111hpxsR].

---

## Clinical implications

Therapy is tailored to phenotype/endotype, with **ICS, LABA, LAMA, leukotriene modifiers, and biologics** (anti-IgE, anti–IL-5, anti–IL-4/13) used to target specific pathways [^1117Yzn3] [^117TAYuQ]. Biomarkers such as eosinophils, FeNO, and IgE help **stratify patients and predict treatment response** [^114Rshjo] [^113HWC35].

---

Asthma pathophysiology reflects a **complex interplay of inflammation, structural remodeling, and hyperresponsiveness**, with heterogeneity in mechanisms and triggers driving individualized treatment strategies [^1142YqeW].

### Recent advances in the pathophysiology of asthma [^1148KzCq]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

There has been an increased understanding, over the past 2 decades, that asthma is a chronic, immunologically mediated condition with a disturbance of the normal airway repair mechanism, which results in inflammatory changes and airway remodeling. The airway inflammation and remodeling together likely explain the clinical manifestations of asthma. The mechanisms by which the external environmental cues, together with the complex genetic actions, propagate the inflammatory process that characterize asthma are beginning to be understood. There is also an evolving awareness of the active participation of structural elements, such as the airway epithelium, airway smooth muscle, and endothelium, in this process. In tandem with this has come the realization that inflammatory cells respond in a coordinated, albeit dysfunctional manner, via an array of complex signaling pathways that facilitate communication between these cells; these structural elements within the lung and the bone marrow serve as reservoirs for and the source of inflammatory cells and their precursors. Although often viewed as separate mechanistic entities, so-called innate and acquired immunity often overlap in the propagation of the asthmatic response. This review examines the newer information on the pathophysiologic characteristics of asthma and focuses on papers published over the past 3 years that have helped to improve current levels of understanding.

### Asthma end points and outcomes: what have we learned? [^116YavZg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

In spite of the wide prevalence of asthma and its substantial consequences, the diagnosis and assessment of asthma has not been standardized, and the goals of therapy currently are not being achieved. Our purpose is to help delineate what the most important asthma end points are and what kinds of strategies we should use to guide therapy. Comparison of numerous studies reveals that asthma measures used routinely in the clinic, such as spirometric lung function, do not uniformly correlate with asthma control. We cannot improve outcomes until we determine which measures reveal the underlying disease process most clearly and at the same time offer ease of performance during routine office visits. We propose that by standardizing the way we collect and analyze data from our daily practice, we can better define which measures reflect true asthma control. Such measures most likely address a spectrum of changes occurring in the pathophysiology of asthma, notably distal airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. Inflammation may provide the best opportunity for assessment and treatment, because if it is adequately addressed, airway sensitivity may improve, thereby reducing airway obstruction and subsequently minimizing exacerbations. The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide as a measure of inflammation is suggested as offering the best combination of disease evaluation and practical implementation for improved asthma outcomes.

### The natural history of asthma and early intervention [^1129TQ2M]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

The understanding of the natural history of asthma has changed significantly during the last 4 decades, with the view that asthma is a disease of chronic inflammation and varying degrees of severity replacing that of it being a disease of reversible airway obstruction. Treatment has progressed in accordance with the growing knowledge about the pathophysiologic mechanisms of asthma. Nevertheless, much remains unknown, especially about how to treat asthma effectively. Pharmacogenetics, an emerging field in which the knowledge of the genetic basis of a disease is applied to its treatment, may ultimately lead investigators to define many unanswered questions about asthma therapy. Asthma occurs early in childhood, but the ideal time for intervention and the most effective treatment strategy are yet unknown for young patients. The lack of response to a therapy may indicate the course of the disease as much as a lack of treatment efficacy. It may be that including such variables as airway hyperresponsiveness in treatment goals will not only become routine but will result in improved long-term asthma treatment as well. The progress in defining asthma and targeting treatment toward specific pathophysiologic mechanisms should lead to better-defined optimal strategies for treating asthma in children.

### Life-threatening asthma: pathophysiology and management [^112k9RYm]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma prevalence and mortality have been increasing over the past 2 decades, despite advances in medical therapy. In 2003 the National Health Interview Survey reported over 4,000 asthma-related deaths. A small proportion of people with severe asthma use a large proportion of health-care resources and bear the burden of asthma-related morbidity and mortality. The management of acute asthma is complex and evolving. Understanding the phenotypes and pathophysiology of acute asthma will lead to increased recognition and characterization of populations at risk for fatal asthma. The early identification and appropriate management of acute asthma is critical in decreasing asthma morbidity and mortality. This paper reviews current pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic management of severe acute asthma.

### Pathophysiology of severe asthma [^117G1VsM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2000). Low credibility.

Although asthma affects nearly 8% of the adult population, most of these patients have mild-to-moderate disease that can be controlled with appropriate treatment. It is estimated, however, that 5% to 10% of patients with asthma have severe disease that is unresponsive to typical therapeutics, including corticosteroids. Because patients with severe asthma are disproportionately affected by their disease, in terms of both impaired lifestyle and health care costs, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute sponsored a workshop on the pathogenesis of severe asthma. The goals of this workshop were to begin to define the characteristics of severe asthma. In these discussions, it was clear that many characteristics need to be considered in defining this phenotype of asthma, including symptoms, intensity of therapy (including administration of systemic corticosteroids), and impairment of lung function. Also discussed were potential mechanisms of severe asthma including the role of allergic diseases, which may play less of a role in severe asthma than in mild-to-moderate disease, and infections. A major limitation to control of severe asthma is the recalcitrant response of these patients to usual therapy including systemic corticosteroids; the potential of other therapies was reviewed. From these discussions, recommendations were made for future research needs to gain insights into a difficult therapeutic and possibly novel mechanistic area of asthma.

### Asthma: pathology and pathophysiology [^115C3HLD]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Asthma has been defined as a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that is associated with recruitment of inflammatory cells and the clinical development of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough. Asthma is a major public health issue. It affects 5% of the United States population and accounts for 2 million emergency department visits, 470,000 hospitalizations, and 4500 deaths annually.

Objective

To review the pathophysiology and characteristic pathologic patterns of this disease and discuss the possible mechanisms of production of the lesions.

Data Sources

We searched the literature using MEDLINE and OVID. We also searched related conference abstracts and bibliographies of selected studies.

Conclusions

There has been a significant evolution in our understanding of asthma. Specific pathways and mechanisms in recent years have been studied; however, numerous mediators and cell receptors have raised new questions that remain to be answered.

### Severe adult asthmas: integrating clinical features, biology, and therapeutics to improve outcomes [^113wUvjf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Compared with the understanding of many core pulmonary diseases, the understanding of asthma and severe asthma has improved exponentially over the last 20–30 years, including understanding concerning the application of precision-medicine approaches. Despite these advances, much remains to be biologically and immunologically clarified. Current "breakthrough" therapies are expensive and often inaccessible, and many patients remain poorly understood and treated. Yet conceptual understanding of "the severe asthmas" is now vastly different from what it was a mere 25 years ago, with accompanying dramatic improvement in the lives of many.

### Asthma endotypes: a new approach to classification of disease entities within the asthma syndrome [^117N7YSx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

It is increasingly clear that asthma is a complex disease made up of number of disease variants with different underlying pathophysiologies. Limited knowledge of the mechanisms of these disease subgroups is possibly the greatest obstacle in understanding the causes of asthma and improving treatment and can explain the failure to identify consistent genetic and environmental correlations to asthma. Here we describe a hypothesis whereby the asthma syndrome is divided into distinct disease entities with specific mechanisms, which we have called "asthma endotypes". An "endotype" is proposed to be a subtype of a condition defined by a distinct pathophysiological mechanism. Criteria for defining asthma endotypes on the basis of their phenotypes and putative pathophysiology are suggested. Using these criteria, we identify several proposed asthma endotypes and propose how these new definitions can be used in clinical study design and drug development to target existing and novel therapies to patients most likely to benefit. This PRACTALL (PRACtical ALLergy) consensus report was produced by experts from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

### Asthma: 2015 and beyond [^115uS8E2]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma is a multifactorial, chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. The knowledge that asthma is an inflammatory disorder has become a core fundamental in the definition of asthma. Asthma's chief features include a variable degree of air-flow obstruction and bronchial hyper-responsiveness, in addition to the underlying chronic airways inflammation. This underlying chronic airway inflammation substantially contributes to airway hyper-responsiveness, air-flow limitation, respiratory symptoms, and disease chronicity. However, this underlying chronic airway inflammation has implications for the diagnosis, management, and potential prevention of the disease. This review for the respiratory therapy community summarizes these developments as well as providing an update on asthma epidemiology, natural history, cause, and pathogenesis. This paper also provides an overview on appropriate diagnostic and monitoring strategies for asthma, pharmacology, and newer therapies for the future as well as relevant management of acute and ambulatory asthma, and a brief review of educational approaches.

### Asthma: clinical expression and molecular mechanisms [^114qZX3m]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Asthma is a complex disorder that displays heterogeneity and variability in its clinical expression both acutely and chronically. This heterogeneity is influenced by multiple factors including age, sex, socioeconomic status, race and/or ethnicity, and gene by environment interactions. Presently, no precise physiologic, immunologic, or histologic characteristics can be used to definitively make a diagnosis of asthma, and therefore the diagnosis is often made on a clinical basis related to symptom patterns (airways obstruction and hyperresponsiveness) and responses to therapy (partial or complete reversibility) over time. Although current treatment modalities are capable of producing control of symptoms and improvements in pulmonary function in the majority of patients, acute and often severe exacerbations still occur and contribute significantly to both the morbidity and mortality of asthma in all age groups. This review will highlight some of the important clinical features of asthma and emphasize recent advances in both pathophysiology and treatment.

### Novel potential treatable traits in asthma: where is the research taking us? [^111hpxsR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous disease with variable clinical manifestations. Patients with common clinical, biologic, and physiologic characteristics (phenotypes) are grouped together to guide diagnosis, therapy, and management of asthma. However, patients within a given phenotype can show heterogeneity of disease severity and response to therapy, prompting the need for more specific disease classifications. Recently, the term endotype has been introduced to define patients with asthma by distinct genetic or molecular mechanisms underlying asthma pathology. Approaches based on endotypes and phenotypes have been proposed to optimally manage patients with asthma.

Classifying patients into phenotypes and endotypes can direct treatment toward targeting specific pathophysiologic pathways that may be dysregulated in a given phenotype or endotype. For example, asthma has been broadly split into 2 distinct phenotypes according to the degree of type 2 inflammation: type 2 and non–type 2 asthma. Of these 2 phenotypes, type 2 asthma is the better understood and more easily identifiable in patients: eosinophilic inflammation and IgE synthesis both play a key role. Non–type 2 asthma is less easily defined and may comprise several subpopulations (distinct phenotypes and endotypes) of patients with non–type 2 asthma. However, because of the heterogeneity found in asthma, there are also likely to be patients whose asthma is driven by both type 2 and non–type 2 inflammatory mechanisms. Specific mechanisms may contribute to severe asthma in certain patients who do not respond to therapies targeting type 2 asthma alone. A greater understanding of the phenotypes and endotypes involved in asthma pathology will help to identify patients who are more to likely benefit from established or novel or emerging targeted therapies.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — clinical asthma phenotypes and biomarkers: Recognizable clusters of demographic and clinical characteristics are called 'clinical asthma phenotypes'; in most instances, these do not correlate strongly with specific pathological processes or treatment responses. However, biomarkers reflecting pathophysiological processes are useful in the assessment of difficult-to-treat asthma and treatment of severe asthma.

### Childhood asthma: recent developments and update [^1174PBKP]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to provide an update on childhood asthma specifically related to the underlying genetic background and pathophysiology of asthma and their interaction with environmental stimuli. We will also discuss emerging data in the field of disease phenotyping.

Recent Findings

The field of genetics is continuously evolving to expand our knowledge on the cause of disease. Childhood onset asthma has been related to atopy and exposure to early-life infections. More recently, phenotypes have been used to classify asthma as transient and persistent, but the association of each phenotype with the genetic origin of asthma is not clearly understood.

Summary

This review covers the topics of genetics, epigenetics, pathophysiology, phenotypes and treatment as they relate to childhood asthma. Overall, it provides a basis for the future of asthma treatment through description of the current research.

### What is asthma? Pathophysiology, demographics, and health care costs [^116GR4xD]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Asthma is an obstructive pulmonary disorder with exacerbations characterized by symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness, and/or wheezing. Symptoms are caused by chronic airway inflammation. There are multiple cell types and inflammatory mediators involved in its pathophysiology. The airway inflammation is frequently mediated by Th2 lymphocytes, whose cytokine secretion leads to mast cell stimulation, eosinophilia, leukocytosis, and enhanced B-cell IgE production. Although various genes have been identified as likely contributors to asthma development, asthma is largely environmentally triggered and has a multifactorial cause. Asthma is extremely common, especially in poor, urban environments. Asthma is the third most common reason for pediatric hospitalizations.

### Asthma [^1142YqeW]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic non-communicable diseases worldwide and is characterised by variable airflow obstruction, causing dyspnoea and wheezing. Highly effective therapies are available; asthma morbidity and mortality have vastly improved in the past 15 years, and most patients can attain good asthma control. However, undertreatment is still common, and improving patient and health-care provider understanding of when and how to adjust treatment is crucial. Asthma management consists of a cycle of assessment of asthma control and risk factors and adjustment of medications accordingly. With the introduction of biological therapies, management of severe asthma has entered the precision medicine era-a shift that is driving clinical ambitions towards disease remission. Patients with severe asthma often have co-existing conditions contributing to their symptoms, mandating a multidimensional management approach. In this Seminar, we provide a clinically focused overview of asthma; epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management in children and adults.

### Unraveling the heterogeneity of asthma: decoding subtypes of asthma [^111GEo1Z]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with diverse underlying mechanisms contributing to disease susceptibility and progression. Asthma endotypes and phenotypes have emerged as critical frameworks to help understand the variation in disease presentation and response to therapies. Phenotypes are the observable characteristics or traits of an organism that are produced by the interaction of genotype and environment. Asthma endotypes are distinct subsets of asthma that are characterized by specific biologic pathways, including differences in inflammatory pathways, genetic predisposition, and immune response. Identifying asthma endotypes and the associated clinical phenotypes is pivotal for the development of personalized treatment strategies, as it enables clinicians to select more effective therapies based on specific biologic mechanisms. This review explores asthma endotypes and their associated phenotypes and the ongoing effort to refine diagnostic tools and therapeutic personalized approaches, aiming to improve outcomes for patients with asthma.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113Z7oTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with mild asthma are believed to represent the majority of patients with asthma. Disease-associated risks such as exacerbations, lung function decline, and death have been understudied in this patient population. There have been no prior efforts from major societies to describe research needs in mild asthma.

Methods

A multidisciplinary, diverse group of 24 international experts reviewed the literature, identified knowledge gaps, and provided research recommendations relating to mild asthma definition, pathophysiology, and management across all age groups. Research needs were also investigated from a patient perspective, generated in conjunction with patients with asthma, caregivers, and stakeholders. Of note, this project is not a systematic review of the evidence and is not a clinical practice guideline.

Results

There are multiple unmet needs in research on mild asthma driven by large knowledge gaps in all areas. Specifically, there is an immediate need for a robust mild asthma definition and an improved understanding of its pathophysiology and management strategies across all age groups. Future research must factor in patient perspectives.

Conclusions

Despite significant advances in severe asthma, there remain innumerable research areas requiring urgent attention in mild asthma. An important first step is to determine a better definition that will accurately reflect the heterogeneity and risks noted in this group. This research statement highlights the topics of research that are of the highest priority. Furthermore, it firmly advocates the need for engagement with patient groups and for more support for research in this field.

### Novel potential treatable traits in asthma: where is the research taking us? [^113W68zQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous disease in which the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Patients are often grouped into phenotypes (based on clinical, biologic, and physiologic characteristics) and endotypes (based on distinct genetic or molecular mechanisms). Recently, patients with asthma have been broadly split into 2 phenotypes based on their levels of type 2 inflammation: type 2 and non–type 2 asthma. However, this approach is likely oversimplified, and our understanding of the non–type 2 mechanisms in asthma remains extremely limited. A better understanding of asthma phenotypes and endotypes may assist in development of drugs for new therapeutic targets in asthma. One approach is to identify "treatable traits", which are specific patient characteristics related to phenotypes and endotypes that can be targeted by therapies. This review will focus on emerging treatable traits in asthma and aim to describe novel patient subgroups and endotypes that may represent the next step in the search for new therapeutic approaches.

### Asthma phenotyping, therapy, and prevention: what can we learn from systems biology? [^1165a42Z]. Pediatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma has a high prevalence worldwide, and contributes significantly to the socioeconomic burden. According to a classical paradigm, asthma symptoms are attributable to an allergic, Th2-driven airway inflammation that causes airway hyperresponsiveness and results in reversible airway obstruction. Diagnosis and therapy are based mainly on these pathophysiologic concepts. However, these have increasingly been challenged by findings of recent studies, and the frequently observed failure in controlling asthma symptoms. Important recent findings are the protective "farm effect" in children, the possible prenatal mechanisms of this protection, the recognition of many different asthma phenotypes in children and adults, and the partly disappointing clinical effects of new targeted therapeutic approaches. Systems biology approaches may lead to a more comprehensive view of asthma pathophysiology and a higher success rate of new therapies. Systems biology integrates clinical and experimental data by means of bioinformatics and mathematical modeling. In general, the "-omics" approach, and the "mathematical modeling" approach can be described. Recently, several consortia have been attempting to bring together clinical and molecular data from large asthma cohorts, using novel experimental setups, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and mathematical modeling. This "systems medicine" approach to asthma will help address the different asthma phenotypes with adequate therapy and possibly preventive strategies.

### Pathophysiological characterization of asthma transitions across adolescence [^111NE9Lk]. Respiratory Research (2014). Low credibility.

Research questions

What are the pathophysiological characteristics associated with persistence of asthma during adolescence? To investigate this, we compared asthma remission with persistent asthma.
What are the factors associated with asthma remission? To investigate this we tested early life and adolescent factors relevant to asthma.
What are the residual pathophysiological abnormalities in remittent asthmatics while symptoms have improved? To investigate this, we compared asthma remission with never asthma at age 18 years.
What are the pathophysiological characteristics of asthma that develops during adolescence? To investigate this, we compared adolescent-onset asthma with never asthma and persistent asthma.

The Isle of Wight cohort, with its population-based prospective design and extensive phenotyping over the entire childhood period provides a powerful means of approaching these questions.

### Asthma 2005–2006: bench to bedside [^11751rjM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Asthma is a prevalent and complex syndrome with several phenotypic variants. The central features are bronchial inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Many aspects of asthma, such as control of airway hyperresponsiveness, causative factors, and variable responses to treatment, remain poorly understood. This review highlights some of the latest insights into the pathogenesis of asthma that might ultimately bear on the development or choice of treatment modalities.

### Asthma exacerbations. 2: aetiology [^116Vv5DN]. Thorax (2006). Low credibility.

The natural history of asthma involves relatively stable periods that are often punctuated by significant exacerbations of symptoms. There are many aetiologies that may lead to an increase in asthma severity including respiratory infection (bacterial/viral), allergens, irritants, and occupational exposures. Each trigger probably acts through different mechanisms, but a final common pathway of multicellular inflammation, enhanced bronchial responsiveness, and airflow obstruction is a likely consequence. This review discusses the most common causes of asthma exacerbations with a focus on their microbiology and immunopathogenesis. Through an understanding of underlying causes of asthma exacerbations, treatments with increased effectiveness may be developed, and it is these future developments that may directly influence the morbidity and mortality of the disease.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^115aSSTw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There are multiple knowledge gaps and unmet research needs in mild asthma. An important first step is to develop a robust definition that reflects its epidemiology, heterogeneity, and associated risks. Next, we must develop dedicated research constructs, independent of other severity groups, to explore its pathophysiology and management. Wherever applicable, findings must be evaluated by age group. We must also acknowledge the needs of at-risk individuals and special populations within this group. Our statement represents an important first step but is not exhaustive. We strongly advocate for greater funding and prioritization of research on mild asthma and encourage engagement with all stakeholders, including patients and caregivers.

### Airway epithelial development and function: a key player in asthma pathogenesis? [^115AUCms]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Though asthma is a common and relatively easy to diagnose disease, attempts at primary or secondary prevention, and cure, have been disappointing. The widespread use of inhaled steroids has dramatically improved asthma control but has offered nothing in terms of altering long-term outcomes or reversing airway remodeling and impairment in lung function. The inability to cure asthma is unsurprising given our limited understanding of the factors that contribute to disease initiation and persistence. New data have focused on the airway epithelium as a potentially key factor orchestrating the different stages of asthma. In this review we summarize for the clinician the current evidence on the central role of the airway epithelium in asthma pathogenesis and the factors that may alter epithelial integrity and functionality.

### Is IgE or eosinophils the key player in allergic asthma pathogenesis? Are we asking the right question? [^111PQEjd]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Bronchial asthma (BA) is a chronic inflammatory disease with a marked heterogeneity in pathophysiology and etiology. The heterogeneity of BA may be related to the inducing mechanism(s) (allergic vs non-allergic), the histopathological background (eosinophilic vs non-eosinophilic), and the clinical manifestations, particularly in terms of severity and frequency of exacerbations. Asthma can be divided into at least two different endotypes based on the degree of Th2 inflammation (T2 'high' and T2 'low'). For patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against immunoglobulin E (IgE) or interleukin (IL)-5 are now available as add-on treatments. Treatment decisions for individual patients should consider the biological background in terms of the "driving mechanisms" of inflammation as this should predict the patients' likely responses to treatment. The question is not whether an anti-IgE or an anti-eosinophilic strategy is more effective, but rather what the mechanism is at the origin of the airway. While IgE is involved early in the inflammatory cascade and can be considered as a cause of allergic asthma, eosinophilia can be considered a consequence of the whole process. This article discusses the different roles of the IgE and IL-5/eosinophil pathways in the pathogenic mechanisms of airway inflammation occurring in allergic asthma, and the possible reasons to choose an anti-IgE mAb or anti-IL-5 treatment.

### Mechanisms of severe asthma [^111mRfAc]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

The mechanisms behind the development of severe asthma are poorly understood. However, these patients disproportionately consume healthcare resources related to asthma. Severe asthma may develop over time, or may develop shortly after onset of the disease. The genetic and environmental elements that may be most important in the development of severe disease are poorly understood. Physiologically, these patients often have air trapping and airway collapsibility. The pathology demonstrates a heterogeneity of findings, including continued eosinophilic inflammation, an apparently different pathology, structural changes likely to be remodelling related, and predominant distal disease. Treatment remains problematic and likely will remain so until a better understanding of this disease develops.

### Is IgE or eosinophils the key player in allergic asthma pathogenesis? Are we asking the right question? [^116e5MFR]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

All the phases leading to inflammation of the airways, and therefore clinical expression of allergic asthma, must be considered as dynamic processes. Treatment decisions should consider the biological background that is "driving" the inflammation as this is likely to predict patients' responses to treatment. While IgE is involved early in the inflammatory cascade and can be considered as a cause of allergic asthma, eosinophilia can be considered a consequence of the whole process. This helps to make sense of the clinical effectiveness observed with anti-IgE mAbs in bronchial asthma and the effects of anti-IL-5 mAbs in specific (eosinophilic) asthma patient populations.

However, the question of whether an anti-IgE or anti-eosinophil therapy will be more effective in the clinical practice with patients suffering from eosinophilic asthma is still an open question and further studies are needed.

### Asthma inception: epidemiologic risk factors and natural history across the life course [^113Sqqrt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a descriptive label for an obstructive inflammatory disease in the lower airways manifesting with symptoms including breathlessness, cough, difficulty in breathing, and wheezing. From a clinician's point of view, asthma symptoms can commence at any age, although most patients with asthma — regardless of their age of onset — seem to have had some form of airway problems during childhood. Asthma inception and related pathophysiologic processes are therefore very likely to occur early in life, further evidenced by recent lung physiologic and mechanistic research. Herein, we present state-of-the-art updates on the role of genetics and epigenetics, early viral and bacterial infections, immune response, and pathophysiology, as well as lifestyle and environmental exposures, in asthma across the life course. We conclude that early environmental insults in genetically vulnerable individuals inducing abnormal, pre-asthmatic airway responses are key events in asthma inception, and we highlight disease heterogeneity across ages and the potential shortsightedness of treating all patients with asthma using the same treatments. Although there are no interventions that, at present, can modify long-term outcomes, a precision-medicine approach should be implemented to optimize treatment and tailor follow-up for all patients with asthma.

### Pathophysiology of asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^114gFf3L]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) is a condition in which a person has clinical and biological features of both asthma and COPD. The pathophysiology behind the development of ACO is complex, with various inflammatory cells, cytokines, environmental factors, and architectural changes within the airways, all affecting a patient's clinical manifestation. A better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms resulting in the development of ACO will help us to better identify potential drug targets and improve symptom burden and overall quality of life for patients living with ACO.

### Improving asthma outcomes: clinicians' perspectives on peripheral airways [^115vjCsD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common and well-known diagnosis to specialists, general practitioners, and the general public. Decades of research has shed much light on the nature of asthma, but as is often the case, it raises more questions, and importantly causality and pathophysiology remain very poorly understood. Perhaps the push to simplify the concept and hence its management has been detrimental, given that its clinical spectrum is broad and complex and a simple approach to treatment does not match the reality of this complexity. The authors strongly argue that better characterization of pathophysiology, be they called phenotypes, traits, or biomarkers, is required to improve management and to advance research. Respiratory physiology has a fundamental role in diagnosis and management of airways diseases and is the functional representation of both inflammation and lung and airway remodeling. Peripheral airways disease is an integral part of asthma, and the ability to measure function of the peripheral airways has allowed studies that reveal the importance of small airway function in asthma. Is this useful for clinicians and researchers? In this article, we explain what aspects of peripheral airway dysfunction are clinically important, and how this informs assessment and management.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113jNTUe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society research statement on mild asthma — mild asthma is believed to represent the majority of patients with asthma, is variably defined with common usage referring to infrequent symptoms, and patients can face an underappreciated exacerbation burden with increased risk for impaired quality of life, accelerated lung function decline, and oral corticosteroid exposure; a panel evaluated existing literature and made recommendations for future research, and this document is meant to be a roadmap for future research and not a clinical guideline for patient care. The statement suggests research priorities in various mild asthma–related areas, including definition of mild asthma (conduct surveys of physician and patient perspectives and develop a consensus definition with utility for patients, clinicians, and researchers), phenotypes and inflammatory mechanisms (investigate inflammatory pathways using airway samples with multiomics and network analyses, describe phenotypes using a multidimensional approach including airway hyperresponsiveness, exacerbation patterns, symptom burden, and inflammation, and assess whether there is a treatment-refractory or poorly corticosteroid responsive phenotype), and disease progression and exacerbations (conduct prospective longitudinal cohort studies to identify the frequency of and risk factors for progression to more severe disease and monitor long-term outcomes of patients followed exclusively by primary care providers, while evaluating patient factors influencing the exacerbation reduction effects of mild asthma therapies).

### The new biologic drugs: which children with asthma should get what? [^112vLMzf]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Asthma affects one in 11 children in the UK, one of the highest prevalences of this condition in Europe. This disease burden has not significantly changed over the last two decades, and the UK has some of the worst asthma outcomes (including childhood asthma deaths) in Europe. Asthma was classically thought to be variable airflow flow obstruction, caused by inflammation and bronchial hyper‐responsiveness. However, more evidence is emerging that asthma is a heterogeneous condition. Management of severe asthma is challenging, particularly since the evidence base for treatment is largely extrapolated from teenagers and adults with severe asthma, which is recognized to have a different pathophysiology to school aged asthma. Evidence has also emerged that children with mild or moderate asthma may have different pathophysiology to those with severe asthma. It is estimated that around 2%–5% of children with school aged asthma have problematic severe asthma (PSA), with poor symptom control despite being prescribed maximum asthma therapy. It is crucial to recognize that children with PSA account for half of healthcare costs for childhood asthma and are at high risk of asthma related deaths, and therefore all children with severe asthma must be referred to a severe asthma specialist center.

### Pharmacotherapy and airway remodelling in asthma? [^113aZMr2]. Thorax (2003). Low credibility.

Over the last few decades attention has largely focused on airway inflammation in asthma, but more recently it has been appreciated that there are important structural airway changes which have been grouped together under the term "airway remodelling". It is only now that questions have been asked about the impact of treatment on these structural changes. This review examines the nature of these structural airway changes, the mechanisms of their generation, their potential consequences, and what is known about the ability of anti-asthma treatments to modulate these changes.

### Recent advances in severe asthma: from phenotypes to personalized medicine [^114P4jvL]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

This review focuses on recent clinical and translational discoveries in severe and uncontrolled asthma that now enable phenotyping and personalized therapies in these patients. Although asthma is common in both children and adults and typically responds to standard therapies, a subset of individuals with asthma experience severe and/or persistent symptoms despite appropriate therapies. Airflow obstruction leading to frequent symptoms requiring higher levels of controller therapy is the cardinal feature of severe asthma, but the underlying molecular mechanisms, or endotypes, are diverse and variable between individuals. Two major risk factors that contribute to severe asthma are genetics and environmental exposures that modulate immune responses, and although these often interact in complex manners that are not fully understood, certain endotypes converge in severe asthma. A number of studies have evaluated various features of patients with severe asthma and classified patients into phenotypes with clinical relevance. This phenotyping is now incorporated into clinical practice and can be used to guide advanced biological therapies that target specific molecules and inflammatory pathways that contribute to asthma pathogenesis.

Background

Asthma has seen a staggering rise in prevalence in recent years with more than 300 million people worldwide believed to be affected by this chronic respiratory disorder. The burden of asthma is felt globally, however it is in developed countries that asthma has come to the fore as a health care concern where the incidence rate of asthma and in particular adult onset asthma has risen so dramatically that this respiratory disorder has reached epidemic proportions. The incidence of childhood asthma in the Western world has also reached worrying levels. Recently research has begun to focus on the role microbes play in this chronic respiratory disorder. Thanks to advances in sequencing technologies it is now possible to dissect the role microbial composition and diversity can play in a multi-factorial disorder such as asthma. It is beginning to become clear that there are clear differences present between asthmatics and non-asthmatics and the microbial load they carry. Through gaining an insight into the unique microbiota of asthmatics much may be revealed, as has happened in gastrointestinal microbial research, which could undoubtedly aid in disease prognosis and treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1179AP9W]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Unanswered clinical questions in patients with overlapping features of asthma and COPD — there is an urgent need for more research to guide better recognition and safe and effective treatment, because patients who do not have 'classical' features of asthma or of COPD, or who have features of both, have generally been excluded from randomized controlled trials of most therapeutic interventions for airways disease, and from many mechanistic studies. Future research should include study of clinical and physiological characteristics, biomarkers, outcomes and underlying mechanisms among broad populations of patients with respiratory symptoms or with chronic airflow limitation. In the meantime, the present chapter provides interim advice about diagnosis and initial treatment from the perspective of clinicians, particularly those in primary care and nonpulmonary specialties, and further research is needed to inform evidence-based definitions, to provide a more detailed classification of these patients, and to encourage the development of specific interventions for clinical use.

### Treating asthma: is there a place for leukotriene receptor antagonists? [^1117Yzn3]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic disorder, characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), airway inflammation and airway remodelling. Evidence has been provided for a relationship between pathophysiology, airway inflammation and remodelling. Moreover, these asthma features have been shown to respond to anti-inflammatory therapy. According to current guidelines, monitoring of asthma is predominantly based on symptoms and lung function data. However, these parameters appeared as poor indices for asthma control. Alternatively, asthma control relates well to exacerbations and (anamnestic) surrogate biomarkers of airway inflammation. Hence, appropriate treatment of asthma should primarily target the airway inflammation. According to current guidelines for asthma management, anti-inflammatory therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is the cornerstone in the treatment of persistent asthma. To further optimize asthma control, add-on therapy with long-acting β₂-agonists (LABA) or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) should be combined with low to high doses of ICS. While the first combination focuses on optimal control of symptoms and lung function, the second provides a more complete suppression of the airway inflammation. In this paper we discuss treatment of asthma according to current guidelines versus new insights, addressing practical issues.

### Is airway remodeling clinically relevant in asthma? [^112Com4h]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The social and economic impact of asthma is substantial worldwide. Although current therapies targeting both airway inflammation and airway hyperreactivity effectively relieve and prevent symptoms in the majority of patients, some patients experience persistent symptoms and a progressive decline in lung function, described as irreversible or refractory asthma. Indeed, there are many unanswered questions about the role of airway remodeling in asthma. This review addresses several topics of controversy, including whether all patients with asthma demonstrate airway remodeling; the contribution of distinct airway resident cells to the development of remodeling; the role of biomarkers or noninvasive measurements in predicting airway remodeling; and the effectiveness of current therapies on airway remodeling and disease progression.

### The physiology of asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^113cM9GU]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are both characterized by airway obstruction and share similar clinical manifestations. However, they differ in many respects related to underlying cause, mechanism of airway obstruction, pattern and progression of symptoms, and response to therapy. It remains unclear whether there is a unique physiologic phenotype that characterizes asthma-COPD overlap (ACO). This review describes the common and distinct physiologic tests that help define asthma and COPD and potentially how they may contribute to understanding the underlying physiology of ACO.

### Severe adult asthmas: integrating clinical features, biology, and therapeutics to improve outcomes [^115nG8db]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Definition

Advances in the understanding of severe asthma accelerated ∼20 years ago when severe asthma was recognized as a distinct grouping of entities. Severe asthma was specifically defined, first in 2000 by an American Thoracic Society (ATS) workshop, then by the World Health Organization (for a more global definition with relevance to poorly developed and developing countries), and most recently by the European Respiratory Society (ERS)–ATS guidelines. Underlying obstructions with reversibility or reactivity, current or previous, remain at the heart of identifying severe asthma, such that confirmation of an asthma diagnosis, by original ATS definitions, is mandatory. This need to link to current or historical reversible obstruction is sometimes lost when evaluating symptomatic patients, despite guideline-appropriate therapy, leading to inaccurate diagnoses. In addition, lack of reversibility to normal should not invoke a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; rather, it is a hallmark of severe asthmatic disease.

Once an asthma diagnosis is established, ERS–ATS–defined severe asthma (Box 1) is "asthma which requires treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (CSs), plus a second controller, to remain controlled or which remains uncontrolled despite this therapy". Control is defined by symptoms, exacerbations, and degree of obstruction. Yet the current severe asthma definition remains an umbrella definition. It can encompass smokers, ex-smokers, and nonsmokers and a broad range of underlying pathobiologies or molecular phenotypes. Dissecting them is critical to improving treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1122GNtY]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma remission — definitions and clinical context: Remission of asthma has been investigated extensively, and definitions and criteria vary, but they commonly refer to either clinical remission (e.g., no asthma symptoms or exacerbations for a specific period) or complete (or pathophysiological) remission (e.g., also including normal lung function, airway responsiveness and/or inflammatory markers). There has been interest in remission off treatment, for example with biologic therapy for severe asthma, and the concept of clinical remission on treatment is consistent with the long-term goal of asthma management promoted by GINA, which is to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the patient. When discussing the best possible outcomes with a patient, consider their own asthma goals, their asthma phenotype, clinical features, multimorbidity, risk factors (including severity of airflow limitation), practical issues including the availability and cost of medications, and the potential adverse effects of treatment. Research in patients who have (or have not) experienced clinical or complete remission of asthma, either off treatment or on treatment, provides opportunities for understanding mechanisms and developing new approaches to prevention and management, which will be facilitated by using standardized criteria and tools.

### 'The microbiome and the pathophysiology of asthma' [^116hT2TM]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease whose prevalence is increasing in the western world. Recently research has begun to focus on the role the microbiome plays in asthma pathogenesis in the hope of further understanding this respiratory disorder. Considered sterile until recently, the lungs have revealed themselves to contain a unique microbiota. A shift towards molecular methods for the quantification and sequencing of microbial DNA has revealed that the airways harbour a unique microbiota with apparent, reproducible differences present between healthy and diseased lungs. There is a hope that in classifying the microbial load of the asthmatic airway an insight may be afforded as to the possible role pulmonary microbes may have in propagating an asthmatic airway response. This could potentially pave the way for new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic lung conditions such as asthma.

### The study team for early life asthma research (STELAR) consortium' asthma e-lab': team science bringing data, methods and investigators together [^115KiMTw]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Asthma epidemiology is reaching the limit of what can be achieved through conventional hypothesis-driven research, due to factors that include residual confounding, multiple influences of modest effect size and lack of statistical power to detect interactions between factors in complex datasets. Evidence is mounting that asthma is not a single disease, but a collection of several diseases, each with unique pathophysiology, and environmental and genetic associates (often referred to as 'asthma endotypes'). Some reports have proposed abolishing the term 'asthma'. This conceptual framework of 'asthma syndrome' may also explain why the responses to currently available treatments vary considerably: if asthma is an umbrella diagnosis that comprises multiple diseases with distinct mechanisms, then it is unlikely that these different diseases would always respond equally to same therapeutic agents. In this context, 'asthma phenotype' can be viewed as an observable characteristic that can be shared between several diseases ('endotypes') within the asthma syndrome, while 'asthma endotype' is a hypothetical construct that has a tangible value in helping us to better understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of asthma disease-related states and may help identify more effective personalised treatment strategies. However, unless better ways are found to distinguish between different endotypes, it will be difficult to discover their underlying pathophysiological processes or identify novel therapeutic targets for stratified treatment, as any signal will be diluted by phenotypical heterogeneity.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in adults: a review [^1177XNRD]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on asthma:

- **Definition**: Asthma is a chronic disorder of the lower respiratory tract characterized by bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reversible airflow obstruction presenting with episodic or persistent symptoms of wheezing, dyspnea, and cough.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of asthma is complex and not fully understood. It involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors that lead to airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and remodeling. Exposure to allergens triggers an inflammatory response in the airways, leading to bronchoconstriction, increased mucus production, and airway remodeling.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of asthma in the US is estimated at 8.2% in the general population involving all ages.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for asthma include a genetic predisposition, atopy, and exposure to environmental factors, such as air pollutants, volatile organic compounds, benzene, formaldehyde, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, xylenes, cleaning agents, insecticides, dampness, mould, and allergens. Additionally, respiratory infections and a personal or family history of allergies are significant risk factors.
- **Disease course**: The clinical manifestations of asthma include recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. These symptoms can vary in frequency and severity and are often worse at night or in the early morning.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of asthma can vary widely among patients. It is generally a controllable chronic condition that can lead to a good QoL with appropriate treatment and lifestyle modifications.

### Mechanisms of airway hyper-responsiveness in asthma: the past, present and yet to come [^115vcAkL]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) has long been considered a cardinal feature of asthma. The development of the measurement of AHR 40 years ago initiated many important contributions to our understanding of asthma and other airway diseases. However, our understanding of AHR in asthma remains complicated by the multitude of potential underlying mechanisms which in reality are likely to have different contributions amongst individual patients. Therefore, the present review will discuss the current state of understanding of the major mechanisms proposed to contribute to AHR and highlight the way in which AHR testing is beginning to highlight distinct abnormalities associated with clinically relevant patient populations. In doing so we aim to provide a foundation by which future research can begin to ascribe certain mechanisms to specific patterns of bronchoconstriction and subsequently match phenotypes of bronchoconstriction with clinical phenotypes. We believe that this approach is not only within our grasp but will lead to improved mechanistic understanding of asthma phenotypes and we hoped to better inform the development of phenotype-targeted therapy.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: current challenges facing research and therapeutic advances in airway remodeling [^117Vi7Pa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society research statement — conclusions on airway remodeling (AR) in asthma state that a contributory role of AR in asthma pathogenesis and pathobiology is largely accepted, although which features are causally important remains debated; alterations in multiple cell types occur with AR and their impact likely varies by age, sex, disease severity, etiology, responsiveness to therapy, and other factors; understanding AR mechanisms and their impact on disease is key to development of anti-AR therapies; significant barriers exist, including limitations in defining AR parameters, lack of appropriate tissue samples or longitudinal sampling approaches for a slowly progressing process, lack of biomarkers, technological limitations in noninvasively assessing AR, and overall lack of enthusiasm from funding agencies, regulatory agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry for a protracted process with unclear regulatory indications; nonetheless, given the emerging and increasingly established importance of AR in asthma, there need to be clear educational, research, funding, and regulatory advancements toward enhancing research into AR and development of novel therapies to blunt this process.

### Is there a rationale and role for long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators in asthma? [^111QWsiu]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

It has long been apparent from clinical and preclinical investigations of the pathophysiology of asthma that cholinergic parasympathetic tone contributes to contraction of bronchial smooth muscle and narrowing of the airways. The extent to which increased parasympathetic tone is a consequence of reflex to the inflammatory state or is a pathophysiological mechanism in itself is unclear. Regardless, the raised parasympathetic tone does provide a rationale for the use of long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators in asthma, and recent Phase III trial results have demonstrated clinical benefits and lung function improvements with tiotropium as add-on therapy to ICS alone or ICS plus LABA in adult patients with poorly controlled asthma. In light of the evidence, we believe that anticholinergic bronchodilators will be a useful add-on therapy for patients at high risk of future worsening or exacerbations, and in patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled on a broad range of treatments and/or for whom other alternative therapies are unsuitable.

Whether tiotropium or other long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators will offer clinical advantages in younger patients, or in those with less severe asthma than studied thus far, is under investigation. As we gain clinical experience in asthma with long-acting anticholinergics, if approved, it will be interesting to see whether and to what extent certain subgroups and phenotypes benefit from their use as controller medications.

### Computed tomography scans in severe asthma: utility and clinical implications [^1155P7ZW]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma is a global burden, affecting 5% of the general adult population, of whom approximately 5–10% suffer from severe asthma. Severe asthma is a complex heterogeneous disease entity, with high morbidity and mortality. Increasingly novel techniques in computed tomography (CT) are being used to understand the pathophysiology of severe asthma. The utility and clinical implications of these CT techniques are the focus of this review.

Recent Findings

Novel qualitative and quantitative CT imaging techniques have enabled us to study the large airway architecture in detail, assess the small airway structure, and perform functional analysis of regional ventilation.

Summary

Despite advances in CT imaging techniques, there is an urgent need for both proof-of-concept studies and large cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical trials in severe asthma to validate and clinically correlate imaging derived measures. This will extend our current understanding of the pathophysiology of severe asthma, and unravel the structure-function relationship, with the potential to discover novel severe asthma phenotypes and predict mortality, morbidity, and response to existing and novel pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies.

### Can we treat airway remodeling? [^115WEknH]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic disease that has been associated with structural changes of the airway wall. These changes lead to decreased reversibility of airway obstruction and have been understood as poorly reversible. Recent studies have proved that even some of the processes involved in airway remodeling may be reversible with early detection of the disease and appropriate anti inflammatory treatment. New treatments should be directed not only against inflammation itself but also against these chronic changes.

### Discerning asthma endotypes through comorbidity mapping [^113mnW2C]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a prevalent, debilitating, and expensive condition that affects about 30 million Americans and about 300 million people worldwide. It is a heterogeneous complex syndrome that undoubtedly represents an amalgam of multiple distinct "diseases", each stemming from a different constellation of genetic variations, environmental exposure histories, and molecular mechanisms that results in a generally similar clinical diathesis. The heterogeneous nature of asthma is evidenced in its varying clinical presentations, spectrum of airway inflammation, and differences in individual responses to asthma treatments –. Moreover, the risk loci discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in very large samples of individuals with "asthma" do not account for all of the genetic risks for asthma, indicating that genetic variants in additional loci are yet to be discovered. These missing loci likely include those that contribute to specific subtypes of asthma – but acquiring sufficiently large numbers of individuals with detailed phenotypic and genetic data to study the genetics of asthma subgroups has been challenging.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — definition and description: Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation and is defined by the history of respiratory symptoms that vary over time and in intensity together with variable expiratory airflow limitation; airflow limitation may later become persistent. Asthma is usually associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation, but these are not necessary or sufficient to make the diagnosis, and it is a common, chronic respiratory disease affecting 1–29% of the population in different countries, with variations often triggered by factors such as exercise, allergen or irritant exposure, change in weather, or viral respiratory infections.

Pathophysiology of Mild Asthma

Mild Asthma Phenotypes and Inflammatory Mechanisms

The phenotypic description of mild asthma should be considered in several dimensions: airway responsiveness, pathophysiology, inflammatory phenotype, exacerbation pattern, and longitudinal clinical symptom burden.

Mild asthma demonstrates heterogeneity in inflammation that likely emanates from specific and nonspecific triggers at the airway epithelium, potentially interacting with different underlying genomic patterns, and that may also be influenced by current exposures, such as to allergen. Although the frequency of particular phenotypes may differ in mild compared with moderate to severe asthma, there is still a spectrum of inflammatory disease present in mild asthma. This is highlighted by post hoc analysis of patients with mild asthma in the SARP (Severe Asthma Research Program) I/II (defined by having FEV₁ ≤ 80% predicted on no or low doses of ICSs). The mild asthma cohort was more likely to have early-onset asthma (age < 12 yr), was predominantly female, and exhibited some atopy. These patients with mild allergic asthma were on no or low- to moderate-dose ICS and had low healthcare resource use. In SARP III, 40% of patients with early-onset asthma had elevated blood eosinophils, 20% had elevated sputum eosinophils, and 60% had elevated sputum neutrophils (highest cell count noted on repeat measures). Comparable results were noted in baseline assessments for the SIENA (Steroids in Eosinophil Negative Asthma) study in which only ∼25% of patients had elevated sputum eosinophils. As in the SARP studies, patients with mild asthma in SIENA tended to have early-onset disease, needed fewer controllers, were usually atopic, had more preserved lung function, and had lower healthcare use.

### Type 2 inflammation in asthma – present in most, absent in many [^113HWC35]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2015). Medium credibility.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic immunological diseases in humans, affecting people from childhood to old age. Progress in treating asthma has been relatively slow and treatment guidelines have mostly recommended empirical approaches on the basis of clinical measures of disease severity rather than on the basis of the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis. An important molecular mechanism of asthma is type 2 inflammation, which occurs in many but not all patients. In this Opinion article, I explore the role of type 2 inflammation in asthma, including lessons learnt from clinical trials of inhibitors of type 2 inflammation. I consider how dichotomizing asthma according to levels of type 2 inflammation — into 'T helper 2 (TH2)-high' and 'TH2-low' subtypes (endotypes) — has shaped our thinking about the pathobiology of asthma and has generated new interest in understanding the mechanisms of disease that are independent of type 2 inflammation.

Table 3 — Research needs for mild asthma phenotypes and inflammatory mechanisms — Knowledge gaps include clinical outcomes of different mild asthma phenotypes including specific populations; the stability of mild asthma phenotypes; which phenotypes are at greater risk; the role of eosinophils in mild asthma regarding pathology, associated risks, and outcomes; other inflammatory pathways of mild asthma and whether/how they differ from those in more severe disease; and optimal study designs. Suggested research includes investigating inflammatory pathways using airway samples with multiomics and network analyses, conducting cluster analyses to elucidate heterogeneity, describing phenotypes using a multidimensional approach including AHR, exacerbation patterns, symptom burden, and inflammation, assessing whether there is a treatment-refractory or poorly CS responsive phenotype, conducting large epidemiological studies on blood eosinophils and breath analysis, and characterizing stability of inflammatory markers/phenotypes across environmental triggers; CS = corticosteroid.

Pathophysiology of mild asthma — Mild asthma phenotypes and inflammatory mechanisms are framed across "airway responsiveness, pathophysiology, inflammatory phenotype, exacerbation pattern, and longitudinal clinical symptom burden", with "heterogeneity in inflammation" linked to epithelial triggers and exposures. In post hoc analyses from the Severe Asthma Research Program, "the mild asthma cohort was more likely to have early-onset asthma (age < 12 yr), was predominantly female, and exhibited some atopy", and "were on no or low-to moderate-dose ICSs and had low healthcare resource use". Quantitatively, "In SARP III, 40% of patients with early-onset asthma had elevated blood eosinophils, 20% had elevated sputum eosinophils, and 60% had elevated sputum neutrophils (highest cell count noted on repeat measures)", while in SIENA "only ∼25% of patients had elevated sputum eosinophils".

### Verdict in the case of therapies versus eosinophils: the jury is still out [^114qTQeF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Eosinophils are regarded by many as fundamental to the pathophysiology of allergic diseases, including asthma. An improved understanding of the mechanisms involved in these responses is therefore of great relevance to asthma pathogenesis and the development of new therapeutics. Most therapies that are effective in reducing allergic inflammation in animals and human subjects diminish tissue eosinophilia and levels of eosinophil-derived mediators. However, recent efforts with more selective eosinophil-suppressive therapies have failed to affect disease, bringing into question the role of eosinophils in asthma. This article will provide a brief overview of the role of eosinophils in allergic diseases, followed by a discussion of both eosinophil-specific and eosinophil-selective therapeutic targets, with a focus on cell-surface molecules. The known and theoretic benefits and risks of these strategies will also be covered.

### Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^113Lzr4i]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) defines a subgroup of patients with asthma who have persistent airflow obstruction or patients with COPD who may exhibit variable airflow limitation and/or evidence of type 2 inflammation. Additional investigations are needed to determine whether ACO represents a distinct disorder with unique underlying pathophysiology, whether ACO patients should be managed differently from those with asthma or COPD, and whether the diagnosis affects long-term outcomes. This article presents the data about the clinical features of ACO, the current information regarding the underlying pathophysiology of the syndrome, and current understanding of therapeutic options.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: current challenges facing research and therapeutic advances in airway remodeling [^116Tzk2k]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society Research Statement on airway remodeling (AR) in asthma — background, significance, and therapeutic gap — highlights that recognition of AR dates to 1922 and that interest increased markedly with 680 reviews among 2,430 peer-reviewed publications since ~1995, while studies reflect a general consensus that AR contributes significantly to the pathobiology of asthma and other obstructive lung diseases and is an important therapeutic target. Despite this interest, little if any progress has been made in developing therapeutics that inhibit or reverse AR, and current therapies targeting asthma that help alleviate airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and inflammation are largely ineffective in addressing AR. The statement specifies it is not intended to provide clinical guidelines or recommendations and focuses on AR that occurs with asthma, though many issues may apply to other obstructive lung diseases.

### Lung damage and airway remodelling in severe asthma [^112qbPhz]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease with substantial unmet clinical need. Airway damage and remodelling is a consequence of complex host-environment interactions and is considered to be the cardinal feature leading onto the development and persistence of airflow obstruction. In this review, we shall bring together recent insights into the causes of airway damage and remodelling that propose key roles for pathogens and mechanical damage in addition to allergens, underlying genetic susceptibility, inflammatory and structural cell interactions, and impaired resolution of damage. We shall consider the consequences of airway remodelling in terms of airway geometry, mechanics and clinical expression of disease. Understanding the causes and consequences of airway damage and remodelling will shed light upon the structure-function relationships required to begin to unravel the complexity of severe asthma and will enable us to target current and novel therapies as we begin to move towards realizing personalized medicine.

### Barriers to clinical remission in severe asthma [^11674bLh]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is the most common noncommunicable respiratory disease, affecting an estimated 339 million people globally. It is a heterogeneous disease characterised by chronic airway inflammation, variable airflow limitation, mucus hypersecretion and bronchial smooth muscle hyperresponsiveness, with variable symptoms over time. Severe asthma, comprising approximately 3–10% of all patients, is defined by the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society task force as asthma that requires high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a second controller and/or oral corticosteroids (OCS) to remain controlled, or that remains uncontrolled despite this therapy. It is associated with an increased risk for exacerbations, reduced lung function and fixed airflow limitation, daily symptoms, and adverse effects of treatment, especially those from OCS. Severe asthma is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, and a significant use of healthcare resources. Inhaled and oral corticosteroids have been the cornerstone of asthma therapy for many years, but they have not been associated with a significant long-term impact on the course of the disease. Knowledge of the underlying pathophysiological changes in asthma has improved significantly during the last decades, allowing for the characterisation of disease phenotypes and the introduction of targeted biologic therapies. The current treatment goals are still focused on symptom control and reduction of future exacerbation risk.

### Airway smooth muscle pathophysiology in asthma [^1132SUXR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

The airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell plays a central role in the pathogenesis of asthma and constitutes an important target for treatment. These cells control muscle tone and thus regulate the opening of the airway lumen and air passage. Evidence indicates that ASM cells participate in the airway hyperresponsiveness as well as the inflammatory and remodeling processes observed in asthmatic subjects. Therapeutic approaches require a comprehensive understanding of the structure and function of the ASM in both the normal and disease states. This review updates current knowledge about ASM and its effects on airway narrowing, remodeling, and inflammation in asthma.

### Is IgE or eosinophils the key player in allergic asthma pathogenesis? Are we asking the right question? [^113nhWtL]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Cellular components and pathways involved in (a): acute (sensitisation), and (b): chronic (cellular damage) phases of allergic asthma pathogenesis

Among specialists there is a common misconception that asthma is always associated with eosinophilic inflammation at the bronchial level. However, not all types of asthma are characterised by the eosinophilic pattern, there are also neutrophilic and pauci-granulocytic variants. One concept that needs to be considered is that asthma endotypes can change over time, particularly regards the pattern of cellular components. One example may be represented by the viral-induced modification of the airway inflammatory responses, due to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines with may favour a Th1/Th17 immune response, or on the other hand, amplify a pre-existing Th2 response. Although respiratory viral infections cause asthma exacerbations, data about the type of cellular infiltrate and underlying molecular mechanisms are not conclusive. The airway inflammatory responses during virus-induced exacerbations depend on the viral species and on host-related factors and may be associated with increases in neutrophils, eosinophils and macrophages.

From a clinical perspective, it is important to note that the efficacy of biological therapies is evident only in patients who have experienced asthma exacerbations. As previously mentioned, the question is not whether an anti-IgE or anti-eosinophil therapy is more effective but rather what is the cause and pathogenic mechanism prevalent in each patient. The complex biological role of IgE, how IgE mAbs achieve their clinical effects and the ability of IgE to regulate the functioning of several cells has been increasingly studied over the past few years by retracing our steps, that is, starting with the clinical observations of the effectiveness of omalizumab in severe asthma patients and then analysing how IgE mAbs achieved this effect. Indeed, unlike other biological agents, the clinical efficacy of omalizumab has been appreciated before fully understanding its overall mechanisms of action.

### Obesity-related asthma: new insights leading to a different approach [^112ZSJHZ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Obesity is a growing global health threat that significantly contributes to the burden of asthma by increasing the risk of developing asthma and exerting a distinct effect on lung function and inflammation. The treatment of obesity-related asthma is hindered by a poor response to standard asthma treatments, leading to worse asthma control. Weight loss strategies have a significant effect on asthma symptoms but are not feasible for a large proportion of patients, underscoring the need for a better understanding of the pathophysiology and the development of additional treatment options.

Recent Findings

Recent literature focusing on pathophysiology particularly delved into nontype 2 inflammatory mechanisms, associations with the metabolic syndrome and small airway impairment. Additionally, several new treatment options are currently investigated, including biologics, weight reduction interventions, and novel antiobesity drugs.

Summary

Obesity-related asthma is a highly prevalent asthma phenotype for which weight loss strategies currently stand as the most specific treatment. Furthermore, novel pharmacological interventions aiming at metabolic processes are on the way.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: evaluation and management of asthma in the elderly [^116aWcD9]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2016). Medium credibility.

Asthma in the elderly — major conclusions on epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment indicate that AIE is common and increasing in prevalence and has high rates of morbidity and mortality with the most vulnerable older individuals being low-income African-American and Hispanic women; structural changes of aging, including loss of elastic recoil, increased airway remodeling in the smaller airways, and increased thickness of the central airway wall, may act synergistically with asthma to worsen airflow obstruction; aging itself is associated with altered immune response and increased systemic inflammation ("inflammaging"), differences in airway inflammation between older and younger patients with asthma are not well characterized, and atopy is common in older patients with asthma but the role of antigen sensitization and exposure on disease severity is not defined; understanding of phenotypes is limited and must address age of asthma onset and overlap with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); there are no specific physiologic tests or biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of AIE and future AIE studies should include global geriatric assessment tools; treatment is complex due to reductions in function, comorbidities, polypharmacy, and psychosocial challenges, knowledge of optimal pharmacological management and response is limited due to exclusion from clinical trials, and adverse effects of asthma medications are more common in the elderly.

### The relationship of airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation: airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma: its measurement and clinical significance [^112xgxoE]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is a clinical feature of asthma and is often in proportion to the underlying severity of the disease. To understand AHR and the mechanisms that contribute to these processes, it is helpful to divide the airway components that affect this feature of asthma into "persistent" and "variable" categories. The persistent component of AHR represents structural changes in the airway, whereas the variable feature relates to inflammatory events. Insight into how these interrelated components of AHR can contribute to asthma is gained by studying treatment effects and models of asthma provocation.

### Eosinophilic endotype of asthma [^111ho1Dj]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease that can be classified into different clinical endotypes, depending on the type of airway inflammation, clinical severity, and response to treatment. This article focuses on the eosinophilic endotype of asthma, which is defined by the central role that eosinophils play in the pathophysiology of the condition. It is characterized by elevated sputum and/or blood eosinophils on at least 2 occasions and by a significant response to treatments that suppress eosinophilia. Histopathologic demonstration of eosinophils in the airways provides the most direct diagnosis of eosinophilic asthma; but it is invasive, thus, impractical in clinical practice.

### Breaking new ground: challenging existing asthma guidelines [^116ckXw4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is estimated to affect 300 million people worldwide, with an expected increase to 400 million worldwide by 2025. A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, asthma causes 0.25 million deaths annually and substantial socioeconomic burden around the globe. Moreover, despite the development and dissemination in recent years of both international guidelines and various national guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management, there is evidence that asthma is frequently not well controlled in many children and adults. In this paper we review the limitations of current asthma guidelines and describe important issues and remaining questions regarding asthma guidelines for use in primary care practice.

### Revisiting type 2-high and type 2-low airway inflammation in asthma: current knowledge and therapeutic implications [^116GiQM7]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma is a complex respiratory disorder characterized by marked heterogeneity in individual patient disease triggers and response to therapy. Several asthma phenotypes have now been identified, each defined by a unique interaction between genetic and environmental factors, including inflammatory, clinical and trigger-related phenotypes. Endotypes further describe the functional or pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the patient's disease. type 2-driven asthma is an emerging nomenclature for a common subtype of asthma and is characterized by the release of signature cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 from cells of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. A number of well-recognized biomarkers have been linked to mechanisms involved in type 2 airway inflammation, including fractional exhaled nitric oxide, serum IgE, periostin, and blood and sputum eosinophils. These type 2 cytokines are targets for pharmaceutical intervention, and a number of therapeutic options are under clinical investigation for the management of patients with uncontrolled severe asthma. Anticipating and understanding the heterogeneity of asthma and subsequent improved characterization of different phenotypes and endotypes must guide the selection of treatment to meet individual patients' needs.

### Airway inflammation in asthma and its consequences: implications for treatment in children and adults [^114Ptkwa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

The development and wide availability of novel research techniques such as bronchoscopy and induced sputum have enhanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma. The appreciation of the inflammatory nature of asthma and the remodeling associated with chronic disease have undoubtedly led to improved disease management and a better understanding of how anti-asthma drugs work. Although extensive data about inflammation and its sequelae in children are lacking, both chronic inflammation and airway remodeling are more than likely to be involved in the development and progression of asthma in this young population. Indeed, evidence suggests that airway restructuring occurs early. The implications for treatment in any differences of inflammation and remodeling between children and adults, then, are likely to be important. Although corticosteroids are considered as first-line anti-inflammatory treatment, especially in chronic asthma, for many patients neither inhaled nor oral corticosteroid therapy can control inflammation adequately. In children, neither the addition of long-acting beta(2)-agonist therapy nor doubling of the corticosteroid dose has produced the same benefits seen in adults. A clearer understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of asthma in adults and pediatric patients should provide new insights into different asthma phenotypes. Therefore, the development and application of relatively simple and safe methods for assessing markers of inflammation and alterations in the airways are vital, especially for children.

### Remodeling in asthma [^115vSF3T]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Airway remodeling encompasses the structural alterations in asthmatic compared with normal airways. Airway remodeling in asthmatic patients involves a wide array of pathophysiologic features, including epithelial changes, increased smooth muscle mass, increased numbers of activated fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, subepithelial fibrosis, and vascular changes. Multiple cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors released from both inflammatory and structural cells in the airway tissue create a complex signaling environment that drives these structural changes. However, recent investigations have changed our understanding of asthma from a purely inflammatory disease to a disease in which both inflammatory and structural components are equally involved. Several reports have suggested that asthma primarily develops because of serious defects in the epithelial layer that allow environmental allergens, microorganisms, and toxins greater access to the airway tissue and that can also stimulate the release of mediators from the epithelium, thus contributing to tissue remodeling. Lung-resident fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of airway remodeling. Remodeling is assumed to result in persistent airflow limitation, a decrease in lung function, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Asthmatic subjects experience an accelerated decrease in lung function compared with healthy subjects, which is proportionally related to the duration and severity of their disease.

### Mast cells in asthma – state of the art [^1149ASLG]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

Mast cells (MCs) play a central role in tissue homoeostasis, sensing the local environment through numerous innate cell surface receptors. This enables them to respond rapidly to perceived tissue insults with a view to initiating a co-ordinated programme of inflammation and repair. However, when the tissue insult is chronic, the ongoing release of multiple pro-inflammatory mediators, proteases, cytokines and chemokines leads to tissue damage and remodelling. In asthma, there is strong evidence of ongoing MC activation, and their mediators and cell-cell signals are capable of regulating many facets of asthma pathophysiology. This article reviews the evidence behind this.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111M2Lvq]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Remission of asthma — Remission of asthma can be identified in children and in adults, either clinical remission or complete remission, and either off-treatment or on-treatment, and definitions and criteria vary; the concept of clinical remission on treatment is consistent with the long-term goal of asthma management promoted by GINA to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for each patient. Research among patients who have (or have not) experienced clinical or complete remission of asthma, either off-treatment or on-treatment, provides important opportunities for understanding underlying mechanisms of asthma and to develop new approaches to asthma prevention and management, facilitated by standardized criteria and assessment tools. Take care if using the term 'remission' with patients or parents/caregivers, explain what you mean, and that if asthma symptoms have gone quiet for a while, they may recur.

### Is IgE or eosinophils the key player in allergic asthma pathogenesis? Are we asking the right question? [^1161MuzC]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchial asthma (BA) is a chronic inflammatory disease with a marked heterogeneity in etiology, pathophysiology and clinical aspects, leading to the identification of different phenotypes (early onset atopic/allergic, eosinophilic, exercise induced, obesity and paucigranulocitic) Subsequently, taking into account the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of bronchial inflammation, the concept of endotypes has been introduced. BA is often sustained by allergic sensitisation, which leads to bronchial hyper-responsiveness and acute bronchoconstriction in response to specific and non-specific triggers. For many years, from a pathogenic perspective, the focus of research has been on the role of T cells in the initiation and perpetuation of inflammation. In particular, T helper 2 (Th2) cells have been identified as the cells involved in controlling immunoglobulin E (IgE) production because of their ability to produce interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, and influence the functioning of eosinophils through the actions of IL-5. The presence of Th2 cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage from atopic asthmatics was clearly demonstrated, However, subsequent analyses demonstrated that at least two different endotypes could be proposed based on the degree of Th2 inflammation and called T2 'high' and T2 'low'. Regarding the type of bronchial infiltrate, eosinophils have been considered important pro-inflammatory and epithelial-damaging cells, both in allergic and non-allergic asthma, although alternative inflammatory cells such as neutrophils may be involved. Allergic (or atopic) asthma represents the most frequent endotype of asthma representing over the 60% whereas non atopic eosinophilic phenotype represents about 25–30% of the cases. Approximately 5–10% of patients suffering from asthma have severe refractory asthma, among them non-eosinophilc forms are frequents. Particularly, based on some clinical data, 55% are eosinophilc forms, 20% are neutrophilic forms, 18% paucigranulocytic and 6% a mixed forms. It is important to underline that among all severe forms of asthma, particularly in young subjects, a specific IgE sensitization is demonstrable in a significant proportion of patients.

### Asthma exacerbations. 3: pathogenesis [^1113LiLH]. Thorax (2006). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations are an exaggerated lower airway response to an environmental exposure. Respiratory virus infection is the most common environmental exposure to cause a severe asthma exacerbation. Airway inflammation is a key part of the lower airway response in asthma exacerbation, and occurs together with airflow obstruction and increased airway responsiveness. The patterns of airway inflammation differ according to the trigger factor responsible for the exacerbation. The reasons for the exaggerated response of asthmatic airways are not completely understood, but recent studies have identified a deficient epithelial type 1 interferon response as an important susceptibility mechanism for viral infection.

### Periostin: its role in asthma and its potential as a diagnostic or therapeutic target [^11796Mnj]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

Periostin in inflammation

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory disease that is commonly characterized by airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and/or reversible airway obstruction. To date, there are treatments available that target eosinophilic inflammation in asthma, and these have been able to reduce asthma exacerbations in some cases. However, the inflammatory mechanisms leading to asthma symptoms and AHR in the absence of sputum eosinophilia are poorly understood. Periostin is potentially relevant in the pathogenesis of asthma-associated inflammation and its phenotypes.

### Mechanisms of bronchial hyperreactivity in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112siztx]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Bronchial hyperreactivity has long been recognized as a hallmark of chronic asthma. Less is known about the prevalence and mechanisms of hyperreactivity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Currently, it is unclear whether the role and mechanisms of hyperreactivity are similar in patients with asthma and COPD or whether the underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities are different for both diseases. The aim of this review is to present an overview of current knowledge of the mechanisms of bronchial hyperreactivity in asthma and COPD.

### The immunology of asthma [^113pVRbB]. Nature Immunology (2015). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common disease that affects 300 million people worldwide. Given the large number of eosinophils in the airways of people with mild asthma, and verified by data from murine models, asthma was long considered the hallmark T helper type 2 (TH2) disease of the airways. It is now known that some asthmatic inflammation is neutrophilic, controlled by the TH17 subset of helper T cells, and that some eosinophilic inflammation is controlled by type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2 cells) acting together with basophils. Here we discuss results from in-depth molecular studies of mouse models in light of the results from the first clinical trials targeting key cytokines in humans and describe the extraordinary heterogeneity of asthma.

### Eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation in asthma: insights from clinical studies [^111i2D6f]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2009). Low credibility.

Cellular inflammation of the airways with eosinophils and neutrophils is a characteristic feature of asthma and is considered relevant to the pathogenesis of the disease. Studies of large numbers of subjects with well-characterized asthma in recent years has resulted in new insights about the clinical and pathologic correlates of eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation in asthma. For example, eosinophilic asthma is a distinct phenotype of asthma that is associated pathologically by thickening of the basement membrane zone and pharmacologically by corticosteroid responsiveness. In contrast, noneosinophilic asthma, a sizeable subgroup of asthma that includes patients with severe disease, is not characterized by thickening of the basement membrane zone, and it appears to be relatively corticosteroid resistant. Eosinophilic and neutrophilic asthma are not mutually exclusive subtypes of asthma. Rather, neutrophils accumulate in the airways in patients with asthma with more severe airflow obstruction, where eosinophils may also be present in excess. In addition, neutrophils are prominent in airway secretions during acute severe asthma exacerbations, where it is possible that they have roles in both the initiation and resolution of attacks. These insights about the relationships between cellular inflammation and disease phenotypes of asthma support the concept that different subgroups of patients with asthma, despite clinically similar features, can be defined by specific cellular and molecular markers. The promise now is that these markers will ultimately guide personalized treatment programs.

### Inflammatory cells in asthma: mechanisms and implications for therapy [^117LDajn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Recent clinical studies have brought asthma's complex inflammatory processes into clearer focus, and understanding them can help to delineate therapeutic implications. Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease characterized by the infiltration of airway T cells, CD(+) (T helper) cells, mast cells, basophils, macrophages, and eosinophils. The cysteinyl leukotrienes also are important mediators in asthma and modulators of cytokine function, and they have been implicated in the pathophysiology of asthma through multiple mechanisms. Although the role of eosinophils in asthma and their contribution to bronchial hyperresponsiveness are still debated, it is widely accepted that their numbers and activation status are increased. Eosinophils may be targets for various pharmacologic activities of leukotriene receptor antagonists through their ability to downregulate a number of events that may be key to the effector function of these cells.

### Asthma phenotypes and the use of biologic medications in asthma and allergic disease: the next steps toward personalized care [^117TAYuQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Traditionally, asthma and allergic diseases have been defined by broad definitions and treated with nonspecific medications, including corticosteroids and bronchodilators. There is an increasing appreciation of heterogeneity within asthma and allergic diseases based primarily on recent cluster analyses, molecular phenotyping, biomarkers, and differential responses to targeted and nontargeted therapies. These pioneering studies have led to successful therapeutic trials of molecularly targeted therapies in defined phenotypes. This review analyzed randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of molecularly targeted therapies in defined allergic disease and asthma phenotypes. IgE was the first successful biological target used in patients with allergic disease and asthma. This review shows that therapies targeting the canonical type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 have shown consistent efficacy, especially in asthmatic patients with evidence of TH2/type 2 inflammation ("type 2 high"). As of yet, there are no successful trials of targeted therapies in asthmatic patients without evidence for type 2 inflammation. We conclude that further refinement of type 2 therapies to specific type 2 phenotypes and novel approaches for patients without type 2 inflammation are needed for asthma and allergic disease treatment.

### Asthma therapy and airway remodeling [^117PsyfZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Asthma is characterized by variable degrees of chronic inflammation and structural alterations in the airways. The most prominent abnormalities include epithelial denudation, goblet cell metaplasia, subepithelial thickening, increased airway smooth muscle mass, bronchial gland enlargement, angiogenesis, and alterations in extracellular matrix components, involving large and small airways. Chronic inflammation is thought to initiate and perpetuate cycles of tissue injury and repair in asthma, although remodeling may also occur in parallel with inflammation. In the absence of definite evidence on how different remodeling features affect lung function in asthma, the working hypothesis should be that structural alterations can lead to the development of persistent airway hyperresponsiveness and fixed airway obstruction. It is still unanswered whether and when to begin treating patients with asthma to prevent or reverse deleterious remodeling, which components of remodeling to target, and how to monitor remodeling. Consequently, efforts are being made to understand better the effects of conventional anti-inflammatory therapies, such as glucocorticosteroids, on airway structural changes. Animal models, in vitro studies, and some clinical studies have advanced present knowledge on the cellular and molecular pathways involved in airway remodeling. This has encouraged the development of biologicals aimed to target various components of airway remodeling. Progress in this area requires the explicit linking of modern structure-function analysis with innovative biopharmaceutical approaches.

### Targeting IL-13 and IL-4 in asthma: therapeutic implications on airway remodeling in severe asthma [^1178Lm6c]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the central the role these cytokines play in both inflammatory and structural aspects of asthma, research has increasingly focused on their contributions to disease progression. In this review, we explore the recent advances in understanding the roles of IL-4 and IL-13 in asthma pathophysiology, particularly in airway remodeling. We also discuss their potential as therapeutic targets and their implications for asthma treatment.

### Intrinsic asthma: is it intrinsic to the smooth muscle? [^116GUoif]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

The traditional view of the pathophysiology of asthma is that its characteristic features are secondary to a major allergic or immunological dysfunction. However, this does not explain intrinsic asthma, which can occur in the absence of atopy. An alternative view is that an abnormality in the airway smooth muscle cell, which is capable of producing inflammatory, immunological and growth factors as well as molecules, which facilitate interaction with inflammatory cells, is the primary or instigating event. Evidence is rapidly accumulating that the smooth muscle is abnormal, in that it proliferates faster, produces more chemokines and cytokines as well as a different profile of extracellular matrix proteins than its non-asthmatic counterpart. These abnormalities may arise from altered calcium homoeostasis leading to increased mitochondrial biogenesis and/or decreases in the levels of key transcription factors such as CCAAT enhancer binding protein-alpha. Conditions under which smooth muscle is ablated, such as bronchial thermoplasty, may help us to understand more about the contribution of an airway smooth muscle dysfunction to asthma aetiology.

### Remodeling in asthma [^111dHd3N]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2009). Low credibility.

Airway remodeling refers to the structural changes that occur in both the large and the small airways of miscellaneous diseases, including asthma. In asthma, airway structural changes include subepithelial fibrosis, increased smooth muscle mass, enlargement of glands, neovascularization, and epithelial alterations. Although controversial, airway remodeling is commonly attributed to the underlying chronic inflammatory process. These remodeling changes contribute to thickening of airway walls and consequently lead to airway narrowing, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, airway edema, and mucous hypersecretion. Airway remodeling is associated with poorer clinical outcome among patients with asthma. Early diagnosis and prevention of airway remodeling has the potential to decrease disease severity, to improve control, and to prevent disease expression. In this article, we briefly provide an update on the characteristic features of airway remodeling observed in asthma and their clinical consequences.

### New strategies in the medical management of asthma… [^1159VzHA]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology Airway inflammation is the primary problem in asthma. An initial event in asthma appears to be the release of inflammatory mediators triggered by exposure to allergens, irritants, cold air or exercise. The mediators are released from bronchial mast cells, alveolar macrophages, T lymphocytes and epithelial cells. Some mediators directly cause acute bronchoconstriction, termed the "early-phase asthmatic response. " The inflammatory mediators also direct the activation of eosinophils and neutrophils, and their migration to the airways, where they cause injury. This so-called "late-phase asthmatic response" results in epithelial damage, airway edema, mucus hypersecretion and hyperresponsiveness of bronchial smooth muscle. Varying airflow obstruction leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and cough. 2–4.

Zafirlukast and Zileuton The leukotrienes are potent inflammatory mediators in asthma and contribute to increased mucus production, bronchoconstriction and eosinophil infiltration. These compounds are produced via the lipoxygenase pathway by mast cells, eosinophils and alveolar macrophages. Zafirlukast and Zileuton are two new drugs that antagonize the action of leukotrienes at their receptor or inhibit the lipoxygenase pathway. Both drugs are approved for the management of chronic asthma in adults and in children older than 12 years. Zileuton selectively and reversibly inhibits the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, preventing the formation of cysteinyl leukotrienes. Therapy with this agent has improved patient symptom scores and pulmonary function tests, reduced beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid use, and reduced asthma exacerbations requiring corticosteroid therapy.

In addition, zileuton therapy may improve quality of life in patients with asthma. Inhaled β₂ agonists have a rapid onset of action. Peak bronchodilation occurs within 30 to 60 minutes of administration, and the duration of action is three to eight hours. Several studies. Systemic Corticosteroids Short-term systemic corticosteroid therapy is useful for gaining initial control of asthma and for treating moderate to severe asthma exacerbations.

### Information for clinicians… [^115GVvTy]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance Work-related asthma includes occupational asthma and work-exacerbated asthma. Occupational asthma is new onset asthma caused by exposures at work. Work-exacerbated asthma is previously diagnosed asthma that gets worse at work. Clinicians should consider work-related asthma anytime a patient is experiencing new or worsening symptoms. Pathophysiology The signs and symptoms of work-related asthma are generally the same as those of non-work-related asthma. Work-related asthma is caused or worsened by exposure to workplace sensitizers, irritants, or physical conditions. Sensitizers Sensitizers are agents that initiate an allergic response. There is typically a latency period of at least a few months between first exposure and becoming sensitized. Sensitizers are divided into high-molecular weight and low-molecular weight agents: High-molecular-weight agents: stimulate the production of specific immunoglobulin E antibodies. During re-exposure, the agent cross-links specific antibodies on mast cells and activates them to release inflammatory mediators leading to asthma symptoms. Low-molecular-weight agents: are incomplete antigens, called haptens, that often combine with a protein to produce a sensitizing agent. Irritants
- Induce a non-allergic response and include gases, fumes, vapors, and aerosols.
- Non-allergen-induced asthma pathophysiology is less understood. Physical conditions
- Exposure to cold air and physical exertion.
- Cooling or drying of the airway is thought to lead to bronchoconstriction.

Regardless of the asthma trigger type, the response is characterized by inflammation, edema, bronchoconstriction, and buildup of mucus in the airways. This leads to coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.
