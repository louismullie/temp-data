## Question

Is anticoagulation needed in chronic pw

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether anticoagulation is needed in chronic pulmonary embolism and how to structure duration and agent selection accordingly. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "chronic" means in this context and distinguish chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) from chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease without pulmonary hypertension (CTEPD). Then, I should verify the baseline requirement for anticoagulation after an acute PE and how that transitions into chronic management. Next, I will examine guideline-directed duration for CTEPH and CTEPD, including any exceptions. After that, I need to check agent selection nuances, especially vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) versus direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in CTEPH and antiphospholipid syndrome. Finally, I should review how to operationalize this at 3 months with screening, multidisciplinary referral, and follow-up, and then synthesize a clear recommendation with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. "Chronic pulmonary embolism" in clinical practice typically refers to organized, fibrotic thromboembolic material persisting in the pulmonary arteries after the acute phase, encompassing CTEPH when pulmonary hypertension is present and CTEPD when pulmonary hypertension is absent. Both are generally assessed after at least 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation to separate unresolved acute clot from chronic disease, which is crucial for decision-making and timing of definitive therapies [^113PXY5Z] [^113c3R32].

> I need to verify the foundational principle: every patient with acute PE should receive therapeutic anticoagulation for a minimum of 3 months, because this reduces recurrence and death. This is a consistent recommendation across major guidelines and serves as the baseline before any discussion of chronic sequelae management [^114GRdjZ].

> Now, for CTEPH specifically, I should confirm the highest-credibility guidance. Multiple contemporary guidelines converge on lifelong therapeutic anticoagulation for all patients with CTEPH, with VKAs preferred in the presence of antiphospholipid syndrome. This is a strong, consistent signal from ESC/ERS 2022 and related consensus statements, and it aligns with earlier AHA guidance recommending indefinite anticoagulation in objectively proven CTEPH when not contraindicated [^114CQsX8] [^1135uPn9] [^115k5e3j].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale and agent nuances so I don't overgeneralize. The rationale is twofold: prevent recurrent VTE and mitigate in-situ thrombosis/progression in a remodeled pulmonary vasculature; VKAs are emphasized in antiphospholipid syndrome because of historical and guideline-based concerns about DOAC efficacy in that subgroup, whereas outside APS, DOACs are widely used for VTE and may be reasonable, though high-quality CTEPH-specific comparative data are limited and expert consensus still leans toward VKAs in many centers pending stronger trials [^117VQ5CA] [^115zktWd].

> For CTEPD without pulmonary hypertension, hold on, I should verify whether lifelong therapy is mandated or individualized. ESC/ERS 2022 recommends long-term anticoagulation be considered on an individual basis, balancing recurrence risk, residual clot burden, symptoms, and bleeding risk; this is a weaker, individualized recommendation compared with CTEPH, and some patients with low recurrence risk may reasonably discontinue after a finite course, though many experts favor continuation given the organized thrombus substrate and potential for progression [^115vAvzF] [^115uPx8g].

> Next, I should review how to operationalize this at 3 months. After completing initial anticoagulation, patients with persistent dyspnea or exercise limitation warrant evaluation for CTEPH/CTEPD with echocardiography, natriuretic peptides, and V/Q scanning. Referral to a PH/CTEPH center is recommended if perfusion defects persist beyond 3 months or if there is intermediate/high probability of pulmonary hypertension, with earlier assessment for deteriorating patients. Importantly, there is no role for thrombolysis to prevent CTEPH, and decisions about PEA/BPA and medical therapy should be made in a multidisciplinary CTEPH team [^114GnXMK] [^113c3R32] [^115Qn4eG].

> I should double-check the evidentiary basis for extended anticoagulation beyond 3–6 months in unprovoked VTE, because this informs the chronic PE discussion even if CTEPH is not present. Randomized and observational data show that extending anticoagulation reduces recurrent VTE by roughly 60–80% while modestly increasing bleeding, with the PADIS-PE trial demonstrating benefit during extended warfarin that dissipates after cessation, and contemporary cohorts suggesting DOACs may further reduce recurrence versus warfarin in extended treatment; this supports a tendency toward extended therapy in unprovoked events even when formal CTEPH/CTEPD criteria are not met, individualized to bleeding risk [^111A5Y8X] [^111K3k8z] [^111hxFM8] [^114ami3U].

> But wait, what if the "chronic PE" in question is merely residual organized clot without symptoms or physiologic consequences? Do we still anticoagulate indefinitely? Let me reconsider. In truly asymptomatic CTEPD with low recurrence risk, some guidelines allow individualized decisions and potential discontinuation, yet the absence of robust prospective data means many clinicians continue anticoagulation, especially with substantial organized burden; shared decision-making and periodic reassessment are essential, and any ongoing or new symptoms should prompt re-evaluation for evolution toward CTEPH [^115vAvzF] [^115uPx8g].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, anticoagulation is needed in chronic pulmonary embolism, with lifelong therapeutic anticoagulation indicated for all patients with CTEPH and long-term (often indefinite) anticoagulation generally favored for CTEPD, tailored to recurrence risk, symptoms, clot burden, and bleeding profile. VKAs are preferred in antiphospholipid syndrome, while DOACs are acceptable alternatives in many other settings, and all patients should undergo structured 3‑month follow-up with PH/CTEPH center referral as indicated [^111QN6En] [^114CQsX8] [^1135uPn9] [^114GnXMK].

---

In chronic pulmonary embolism (CTEPH/CTEPD), **lifelong therapeutic anticoagulation is recommended** [^111QN6En] to prevent recurrence and progression, with VKAs preferred in antiphospholipid syndrome [^117VQ5CA] and DOACs acceptable otherwise [^115zktWd]. Anticoagulation does not reverse established vascular obstruction; symptomatic patients require referral to a CTEPH center for evaluation of pulmonary endarterectomy, balloon pulmonary angioplasty, and/or riociguat [^114CQsX8] [^116euotZ]. Duration is lifelong unless contraindicated, and therapy should be individualized based on bleeding risk, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^111QN6En] [^115vAvzF].

---

## Indications for anticoagulation in chronic pulmonary embolism

Anticoagulation is indicated in chronic pulmonary embolism to **prevent recurrent thromboembolism** and halt progression of chronic thromboembolic disease [^111QN6En]. The indications include:

- **Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)**: Lifelong therapeutic anticoagulation is recommended for all patients with CTEPH [^111QN6En] [^1135uPn9].

- **Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease (CTEPD) without pulmonary hypertension**: Long-term anticoagulation is recommended on an individual basis, considering the risk of recurrence and patient-specific factors [^115vAvzF] [^115uPx8g].

- **Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)**: In patients with CTEPH and APS, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are specifically recommended due to their proven efficacy and safety profile in this population [^111QN6En] [^117VQ5CA].

---

## Duration of anticoagulation therapy

The duration of anticoagulation therapy in chronic pulmonary embolism **varies** according to the clinical scenario:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration of anticoagulation** |
|-|-|
| CTEPH | Lifelong therapeutic anticoagulation [^111QN6En] [^1135uPn9] |
| CTEPD without pulmonary hypertension | Long-term anticoagulation individualized based on recurrence risk and patient factors [^115vAvzF] [^115uPx8g] |
| Antiphospholipid syndrome | Lifelong VKA therapy [^111QN6En] [^117VQ5CA] |

---

## Choice of anticoagulant agents

The **choice of anticoagulant** depends on patient-specific factors, including comorbidities, bleeding risk, and drug interactions:

- **Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs)**: Preferred in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome [^notfound] and in those with specific comorbidities where VKAs have a favorable risk-benefit profile [^115zktWd].

- **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)**: Recommended for patients without antiphospholipid syndrome, particularly in non-cancer populations, due to their favorable safety profile and convenience of use [^113iFX4a] [^111hxFM8].

- **Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)**: Considered in patients with renal impairment or in specific clinical scenarios where oral anticoagulants are contraindicated [^1135ykmS].

---

## Risks and benefits of anticoagulation therapy

Anticoagulation therapy in chronic pulmonary embolism **has both benefits and risks**:

Benefits include a **reduced risk of recurrent thromboembolism** and progression of chronic thromboembolic disease [^114ami3U], as well as improved survival and quality of life in patients with CTEPH [^notfound]. Risks include **bleeding complications**, which may be major or minor and require careful monitoring and dose adjustments [^111A5Y8X], and drug interactions, particularly with VKAs, necessitating regular INR monitoring and dose adjustments [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential in patients with chronic pulmonary embolism receiving anticoagulation therapy. This includes periodic clinical assessments for **bleeding, thromboembolic recurrence, and adherence to therapy** [^notfound], laboratory monitoring — INR monitoring for VKAs and periodic renal and hepatic function tests for DOACs [^notfound] — and periodic imaging with echocardiography and ventilation-perfusion scans to assess disease progression and response to therapy [^113c3R32].

---

## Special considerations and contraindications

Certain patient populations require **special consideration**:

- **Renal impairment**: DOACs may require dose adjustments or alternative anticoagulants may be preferred [^114ZZTUs].

- **Hepatic impairment**: Caution is advised with anticoagulation therapy, and alternative strategies may be necessary [^112M3J5W].

- **High bleeding risk**: Individualized risk-benefit assessment is essential, and alternative therapies or adjusted dosing may be required [^113TBBSg].

---

## Alternative therapies and adjunctive treatments

In addition to anticoagulation, **alternative therapies and adjunctive treatments** may be considered:

- **Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA)**: Recommended for patients with CTEPH and accessible fibrotic obstructions [^111QN6En] [^114CQsX8].

- **Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA)**: Recommended for patients who are inoperable or have residual pulmonary hypertension after PEA [^111QN6En] [^116euotZ].

- **Riociguat**: Recommended for symptomatic patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent pulmonary hypertension after PEA [^111QN6En] [^116euotZ].

---

Anticoagulation is a cornerstone of chronic pulmonary embolism management, with **lifelong therapy recommended** for CTEPH and individualized duration for CTEPD. The choice of anticoagulant should be tailored to patient-specific factors, and regular monitoring is essential to balance the risks and benefits of therapy.

6 Limitations

This meta‐analysis has some limitations. There was variability among the included studies regarding design, patient populations, intervention protocols, and outcome measures, which could be resolved using a random‐effects model. Publication bias remains a possibility, especially since studies with negative or inconclusive results are less likely to be published. Inconsistent reporting of outcomes and the focus on short‐term outcomes posed challenges, providing limited information on long‐term effects. In addition, the current study did not discuss the impact of differences in anticoagulant dosages or timing of thrombolysis. Only English‐language studies were included, potentially excluding relevant research in other languages and affecting the comprehensiveness of the findings.

### Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis [^115ZNu6w]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is the third most common cause of death from cardiovascular disease after heart attack and stroke. Sequelae occurring after venous thromboembolism include chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and post-thrombotic syndrome. Venous thromboembolism and atherothrombosis share common risk factors and the common pathophysiological characteristics of inflammation, hypercoagulability, and endothelial injury. Clinical probability assessment helps to identify patients with low clinical probability for whom the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism can be excluded solely with a negative result from a plasma D-dimer test. The diagnosis is usually confirmed with compression ultrasound showing deep vein thrombosis or with chest CT showing pulmonary embolism. Most patients with venous thromboembolism will respond to anticoagulation, which is the foundation of treatment. Patients with pulmonary embolism should undergo risk stratification to establish whether they will benefit from the addition of advanced treatment, such as thrombolysis or embolectomy. Several novel oral anticoagulant drugs are in development. These drugs, which could replace vitamin K antagonists and heparins in many patients, are prescribed in fixed doses and do not need any coagulation monitoring in the laboratory. Although rigorous clinical trials have reported the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological prevention with low, fixed doses of anticoagulant drugs, prophylaxis remains underused in patients admitted to hospital at moderate risk and high risk for venous thromboembolism. In this Seminar, we discuss pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis of the legs.

Chronic pulmonary embolism in the acute setting

The concept of acute on chronic pulmonary embolism is an entity that is increasingly recognized and important to look for in the acute setting. This concept emerged from studies in the CTEPH population. The International CTEPH registry demonstrated that up to 41% of the patients with CTEPH had a history of acute massive pulmonary embolism and 14% of them required thrombolysis. In a prospective clinical trial, Guérin et al. observed that 5% of the patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism had CTEPH at the time of the acute presentation and that evidence of chronic disease could frequently be detected on the index computed tomography (CT) in the acute setting.

A diagnosis of CTEPH should be suspected in the acute setting by the presence of long-standing shortness of breath, large clot burden on CT scan and evidence of pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram. These patients are frequently haemodynamically stable despite an impressive extent of thromboembolic material on the CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) due to the chronic adaptation of the right ventricle. The presence of mosaic lung attenuation, extensive bronchial circulation, organized clot on the wall of the pulmonary artery and evidence of webs and bands on CTPA in the context of an acute pulmonary embolism are highly suggestive of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease.

Evidence of underlying chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease is particularly important to identify if surgical embolectomy is contemplated, as removing the fresh thrombi only will leave the residual chronic disease in place with potentially major haemodynamic difficulty postoperatively, particularly if pulmonary hypertension is already established. PTE surgery is the preferred operation for these patients. Therefore, patients with evidence of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease should be transferred to centre with an expertise in PTE surgery either urgently in the presence of haemodynamic instability or during follow-up if they are stable. These patients will require further investigations to confirm the diagnosis of CTEPH. These investigations are generally conducted after 3 months of anticoagulation in haemodynamically stable patients to ensure that the acute component of the disease is resolved (Fig. 3).

Pulmonary embolism can be acutely life-threatening and is associated with long-term consequences such as recurrent venous thromboembolism and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. In 2020, the American Society of Hematology published updated guidelines on the management of patients with venous thromboembolism. Here, a hematologist and a cardiology and vascular medicine specialist discuss these guidelines in the context of the care of a patient with pulmonary embolism. They discuss advanced therapies such as catheter-directed thrombolysis in the short-term management of patients with intermediate-risk disease, recurrence risk stratification at presentation, and ideal antithrombotic regimens for patients whose pulmonary embolism was associated with a transient minor risk factor.

### Chronic complications of venous thromboembolism [^113gykfn]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disease (~700 per 100 000) that is associated with significant risk of recurrence, chronic complications, and substantial mortality, with reported death rates of up to 40% at 10 years. The development of novel anticoagulants has revolutionized the treatment of acute VTE, while strategies for prevention and treatment of chronic complications still seek for such a landmark change. Impaired thrombus resolution is the common denominator behind VTE complications, which are postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). PTS and CTEPH are associated with substantial morbidity and high healthcare expenses. While PTS occurs in up to 50% of patients after symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, only a small and poorly defined number of patients are diagnosed with CTEPH after pulmonary embolism. This review is a comprehensive summary of VTE-related chronic complications, their epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment.

Clinical Course of Patients With

Among 48 patients with CTEPH, 47 (97.9%) were diagnosed with CTEPH within 3 years after acute PE. The majority of patients underwent comprehensive follow‐up assessments, including blood tests, echocardiograms, pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy, and other diagnostic evaluations, at the initial institutions. The diagnosis of CTEPH was subsequently established within the same institutions. Two cases were referred to other institutions during the course and received follow‐up care there. The time intervals from the index acute PE to the referral were 195 days and 214 days, respectively. These 2 cases were subsequently referred back to the initial institutions due to a recurrence of dyspnea, leading to the diagnosis of CTEPH. Among the 48 cases, 24 cases had persistent dyspnea from index acute PE, while the remaining 24 cases experienced the recurrence or onset of dyspnea during the course. The duration from acute PE to the recurrence or onset of dyspnea was 109 [32–473] days. At the 3‐month mark from the index acute PE, 34 cases exhibited symptoms of dyspnea. Two patients had anticoagulation discontinued before the onset of CTEPH (214 days, 247 days). Two patients experienced recurrent VTE events before the onset of CTEPH. The 2 patients who experienced recurrent VTE events were different from the 2 patients for whom anticoagulation was discontinued. Balloon pulmonary angioplasty was performed in 26 cases, and pulmonary endarterectomy was performed in 3 cases. Seven of the total 48 patients with CTEPH died, but no death was directly related to CTEPH itself. The causes of death for the 7 patients with CTEPH were malignant disease in 4 cases, infection in 1 case, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 1 case, and unknown in 1 case. Overall survival rate of the patients who developed CTEPH after acute PE was 95.7% at 1 year, 93.5% at 2 years, 88.4% at 3 years, 85.0% at 4 years, 85.0% at 5 years, and 72.9% at 6 years (Figure S1).

### Evaluation and management of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension-consensus statement from the ISHLT [^116DHDtr]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) — maintaining a high index of suspicion is essential in patients with risk factors in the context of acute pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients with a new diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH), and in patients with unexplained dyspnea. Risk factors include CT findings suggestive of CTEPH, evidence of PH on echocardiogram, large clot burden, recurrent or unprovoked PE, history of splenectomy, infected pacemaker leads, chronic inflammatory disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, hypothyroidism, ventriculo-atrial shunt, and persistent symptoms despite anticoagulation. There is no indication to administer thrombolytic therapy to prevent CTEPH, and if CTEPH is suspected, screening investigations should be performed after 3 months of anticoagulation with echocardiogram and VQ scan, with earlier assessment if worrisome signs or symptoms of heart failure are present.

### Chronic management of pulmonary embolism in thromboangiitis obliterans [^113i9gxH]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), also known as Buerger's disease, is a rare small vessel vasculitis that is associated with an increased risk of arterial occlusion. Although venous thromboembolism has been described, the risk of its recurrence and the best long-term anticoagulation management is not known. Considering this, we would like to share our experience with two patients admitted to our hospital with recurrent pulmonary embolism and previous diagnosis of TAO, aiming to discuss the indication for indefinite anticoagulation in this population.

1 Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a critical medical condition characterized by the sudden blockage of a major blood vessel in the lung, usually caused by a blood clot. PE is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and its management is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The clinical presentation of PE can vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic cases to sudden death. The severity of PE is often categorized based on the patient's hemodynamic stability and the extent of the clot burden, leading to classifications such as sub‐massive and massive PE.

In sub‐massive pulmonary embolism (sPE), patients are hemodynamically stable but exhibit right ventricular dysfunction or myocardial necrosis. Acute intermediate‐risk PE, on the other hand, includes patients with signs of right ventricular dysfunction but without hypotension.

Exclusion or identification of right ventricular strain in hemodynamically stable patients with PE is a component of the risk stratification that directs additional therapy ("intermediate care", normal ward, outpatient treatment). Echocardiography can also identify significant concomitant conditions and help identify symptoms of a preexisting chronic cor pulmonale. Thus, even in patients with stable PE, echocardiography needs to be a standard technique, even though current recommendations do not require it.

The management of PE has evolved significantly over the years, with anticoagulation therapy being the cornerstone of treatment. Anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin help prevent further clot formation and facilitate clot resolution. However, anticoagulation alone may not be sufficient for all patients, particularly those with extensive clot burden or right ventricular dysfunction. In such cases, more aggressive interventions, including thrombolysis and catheter‐directed therapies, may be considered. Although prolonged treatment is related to a decreased chance of recurrence, it is also associated with a higher risk of bleeding. This is the reason why the length of oral anticoagulation is a more contentious argument. Oral anticoagulant medication should be administered for a minimum of 3 months to every patient. The selection of candidates for prolonged oral anticoagulation should be based on the stratification of the risk of recurrence, which has been estimated to be approximately 2.5% per year after PE associated with transient risk factors and 4.5% per year after PE occurring in the absence of transient risk factors or in patients with cancer or thrombophilia. This information ought to be taken into consideration when selecting candidates for prolonged oral anticoagulation.

Epidemiology and Pathophysiology

The aftermath of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) includes a spectrum of outcomes that range from full resolution of symptoms with complete restoration of normal perfusion to residual chronic obstruction that contributes to PH and persistent cardiopulmonary limitations. After acute PE, approximately 30% to 50% of patients will show abnormal perfusion scans after 6 months of anticoagulation. Of those patients, only 10% to 15% will proceed to demonstrate CTEPH. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease (CTEPD) without PH is an increasingly recognized entity on the spectrum of possible outcomes after PE and is characterized by the presence of persistent perfusion defects with associated symptoms, but no resting PH.

The true incidence of CTEPH is unknown, and current reported rates after PE range from 0.5% to 9%. This wide variability may reflect referral bias, study design, and screening strategies used, but in clinical practice, an incidence of approximately 3% is likely most relevant. The landmark study by Pengo et al, which followed up 223 patients prospectively after acute PE for up to 10 years, reported a CTEPH incidence of 3.1%. Similarly, a meta-analysis of 16 studies evaluating the incidence of CTEPH found the rate to be 3.2% in survivors of PE. Still, CTEPH likely remains underdiagnosed. An estimated 300,000 cases of acute PE occur annually in the United States. Even with conservative estimates of CTEPH, that would lead to approximately 1,500 to 3,000 new CTEPH cases per year, not including in those without a history of prior PE. However, considerably fewer CTEPH cases are being observed in the United States, with only about 0.9 pulmonary endarterectomies performed annually per 1 million adults.

### Challenging anticoagulation cases: a case of acute pulmonary embolism in a patient with chronic thrombocytopenia [^111D91TK]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

We present a case of acute pulmonary embolism in a patient with myelofibrosis and thrombocytopenia. The patient had a history of portal vein thrombosis and had taken warfarin for the past six years. At the time of his pulmonary embolism diagnosis, his INR was 1.5 and platelet count 58 × 10⁹/L. This article discusses how to balance the risk of thrombosis against the risk of bleeding, and reviews the options for pulmonary embolism treatment including transition to low-molecular-weight heparin, direct oral anticoagulants and/or inferior vena cava filters.

Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Some previous studies have suggested a high prevalence of pulmonary embolism (PE) during exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPD). The SLICE trial aims to assess the efficacy and safety of an active strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of PE (vs usual care) in patients hospitalized because of ECOPD.

Methods

SLICE is a phase III, prospective, international, multicenter, randomized, open‐label, and parallel‐group trial. A total of 746 patients hospitalized because of ECOPD will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either an active strategy for the diagnosis and anticoagulant treatment of PE or usual care (ie, standard care without any diagnostic test for diagnosing PE). The primary outcome is a composite of all‐cause death, non‐fatal (recurrent) venous thromboembolism (VTE), or readmission for ECOPD within 90 days after enrollment. Secondary outcomes are (a) death from any cause within 90 days after enrollment, (b) non‐fatal (recurrent) VTE within 90 days after enrollment, (c) readmission within 90 days after enrollment, and (d) length of hospital stay.

Results

Enrollment started in September 2014 and is expected to proceed until 2020. Median age of the first 443 patients was 71 years (interquartile range, 64‐78), and 26% were female.

Conclusions

This multicenter trial will determine the value of detecting PEs in patients with ECOPD. This has implications for COPD patient morbidity and mortality.

Trial registration number: NCT02238639.

### Prevalence of pulmonary embolism among patients with COPD hospitalized with acutely worsening respiratory symptoms [^115s3Vfe]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acutely worsening respiratory symptoms remains uncertain.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients with COPD admitted to the hospital for acutely worsening respiratory symptoms.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter cross-sectional study with prospective follow-up conducted in 7 French hospitals. A predefined pulmonary embolism diagnostic algorithm based on Geneva score, D-dimer levels, and spiral computed tomographic pulmonary angiography plus leg compression ultrasound was applied within 48 hours of admission; all patients had 3-month follow-up. Patients were recruited from January 2014 to May 2017 and the final date of follow-up was August 22, 2017.

Exposures

Acutely worsening respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was pulmonary embolism diagnosed within 48 hours of admission. Key secondary outcome was pulmonary embolism during a 3-month follow-up among patients deemed not to have venous thromboembolism at admission and who did not receive anticoagulant treatment. Other outcomes were venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism and/or deep vein thrombosis) at admission and during follow-up, and 3-month mortality, whether venous thromboembolism was clinically suspected or not.

Results

Among 740 included patients (mean age, 68.2 years [SD, 10.9 years]; 274 women [37.0%]), pulmonary embolism was confirmed within 48 hours of admission in 44 patients (5.9%; 95% CI, 4.5%-7.9%). Among the 670 patients deemed not to have venous thromboembolism at admission and who did not receive anticoagulation, pulmonary embolism occurred in 5 patients (0.7%; 95% CI, 0.3%-1.7%) during follow-up, including 3 deaths related to pulmonary embolism. The overall 3-month mortality rate was 6.8% (50 of 740; 95% CI, 5.2%-8.8%). The proportion of patients who died during follow-up was higher among those with venous thromboembolism at admission than the proportion of those without it at admission (14 [25.9%] of 54 patients vs 36 [5.2%] of 686; risk difference, 20.7%, 95% CI, 10.7%-33.8%; P < .001). The prevalence of venous thromboembolism was 11.7% (95% CI, 8.6%-15.9%) among patients in whom pulmonary embolism was suspected (n = 299) and was 4.3% (95% CI, 2.8%-6.6%) among those in whom pulmonary embolism was not suspected (n = 441).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admitted to the hospital with an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms, pulmonary embolism was detected in 5.9% of patients using a predefined diagnostic algorithm. Further research is needed to understand the possible role of systematic screening for pulmonary embolism in this patient population.

Figure 3
Kaplan‒Meier curves for the composite end point, all‐cause death, or recurrent venous thromboembolism, between patients treated with vs without extended anticoagulation.

The primary efficacy rates between patients treated with extended vs without extended anticoagulation were adjusted for age (per 10 years), weight < 60 kg, prior arterial hypertension, prior coronary artery disease, chronic lung disease, active cancer, systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg at admission, anemia at admission (ie, hemoglobin < 12 g/dL), thrombocythemia at admission (ie, platelet count < 150×10³/µL), renal dysfunction at admission (ie, estimated glomerular function calculated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation < 60 mL/min), and major bleeding events between index pulmonary embolism and 3 to 6 months (ie, initial phase) (see Table S4). HR indicates hazard ratio.

Adjusted rates of major or CRNMB were similar between the extended anticoagulant group and the no‐anticoagulant group (5.1% versus 5.0%, and 4.6% versus 3.0%, respectively) (Table 2). Unadjusted rates of the major bleeding were lower whatever the drug (ie, DOAC or VKA) or DOAC dose used, compared with those observed in the no‐anticoagulant group (Figure S2).

Data Collection and Definitions for Patient Characteristics and Anticoagulation Therapies

Data for patient characteristics were collected from hospital charts or hospital databases according to the prespecified definitions, using an electronic case report form in a web‐based database system. The physicians at each institution were responsible for data entry, and data were automatically checked for missing or contradictory input and values out of the expected range. Additional editing checks were performed at the general office of the registry.

The sPESI score consisted of several variables, including age > 80 years, history of cancer, history of chronic cardiopulmonary disease, heart rate of ≥ 110 bpm, systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg, and arterial oxygen saturation < 90% at the time of diagnosis. The original data of the sPESI score component were collected from hospital charts, and the sPESI score was recalculated by the current investigators. If these variables were not documented in the medical record, we assumed that there was no score component of the variable. Chronic cardiopulmonary disease included heart failure or chronic lung disease. Heart failure was diagnosed if the patient had a history of hospitalization for heart failure, if the patient had symptoms due to heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class ≥ 2), or if the left ventricular ejection fraction was < 40%. Chronic lung disease was defined as persistent lung disorders such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and restrictive lung diseases.

Initial parenteral anticoagulation therapy included heparin (single or continuous injection) and fondaparinux within 10 days after the diagnosis. Oral anticoagulation therapy included a vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) and DOACs. DOACs included dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Prolonged anticoagulation therapy was defined as oral or parenteral anticoagulation therapy (warfarin, DOACs, or heparin) that was continued beyond the acute phase of 10 days after the diagnosis. The detailed definitions of other patient characteristics are described in Data S2.

### Off-label use of direct oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin for left ventricular thrombi… [^1151JrVV]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Exposures Type and duration of anticoagulant use. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinically apparent SSE. Results. Written consent was waived owing to minimal patient risk. Oral consent was obtained at the time of the telephone interview. The median follow-up across the patient cohort was 351 days. Additional data on follow-up, including follow-up period and treatment duration, are included in eAppendix 1 in the Supplement. There was a total of 54 SSE events, consisting of 36 ischemic strokes and 18 systemic emboli. In this period, there was no statistical difference in the risk of SSE by oral anticoagulation. In the interval from 3 months to the end of follow-up, there were 22 SSE events among patients being treated with oral anticoagulation, including 10 events among patients being treated with warfarin and 12 events among patients being treated with a DOAC.

Anticoagulation with a DOAC vs warfarin during this period was associated with SSE on Cox proportional hazards regression. There were no events among patients being treated with oral anticoagulation between 3 and 6 months, such that the point estimates were unchanged using the European guideline–recommended 6-month time period as a landmark. In this analysis, there were 98 patients who discontinued therapy after completing at least 90 days of anticoagulation. Of these, 64 patients had follow-up associated with warfarin, and 34 patients had follow-up associated with a DOAC. We also performed an analysis censoring all events after 1 year. In the first year of follow-up, there were 15 SSE events among patients being treated with oral anticoagulation, including 6 events among patients being treated with warfarin and 9 events among patients being treated with a DOAC.

On univariable Cox proportional hazards regression, SSE was associated with anticoagulation with a DOAC vs warfarin.

PE

PE was reported in 4 DOAC, 6 VKA/LMWH, and 2 antiplatelet trials, with 8426 patients and a mean follow-up of 20 months. Overall, 136 of the 3797 patients (3.6%) assigned to discontinue treatment developed a PE event as opposed to 53 of 4629 patients (1.1%) assigned to continue treatment indefinitely (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.21–0.55; Figure 3). Anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy showed different effect estimates with a significant subgroup effect (P = 0.006). We therefore evaluated the certainty of the evidence for each subgroup. When compared with discontinuing treatment, indefinite anticoagulation therapy reduced nonfatal PE (RR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.16–0.41; ARR, 27 fewer per 1000 [95% CI, 30 fewer to 21 fewer] or 14 fewer per 1000 [95% CI, 16 fewer to 11 fewer] for patients with unprovoked VTE or VTE provoked by chronic risk factors, respectively; high certainty; Tables 5 and 6). When compared with discontinuing treatment, indefinite antiplatelet therapy probably reduce nonfatal PE (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.41–1.03; ARR, 13 fewer per 1000 [95% CI, 21 fewer to 1 more] or 7 fewer per 1000 [95% CI, 11 fewer to 1 more] for patients with unprovoked VTE or VTE provoked by chronic risk factors, respectively; moderate certainty; Tables 5 and 6).

The committee performed a systematic review seeking studies comparing indefinite versus shorter-duration anticoagulation in patients with SCD-related PH and VTE and did not identify relevant studies, and broadening to SCD (with or without PH) and VTE again found no relevant studies; therefore, they updated a published systematic review and identified four randomized trials from heterogeneous VTE populations.

### International clinical practice guideline Recommendations for acute Pulmonary embolism: harmony, dissonance, and silence [^115ZsUrY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite abundant clinical innovation and burgeoning scientific investigation, pulmonary embolism (PE) has continued to pose a diagnostic and management challenge worldwide. Aging populations, patients living with a mounting number of chronic medical conditions, particularly cancer, and increasingly prevalent health care disparities herald a growing burden of PE. In the meantime, navigating expanding strategies for immediate and long-term anticoagulation, as well as advanced therapies, including catheter-based interventions for patients with more severe PE, has become progressively daunting. Accordingly, clinicians frequently turn to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for diagnostic and management recommendations. However, numerous international guidelines, heterogeneity in recommendations, as well as areas of uncertainty or omission may leave the readers and clinicians without a clear management pathway. In this review of international PE guidelines, we highlight key areas of consistency, difference, and lack of recommendations (silence) with an emphasis on critical clinical and research needs.

; a comparable bleeding rate; a shorter half-life; and fixed dosing based on indication, drug interactions, and renal or hepatic function. Among the direct oral anticoagulants, there are key differences including the need for parenteral anticoagulation lead-in, once or twice per day dosing, and degree of renal excretion. Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation In patients who have had acute ischemic stroke, the prevalence of comorbid atrial fibrillation is increasing, and atrial fibrillation–associated strokes have a higher mortality rate. American Academy of Family Physicians guidelines recommend the use of oral anticoagulants with a CHADS 2 score higher than 1. 19 These guidelines also allow for anticoagulation in patients with a CHADS 2 score of 1 in certain circumstances.

19 The recently published American Heart Association /American College of Cardiology /Heart Rhythm Society guidelines recommend a direct oral anticoagulant over vitamin K antagonists, unless the patient has moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. 20 Anticoagulation is recommended for male patients with a CHA 2DS 2-VASc score of 2 or higher and female patients with a CHA 2DS 2-VASc score of 3 or higher. AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines, 20 and the recently published ACCP guidelines attempt to further specify recommendations for low-risk patients as defined by low CHA 2DS 2-VASc scores.
21. According to these recommendations, a CHA 2DS 2-VASc score as low as 1 for men and 2 for women warrants consideration for anticoagulation therapy. 21 Guidelines also recommend that if a therapeutic INR range of 2 to 3 cannot be attained more than 70% of the time, then consideration should be given to changing the treatment to a direct oral anticoagulant.

Management of Bleeding The ACC published an expert consensus decision pathway in 2017 on the management of bleeding for patients taking oral anticoagulants. 28 Management of bleeding for patients taking vitamin K antagonists depends on the severity of the bleed. For major bleeding (defined as all bleeds associated with hemodynamic compromise, occurring in an anatomically critical site, associated with a decrease of hemoglobin of 2 g per dL [.

### Direct oral anticoagulants vs warfarin for extended treatment of VTE… [^111hxFM8]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this cohort study of 18 495 adults with VTE who were prescribed anticoagulants for 6 or more months, DOAC treatment was associated with a lower risk of recurrent VTE. The risks for hospitalization for hemorrhage and all-cause death were not significantly different between patients taking DOACs vs warfarin. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of patients with VTE who continued warfarin or DOAC anticoagulation beyond 6 months, DOAC treatment was associated with a lower risk of recurrent VTE, supporting the use of DOACs for the extended treatment of VTE in terms of clinical outcomes. Venous thromboembolism is a common condition and a leading cause of sudden death. 1 The primary treatment of VTE entails administering anticoagulation therapy for a period of 3 to 6 months during the acute active phase of thrombosis.

2 Some patients may benefit from extending anticoagulation treatment duration beyond this initial treatment period, and current guidelines have recommended extended duration of anticoagulation treatment for selected patients, such as those with chronic persistent risk factors for VTE or if the VTE event occurred in the absence of a transient reversible risk factor. 2, 3. We defined continuous anticoagulant therapy as the period covered by consecutive dispensed anticoagulant prescriptions, which was based on the number of days of medication supplied, prescription end date, and dispensed refill dates. We allowed for gaps of no more than 14 days between consecutive DOAC prescriptions and 30 days between warfarin prescriptions. Determination of continuous warfarin exposure also incorporated outpatient testing of international normalized ratios, as described in a previously validated algorithm.

16 Permanent discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy was defined as occurring when there were 90 days or more without continuous anticoagulant exposure. Discontinuation of anticoagulation treatment was inferred once there was a period of 90 consecutive days without evidence of anticoagulant exposure. Although this approach is likely to be specific to discontinuation of treatment, our analysis could have included the outcomes of patients who discontinued anticoagulation for shorter periods of time. In addition, although nearly one-half of patients in our study continued anticoagulants for more than 1 year, our study did not have many patients who continued anticoagulants for multiple years.

### Duration of oral anticoagulation after PE… [^111K3k8z]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism who received 6 months of anticoagulant treatment, an additional 18 months of treatment with warfarin reduced the composite outcome of recurrent venous thrombosis and major bleeding compared with placebo. However, benefit was not maintained after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy. The primary outcome was the composite of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism and nonfatal or fatal major bleeding up to 18 months. This composite outcome and its components were also assessed during the entire study period. Median study treatment duration was 17. 5 months in the warfarin group and
17. 4 months in the placebo group.

Double-blind treatment was permanently discontinued for 38 warfarin-treated patients and for 49 placebo-treated patients who discontinued treatment. In the warfarin group, symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 25 patients, all in the absence of anticoagulation; 17 events were unprovoked, and 4 were fatal. In the placebo group, symptomatic recurrence occurred in 14 patients, all in the absence of anticoagulation; 10 events were unprovoked, and none were fatal. This result was driven by a reduction in the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism, the risk of bleeding increasing to a minimal extent.

However, this benefit of anticoagulation was lost after anticoagulation was discontinued. As previously described, 11–13 the risk of recurrence in the placebo group was greatest during the first 6 months after discontinuing anticoagulation and then increased linearly by 4% to 5% per year, whereas the risk of major bleeding during treatment with warfarin was low, increasing linearly by less than 2% per year.

Discussion

Patients with COVID-19 disease who have confirmed VTE should be started on full dose anticoagulation unless otherwise contraindicated. Current guidelines do not address treatment of patients with acute VTE in the setting of COVID-19. The current International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) guidelines do not address treatment of patients with acute VTE in the setting of COVID-19 disease. The guidelines from ISTH report the advantages of low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy when used as an inpatient and direct oral anticoagulants when used as an outpatient. Specific studies appear to show an improved prognosis in patients with COVID-19 who are treated with LMWH, possibly due to its anti-inflammatory effects. Heparinoids have previously demonstrated both anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, which may explain a benefit in patients with COVID-19. Despite these benefits associated with heparinoids, the patient's obesity made dosing difficult due to the distribution and metabolism of the drug. Also, lack of clear guidelines for treatment failure in the setting of COVID-19 leads to the decision to continue the patient on warfarin. Our patient had a negative hypercoagulable work-up following his second VTE. While our patient has several risk factors including obesity, history of previous PE and a history of a recent prolonged hospital course, he was adequately treated with evidence of therapeutic anticoagulation, which had kept him free from developing a PE for about 8 years prior to his presentation. We postulate that the recent COVID-19 infection had been the contributing risk factor given the present literature on COVID-19 and its association with hypercoagulable states. On presentation to our hospital, the patient's INR was 3.0. Despite this, his CTPE study demonstrated a large filling defect within the descending right main pulmonary artery consistent with thromboembolism. Our study further highlights the need for new therapeutic anticoagulation management and parameters in not only critically ill patients with COVID-19 disease but also in patients with COVID-19 disease and a history of previous thrombosis. A number of randomised control trials are ongoing to determine an optimal anticoagulation regimen in patients with COVID-19 disease.

Learning points

Recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) can occur in patients on therapeutic anticoagulation for a history of VTE after COVID-19 infection.
Clinical trials are ongoing to determine optimal anticoagulation strategies in patients with VTE in the setting of COVID-19.
Effective and safe modality of anticoagulation in obese patients with recent VTE and COVID-19 disease is yet to be developed.

### Pulmonary embolism [^1111SSxc]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is caused by emboli, which have originated from venous thrombi, travelling to and occluding the arteries of the lung. PE is the most dangerous form of venous thromboembolism, and undiagnosed or untreated PE can be fatal. Acute PE is associated with right ventricular dysfunction, which can lead to arrhythmia, haemodynamic collapse and shock. Furthermore, individuals who survive PE can develop post-PE syndrome, which is characterized by chronic thrombotic remains in the pulmonary arteries, persistent right ventricular dysfunction, decreased quality of life and/or chronic functional limitations. Several important improvements have been made in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of acute PE in recent years, such as the introduction of a simplified diagnostic algorithm for suspected PE as well as phase III trials demonstrating the value of direct oral anticoagulants in acute and extended treatment of venous thromboembolism. Future research should aim to address novel treatment options (for example, fibrinolysis enhancers) and improved methods for predicting long-term complications and defining optimal anticoagulant therapy parameters in individual patients, and to gain a greater understanding of post-PE syndrome.

### Is thrombolytic therapy effective for pulmonary embolism? [^112eQkFt]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a disorder that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Right-sided heart failure and recurrent pulmonary embolism are the main causes of death associated with pulmonary embolism in the first two weeks after the embolic event. Thrombolysis is a potentially lifesaving therapy when used in conjunction with standard anticoagulation. However, it has significant side effects and must therefore be used with caution. Indications for thrombolysis are not well defined and are thus controversial. The only current absolute indication is massive pulmonary embolism with hypotension. Other potential indications include right heart dysfunction, recurrent pulmonary embolism and the prevention of pulmonary hypertension. However, no evidence exists to show benefit of thrombolytic therapy over standard anticoagulation therapy for recurrent pulmonary embolism, mortality or chronic complications. Bleeding is the most common complication of thrombolysis and may be fatal.

### 2022 ESC / ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^1164Ewoe]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thrombo-embolic disease — screening and early detection specify for systemic sclerosis (SSc) that an annual evaluation of the risk of having PAH is recommended; in adult SSc with > 3 years' disease duration, an FVC ≥ 40% and a DLCO < 60%, the DETECT algorithm is recommended to identify asymptomatic PAH; and when breathlessness remains unexplained after non-invasive assessment, right heart catheterization (RHC) is recommended to exclude PAH. For chronic thrombo-embolic conditions, in patients with persistent or new-onset dyspnoea or exercise limitation following pulmonary embolism (PE), further diagnostic evaluation to assess for CTEPH/CTEPD is recommended, and for symptomatic patients with mismatched perfusion defects beyond 3 months of anticoagulation for acute PE, referral to a PH/CTEPH centre is recommended after considering echocardiography, BNP/NT-proBNP, and/or CPET. Other targeted screening measures state that counselling regarding the risk of PAH and annual screening are recommended in individuals who test positive for PAH-causing mutations and in first-degree relatives of patients with HPAH, and that in patients referred for liver transplantation, echocardiography is recommended as a screening test for PH.

### Extended anticoagulation after pulmonary embolism: a multicenter observational cohort analysis [^111iZSmW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our analysis suggests that extended oral anticoagulation over 2 and a half years after index PE, whether by VKA or DOAC, provides a net clinical benefit compared with no anticoagulation in patients selected by providers to receive extended anticoagulation, likely based on their bleeding risk profile. Sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results across all relevant subgroups, including high bleeding and thrombotic risk groups. Randomized clinical trials are warranted to explore the potential benefit of extended anticoagulation in patients with PE, especially those with transient provoking factors but residual risk.

### Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: anticoagulation and beyond [^1156hvq6]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a rare complication in pulmonary embolism (PE) survivors, characterized by chronic vascular occlusion and pulmonary hypertension. The identification and diagnosis of CTEPH requires a stepwise approach, starting with symptom evaluation, functional evaluation, screening imaging, and progressing to interventional hemodynamic assessment. On the backbone of anticoagulation, CTEPH management necessitates a multidisciplinary approach. Surgical pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) is the only potentially curative option. In nonoperable disease or residual disease after PTE, interventional balloon pulmonary angioplasty and/or pulmonary-vasodilator therapies can be offered, in collaboration with interventional and vascular pulmonary colleagues. As it is a disease that can cause high morbidity and mortality, CTEPH requires a high index of suspicion to diagnose and treat in patients following PE.

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^113cidmW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

### Epoprostenol (Veletri) [^115i4vHU]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Do not abruptly lower the dose or withdraw dosing. All dosing initiation and changes should be closely monitored. (5.2, 5.3)

5.1 Dose Initiation

VELETRI is a potent pulmonary and systemic vasodilator. Initiate VELETRI in a setting with adequate personnel and equipment for physiologic monitoring and emergency care. Dose initiation has been performed during right heart catheterization and without cardiac catheterization. During dose initiation, asymptomatic increases in pulmonary artery pressure coincident with increases in cardiac output occurred rarely. In such cases, consider dose reduction, but such an increase does not imply that chronic treatment is contraindicated.

5.2 Chronic Use and Dose Adjustment

During chronic use, deliver VELETRI continuously on an ambulatory basis through a permanent indwelling central venous catheter. Unless contraindicated, administer anticoagulant therapy to patients receiving VELETRI to reduce the risk of pulmonary thromboembolism or systemic embolism through a patent foramen ovale. To reduce the risk of infection, use aseptic technique in the reconstitution and administration of VELETRI and in routine catheter care. Because epoprostenol is metabolized rapidly, even brief interruptions in the delivery of VELETRI may result in symptoms associated with rebound pulmonary hypertension including dyspnea, dizziness, and asthenia. Intravenous therapy with VELETRI will likely be needed for prolonged periods, possibly years, so consider the patient's capacity to accept and care for a permanent intravenous catheter and infusion pump.

Based on clinical trials, the acute hemodynamic response (reduction in pulmonary artery resistance) to epoprostenol did not correlate well with improvement in exercise tolerance or survival during chronic use of epoprostenol. Adjust dosage of VELETRI during chronic use at the first sign of recurrence or worsening of symptoms attributable to pulmonary hypertension or the occurrence of adverse events associated with epoprostenol [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Following dosage adjustments, monitor standing and supine blood pressure and heart rate closely for several hours.

5.3 Withdrawal Effects

Abrupt withdrawal (including interruptions in drug delivery) or sudden large reductions in dosage of VELETRI may result in symptoms associated with rebound pulmonary hypertension, including dyspnea, dizziness, and asthenia. In clinical trials, one Class III primary pulmonary hypertension patient's death was judged attributable to the interruption of epoprostenol. Avoid abrupt withdrawal.

### Extended anticoagulation after pulmonary embolism: a multicenter observational cohort analysis [^113qHMzx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is becoming increasingly recognized as an important source of acute and chronic morbidity and mortality. Patients with incident PE carry a long‐lasting risk of recurrence, associated with long‐term complications. Patients with PE may develop chronic conditions including thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, post‐thrombotic syndrome if associated with deep vein thrombosis, post‐PE syndrome, which impairs long‐term clinical functional status, and acute arterial thrombotic events.,

Anticoagulation is the mainstay of PE treatment both in the in‐hospital treatment phase and after hospital discharge. The purpose of anticoagulant therapy is initially to prevent extension of thrombus, but also to prevent recurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and death. Following the acute treatment period of a minimum of 3 months, the aim of extended secondary anticoagulation is to prevent VTE recurrence over the long term. Overall, all direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) effectively reduce recurrent VTE by about 80% to 90%, with a persisting 2.0% to 6.0% risk for clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (CRNMB) in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The latest evidence‐based guidelines recommend that extended oral anticoagulation of indefinite duration should be considered for patients with PE with no identifiable risk factors or with a minor transient or reversible risk factor. Nevertheless, long‐term follow‐up data from unselected populations in daily clinical practice are needed to provide insights into the impact of extended anticoagulation after PE.

Using data from a French multicenter prospective nonrandomized registry, we report a comparison of clinical characteristics and outcomes between patients treated with 2‐year extended anticoagulation and those who were not, in a population who had completed 3 to 6 months of anticoagulant therapy after acute PE.

### Six months vs extended oral anticoagulation after a first episode of pulmonary embolism: the PADIS-PE randomized clinical trial [^111A5Y8X]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The optimal duration of anticoagulation after a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism is uncertain.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of an additional 18-month treatment with warfarin vs placebo, after an initial 6-month nonrandomized treatment period on a vitamin K antagonist.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind trial (treatment period, 18 months; median follow-up, 24 months); 371 adult patients who had experienced a first episode of symptomatic unprovoked pulmonary embolism (ie, with no major risk factor for thrombosis) and had been treated initially for 6 uninterrupted months with a vitamin K antagonist were randomized and followed up between July 2007 and September 2014 in 14 French centers.

Interventions

Warfarin or placebo for 18 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the composite of recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding at 18 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes were the composite at 42 months (treatment period plus 24-month follow-up), as well as each component of the composite, and death unrelated to pulmonary embolism or major bleeding, at 18 and 42 months.

Results

After randomization, 4 patients were lost to follow-up, all after month 18, and 1 withdrew due to an adverse event. During the 18-month treatment period, the primary outcome occurred in 6 of 184 patients (3.3%) in the warfarin group and in 25 of 187 (13.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.22; 95% CI, 0.09–0.55; p = 0.001). Recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 3 patients in the warfarin group and 25 patients in the placebo group (HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05–0.43); major bleeding occurred in 4 patients in the warfarin group and in 1 patient in the placebo group (HR, 3.96; 95% CI, 0.44 to 35.89). During the 42-month entire study period (including the study treatment and follow-up periods), the composite outcome occurred in 33 patients (20.8%) in the warfarin group and in 42 (24.0%) in the placebo group (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.47–1.18). Rates of recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and unrelated death did not differ between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism who received 6 months of anticoagulant treatment, an additional 18 months of treatment with warfarin reduced the composite outcome of recurrent venous thrombosis and major bleeding compared with placebo. However, benefit was not maintained after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy.

It is recommended that all patients with CTEPH receive assessment of operability and decisions regarding other treatment strategies made by a multidisciplinary team of experts, and surgical PEA in deep hypothermia circulatory arrest is recommended for patients with CTEPH. Interventional BPA may be considered in patients who are technically inoperable or carry an unfavourable risk:benefit ratio for PEA, while BPA is recommended in patients who are technically inoperable or have residual PH after PEA and distal obstructions amenable to BPA. Riociguat is recommended in symptomatic patients who have been classified as having persistent/recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment or inoperable CTEPH by a CTEPH team including at least one experienced PEA surgeon.

2.3 Randomization and trial interventions

In a patient with ECOPD who requires hospital admission, randomization should occur in the first 24 hours after admission. The trial uses a computer‐generated randomization scheme. Randomization is stratified by center and, within the centers, performed in blocks of 4 and 6 to ensure balanced distribution of the management groups. Randomization is performed centrally through the Internet, and management allocation is concealed from all investigators.

2.3.1 Intervention group

Patients in the intervention group have blood samples collected from an antecubital vein, and undergo D‐dimer testing within 12 hours after randomization. Cutoff levels for defining elevated D‐dimer are defined by the Department of Clinical Chemistry at each participating site. For patients with a negative D‐dimer, a diagnosis of PE is ruled out. For patients with a positive D‐dimer, a contrast‐enhanced, PE‐protocol, multidetector computerized tomography (CTPA) is performed. CTPA results are categorized as positive for PE if an intraluminal filling defect is seen in (sub)segmental or more proximal branches, and are considered negative if no filling defect is observed. Scans are considered technically inadequate only if main or lobar pulmonary vessels are not visualized. Although not mandatory, the protocol suggests the use of complete lower limb compression ultrasonography (CCUS) to detect concomitant deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for patients with isolated subsegmental PE.

If the diagnosis of PE is confirmed, patients receive anticoagulant treatment according to guideline recommendations: parenteral anticoagulation (ie, unfractionated heparin, low‐molecular‐weight heparin, or fondaparinux) overlapped and followed by vitamin K antagonists; or parenteral anticoagulation followed by dabigatran or edoxaban; or monotherapy with apixaban or rivaroxaban. 18

2.3.2 Control group

Patients in the control group undergo standard (ie, according to clinical practice guidelines) clinical management, 1, 8 as deemed appropriate by the attending physician.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^1116cPiy]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Follow-up after acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is important to assess recovery, consider the need for on-going anticoagulation and identify chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a rare but serious complication of PE. 16 dilemmas in the follow-up of acute PE were identified by a steering committee of four pulmonologists and a haematologist with interest in PE and/or CTEPH. Current literature was reviewed and a practical approach suggested based on expert consensus. Dilemmas discussed included: (1) how to manage a breathless patient; (2) what to do if CTEPH is suspected; (3) the difference between CTEPH and post-PE syndrome, (4) testing for thrombophilia, (5) when to investigate for cancer, (6) anticoagulation duration and dose, (7) approaches to discussions and decision-making with respect to anticoagulation, (8) use of aspirin and whether antiplatelet therapy should be stopped during anticoagulation and (9) advice for patients on discharge from hospital at 3 months and information for first-degree relatives. Given the occurrence of complications that may require assessment, follow-up of patients post-PE should be systematic and consider the individual needs of the patient.

### The incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension following a first episode of pulmonary embolism [^116JLhPb]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pulmonary embolism is the most serious complication of venous thromboembolism, with an elevated case/fatality rate. Patients who survived a first episode of pulmonary embolism should be evaluated for the risk of recurrence and of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).

Recent Findings

The risk of recurrence is higher in patients with unprovoked pulmonary embolism than in those with transient risk factors. Persistent risk factors, such as active cancer and antiphospholipid antibodies, are associated with high risk of recurrence. Recently, elevated D-dimer levels after discontinuation of therapy have been identified as a risk factor for recurrence. CTEPH is characterized by intravascular organization of emboli and occurs in 0.5–1% of cases. Some patients with CTEPH have impaired fibrinolysis, likely due to a structural abnormality of fibrin or fibrin clot. Echocardiography often reveals signs of pulmonary hypertension. This should be confirmed by direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressures at right heart catheterization.

Summary

CTEPH patients should receive life-long anticoagulation for preventing recurrent pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary endarterectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with proximal pulmonary vascular occlusion. Patients with predominantly distal pulmonary vascular occlusion are candidates for pharmacological treatment. All patients with unprovoked pulmonary embolism should be evaluated for long-term anticoagulation.

### Does the use of direct oral anticoagulants influence the incidence of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension after acute pulmonary embolism? [^116sxhzR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism can lead to serious, long‐lasting complications known as post–pulmonary embolism (PE) syndrome. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is the most severe type of post‐PE syndrome.CTEPH is associated with poor quality of life and a poor prognosis, especially if left untreated. Despite the lack of clarity regarding the underlying mechanism of CTEPH development following acute PE, it is widely accepted that it occurs due to inadequate resolution of the acute embolism. However, CTEPH can occur in patients without a history of acute PE, and the mechanism underlying its development remains poorly understood. Therefore, it is crucial to acquire more precise incidence data to detect CTEPH more effectively after acute PE.

Although the precise incidence of CTEPH after acute PE remains unclear, estimates vary significantly, ranging from 0.1% to 11.8%. These studies on the incidence of CTEPH after acute PE used vitamin K antagonists as acute anticoagulant therapy. Recently, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been widely used for the treatment of acute PE in place of vitamin K antagonists. However, the effect of DOACs on the development of CTEPH after acute PE has not been fully explored. The research article "Incidence of Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension After Pulmonary Embolism in the Era of Direct Oral Anticoagulants: From the COMMAND VTE Registry‐2" by Ikeda et al in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), added an intriguing finding to the detection of CTEPH after acute PE in the era of DOAC therapy. This study retrospectively enrolled and followed up 2787 patients with acute PE over a 3‐year period in expert centers for venous thromboembolic disease. The authors reported that the cumulative incidence of CTEPH 3 years after acute pulmonary embolism was 2.3%. This study provides data on the incidence of CTEPH after acute PE in the DOAC era, as > 80% of patients were treated with DOACs for acute PE. Furthermore, the study identified the possible risk factors for the development of CTEPH after acute PE in the era of DOAC therapy. This may also be useful for screening populations at high risk for CTEPH after acute PE in the DOAC era.

### Long-term incidence of death due to thromboembolic disease among patients with unprovoked pulmonary embolism [^1151XhNW]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize recent studies that have quantified the incidence of death due to late thromboembolic disease among patients initially diagnosed with acute unprovoked pulmonary embolism. These findings will aid clinicians who must weigh the risk versus the benefits of long-term anticoagulant therapy.

Recent Findings

The incidence of death due to fatal acute recurrent pulmonary embolism following 3–6 months of anticoagulant therapy is approximately 0.2–0.4% per year, depending in part on the presence or absence of chronic comorbidity. In addition, up to 1–3% of all patients with pulmonary embolism are diagnosed with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension within 3 years of the index event. Patients with acute pulmonary embolism who develop acute pulmonary hypertension greater than 50 mmHg that does not resolve in the first few weeks are at highest risk for progression, particularly if the event is recurrent pulmonary embolism.

Summary

The incidence of death due to recurrent pulmonary embolism or significantly debilitating or fatal thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in the first 3 years after anticoagulant treatment is discontinued is approximately 1–3%. In patients in whom the risk of fatal or disabling hemorrhage is lower, the benefits of chronic anticoagulation may outweigh the risks.

For a patient who has undergone CT imaging and has an incidental finding of chronic thromboembolism (webs and/or attenuated vessels), what should I do?

Strictly, CTEPD cannot be diagnosed until after 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation. If there is an incidental finding of chronic, organised, fibrotic clot and the patient presents with breathlessness, we would recommend therapeutic anticoagulation with reassessment after 3 months. The decision with respect to long-term anticoagulation should be made on an individual basisand consider the risk of PE recurrence, the previous history of PE (if any) and the burden of organised clot seen on CTPA against the risk of potential bleed.

Patients who remain symptomatic at 3 months require further assessment. The first step would usually be an echocardiogram. If there is an intermediate or high probability of PH, then referral to a PH centre is recommended. If there is a low probability of PH, a CPET looking for an abnormal pulmonary vascular response patternshould be considered, or, if unfit to perform CPET, the authors suggest echocardiogram surveillance after a year. NT-proBNP can also help to stratify likelihood of having significant PH. Where patients have a low echocardiographic probability of PH and breathlessness is likely due to other factors, it may not be necessary to perform any further assessment. In cases where the probability of PH is unclear, a follow-up echocardiogram after an interval may be helpful.

### Pulmonary embolism: update on management and controversies [^113CFVqY]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common and potentially fatal cardiovascular disorder that must be promptly diagnosed and treated. The diagnosis, risk assessment, and management of pulmonary embolism have evolved with a better understanding of efficient use of diagnostic and therapeutic options. The use of either clinical probability adjusted or age adjusted D-dimer interpretation has led to a reduction in diagnostic imaging to exclude pulmonary embolism. Direct oral anticoagulation therapies are safe, effective, and convenient treatments for most patients with acute venous thromboembolism, with a lower risk of bleeding than vitamin K antagonists. These oral therapeutic options have opened up opportunities for safe outpatient management of pulmonary embolism in selected patients. Recent clinical trials exploring the use of systemic thrombolysis in intermediate to high risk pulmonary embolism suggest that this therapy should be reserved for patients with evidence of hemodynamic compromise. The role of low dose systemic or catheter directed thrombolysis in other patient subgroups is uncertain. After a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, all patients should be assessed for risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism to guide duration of anticoagulation. Patients with a venous thromboembolism associated with a strong, transient, provoking risk factor can safely discontinue anticoagulation after three months of treatment. Patients with an ongoing strong risk factor, such as cancer, or unprovoked events are at increased risk of recurrent events and should be considered for extended treatment. The use of a risk prediction score can help to identify patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism who can benefit from extended duration therapy. Despite major advances in the management of pulmonary embolism, up to half of patients report chronic functional limitations. Such patients should be screened for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, but only a small proportion will have this as the explanation of their symptoms. In the remaining patients, future studies are needed to understand the pathophysiology and explore interventions to improve quality of life.

### Evaluation and management of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension-consensus statement from the ISHLT [^113c3R32]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) after acute pulmonary embolism — screening and timing states that CTEPH can mimic acute PE, so it is essential to keep a high index of suspicion; although there is currently no indication to routinely screen after an acute PE, follow-up imaging with echocardiogram and VQ scan is indicated in specific situations such as evidence of PH on echocardiogram, CT findings suggestive of CTEPH, large clot burden, recurrent PE, or persistent dyspnea despite clinical improvement, and the optimal moment to investigate is after 3 months of anticoagulation, with earlier work-up for highly symptomatic or deteriorating patients.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to indications for anticoagulation, ACCP 2016 guidelines recommend to consider monitoring clinically, rather than initiating anticoagulation, in patients with subsegmental PE, no involvement of more proximal pulmonary arteries, and no proximal DVT in the legs, and a low risk for recurrent VTE.

### Anticoagulation in venous thromboembolism in Behçet's syndrome: friend or foe? [^112AVdyf]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Behçet's syndrome (BS) is a multisystemic vasculitis characterised by venous and arterial thrombosis. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is very rare and is considered a phenomenon of in situ thrombosis rather than peripheral thrombus embolisation; chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is anecdotal. The EULAR-recommendations (EULAR-R) for the management of BS (2018) recommend glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) treatment, assuming DVT comes from vessel wall inflammation rather than hypercoagulability, based on a meta-analysis showing that the relapse risk did not decrease with anticoagulants. Anticoagulants are recommended only in refractory DVT, with caution and respect to bleeding risk.

We treated a patient in her 40s with a mucocutaneous, joint and ocular BS controlled with colchicine, 6-methyl-prednisolone, infliximab. In 2021, she developed intermediate-high mortality risk PE, with signs of undatable previous DVT in a leg. CT pulmonary angiography showed eccentric wall-adherent filling defects, intravascular webs and right ventricular hypertrophy. Although pulmonary CT angiograms can differentiate acute and chronic events, it is not possible to differentiate chronic pulmonary embolism from chronic in situ thrombosis of the pulmonary arteries. No major thrombophilic mutations were detected.

She took dabigatran 150 mg two times per day for 3 months with minimal perfusion enhancement (figure 1) and was then evaluated for CTEPH, corroborated by persistent dyspnoea New York Heart Association (NYHA) III, respiratory failure, high echocardiographic probability of pulmonary hypertension (PH), persistent multiple perfusion defects and forced flow areas at perfusion lung scan (figure 1). Right heart catheterisation confirmed a severe pre-capillary PH, showing mean pulmonary pressure (mPAP) of 40 mmHg, pulmonary vascular resistance of 7 Woods units and capillary wedge pressure of 7 mmHg. After a multidisciplinary consultation, she underwent pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA), achieving normalisation of mPAP (15 mmHg) and gas exchange and then she continued long-term anticoagulants without side effects. Clinically, she achieved a marked improvement in dyspnoea (NYHA I) and exercise tolerance (on 6-minute walking test after rehabilitation she walked nearly 20% more than baseline), remaining stable 2 years after PEA.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to choice of anticoagulation, ACCP 2016 guidelines recommend to consider dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban as long-term anticoagulant therapy, rather than VKA therapy, in patients with DVT of the leg or PE and no evidence of cancer.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^113TBBSg]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Physicians treating acute pulmonary embolism (PE) are faced with difficult management decisions while specific guidance from recent guidelines may be absent.

Methods

Fourteen clinical dilemmas were identified by physicians and haematologists with specific interests in acute and chronic PE. Current evidence was reviewed and a practical approach suggested.

Results

Management dilemmas discussed include: sub-massive PE, PE following recent stroke or surgery, thrombolysis dosing and use in cardiac arrest, surgical or catheter-based therapy, failure to respond to initial thrombolysis, PE in pregnancy, right atrial thrombus, role of caval filter insertion, incidental and sub-segmental PE, differentiating acute from chronic PE, early discharge and novel oral anticoagulants.

Conclusion

The suggested approaches are based on a review of the available evidence and guidelines and on our clinical experience. Management in an individual patient requires clinical assessment of risks and benefits and also depends on local availability of therapeutic interventions.

Adjunct therapies in COPD exacerbations — thromboembolism risk and preventive care: Depending on the clinical condition, fluid balance, diuretics when clinically indicated, anticoagulants, treatment of comorbidities and nutritional aspects should be considered. Among COPD patients hospitalized with a suspected exacerbation, up to 5.9% were found to have pulmonary embolism, and hospitalized patients with COPD are at an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and prophylactic measures for thromboembolism should be instituted. At all times, healthcare providers should strongly enforce the need for smoking cessation.

### An authoritative algorithm most appropriate for the prediction of pulmonary embolism in patients with AECOPD [^116sk1U4]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide that induces a substantially and increasingly economic and social burden. The acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third most frequent acute cardiovascular syndrome behind myocardial infarction and stroke globally. Among patients who die of PE, 34% died suddenly before therapy could be initiated or take effect, 59% was diagnosed after death and only 7% were correctly diagnosed with PE before death. PE that has an explicit indication for anticoagulant treatment is frequently encountered in AECOPD. If it happens, PE is significantly associated with increased mortality and length of hospital stay in patients with AECOPD. Consequently, PE should be ruled out when a patient with COPD has an acute exacerbation.

Chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary disease (CTEPD) definition and terminology — CTEPD describes symptomatic patients with mismatched perfusion defects on V/Q scan and signs of chronic organized, fibrotic clots on CTPA or DSA (such as ring-like stenoses, webs/slits, and chronic total occlusions [pouch lesions or tapered lesions]) after at least 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation; pulmonary hypertension in this setting is not only a consequence of pulmonary artery obstruction by organized fibrotic clots but can also be related to the associated microvasculopathy; in patients without PH at rest, breathlessness could be due to exercise PH and/or increased dead space ventilation; excluding ventilatory limitation, deconditioning and psychogenic hyperventilation syndrome by CPET and left ventricular myocardial or valvular disease by echocardiography is of utmost importance when making therapeutic decisions in patients with CTEPD without PH; patients are considered to have CTEPD without or with PH, and CTEPH remains the preferred term for patients with PH; because chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension is a common and important cause of PH, the possibility of CTEPH should be carefully considered in all patients with PH.
