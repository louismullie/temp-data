## Question

Can lisinopril lower the glomerular filtration rate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether lisinopril can lower the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about lisinopril's pharmacology and the renal hemodynamics it alters. Then, I should verify the expected acute changes in GFR after initiation and their typical magnitude. Next, I will review thresholds that trigger concern, monitoring strategy, and high‑risk clinical scenarios. After that, I should examine longer‑term renal outcomes with continued therapy. Finally, I will synthesize these pieces to answer the question and provide practical guidance with caveats, referencing current guidelines and robust evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism so I don't jump to conclusions: lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor that reduces angiotensin II generation, leading to preferential efferent arteriolar vasodilation, which lowers intraglomerular capillary pressure and thereby reduces filtration pressure, so yes, a hemodynamic reduction in GFR is physiologically expected at initiation, and I should verify that this effect is typically functional rather than structural injury [^1138Jv3a] [^115BBeWB] [^114Eitoo].

> Wait, let me verify the acute effect size and timing: with ACE inhibitor initiation, an early, reversible dip in GFR is common, generally manifesting as a rise in serum creatinine that is often up to about 30% and then stabilizes if volume status and renal perfusion are adequate, which has been described as a functional change and even a biomeasure of effective renin‑angiotensin system blockade rather than parenchymal damage [^114Eitoo] [^1114TB9M] [^114VkkrB].

> Hold on, I should confirm the boundaries beyond which I should be concerned and who is at risk: a creatinine rise exceeding about 30% from baseline or a substantial eGFR fall merits reassessment for contributing factors such as volume depletion, diuretic overuse, NSAIDs, or renovascular disease, with consideration of dose reduction or temporary discontinuation if the abnormality persists, and this risk becomes more pronounced in settings like bilateral renal artery stenosis, advanced CKD, or combined use with diuretics where hemodynamic stressors compound the effect, so careful monitoring in the first 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose uptitration is prudent [^116fN4cF] [^1114TB9M] [^1179yinj] [^114VkkrB].

> Let me consider the long‑term trajectory because an early dip is not the whole story: over months to years, ACE inhibitors like lisinopril reduce intraglomerular hypertension and proteinuria and slow the progressive decline in GFR, with consistent evidence in diabetic and non‑diabetic CKD, including meta‑analytic data and trials in advanced CKD showing lower risk of kidney failure with replacement therapy when ACEi/ARB are initiated and no renal benefit to withdrawing therapy in advanced disease, which reassures me that the early functional dip does not equate to long‑term harm and is usually renoprotective overall [^113uVeP1] [^115cpPxP] [^111u4bWf] [^111u4bWf].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should integrate the acute and chronic effects so the clinical message is clear: the early GFR reduction reflects efferent vasodilation and lower intraglomerular pressure, and while it can look like "worsening renal function", in most patients it is a reversible, functional change that predicts long‑term benefit in slowing CKD progression, so the key is to distinguish a safe, modest dip from an excessive or progressive decline that signals a problem needing intervention [^114Eitoo] [^111u4bWf].

> I need to ensure the practical steps are concrete: check serum creatinine and potassium about 1–2 weeks after starting lisinopril and after each dose increase, maintain volume status, review concomitant nephroactive drugs, and if creatinine rises more than about 30% or potassium is dangerously high, reassess and consider dose adjustment or temporary cessation; in severe CKD, start at lower doses, for example lisinopril 2.5 mg daily when creatinine clearance is below 10 mL/min, and avoid fixed‑dose lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combinations when eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², favoring single‑agent ACEi titrated to the highest tolerated dose to capture renoprotective benefit while mitigating risk [^1179yinj] [^115VhSvD] [^111ZuRpN] [^notfound] [^111YfX3u].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a diuretic or has renovascular disease, could I be misattributing the decline to lisinopril alone? I should double‑check for volume depletion, concurrent diuretic‑induced prerenal azotemia, or bilateral renal artery stenosis, because these settings amplify the hemodynamic drop and can precipitate more marked GFR reductions; label guidance and observational data emphasize reversibility upon correcting precipitating factors or stopping the ACE inhibitor when true renovascular compromise is present [^1179yinj] [^1114TB9M].

> Final synthesis, and let me be precise so there is no ambiguity: yes, lisinopril can lower GFR acutely via efferent arteriolar vasodilation, typically a modest, reversible dip that corresponds to an up to 30% creatinine rise and indicates the intended hemodynamic effect, whereas with sustained therapy ACE inhibition generally preserves kidney function by reducing proteinuria and slowing GFR decline; the clinician's task is to monitor early, differentiate a safe functional dip from excessive decline, and adjust therapy when thresholds are exceeded or high‑risk features emerge [^114Eitoo] [^1114TB9M] [^114VkkrB] [^113uVeP1] [^115cpPxP] [^111u4bWf].

---

Yes, lisinopril causes a **modest, early GFR decline** (typically ≤ 20–30%) [^114VkkrB] due to efferent arteriolar vasodilation [^114Eitoo] and lower intraglomerular pressure [^1138Jv3a] [^1114TB9M]. This hemodynamic effect is usually **transient and stabilizes** within weeks [^116fN4cF], with long-term therapy slowing CKD progression and reducing proteinuria [^113uVeP1] [^115BBeWB] [^111u4bWf]. Larger or persistent **declines (> 30%)** [^114VkkrB] warrant evaluation for volume depletion, NSAID use, or renal artery stenosis [^116fN4cF], and may require dose adjustment or discontinuation [^111jWzdo] [^116vhKos].

---

## Mechanism of lisinopril-induced GFR changes

Lisinopril inhibits ACE, reducing angiotensin II [^114Eitoo], leading to **efferent arteriolar vasodilation** that lowers intraglomerular pressure and GFR [^1138Jv3a]. This **hemodynamic effect** is typically transient and stabilizes within weeks [^116fN4cF].

---

## Clinical evidence of GFR changes with lisinopril

Clinical studies show a **modest, early GFR decline** with lisinopril (usually ≤ 20–30%) [^114VkkrB] that stabilizes thereafter [^1138Jv3a] [^114Eitoo]. This initial drop **predicts benefit** and is not associated with long-term harm [^114Eitoo] [^111u4bWf].

---

## Long-term effects on renal function

Long-term, lisinopril slows CKD progression, reduces proteinuria, and lowers ESRD risk, especially in diabetic nephropathy [^113uVeP1] [^111u4bWf]. These **renoprotective effects** are independent of blood pressure reduction [^115BBeWB] [^111u4bWf].

---

## Clinical significance and management

The initial GFR decline is **usually clinically insignificant** and stabilizes with continued therapy [^116fN4cF]. Larger or persistent declines (> 30%) [^114VkkrB] should prompt evaluation for volume depletion, NSAID use, or renal artery stenosis [^116fN4cF], and may require dose adjustment or discontinuation [^111jWzdo] [^116vhKos].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain patients are at **higher risk** of a significant GFR decline with lisinopril:

- **Renal artery stenosis**: Especially bilateral or in a solitary kidney [^1179yinj] [^116fN4cF].
- **Severe heart failure**: Renal function may depend on RAAS activity [^1179yinj].
- **Advanced CKD**: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m².
- **Other factors**: Volume depletion and concomitant NSAID use.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend **monitoring renal function and electrolytes** after initiating or adjusting lisinopril. Dose reduction or discontinuation is advised if **symptomatic hypotension**, **uncontrolled hyperkalemia**, or **significant renal impairment** occurs [^116vhKos].

---

## Summary table: effects of lisinopril on GFR

| **Effect** | **Clinical significance** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial GFR decline (≤ 20–30%) [^114VkkrB] | Usually transient and stabilizes [^1138Jv3a] | Continue therapy; monitor renal function |
| Persistent or large decline (> 30%) | Clinically significant [^116fN4cF] | Evaluate causes; adjust dose or discontinue [^116vhKos] |
| Long-term effect [^113uVeP1] | Slows CKD progression; reduces proteinuria [^111u4bWf] | Continue therapy; monitor regularly [^111jWzdo] |

---

Lisinopril causes a **modest, early GFR decline** [^1138Jv3a] that is usually transient and stabilizes [^116fN4cF], while long-term therapy slows CKD progression and reduces proteinuria [^113uVeP1]. Persistent or large declines should be evaluated and managed appropriately [^111jWzdo].

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to RAAS inhibitors, ACEis/ARBs, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend considering a reduction in the dose or discontinuation of ACEi or ARB in cases of symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment. These recommendations also apply to reducing uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure when the eGFR is less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Comparative effectiveness of renin-angiotensin system blockers and other antihypertensive drugs in patients with diabetes: Systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis [^115BBeWB]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Previous studies showed that ACE inhibitors block the renin-angiotensin system, decrease glomerular capillary pressure by inducing vasodilation of efferent arterioles, reduce the level of albuminuria, slow the progression of chronic kidney disease, and lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, the results of clinical trials and meta-analyses suggest that ACE inhibitors provide renoprotective effects in diabetic nephropathy above and beyond any such effect attributable to a reduction in blood pressure. This may be caused by the non-haemodynamic antiproteinuric effects of ACE inhibitors, such as enhanced selectivity of the glomerular barrier, compensatory growth of residual nephrons, and the limitation of interstitial inflammation and fibrosis.

As a group of pharmaceuticals that modulate the renin-angiotensin system, ARBs selectively block the activation of angiotensin II AT1 receptors and are considered to have similar cardioprotective and renoprotective effects as ACE inhibitors. Although guidelines suggest the equivalent protective effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs for hypertensive patients with diabetes, some of the guidelines prefer ACE inhibitors as the first-line treatment on the grounds of cost. They suggest that ARBs should be substituted mainly under the condition of intolerance to ACE inhibitors or when a low-cost generic ARB is available. Because of AT1 blockade, ARBs upregulate the AT2 receptors; however, some recent studies suggest that the overstimulation of AT2 receptors may be less beneficial than previously proposed and might even contribute.

When should RAAS blockade be stopped?

Use of RAAS-blocking drugs in early pregnancy has been associated with harm to the fetus, including cardiovascular, neurological, and renal malformations, although more recent surveys do not suggest that there is a high risk of these problems occurring. Pregnancy is associated with a high risk of progression of diabetic nephropathy in people with type 1 diabetes, and the benefits of RAAS blockade in such individuals may outweigh the risks. However, advice is that RAAS-blocking drugs should be stopped when pregnancy is confirmed, and indeed, when pregnancy is planned.

Drugs that block the RAAS reduce intraglomerular pressure and may lead to a rise in serum creatinine of up to 30%, which should then stabilize. Some studies suggest that clinically significant renal artery stenosis may be quite common among people with diabetes, especially those with type 2 diabetes. While the use of drugs that modulate the RAAS may increase the risk of deterioration in renal function in people with renovascular disease, in practice, such deterioration is rare.

RAAS blockade can lead to hyperkalemia, which may be managed by dietary methods, diuretics, or use of sodium bicarbonate. However, if the hyperkalemia is severe and refractory to these measures, RAAS blockade may need to be stopped or reduced, but this needs to be balanced with the loss of the benefits of proteinuria reduction and retardation of GFR decline. A further possible clinical scenario is someone with type 1 diabetes having deteriorating renal function despite having well-controlled blood glucose levels.

Guidelines suggest that adults with diabetes and kidney disease receive treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2006.

- **Objectives**: We compared the efficacy and safety of ACEi and ARB therapy (either as monotherapy or in combination) on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in adults with diabetes and kidney disease.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplants Register of Studies up to 17 March 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies evaluating ACEi or ARB alone or in combination, compared to each other, placebo, or no treatment in people with diabetes and kidney disease.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

- **Main results**: One hundred and nine studies (28,341 participants) were included in the analysis.

### Acute fall in glomerular filtration rate with renin-angiotensin system inhibition: A biomeasure of therapeutic success [^114Eitoo]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) acutely declines with the introduction of renin-angiotensin system inhibition. This response is functional, not anatomical, and varies with volume status. The reduction in GFR with renin-angiotensin system inhibition may serve as a biomeasure of future therapeutic benefit.

### Effect of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and other antihypertensive drugs on renal outcomes: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113diAfM]. Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

A consensus has emerged that angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) have specific renoprotective effects. Guidelines specify that these are the drugs of choice for the treatment of hypertension in patients with renal disease. We sought to determine to what extent this consensus is supported by the available evidence.

- **Methods**: Electronic databases were searched up to January 2005 for randomized trials assessing antihypertensive drugs and the progression of renal disease. Effects on primary discrete endpoints (doubling of creatinine and end-stage renal disease) and secondary continuous markers of renal outcomes (creatinine, albuminuria, and glomerular filtration rate) were calculated with random-effect models. The effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in placebo-controlled trials were compared with the effects seen in trials that used an active comparator drug.

- **Findings**: Comparisons of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with other antihypertensive drugs yielded a relative risk of 0.71 (95% CI 0.49–1.04) for doubling of creatinine and a small benefit on end-stage renal disease (relative risk 0.87, 0.75–0.99). Analyses of the results by study size showed a smaller benefit in large studies. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, no benefit was seen in comparative trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs on the doubling of creatinine (1.09, 0.55–2.15), end-stage renal disease (0.89, 0.74–1.07), glomerular filtration rate, or creatinine amounts. Placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs showed greater benefits than comparative trials.

### Updates for cardio-kidney protective effects by angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor: Requirement for additional evidence of kidney protection [^113nHbh4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

For CKD patients with advanced GFR decline or high albuminuria, ARNIs did not exert a stronger renoprotective effect than ARBs, although the results suggested a possible cardioprotective effect. In post hoc analysis of the PARADIGM‐HF trial, ARNI had no cardiorenal protective effect versus enalapril in patients with HF and albuminuria. There is insufficient evidence in RCTs for some patient populations. For example, the renal impact of ARNIs in patients without HF and albuminuria and with reduced GFR (e.g. nephrosclerosis) is unclear. In addition, ARNIs did not have different renoprotective effects than RAS‐Is in patients with HF and albuminuria; it should be noted that the number of eligible patients was small (N = 441). Furthermore, patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² were excluded in the PARADIGM‐HF and PARAGON‐HF trials, which showed positive effects of ARNIs on the heart and kidneys. Consequently, the cardiorenal protective effects of ARNIs in patients with HF and severe renal dysfunction or overt albuminuria are unclear.

### Zestoretic [^1179yinj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Lisinopril is a medication that requires careful administration in several specific conditions:

- **Aortic stenosis/hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**: As with all vasodilators, lisinopril should be administered with caution to patients with obstruction in the outflow tract of the left ventricle.

- **Impaired renal function**: Inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system can lead to changes in renal function for susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure, where renal function may rely on this system's activity, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril, can be associated with oliguria, progressive azotemia, and in rare cases, acute renal failure and/or death.

	- In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril and/or diuretic therapy. Renal function should be monitored during the first weeks of therapy for such patients.

	- Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, particularly when lisinopril is administered concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, and dosage reduction of lisinopril and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be necessary.

### Are two better than one? Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors plus angiotensin receptor blockers for reducing blood pressure and proteinuria in kidney disease [^113YzA3U]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers each reduce proteinuria and blood pressure. Several studies have compared the antiproteinuric and antihypertensive effects of combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers with those of therapy with either drug class alone. This article reviews those trials as well as evidence suggesting a mechanism for the benefits observed with combination therapy.

### Zestoretic [^114qHuXU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Lisinopril monotherapy is an effective treatment for hypertension when administered in once-daily doses ranging from 10 mg to 80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy is effective at daily doses of 12.5 mg to 50 mg. In clinical trials of lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy, using lisinopril doses from 10 mg to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses from 6.25 mg to 50 mg, antihypertensive response rates generally increased with higher doses of either component.

The side effects of lisinopril (see warnings) are generally rare and apparently independent of dose. For hydrochlorothiazide, side effects are a mix of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g. pancreatitis), with the former being much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide may result in either or both dose-independent or dose-dependent side effects, but the addition of lisinopril in clinical trials has been shown to blunt the hypokalemia commonly associated with diuretics.

To minimize dose-dependent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only following a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.

- **Dose titration guided by clinical effect**: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril/HCTZ 10/12.5 or lisinopril/HCTZ 20/12.5, depending on the monotherapy dose. Further increases of either or both components should depend on the clinical response, with blood pressure measured accordingly.

### Combination ACEI and ARB therapy: Additional benefit in renoprotection [^112J3CXn]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

The fact that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers antagonize the renin-angiotensin system at different levels suggests that these agents, each of confirmed clinical benefit in retarding the progression of chronic renal disease, may have additive effects that result in even greater renoprotection when used in combination. In light of the persisting need for treatments that afford more effective renoprotection, this special commentary examines available experimental and clinical evidence in support of this hypothesis.

- **Recent findings**: Experimental studies at the time of writing have failed to distinguish clearly between the additive antihypertensive effects of combination therapy and additive intrinsic renoprotective effects. Clinical studies, albeit with relatively small patient numbers and short follow-up periods, have shown that combination therapy results in greater antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects than monotherapy in diabetic nephropathy and non-diabetic forms of chronic renal disease.

- **Summary**: At present, we recommend the addition of angiotensin receptor blocker therapy in patients with continued hypertension or proteinuria despite angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Further long-term studies are required to evaluate more fully the renoprotective potential of this combination.

### Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial [^113SNcaS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). High credibility.

This study investigates whether discontinuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or their combination in patients with advanced (Stage 4 or 5) progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) can lead to stabilization or improvement in renal function over a 3-year follow-up period. This strategy is explored under the condition that good blood pressure (BP) control is maintained with other agents. The outcomes are compared with the strategy of continuing the use of ACEi and/or ARB.

### Aliskiren: A novel renoprotective agent or simply an alternative to ACE inhibitors [^115xbstP]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common condition that is increasing in prevalence in developed nations. The economic and psychosocial costs of CKD are considerable and are associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Specific treatments do not exist for many causes of CKD. Therefore, treatment relies on the introduction of therapies that retard the progression of structural renal damage and renal impairment.

At present, aside from the judicious use of antihypertensive agents to lower blood pressure, and possibly low-protein diets and statin therapy, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are the only widely available treatments. Although these measures attenuate the inexorable progression to renal failure, they do not halt it. One limiting factor may be feedback effects of ACEis and ARBs, such as increased plasma renin activity.

Aliskiren is a newer agent that inhibits renin, the rate-limiting step in the RAAS. There are several theoretical reasons to suggest that aliskiren may have renoprotective actions superior to those of ACEis and ARBs. In this paper, the available evidence regarding the renoprotective effects of aliskiren is reviewed, with an emphasis on comparison with ACEis and ARBs.

### Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial [^113f7xbE]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

The rigor of some of these studies, which failed to dissociate renoprotective from antihypertensive effects of ACEi/ARBs, is now being questioned. Renoprotection from ACEi/ARB may be lost in more advanced disease where significant ischemic nephropathy is present. This hypothesis is supported by reports in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with CKD indicating that ACEi/ARBs may accelerate renal progression, in spite of a beneficial anti-proteinuric effect. Combined ACEi/ARB treatment has been shown to worsen renal outcomes in patients at high cardiovascular risk and increase the risk of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. The Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE-intolerant subjects with cardiovascular disease (TRANSCEND) demonstrated both a greater decline in eGFR and a greater incidence of doubling of serum creatinine on Telmisartan (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.04–2.41).

In a recent observational study, withdrawal of ACEi/ARB therapy in 52 older patients with advanced CKD led to a mean increase in eGFR of 10 mL/min/1.73 m² over 12 months and an increase or stabilization in eGFR in all but four patients. There was a small increase in BP but no change in the risk of cardiovascular events. There was also an association between the increase in BP levels upon discontinuation of ACEi/ARB and improved renal function. The close interaction of the kidney and the heart is critical to survival, and the risk factors for poor cardiovascular outcomes in the general population and in early CKD are associated with better outcomes in advanced CKD.

### Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: The ultimate treatment for renal protection [^113g4qSq]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

The prevalence of chronic renal diseases is increasing worldwide. There is a great need to identify therapies that arrest disease progression to end-stage renal failure. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists is probably the best therapeutic option available. Several large, multicenter studies have shown a significant reduction in the risk for doubling baseline serum creatinine or progression toward end-stage renal failure in patients with and without diabetes, who have chronic nephropathies and are treated with these inhibitors or antagonists. However, the number of patients reaching end-stage renal failure is still considerably high. A significant reduction in the incidence of ESRD is likely to be achieved in the near future for chronic nephropathies if the degree of renoprotection can be improved. This goal may be attainable with a more complex strategy than a single or dual pharmacologic intervention on the renin-angiotensin system. Strict control of blood pressure and protein excretion rate, lowering of blood lipids, tight glucose control for individuals with diabetes, and lifestyle changes will form part of a future multimodal protocol for the treatment of patients with chronic nephropathies.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, specifically with respect to RAAS inhibitors (ACEis/ARBs), KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend initiating renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (ACEi or ARB) in patients with CKD and severely increased albuminuria (G1-G4, A3) without diabetes.

### Effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on cardiovascular events and residual renal function in dialysis patients: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114RaVVP]. BMC Nephrology (2017). High credibility.

Subgroup analysis showed that ARB (angiotensin receptor blockers) clearly reduced the risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs), including heart failure, suggesting ARB use may still confer benefits to these individuals. The effectiveness of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and ARB in reducing heart failure was assessed in four studies, two of which were negative. Thus, whether ARB is superior to ACEi in reducing cardiovascular event rates couldn't be conclusively determined. So far, only one head-to-head study comparing the effect of ARB and ACEi did not find ARB to be preferred in dialysis patients at high risk of CVEs; however, the sample size was relatively small. Also, the large study of Fosinopril in Dialysis (FOSIDIAL), which evaluated the effect of ACEi on CVEs, included nearly 400 patients on hemodialysis with a relatively higher prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline in the ACEi group compared with the control group. There was not a significant reduction of CVEs risk by fosinopril detected in the FOSIDIAL study. Therefore, studies with large samples are strongly recommended to confirm the effect of ACEi or ARB on cardiovascular events.

This large and comprehensive meta-analysis in people undergoing dialysis has confirmed the residual renal function protective effects of RAS inhibitors, especially in patients with peritoneal dialysis. Evidence from Lavoie et al. shows that ARB plays an important role in the amelioration of the development of fibrosis and the increase of peritoneal transport in PD (peritoneal dialysis) patients, which is in line with reports from some individual studies. Of note, these results are mainly driven by the studies with PD patients.

### Using mendelian randomization study to assess the renal effects of antihypertensive drugs [^111oHDPt]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a leading contributor to global years of life lost because of its role in cardiovascular disease. It is also a key risk factor for impaired kidney function, which might be affected by kidney function. Different classes of antihypertensive drugs, acting via different targets, may have different renal effects. Most guidelines recommend the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as the first-line antihypertensive therapy for the treatment of hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines also advocate the combination of an ACE inhibitor with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) as the first-line therapy in patients with proteinuria.

In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), treatment with ACE inhibitors can slow down the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the progression to end-stage renal failure, independent of the reduction in blood pressure. Network meta-analysis of RCTs comparing different classes of antihypertensives suggests that the ACE inhibitor-CCB combination therapy is the most efficacious treatment in reducing albuminuria in patients with diabetes and microalbuminuric kidney disease. However, whether the findings can be generalized to people without these comorbidities is unclear. Given the limited number of often small-scale RCTs, evidence may not be sufficient to support the use of ACE inhibitors as the first-line antihypertensive drug. Evidence from large RCTs comprehensively comparing the effects of various antihypertensive drugs is needed.

### Diverse effects of increasing lisinopril doses on lipid abnormalities in chronic nephropathies [^111TSr9s]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia frequently complicates chronic nephropathies and increases the risk of renal and cardiovascular events. This might be ameliorated by drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which effectively reduce proteinuria.

- **Methods and results**: In this longitudinal study, we evaluated the extent to which uptitration of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril to maximum tolerated doses (median [range]: 30 [10 to 40] mg/d) ameliorated proteinuria and dyslipidemia in 28 patients with nondiabetic chronic nephropathies. Maximum lisinopril doses significantly and safely reduced proteinuria, serum total, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides without substantially affecting serum HDL and renal hemodynamics. Proteinuria already decreased at 10 mg/d. Serum lipids progressively and dose-dependently decreased during uptitration to maximum doses. Reduction in total and LDL cholesterol correlated with increases in serum albumin/total protein concentration and oncotic pressure, peaked at lisinopril maximum doses, and persisted after treatment withdrawal.

Despite less proteinuria reduction, hypercholesterolemia decreased more (and reflected the increase in serum albumin) in hypoalbuminemic than in normoalbuminemic patients who, despite more proteinuria reduction, had less decrease in cholesterol and no changes in serum albumin. Changes in serum triglycerides were independent of changes in serum proteins, were strongly correlated with lisinopril doses (r = -0.89, P = 0.003), and recovered promptly after treatment withdrawal. Lisinopril was well tolerated, did not affect renal hem.

### Effects of newer kidney protective agents on kidney endpoints provide implications for future clinical trials [^115WdKB3]. Kidney International (2023). High credibility.

Doubling of serum creatinine (equivalent to a 57% decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) is an accepted component of a composite kidney endpoint in clinical trials. Smaller declines in eGFR (40%, 50%) have been applied in several recently conducted clinical trials. Here, we assessed the effects of newer kidney protective agents on endpoints, including smaller proportional declines in eGFR, to compare relative event rates and the magnitude of observed treatment effects.

We performed a post hoc analysis of 4,401 patients in the CREDENCE, 4,304 in the DAPA-CKD, 5,734 in the FIDELIO-DKD, and 3,668 in the SONAR trials, which assessed the effects of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, finerenone, and atrasentan in patients with chronic kidney disease.

- **Effects of active therapies**: Versus placebo on alternative composite kidney endpoints incorporating different eGFR decline thresholds (40%, 50%, or 57% eGFR reductions from baseline) with kidney failure or death due to kidney failure were compared. Cox-proportional hazards regression models were used to assess and compare treatment effects.

During follow-up, event rates were higher for endpoints incorporating smaller versus larger eGFR decline thresholds. Compared to the treatment effects on kidney failure or death due to kidney failure, the magnitude of relative treatment effects was generally similar when considering composite endpoints incorporating smaller declines in eGFR. Hazard ratios for the four interventions ranged from 0.63 to 0.82 for the endpoint incorporating 40% eGFR decline and 0.59 to 0.76 for the endpoint.

### Complementary effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease [^116YQGED]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease continue to pose major healthcare challenges. Early initiation of therapy aimed at slowing the progression of CKD is essential. Increased renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system activity and, in particular, elevated levels of angiotensin II (AII) play important roles in the development and progression of CKD. Therefore, pharmacologic therapies that block the effects of AII and reduce its pathogenic effects are cornerstones of clinical management. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to have renoprotective effects in addition to their ability to control blood pressure. There is accumulating clinical evidence that the combination of an ACEI and an ARB provides greater renal protection, particularly in decreasing proteinuria, than does either agent alone.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers for advanced chronic kidney disease: A systematic review and retrospective individual participant-level meta-analysis of clinical trials [^115cpPxP]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

In patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), the effects of initiating treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) on the risk for kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT) and death remain unclear.

- **Purpose**: To examine the association of ACEi or ARB treatment initiation, relative to a non-ACEi or ARB comparator, with rates of KFRT and death.

- **Data sources**: Ovid Medline and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration Clinical Trials Consortium from 1946 through 31 December 2023.

- **Study selection**: Completed randomized controlled trials testing either an ACEi or an ARB versus a comparator (placebo or antihypertensive drugs other than ACEi or ARB) that included patients with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

- **Data extraction**: The primary outcome was KFRT, and the secondary outcome was death before KFRT. Analyses were done using Cox proportional hazards models according to the intention-to-treat principle. Prespecified subgroup analyses were done according to baseline age (< 65 vs. ≥ 65 years), eGFR (< 20 vs. ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m²), albuminuria (urine albumin-creatinine ratio < 300 vs. ≥ 300 mg/g), and history of diabetes.

- **Data synthesis**: A total of 1739 participants from 18 trials were included, with a mean age of 54.9 years and mean eGFR of 22.2 mL/min/1.73 m², of whom 624 (35.9%) developed KFRT and 133 (7.6%) died during a median follow-up of 34 months (IQR, 19 to 40 months). Overall, ACEi or ARB treatment initiation led to a lower risk.

### Low glomerular filtration rate, recurrent stroke risk, and effect of renin-angiotensin system modulation [^116ufi6A]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

To investigate the association of low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min with recurrent stroke risk and to evaluate whether add-on renin-angiotensin system modulator therapy is associated with lower recurrent stroke risk in patients with low eGFR.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the database of a multicenter trial involving 18,666 patients with recent ischemic stroke, followed for 2.5 years. The primary outcome was the time to the first recurrent stroke. Independent associations of low eGFR with outcomes in the entire cohort and add-on telmisartan treatment with outcomes among those with low eGFR were evaluated.

- **Results**: Low eGFR was observed in 3,630 (20.1%) patients. Patients with low eGFR were older, more likely to be women, and had a known history of hypertension. In unadjusted analyses, patients with low eGFR were more likely to experience a recurrent stroke (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–1.49). After adjusting for confounders, low eGFR was still associated with recurrent stroke but to a lesser extent (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–1.31). Telmisartan treatment among patients with low eGFR was not independently associated with recurrent stroke (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–1.31).

- **Conclusions**: Low eGFR is independently associated with a higher risk of recurrent stroke, but short-term add-on telmisartan therapy does not seem to mitigate this risk.

### Zestril [^111dXKB3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Impaired renal function decreases elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this glomerular filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases, and time to attain steady state is prolonged [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis.

- **Pediatric patients**: The pharmacokinetics of lisinopril were studied in 29 pediatric hypertensive patients between 6 years and 16 years with a glomerular filtration rate greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m². After doses of 0.1 mg per kg to 0.2 mg per kg, steady state peak plasma concentrations of lisinopril occurred within 6 hours, and the extent of absorption based on urinary recovery was about 28%. These values are similar to those obtained previously in adults. The typical value of lisinopril oral clearance (systemic clearance/absolute bioavailability) in a child weighing 30 kg is 10 L/h, which increases in proportion to renal function. In a multicenter, open-label pharmacokinetic study of daily oral lisinopril in 22 pediatric hypertensive patients with stable kidney transplant (ages 7 to 17 years; estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), dose normalized exposures were in the range reported previously in children without a kidney transplant.

### Zestoretic [^117Na5Ww]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations occur within about 7 hours. Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins.

Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25 percent, with large intersubject variability (6% to 60%) at all doses tested (5 mg to 80 mg). Lisinopril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract.

Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of accumulation of 12 hours. Impaired renal function decreases the elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this glomerular filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, the time to peak concentration increases, and the time to attain steady state is prolonged. Older patients, on average, have approximately doubled higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger patients.

### Protecting renal function in the hypertensive patient: Clinical guidelines [^114RfV1r]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Both the incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasing in the United States and worldwide. Patients with both diabetes and hypertension have a dramatically increased risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly if both conditions are not effectively controlled. Failure to achieve the goals for blood glucose, blood pressure (BP), and lipids is associated with high morbidity from cardiovascular and renal events as well as the high costs of treating these events.

There is increasing evidence that cardiovascular events, renal failure, and premature death can be prevented or delayed by earlier identification and treatment of CKD, as well as by taking measures to prevent its onset. A large subgroup of hypertensive patients may be at increased risk for developing CKD and should be targeted for appropriate monitoring and treatment. Not all antihypertensive regimens are equally effective at preserving renal function.

Clinical trials indicate that the primary clinical goal in the treatment of patients with CKD is to lower BP to the recommended goal and to reduce albuminuria and proteinuria to the lowest levels possible. This is achieved optimally by using agents that block the renin-angiotensin system in concert with other agents that reduce proteinuria and BP.

### Management of hypertension and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade in adults with diabetic kidney disease: Association of British Clinical Diabetologists and the Renal Association UK guideline update 2021 [^1123w2xi]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Despite improvements in prognosis, diabetic nephropathy in people with type 1 diabetes remains a major cause of end-stage renal disease. The onset of micro- and macroalbuminuria in people with type 1 diabetes heralds not only an increased risk of renal disease but also an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Early prospective studies suggested that around 30–50% of people with type 1 diabetes will develop microalbuminuria, in whom a 6% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease is seen per 5 mg increase in the 24-hour albumin excretion rate (AER). The natural history of diabetic nephropathy in people with type 1 diabetes has, however, changed over the past four decades. Studies in the 1970s and 1980s suggested that progression to end-stage kidney disease in people with macroalbuminuria would occur within seven years. More recent follow-up data of significant numbers of people with type 1 diabetes suggest that end-stage kidney disease occurs in around 3% of people who have had diabetes for 10 years and in around 8% of people who have had diabetes for 30 years.

- **Recommendations for people with type 1 diabetes**:
	a. We suggest a target upright blood pressure in younger adults of 120/80 mmHg and 140/90 mmHg for those aged over 65 (Grade 2D).
	b. Between the ages of 30–65, for some people with a higher lifetime risk through an earlier age of onset of type 1 diabetes, it may be appropriate to target a diastolic BP of < 80 mmHg (Grade 2C).

There is a significant body of evidence to suggest that over-activation of the RAAS plays a major role in the pathogenesis.

### Impact of early glomerular filtration rate decline in response to antihypertensive treatment on risk of end-stage kidney disease and cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1127otcp]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Blood pressure control, which can induce a slight decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), plays a nephron- and cardioprotective role. However, the more significant early decline in GFR associated with antihypertensive therapy and strict blood pressure targets is still of concern. Since few data are available from trials and observational studies, and the phenomenon is relatively rare, we performed a meta-analysis of available studies. We conclude that major reductions in the glomerular filtration rate occurring soon after starting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and/or under intensive blood pressure control predict end-stage kidney disease.

### Acute declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients treated with benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide versus amlodipine and risk of cardiovascular outcomes [^114VkkrB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Acute declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are common during the treatment of hypertension, especially in patients who are starting renin‐angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors. However, acute declines in eGFR can also occur in the setting of diuretic use. Theoretically, the concomitant initiation of RAS inhibitors with diuretics may increase the risk for the occurrence of acute declines in eGFR during the initiation of combination antihypertensive therapy.

Historically, tolerance of up to a 30% increase in serum creatinine after the initiation of RAS inhibitors has been recommended because such changes in eGFR are considered to be a hemodynamic response to efferent arteriolar vasodilation. However, in some observational studies, increases in serum creatinine after RAS inhibitor use were associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, and need for kidney replacement therapy. Few studies have examined whether specific combinations of antihypertensive agents are more likely to induce acute declines in eGFR, such as the use of a RAS inhibitor and diuretics. Additionally, combined use of amlodipine with RAS inhibition may be preferred by providers because the eGFR typically improves (rather than declines) when amlodipine is initiated and could theoretically counter the eGFR declines that may occur with RAS inhibition.

In this study, we had two objectives. First, we aimed to identify predictors of acute declines in eGFR in the first three months following randomized assignment of patients at high cardiovascular risk.

### The cardio-kidney patient: Epidemiology, clinical characteristics and therapy [^111u4bWf]. Circulation Research (2023). Low credibility.

Prognostic improvement has been best documented for ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, which, in a network meta-analysis of 44 randomized trials including 42,319 patients with CKD, lowered kidney events by 46% (OR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.41–0.73]), cardiovascular events by 27% (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64–0.84]), cardiovascular death by 27% (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.63–0.86]), and all-cause death by 23% (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.66–0.91]) when compared with placebo. Still, blood pressure lowering especially with renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) inhibitors often increases serum creatinine. This is thought to reflect reversible hemodynamic effects in the kidney and not renal injury.

The recently published STOP ACEi trial (multi-centre randomised controlled trial of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi]/angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB] withdrawal in advanced renal disease) randomized 411 patients with advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m² of body surface area) to either discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition. During a mean follow-up of 3 years, no difference was observed in renal function between both treatment groups, while end-stage kidney disease occurred numerically more often in the discontinuation group (62% versus 56%; HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 0.99–1.65]). No statistical difference in adverse events was found between both groups, which by number occurred, however, more often in the discontinuation group (cardiovascular events, 108 versus 88; deaths, 20 versus 22). These results support the continuation of RAS inhibition in advanced kidney disease.

### SPL drug information for lisinopril [^1172cuU8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

### Zestoretic [^114khj36]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, due to its diuretic effects, increase plasma renin activity, increase aldosterone secretion, and decrease serum potassium. The administration of lisinopril blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with the diuretic.

In clinical studies, the extent of blood pressure reduction seen with the combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was approximately additive. The ZESTORETIC 10–12.5 combination worked equally well in both black and white patients. The ZESTORETIC 20–12.5 and ZESTORETIC 20–25 combinations appeared somewhat less effective in black patients, but relatively few black patients were studied. In most patients, the antihypertensive effect of ZESTORETIC was sustained for at least 24 hours.

In a randomized, controlled comparison, the mean antihypertensive effects of ZESTORETIC 20–12.5 and ZESTORETIC 20–25 were similar, suggesting that many patients who respond adequately to the latter combination may be controlled with ZESTORETIC 20–12.5.

Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide has little or no effect on the bioavailability of either drug. The combination tablet is bioequivalent to the concomitant administration of the separate entities.

Renin-angiotensin system inhibition with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers has been shown to be effective in reducing the progression of renal and cardiovascular disease. However, these medications are often associated with an initial reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate, which is thought to be functional but may be of clinical significance. Newer insights from secondary analyses of large clinical trials may provide an important clinical perspective.

### Effect of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system on the progression of type 2 diabetic nephropathy: a randomized trial [^113xw2EU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). High credibility.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers has been shown to lessen the rate of decrease in glomerular filtration rate in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

- **Study design**: A multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of combining the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril and the angiotensin II receptor blocker irbesartan with each drug in monotherapy (at both high and equipotent doses) in slowing the progression of type 2 diabetic nephropathy.

- **Setting & population**: The study involved 133 patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy (age, 66 ± 8 years; 76% men) from 17 centers in Spain.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:2 ratio to receive lisinopril (n = 35), irbesartan (n = 28), or the combination of both (n = 70).

- **Outcomes**: The primary composite outcome was a greater than 50% increase in baseline serum creatinine level, end-stage renal disease, or death.

- **Results**: Baseline values for the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure were 49 ± 21 mL/min/1.73 m² and 153 ± 19/81 ± 11 mm Hg, respectively. Mean geometric baseline proteinuria was protein excretion of 1.32 (95% CI, 1.10–1.62) g/g creatinine. After a median follow-up of 32 months, 21 (30%) patients in the combination group, 10 (29%) in the lisinopril group, and 8 (29%) in the irbesartan group reached the primary outcome. Hazard ratios were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.44–2.05; P = 0.9) and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.39–2.02; P = 0.8) for the combination versus the lisinopril and irbesartan groups, respectively. There were no significant differences observed.

### Aggressive blood pressure reduction and renin-angiotensin system blockade in chronic kidney disease: Time for re-evaluation [^116qea5Q]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Over the past decades, aggressive control of blood pressure (BP) and blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) have been considered the cornerstones of treatment against the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), following significant background and clinical evidence on the association of hypertension and RAAS activation with renal injury. Previous recommendations included a BP target of 1 g/day and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension in all CKD patients. However, long-term extensions of relevant clinical trials support a low-BP goal only for patients with proteinuria, whereas recent cardiovascular trials have questioned the benefits of low systolic BP for diabetic patients, leading to more individualized recommendations.

Furthermore, our previous knowledge of the specific renoprotective properties of RAAS blockers in patients with proteinuric CKD is now extended with data on the use of these agents in patients with less advanced nephropathy and/or absence of proteinuria. This finding derives mostly from subanalyses of cardiovascular trials. This review discusses previous and recent clinical evidence on the issues of BP reduction and RAAS blockade by type and stage of renal damage, aiming to aid clinicians in their treatment decisions for patients with CKD.

### Angiotensin blockade and progressive loss of kidney function in hemodialysis patients: a randomized controlled trial [^113Ntve2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). High credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines during long-term dialysis treatment. In peritoneal dialysis, the blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system reduces GFR decline. Observational studies suggest that similar treatment may preserve kidney function in hemodialysis (HD).

- **Study Design**: A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial, with a 1-year follow-up.

- **Setting & Participants**: Adult HD patients with urine output greater than 300mL/24h, HD vintage less than 1 year, and cardiac ejection fraction greater than 30%. Patients were included from 6 HD centers.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomly assigned to placebo or the angiotensin II receptor blocker irbesartan, 300mg daily. Target systolic blood pressure (BP) was 140mm Hg.

- **Outcomes & Measurements**: Primary outcomes included change in GFR measured as the mean of creatinine and urea renal clearance together with urine volume. Secondary outcomes were changes in albuminuria, renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone hormone plasma levels, and time to anuria.

- **Results**: Of the 82 patients randomly assigned (41 patients in each group), 56 completed 1 year of treatment. The placebo and irbesartan groups were comparable at baseline in terms of sex balance (26 vs 30 men), mean age (62 vs 61 years), median HD vintage (137 vs 148 days), mean HD time (10 vs 11h/wk), median urine volume (1.19 vs 1.26L/d), and mean GFR (4.8 vs 5.7mL/min/1.73 m²). The target BP level was reached in both groups, and BP did not differ significantly between groups over time. Adverse-event rates were similar.

### Impact of the preintervention rate of renal function decline on outcome of renoprotective intervention [^1169Ryk1]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Randomized clinical trials on the progression of renal diseases usually include patients based on criteria for blood pressure, renal function, and proteinuria. However, there are no data showing that this enrollment provides groups with comparable baseline rates of renal function decline. Consequently, the impact of the preintervention rate of renal function loss, or slope, on study outcomes has yet to be established.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: The preintervention slope was determined for 60 out of 89 renal patients without diabetes, who participated in a four-year prospective, randomized intervention comparing enalapril versus atenolol. The analysis explored whether (1) the preintervention slope was equally distributed across groups, (2) the treatment benefit, defined as slope improvement, corresponded to the study outcome, and (3) the preintervention slope was a determinant of the intervention slope.

- **Results**: The preintervention slope was different between the groups: -3.7 ± 3.2 in the group to receive enalapril versus -2.2 ± 3.3 ml/min per year in the group to receive atenolol. The intervention slopes were similar, with -1.9 ± 0.8 for enalapril and -1.8 ± 0.7 ml/min per year for atenolol. Thus, slope improvement was observed during enalapril treatment only. When analyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (I/D) genotype, slope improvement was evident only in the DD genotype. Multivariate analysis identified the preintervention slope as a main predictor of the intervention slope.

- **Conclusions**: Variations in preintervention slope are significant for trial outcomes and can introduce bias. Future studies should consider allocation according to preintervention slope.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^116hynxJ]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of chronic kidney disease, specifically concerning RAAS inhibitors like ACEis and ARBs, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend initiating renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (ACEi or ARB) in patients with CKD and normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) for specific indications, such as the treatment of hypertension or HFrEF.

### Additive antiproteinuric effect of combined ACE inhibition and angiotensin II receptor blockade [^113FTuQ4]. Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Limitation of systemic and glomerular hypertension reduces urinary protein excretion and prevents renal function deterioration.

- **Objective**: To investigate whether, in hypertensive patients with glomerulonephritis, a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI, fosinopril 20 mg/day) with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB, irbesartan 150 mg/day) produces a more profound antiproteinuric effect than either drug alone.

- **Methods**: Ten non-diabetic patients with glomerulonephritis, normal or slightly reduced but stable renal function (creatinine clearance 40–106 ml/min) without immunosuppression were studied. Clinical evaluations, 24-hour blood pressure measurements, and laboratory tests were performed as follows: (1) without medication (baseline) and in random sequence; (2) ACEI alone; (3) ARB alone; and (4) combination of ACEI + ARB. Each period lasted for 6 weeks, separated by three washout periods of 4 weeks each without therapy.

- **Results**: ACEI and ARB alone reduced proteinuria from 7.9 ± 7.1 to 5.3 ± 5.2 and 5.0 ± 4.9 g/24 h (mean ± SD), respectively. The combination of ACEI + ARB induced a more remarkable reduction of proteinuria in every patient (to 3.3 ± 3.7 g/24 h) than either drug alone (P = 0.039 by ANOVA). The enhanced antiproteinuric effect of the combined therapy could not be attributed to a more pronounced reduction of 24-hour mean arterial pressure (basal, 106 ± 8; ACEI, 97 ± 5; ARB, 98 ± 5; ACEI + ARB, 95 ± 5 mmHg) or creatinine clearance (basal, 77 ± 27; ACEI, 73 ± 31; ARB, 80 ± 30; ACEI + ARB, 73 ± 32 ml/min).

### Dual renin-angiotensin system blockade at optimal doses for proteinuria [^115iFpk4]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

The antiproteinuric effect of combining the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril and the angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonist losartan was compared to that of the optimal antiproteinuric doses of monotherapy.

- **Methods**: To this purpose, lisinopril and losartan were studied in nine nondiabetic renal patients with median proteinuria of 4.5 g/day (95% CI, 3.5, 6.4), a creatinine clearance of 80 mL/min (95% CI, 66, 96), and a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 102 mm Hg (95% CI, 93, 112). First, in two protocols with six-week treatment periods per dose, the optimal antiproteinuric dose of each drug was established in each patient. Losartan and lisinopril were used in randomized order, each preceded by a baseline period without medication. The doses of losartan (mg/day) were 50, 100, 150, and again 50. The lisinopril doses were 10, 20, 40, and again 10. After the second protocol, patients were treated with a combination, using the optimal antiproteinuric doses established for the individual drugs.

- **Results**: The antiproteinuric response by losartan was optimal at 100 mg (-46%; 95% CI, -60, -24%), being larger than at the 50 mg dose (-27%; 95% CI, -42, -4%), but not different from the 150 mg dose (-46%; 95% CI, -58; -20%). Proteinuria decreased further at each up-titration step of lisinopril to -75% (95% CI, -85, -43%) at the 40 mg dose. Combination therapy reduced proteinuria more effectively (-85%; 95% CI, -96, -58) than monotherapy with losartan, and to a lesser extent than with lisinopril. Optimal blood pressure responses were obtained at similar doses.

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: National guidance [^116fN4cF]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

Changes in kidney function after the initiation of drug treatment

A decline in renal function is commonly seen in patients when they start an ACEI, ARB, or sacubitril/valsartan and is usually modest. This decline is attributable to the loss of renal efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and an acute decrease in intraglomerular pressure, with a subsequent fall in GFR. Renal function may actually improve: in the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS), although the average increase in creatinine was 44 µmol/L at two weeks, nearly a quarter of patients experienced a decline in creatinine. RAAS inhibitors can decrease the rate at which renal function subsequently declines, despite an apparent initial worsening.

The deterioration in renal function may also indicate haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis or intrarenal vascular disease. For a small proportion of patients, particularly those with bilateral renovascular disease, initiation of ACEI/ARB can result in substantial and irreversible declines in renal function or life-threatening hyperkalemia. In those rare cases with a profound decline in GFR post-RAAS inhibitor, renal artery stenosis should be actively sought, with decisions on revascularization made on an individual patient basis.

Important questions are: (1) whether there is a level of decline in renal function related to ACEI/ARB initiation beyond which the risk of continuing treatment outweighs the benefits; and (2) whether the risk-benefit balance depends on the indication for treatment.

### Improving the efficacy of RAAS blockade in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112gSAaM]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The reduction of blood pressure and proteinuria through the blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been a cornerstone of renoprotective intervention for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) for many years. Despite the proven efficacy of RAAS blockade, the reduction in proteinuria is insufficient for many patients and does not prevent further deterioration of renal function.

Short-term studies have shown that a variety of treatment intensification strategies beneficially affect blood pressure and proteinuria. These strategies include RAAS blockade through either dose escalation or the use of multiple drugs, alongside dietary sodium restriction. Large clinical trials, however, have shown that RAAS blockade with multiple drugs does not improve patients' long-term renal or cardiovascular outcomes.

By contrast, two post-hoc analyses of landmark trials in nephrology demonstrate beneficial renal and cardiovascular effects from avoiding excessive dietary sodium intake during single-agent RAAS blockade therapy. The effects of dietary sodium restriction on renal or cardiovascular outcomes still require prospective confirmation. Nevertheless, data support implementing lifestyle changes to reduce dietary sodium intake in combination with single-agent RAAS blockade, rather than dual-agent RAAS blockade, as a potent and feasible strategy to mitigate the burden of renal and cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD.

### Association between hypertension and kidney function decline: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study [^112nLrBp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The relationship between hypertension, antihypertension medication use, and change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over time among individuals with preserved GFR requires investigation.

- **Study design**: Observational study.

- **Setting and participants**: 14,854 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.

- **Predictors**: Baseline hypertension status (1987–1989) was categorized according to the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Clinical Practice Guideline as normal blood pressure, elevated blood pressure, stage 1 hypertension, stage 2 hypertension without medication, or stage 2 hypertension with medication.

- **Outcomes**: Slope of estimated GFR (eGFR) at 5 study visits over 30 years.

- **Analytical approach**: Mixed models with random intercepts and random slopes were fit to evaluate the association between baseline hypertension status and slope of eGFR.

- **Results**: At baseline, 13.2%, 7.3%, and 19.4% of whites and 15.8%, 14.9%, and 39.9% of African Americans had stage 1 hypertension, stage 2 hypertension without medication, and stage 2 hypertension with medication. Compared with those with normal blood pressure, the annual eGFR decline was greater in people with higher blood pressure (whites: elevated blood pressure, -0.11 mL/min/1.73 m²; stage 1 hypertension, -0.15 mL/min/1.73 m²; stage 2 hypertension without medication, -0.36 mL/min/1.73 m²; stage 2 hypertension with medication, -0.17 mL/min/1.73 m²; African Americans: elevated blood pressure, -0.21 mL/min/1.73 m²; stage 1 hypertension, -0.16 mL/min/1.73 m²; stage 2 hypertension without medication, cut-off due to truncation).

### The effects of eGFR change on CVD, renal, and mortality outcomes in a hypertensive cohort treated with 3 different antihypertensive medications [^115o7hSB]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Impaired renal function is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and mortality. The impact of short-term renal function decline on outcomes is less well studied. The association of antihypertensive medications with the impact of short-term estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline is not known.

- **Methods**: We examined 20,207 hypertensive participants with baseline and 2-year creatinine levels from which eGFR changes were estimated. The associations between eGFR change with incident coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, heart failure (HF), all-cause mortality, and ESRD during 2.9 years of in-trial follow-up, and with mortality during in-trial and post-trial follow-up (7.6 years) were studied. Results were assessed by primary hypertension (HTN) treatment (chlorthalidone, lisinopril, and amlodipine) and adjusted for baseline eGFR levels.

- **Results**: In the short term, an eGFR decline below the cohort median (-1.28 ml/minute/1.73 m²/2 years) compared to above the median, or a 5 ml/min/1.73 m²/year decline compared to no decline, was associated with significant hazard risk for CHD (1.06–1.28), HF (1.24–1.91), ESRD (2.84–6.01), and mortality (1.08–1.19), but not with stroke risk. In the long term, there was a significant association with mortality (1.11–1.34). Interaction terms for outcomes by antihypertensive treatments were not statistically significant except for ESRD between amlodipine versus chlorthalidone (hazard ratio: 3.17 [2.59, 3.88] vs. 2.41 [1.98, 2.97]; P interaction = 0.005) for a 5 ml/min/1.73 m²/year eGFR decline.

### Renin angiotensin aldosterone system blockade: Little to no rationale for ACE inhibitor and ARB combinations [^111LLsb8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the complexities and inter-related pathways of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system continues to evolve. Determining which drugs to use, when, and how are everyday questions faced by clinicians in the ambulatory setting. Combining these classes, for the purpose of enhancing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade and incremental blood pressure, nephroprotective, and cardioprotective effects, logically has emerged as an area for scientific inquiry and clinical use.

Despite the lack of evidence on safety and efficacy in most disease states, dual therapy has been embraced as a treatment option. Most studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension have limitations. In contrast, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in systolic heart failure has been addressed in several large randomized controlled trials. Until recently, there has been limited and conflicting evidence for the use of combination therapy for the prevention or management of nephropathy. Based on the new evidence, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in the treatment and management of hypertension, heart failure, and nephropathy should be limited.

### Drugs that slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease: Are renoprotective effects attenuated in heart failure [^112PRt3v]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

In large-scale randomized controlled trials, several classes of drugs have been shown to reduce major adverse renal outcomes in Type 2 diabetes. Compared with placebo, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors each reduce the risk of occurrence of end-stage kidney disease by approximately 30%–35%. Therefore, many of the foundational drugs that favorably influence cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization in chronic heart failure act to decrease the risk of serious adverse renal outcomes in diabetic patients, most of whom did not have heart failure.

Yet, surprisingly, large-scale trials have not demonstrated that these four classes of drugs reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease in patients with heart failure, even though the same trials demonstrated significant benefits of these treatments on major heart failure outcomes. Long-term therapy with angiotensin receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure has not altered the rate of decline in glomerular function or reduced the risk of developing severe renal impairment. Initiating treatment with these drugs increases the likelihood that patients will experience a decline in estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² nearly five-fold, even when therapy is started at low doses. Similarly, treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists has not influenced the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with heart failure.

### ACE inhibition versus angiotensin receptor blockade: Which is better for renal and cardiovascular protection [^114cWniF]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic renal disease is characterized by a gradual loss of renal function and an increased cardiovascular risk. Renin-angiotensin system blockade by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin receptor blockade has distinct renoprotective and cardiovascular protective effects, but which of the two drug classes confers more protection is still a matter of debate. This review highlights and compares the effects of the two drug classes in nondiabetic renal disease and in overt or incipient nephropathy of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Both renal and cardiovascular outcomes are considered. Regardless of their relative efficacy, both drug classes have a dose-response relationship for intermediate renal and cardiovascular parameters. Moreover, combined treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade seems to provide better long-term renoprotection than monotherapy. Actually, in most patients, achieving maximal renal and cardiovascular protection requires a multidrug regimen, usually including several antihypertensives. Within this approach, full dose titration of either RAS blocker followed by add-on with the second drug is more important than the choice of the initial drug.

### Effect of lisinopril on the progression of renal insufficiency in mild proteinuric non-diabetic nephropathies [^115s8T4S]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine whether lisinopril, an ACE-inhibitor (ACEi), was more effective than other antihypertensive agents in slowing the progression of non-diabetic chronic renal diseases in patients with baseline proteinuria ≤ 1.0 g/day.

- **Methods**: In an open, multicenter study, all eligible patients entered a 3-month run-in phase during which antihypertensive therapy (excluding ACEi) was adjusted to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg and to verify urinary protein excretion and renal function stability. One hundred thirty-one patients with chronic renal insufficiency (Clcr between 20–50 ml/min) due to primary renoparenchymal diseases and proteinuria ≤ 1.0 g/day were randomized to lisinopril (L = 66) or alternative antihypertensive therapy (C = 65). Changes in renal function were assessed by inulin (Clin) clearance.

- **Results**: During the follow-up period of 22.5 ± 5.6 months, Clin did not change significantly in group L (-1.31 ± 0.6 ml/min/1.73 m²), differing significantly from group C in which it declined markedly (-6.71 ± 3.6 ml/min/1.73 m²) (P < 0.04). Seven patients experienced adverse events that prompted discontinuation of treatment: four in group L and three in group C. Additionally, seven patients showed severe deterioration in renal function requiring dialysis: two in group L and five in group C. The overall risk of the combined endpoints — need for dialysis or halving of GFR — was significantly higher in group C versus group L.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^117Mdo55]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, particularly concerning the management of hypertension, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend initiating blood pressure-lowering medication along with lifestyle optimization. This is aimed at reducing cardiovascular disease risk in patients with diabetic or non-diabetic moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease and confirmed blood pressure ≥ 130/80 mmHg, if such treatment is well tolerated.

### Is it the agent or the blood pressure level that matters for renal protection in chronic nephropathies [^112YWtLY]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Some antihypertensive agents may be capable of reducing chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) progression because they halt some of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in renal damage. Although this effect seems to be partially independent of blood pressure (BP) reduction, it is still unclear whether these drugs are truly superior to other antihypertensive agents when the BP values recommended by the present guidelines are achieved. This is particularly true when considering that, in published trials, target and achieved BP values were consistently higher than those recommended today.

Furthermore, in the majority of these studies, patients treated with ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) or Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ATIIRA) achieved lower BP values than those in control groups, and BP values over 24 hours were not recorded. Taking into account the role of baseline and follow-up BP values, the treatment effect remained significant in almost all multivariate models. These findings suggest that the renoprotective effect of these agents (ACE-I, ATIIRA) is partially independent of better BP control.

However, caution should be exercised in attributing true biological renoprotective properties to drugs based solely on statistical adjustments of BP values. This is important even when such adjustments are robustly performed without an understanding of what those BP values actually reflect.

### Acute declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients treated with benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide versus amlodipine and risk of cardiovascular outcomes [^112mYYdX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

In patients at elevated cardiovascular risk, it is not uncommon for individuals to require more than one antihypertensive agent to achieve blood pressure targets. Depending on the classes of antihypertensive agents used, the magnitude of the acute decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may vary substantially.

In this study, we examined the association between acute declines in eGFR when using a combination of benazepril and a diuretic versus benazepril and a calcium channel blocker. Overall, declines in eGFR were more common in those receiving a diuretic compared with amlodipine. Any decline in eGFR greater than 15% was associated with a 26% higher risk of the primary cardiovascular endpoint compared with those without such eGFR declines in the first three months of starting therapy. When we performed stratified analysis in each treatment arm, we observed a 47% higher risk of the primary cardiovascular outcome in those with acute declines in eGFR greater than 15% (versus ≤ 15%) within the first three months of study when using amlodipine, but this risk was not statistically significant in the hydrochlorothiazide arm. However, in spline-based analysis, the benefit of the amlodipine arm was preserved regardless of the magnitude of the acute decline in eGFR compared with the same decline in the hydrochlorothiazide arm.

It might have been expected that eGFR declines would be larger when patients were starting a combination of both RAS inhibitors and diuretics simultaneously, which may increase the likelihood of hemodynamic eGFR declines occurring.
