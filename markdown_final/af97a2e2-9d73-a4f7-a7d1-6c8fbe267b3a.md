## Question

Two squares of a $7 \times 7$ board are painted yellow and the rest is painted green. Two color schemes are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by applying a rotation in the plane of the board. How many non-equivalent color schemes can we obtain?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many non-equivalent color schemes can be obtained when two squares of a 7×7 board are painted yellow and the rest green, where two schemes are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a rotation of the board. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of ways to choose two distinct squares on a 7×7 grid. Then, I should classify the squares by their orbit under the cyclic rotation group C4 and count how many orbits have size 1, 2, or 4. Next, I will count how many 2-element subsets are fixed by each rotation, apply Burnside's lemma, and finally extract the number of distinct orbits, which equals the number of non-equivalent color schemes.

> Let me first confirm the total number of ways to place two yellow squares without considering symmetry. On a 7×7 board there are 49 squares, so the number of unordered pairs is C(49, 2) = 1176, and I should keep that in mind as a sanity check for the final answer.

> Now, I need to think about the symmetry group acting on the board. The problem says rotations in the plane, so the relevant group is the cyclic group C4 generated by a 90-degree clockwise rotation; I should confirm that reflections are not included, and the wording supports that restriction, so I will proceed with C4 only.

> Next, I should classify the squares by their stabilizers under C4. Squares on the center of the board are fixed by all rotations, so they form orbits of size 1. Squares that are not on the center but are mapped to themselves after a 180-degree rotation lie in orbits of size 2. Squares with no rotational symmetry lie in orbits of size 4. Wait, let me verify the counts: for a 7×7 grid, the center is unique, so there is 1 square with orbit size 1. The remaining 48 squares pair up under 180-degree rotation, giving 24 orbits of size 2. Hold on, I should verify the math: 1 + 24×2 = 49, which checks out, so the orbit structure is correct.

> I will now examine fixed points for each group element to apply Burnside's lemma. For the identity rotation, every 2-element subset is fixed, so Fix(e) = C(49, 2) = 1176. For a 90-degree rotation, a 2-element subset is fixed only if both squares are fixed by that rotation; the only fixed square is the center, so no 2-element subset is fixed, meaning Fix(r90) = 0. Similarly, for a 270-degree rotation, the same logic applies and Fix(r270) = 0. For a 180-degree rotation, a 2-element subset is fixed if either both squares are fixed by 180 degrees or the subset is a pair of squares swapped by 180 degrees; the center is fixed, and the other 48 squares form 24 pairs swapped by 180 degrees, so Fix(r180) = C(1, 2) + 24 = 0 + 24 = 24. Wait, I initially thought C(1, 2) was 1, but that's wrong; C(1, 2) is 0 because you can't choose 2 elements from 1, so the correct count is 24, not 25. I should double-check that correction before proceeding.

> Applying Burnside's lemma, the number of distinct orbits is the average number of fixed points: (Fix(e) + Fix(r90) + Fix(r180) + Fix(r270)) / 4 = (1176 + 0 + 24 + 0) / 4 = 1200 / 4 = 300. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the arithmetic and make sure I didn't miscount anything. 1176 + 24 = 1200, and 1200 divided by 4 is indeed 300, so the calculation holds.

> Therefore, the number of non-equivalent color schemes is 300. I should confirm that this is reasonable relative to the total 1176 unordered pairs; reducing by a factor near 4 makes sense given the small number of fixed points under non-identity rotations, so the answer passes a quick plausibility check.

---

The number of non-equivalent color schemes is **300**. This is found by applying Burnside's lemma to the action of the cyclic group C4 (0°, 90°, 180°, 270° rotations) on the 1176 ways to choose 2 yellow squares from 49. Only the identity and 180° rotations fix any configurations: the identity fixes all 1176, and the 180° rotation fixes 24 (the 24 pairs of squares symmetric about the center). The average number of fixed configurations is (1176 + 0 + 24 + 0)/4 = 300, so there are 300 non-equivalent schemes.

---

## Total number of color schemes without considering symmetry

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 squares out of 49 to paint yellow: C(49, 2) = 1176.

---

## Symmetry operations and their effects

The symmetry group of a 7×7 grid under rotation is the cyclic group C4, consisting of rotations by 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°. We need to determine how many color schemes remain unchanged (are fixed) under each rotation.

---

### Identity rotation (0°)

Under the identity rotation, every color scheme remains unchanged. Therefore, the number of fixed schemes is the total number of schemes: **1176**.

---

### 90° and 270° rotations

For a scheme to be fixed under a 90° or 270° rotation, the two yellow squares must map to themselves under that rotation. On a 7×7 grid, the only square fixed under 90° or 270° rotation is the center square. Since we are choosing two distinct squares, no pair is fixed under these rotations. Thus, the number of fixed schemes is **0** for both 90° and 270° rotations.

---

### 180° rotation

For a scheme to be fixed under a 180° rotation, the two yellow squares must either both be fixed by the 180° rotation or be a pair that swaps under 180°. The only square fixed by 180° rotation is the center square, so the only way to have two fixed squares is to choose the center square twice, which is impossible. Therefore, the fixed schemes must consist of pairs of squares that are symmetric with respect to the center. There are 24 such pairs (since 48 squares can be paired symmetrically, and 48/2 = 24). Thus, the number of fixed schemes under 180° rotation is **24**.

---

## Applying Burnside's lemma

Burnside's lemma states that the number of distinct orbits (non-equivalent color schemes) is the average number of fixed points under the group actions. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

[
\\text{Number of distinct schemes} = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{g \\in G} \\text{Fix}(g)
]

where |G| is the order of the group (4 in this case), and Fix(g) is the number of schemes fixed by the group element g.

Substituting the values we found:

[
\\text{Number of distinct schemes} = \\frac{1}{4} (1176 + 0 + 24 + 0) = \\frac{1200}{4} = 300
]

---

Therefore, the number of non-equivalent color schemes is **300**.

Results

Experiment 1

Subjects saw a briefly presented stimulus consisting of 49 colored circles arranged in a 7 × 7 square (Fig. 2). Each circle was colored in blue, red, green, or white. On each trial, one color was randomly chosen to be dominant (i.e. more frequently presented than the other colors) and 16 circles were painted in that color, whereas the remaining three colors were nondominant and 11 circles were painted in each of those colors. The task was to indicate the dominant color. The experiment featured two different conditions. In the four-alternative condition, subjects picked the dominant color among the four possible colors. In the two-alternative condition, after the offset of the stimulus, subjects were asked to choose between the dominant and one randomly chosen nondominant color. In both conditions, the response screen was displayed with 0-ms delay thus minimizing short-term memory demands. Note that subjects' task was always the same (to correctly identify the dominant color).

### Simultaneous and independent topological control of identical microparticles in non-periodic energy landscapes [^32a5ec5d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The simultaneous control of the transport in several patches of rotated square patterns is particularly simple due to the simplicity of the fences in. However, the same ideas apply to patterns with other symmetry classes.

Here, we have initialized the particles in the desired positions within their respective patches. As we discuss now, it is possible to automatize this process by combining the patches with complex patterns.

Complex patterns and complex loops

Complete control over the colloidal transport is achieved by combining complex patterns and complex loops. In Fig. 6 we combine three C 4 patches that differ in their global orientation ψ and three hexagonal patterns with a topological defect in the symmetry phase. The transition between both patterns occurs smoothly within a region of length equivalent to approximately five unit cells of the square patterns.

Fig. 6
Complex patterns and complex loops.

Brownian dynamics simulations of the transport of colloidal particles above a complex pattern made of three patches, each one with a topological defect in the symmetry phase (top) connected to three patches with square symmetry (down) rotated with respect to each other. The color of the patches with topological defects indicates the value of the symmetry phase ϕ. The color of the square patches indicates the global rotation ψ, illustrated with a sketch of the magnetization. A unique complex modulation loop made of four parts drives the transport in the whole system. In the first part, the repetition of the attractor loop moves the particles toward the defects (blue trajectories) and lets them wait there. The second part of the loop moves the particles downwards through the patterns with defects (orange trajectories). The third part of the loop moves the particles downwards in the square patterns (green trajectories). The last part of the loop writes a custom trajectory (square, triangle, and cross) depending on the global orientation ψ of the pattern (red trajectories). Insets show the corresponding experimental trajectories. The length of the scale bars (yellow) is 15 a.

### Colour map displays [^70f79caa]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

The use of colour-encoded images, displayed as colour maps, is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in radiology as quantitative data are exploited more routinely, both in research as well as clinical routine. Nevertheless, the schemes adopted in colour map displays are usually arbitrary and merely reflect individual preferences or default settings of their processing tool, rather than conforming to any standards set by international bodies. Results from schemes such as the rainbow or jet colour maps that are frequently used can therefore be misinterpreted, as the linearity of the colour scale is not evident, and the brightest colour (yellow) is not at the top of the scale. This is problematic, particularly when viewed by users who lack the expertise to appreciate the nuances in the underlying data, and can potentially lead to erroneous assumptions and therefore affect diagnosis accuracy, leading to the implementation of patient management strategies that may be inappropriate and unwarranted. An initial attempt at standardising colour displays of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was therefore undertaken by the Quantitative MR Group of the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) to meet the universally recognised desirable features of colour maps:
Even colour contrast along the colour gradient for accurate representation of data (only a perceptually uniform colour map weights the same data variation equally across the data space and limits adding visual errors to the data).
High overall colour contrast of the colour gradient (ensuring good visibility of imaged features in the data for people with normal colour vision).
Monotonic and overall high lightness contrast of the colour gradient (ensuring universal and good visibility of imaged features in the data, also for people with impaired colour vision).
Intuitive and constant magnitude of the colour gradient along the whole colour scale (a perceptually ordered colour map does not break the correspondence between colour and numeric values and enables qualitative understanding of a dataset).
Recognisability, from the colour scheme, of the type of information that is presented (by fostering a uniform, coordinated use of individual colour schemes for given types of data, not only over many users, institutes, countries, and manufacturers, but also over time).

### Geriatric emergency department guidelines [^0139bbbd]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Geriatric emergency department visual orientation improvements — soft light is recommended and exposure to natural light is beneficial for recovery times and decreasing delirium; light colored walls with a matte sheen and light flooring with a low-glare finish should be used to optimize lighting and reduce glare. Older adults require three to four times as much light as young adults for visual clarity, and it is recommended that lighting consist of a combination of ambient and spot lighting. Patients should have control of the lighting in their space if they wish to sleep at a time when the other lights are on, allowing for fewer sleep disturbances. Contrast sensitivity in aging vision can be both confusing and hinder movement, and patterns that have dominant contrasts may create a sense of vertigo or be misperceived as obstacles or objects. Secondary to vision and perception changes, color choice for facilities and structure should be considered to enhance visual function and depth perception; avoid monochromatic color schemes and allow for colors to contrast between horizontal and vertical surfaces. Older adults experience a decrease in the ability to differentiate cool colors (greens, blues) as opposed to warm colors (yellows, oranges); in poorly lit areas, yellow is the most visible, orange and reds are attention grabbing, and blues appear hazy and indistinct and may appear gray due to the yellowing of the lens.

### Holographic colour prints for enhanced optical security by combined phase and amplitude control [^a2344152]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Finally, using the spectral degree of freedom, we relaxed the constraint on wavelength selectivity of the colour filters by introducing three additional colours (orange, yellow, and purple) into a three-colour multiplexed RGB (red, green, and blue) hologram and arranging the pixels to form a complex six-colour image (Fig. 4a). The additional colours were assigned to their closest matches within RGB: orange colour filters were placed over phase plates belonging to the red hologram, and purple colour filters over phase plates of the blue hologram (Fig. 4b). As yellow colour filters had poor selectivity between transmitting red light and green light (Fig. 4c), we opted not to store any hologram information in the phase plates under yellow filters — their high transmission at both wavelengths would cause the red projection to appear on the green channel as crosstalk and vice versa. However, if no information was stored in the yellow pixels, their constant phase would contribute to the transmitted zero-order (undiffracted) beam. Hence, we instead applied a random phase to diffuse the contribution from the yellow pixels into a uniform background.

The fences in(blue circles) are four points located on the equator (violet circle). The position of the fences depends on the value of ψ. The modulation loop consists of four interconnected subloops that wind counterclockwise. A subloop is active (green) if it winds around a fence point (blue circles) and inactive (red) otherwise. The orange segments of the modulation loop simply connect the different subloops. Depending on the value of ψ, the modulation loop induces different transport directions (green arrows) or no transport at all. b A pattern made of 18 patches with square symmetry and different global orientation ψ (color bar). A modulation loop controls the trajectories of particles above each patch simultaneously and independently. The particle trajectories (black) write the first 18 letters of the alphabet.

A schematic unit cell illustrating the global orientation is depicted in each patch. The length of the scale bar is 5 a and in this case, we use patterns with a = 7 μm. A unique modulation loop transports the four colloidal particles simultaneously. The trajectories are colored according to the time evolution from blue (initial time) to red (final time). A movie showing the whole time evolution and a one-to-one comparison with computer simulations is available in Supplementary Movie 4.

### The suboptimality of perceptual decision making with multiple alternatives [^ef100c1f]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Experiment 1

The stimulus consisted of 49 circles colored in four different colors — red, blue, green, and white — presented in a 7 × 7 grid on black background. The diameter of each colored circle was 0.24° and the distance between the centers of two adjacent circles was 0.6°. The grid was located at the center of the screen. On each trial, one of the four colors was dominant — it was featured in 16 different locations — whereas the other three colors were nondominant and were featured in 11 locations each. The exact locations of each color were pseudo-randomly chosen so that each color was presented the desired number of times.

A trial began with a 500-ms fixation followed by 500-ms stimulus presentation. Subjects then indicated the dominant color in the display and provided a confidence rating without time pressure.

There were three different conditions in the experiment. In the first condition, subjects could choose any of the four colors (four-alternative condition). In the second condition, after the stimulus offset subjects were asked to choose between only two options that were not announced in advance — one was always the correct dominant color and the other was a randomly selected nondominant color (two-alternative condition). Finally, in the third condition, subjects were told in advance which two colors will be queried at the end of the trial (advance warning condition). For the purposes of the current analyses, we only analyzed the four- and two-alternative conditions. The advanced warning condition and the confidence ratings were not analyzed.

Subjects completed six runs, each consisting of three 35-trial blocks (for a total of 630 trials). The three conditions used in the experiment were blocked such that one block in each run consisted entirely of trials from one condition and each run included one block from each condition. Subjects were given 15-s breaks between blocks and untimed breaks between runs. Before the start of the main experiment, subjects completed a training session where they completed 15 trials per condition with trial-to-trial feedback, and another 15 trials per condition without trial-to-trial feedback. No explicit feedback was provided during the main experiment in any of Experiments 1–4 though the presence of second answers in Experiment 3 served as a form of feedback that those specific trials were wrong. We did not hypothesize that the presence or absence of feedback would alter the results in a systematic way and therefore chose to withhold feedback as in our previous experiments.

### Two-edge-resolved three-dimensional non-line-of-sight imaging with an ordinary camera [^e7b7431a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Objects of varying range and size in the same scene are also evaluated (Fig. 3 a). The pose, colour, and range of the small and close mannequin object are almost perfectly estimated; note the accuracy of its range estimate (reported in Table 1), which is likely due to its proximity to the origin. The colourful doughnut-shaped swimming tube (the largest and farthest hidden scene component) is recovered with surprisingly high fidelity, and relative sizes and positions of the different colours are well-preserved in the reconstruction. Notably, the large patches of blue on either side and the much smaller orange-coloured patches at the top and bottom of the doughnut are present. The reconstructed range and colours of the medium-sized and fairly distant volleyball object are comparably less accurate, likely due to the low reflectivity of the dark-blue stripes and distant spatial location.

Spanning the broadest continuum of range values from the origin, and composed of several large planar surfaces, many of which are orthogonal to the measurement surface, the shelf is by far the greatest exception to our hidden scene representation. However, the recovered shape is strikingly accurate when assimilated with care. First, we note that by being close to the origin, the top of the shelf occupies a larger subset of azimuthal angles compared to its farthest part (the base). Most objects on the shelves also appear in the reconstructions. Looking closely, near the top of the shelf are two neighbouring patches of yellow (left) and green (right) representing the two basketballs in the topmost cubby. Following beneath is a vibrant pink area corresponding to the surface of the mostly empty second cubby hole. The final hole shows subtle patches corresponding to the pink and dark blue basketballs. Because the shelf is so detailed with different colours, the total variation prior smears out smaller details, such as the objects on top of the shelf. However, in Supplementary Note 4, we provide a less smoothed reconstruction performed without the total variation constraint (see Supplementary Fig. 13) that shows more details of the shelf.

### Color brings relief to human vision [^71182600]. Nature Neuroscience (2003). Medium credibility.

In natural scenes, chromatic variations, and the luminance variations that are aligned with them, mainly arise from surfaces such as flowers or painted objects. Pure or near-pure luminance variations, on the other hand, mainly arise from inhomogeneous illumination such as shadows or shading. Here, I provide evidence that knowledge of these color-luminance relationships is built into the machinery of the human visual system. When a pure-luminance grating is added to a differently oriented chromatic grating, the resulting 'plaid' appears to spring into three-dimensional relief, an example of 'shape-from-shading'. By psychophysical measurements, I found that the perception of shape-from-shading in the plaid was triggered when the chromatic and luminance gratings were not aligned, and suppressed when the gratings were aligned. This finding establishes a new role for color vision in determining the three-dimensional structure of an image: one that exploits the natural relationships that exist between color and luminance in the visual world.

Photographs in telemedicine — advice for travelers — emphasizes capturing key lesion features, including distribution, configuration and arrangement of lesions with respect to one another, a primary lesion, and lesions with secondary changes; if several lesions are present or if the lesion is subtle, highlight the specific lesion with a marking pen or (for digital images) editing software, and take pictures in a well-lit room or outdoors in a shaded area. High-quality image set-up includes an orientation view showing the entire body or affected body part with the lesion's location obvious, a mid-distance view centered on the lesion with an anatomical landmark for orientation and size, and a close-up view that can be physically close (under 18 inches) using the camera's macro function or from farther away if using a zoom lens; ensure the lesion is in the center and fills most of the frame with some normal skin, include a scale or size comparison using a ruler, measuring tape, or a standard object like a pencil, paper clip, or US coin, and take as many pictures as necessary and send sharply focused, well-lit photos only because blurry pictures are not helpful.

### Elastic pseudospin transport for integratable topological phononic circuits [^ea4da720]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Remarkably in the region (marked by purple) between the two transducers, there exist simultaneously an upward traveling pseudospin+ excited by the bottom transducer and a downward traveling pseudospin− excited by the top transducer. Pure pseudospin current (without energy flow) in this region is thus determined by the coherent superposition of these two pseudospins, as illustrated in Fig. 4b. When the pseudospins exited by two transducers have the same amplitude, they (in red and blue arrows) are effectively annihilated anywhere in this region, due to their same rotating phase and group velocity but opposite direction. Consequently, this process leaves behind only a non-spinning or an equivalent linear vector field component in the S / A normal mode basis. Since the phase difference between the two pseudospins varies linearly with location (e.g. from position#1 to position#7), the resulted vector direction of the linear component rotates correspondingly in a linear fashion to form a well-defined spatial chirality, as illustrated by the DNA-like double helix marked by the violet and green traces. Note that in this case the helix is left-handed at the right boundary of TI, and a right-handed chirality can also be obtained but at the left boundary of TI.

In experiment, the out-of-plane displacement distribution in this region is obtained at a deep subwavelength resolution and shown in Fig. 4c (see Supplementary Note 6 for complete field information, and Supplementary Movie 3 for its temporal evolution). At any location in this region, e.g. the top position #7, the field pattern in a unit cell remains the same, but its intensity blinks with time, as illustrated in the right panel. This indicates the formation of a standing wave pattern. Along the waveguide in this region, the symmetry of the field in the unit cell undergoes periodic changes, e.g. symmetric — antisymmetric — symmetric or equivalently. Consequently, the standing-wave pattern is seen to spiral in one-way fashion, representing the signature of pure pseudospin current, i.e. no energy flow but a pseudo angular momentum transport in real space.

### A case report of changes in asymmetric colour use in paintings produced over 3 years post-stroke by a patient with spatial neglect [^03e28a9a]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Disappearance of colour asymmetry

Direct observation of the paintings suggests a qualitative and quantitative asymmetry in colour choice. Qualitatively, the left-side colours appear colder (Hue more toward the blue), duller (less Saturation) and darker (less Value). For example, F.B. did not use the same shades of red and brown on both sides of the week 32 painting shown in Fig. 1. Quantitatively, a larger variety of colours on the right side of the paintings, observable in the three earliest paintings in Fig. 1, was measured by the rightward shift of the complexity barycenter (e.g. black arrows Fig. 3B). Barycenter values for each painting and each colour component are shown in Supp. Information 4 and are plotted as a function of time in weeks in Fig. 4B.

The follow-up analysis showed that the left-right entropy asymmetry in the three colour components (Hue, Saturation, Value) evolved with similar time courses. Each recovery curve consists of two phases: a positive plateau observed for each colour component around 10% with a confidence interval that did not include zero (7.5%, t(37) = 4.42, p < 0.0001, 95CI = [4.2, 10.8] for Hue, 11.7%, t(37) = 5.57, p < 0.0001, 95CI = [7.8, 15.6] for Saturation, and 9.6%, t(37) = 5.33, p < 0.0001, 95CI = [7.6, 11.6] for Value, Table 1) denoting larger variety of colours on the right side of the paintings (and lasting until t0 estimated at 17 weeks (SD = 8) for Saturation, 27 weeks (SD = 14) for Value and 30 weeks (SD = 17) for Hue, Table 1), followed by a slow progressive reduction of entropy asymmetry (Fig. 4B). Note that error bars in this figure do not reflect experimental uncertainties, but are calculated in such a way as to obtain residual distribution for H, S, V following a normal distribution with standard deviation equal to 1. They thus reflect the estimated statistical uncertainty of the colour entropy asymmetry.

Biological tissue: fourier ring correlation maps

Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC) measurements were performed using a PYME implementation available through the PYME-extra set of plugins. After drift correction was applied the series was split into two equal blocks of events. All events were split into alternating segments containing 100 frames and these in turn were then used to generate two rendered Gaussian images which were compared using the FRC approach as described in ref. Briefly, the intersection of the FRC curve with the 1/7 line was used to obtain an estimate of the FRC resolution. In order to generate the FRC map, presented in Fig. 2c, optically thick ~20 µm porcine tissue, labeled for alpha actinin, was imaged near the surface furthest from the objective with the excitation laser orientated to pass straight out of the objective lens. For 1x RD measurements the detection threshold in the PYME analysis pipeline was set to 1.3. Because this threshold is signal-to-noise ratio based it was adjusted to 2.0 for 10x RD measurements in order to have equivalent foreground mean photon yields in detected events which ensured that equivalent detection settings are used. 2 × 2 µm regions of interest were individually segmented in time, utilizing 30k frames for each modality (1x/10x RD), and two Gaussian images rendered with a pixel size of 5 nm were rendered for each square. Localization precision, as shown in Fig. 2d inset, was determined by the PyME localization algorithm which estimates the localization error from the co-variance of the weighted least squares penalty function at convergence, see also.

### Quantifying absolute addressability in DNA origami with molecular resolution [^9b662d2d]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Assembly conditions and staple detection

We investigated the influence of different assembly conditions on the detection efficiency of individual staples. First, we evaluated the number of detected sites as a function of the annealing time: for the 20-nm-grid, we tested annealing times ranging from 5 min to 3 days (Fig. 3b) and determined detection efficiencies for all 12 staple positions separately. Since the 20-nm-grid has rotational and mirror symmetry, we then averaged over all 12 sites of a single grid to obtain an average detection efficiency per origami. We measured an average detection efficiency of ~82% for all annealing times (standard deviation σ = 1.3%), underlining the remarkable robustness of the 2D rectangular DNA origami. Additionally, magnesium concentrations between 8 and 16 mM during folding, as well as the long-term storage at room temperature of purified 20-nm-grids did not result in any significant change in detection efficiency (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). Second, we investigated the detection efficiency of staples with respect to their molar excess over the scaffold ranging from ten times to ~500 times molar excess (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 8). The efficiency improved by more than 10% when increasing the excess from ten times to ~500 times (from 72 to 84% on average) and followed a Michaelis–Menten kinetic (for fit parameters see Supplementary Table 1).

### Space-time-coding digital metasurfaces [^0447f2a0]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

More specifically, we consider a coding metasurface with 8 × 8 elements and time-coding sequences with a length of 8. First, we address the beam-steering design in one plane at the central frequency. Hence, we only need to study time-coding sequences of eight elements, and each column of elements has the same digital code. Figure 4a, b shows the 2-bit space-time-coding matrix, in which the red, yellow, green, and blue dots represent "0", "1", "2", and "3" digits, representing 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° phase responses, respectively (the criterion for selecting those eight sets of time-coding sequences is detailed in Supplementary Note 7). The equivalent amplitudes and phases of those eight coding elements at different harmonic frequencies are shown in Fig. 4c, d, respectively. We can clearly observe that the designed space-time-coding matrix effectively results in equivalent 3-bit responses, "0 ′ " (−135°), "1 ′ " (−90°), "2 ′ " (−45°), "3 ′ " (0°), "4 ′ " (45°), "5 ′ " (90°), "6 ′ " (135°), and "7 ′ " (180°), and an equivalent phase gradient at the central frequency. According to the generalized Snell's law, this phase discontinuity will steer a normally incident wave by an angle of 14.5°. The corresponding 2D scattering pattern at the central frequency and the scattering patterns at different harmonic frequencies are displayed in Fig. 4e, f. It can be seen that the main beam at the central frequency points at θ = −14.5°, and the scattered powers at the harmonic frequencies are much smaller, which provides good sideband suppression. Moreover, we compare the beam-steering performance of the original 2-bit coding "0-0-1-1-2-2-3-3" with the equivalent 3-bit coding "0 ′ -1 ′ -2 ′ -3 ′ -4 ′ -5 ′ -6 ′ -7 ′ ", as shown in Fig. 4g. It is observed that the former scheme could realize a steering angle of 14.5°, but accompanied by high sidelobes, while the latter scheme attains the steering with much lower sidelobes and only a little gain reduction attributable to the sideband power losses. Similar examples of equivalent 3-bit coding for large-angle beam steering are illustrated in Supplementary Figures 6c and 6d.

### A classical chiral spin liquid from chiral interactions on the pyrochlore lattice [^be2ed0d0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Single-tetrahedron spin, Potts, and gauge-field configuration.

Example of a single-tetrahedron minimum-energy configuration for the chiral Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) shown in the Heisenberg spin configuration (a), the color representation (b), the Potts gauge fields, andcolored in red, blue, and green, respectively, in the single tetrahedron (c).

Fig. 3
Allowed color configurations.

Single-tetrahedron ground states S χ of the chiral Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) in the color basis where the colors red, blue, green, and yellow correspond to the spin orientations u 0, u 1, u 2, and u 3 as defined in the main text, respectively.

We note that a spin configuration spanning the entire pyrochlore lattice can be constructed by assigning a spin configuration in Fig. 3 to all up tetrahedra while keeping the down-tetrahedra in an equivalent low-energy configuration. These configurations possess an energy of E 0 = −1.5396 J χ per lattice site.

Numerical simulations

To investigate the ground states and thermodynamics of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) on the full pyrochlore lattice, we perform classical Monte-Carlo (cMC) and iterative minimization (IM) simulations considering systems comprised of 4 L 3 spins with systems of size L = 10. To thermalize our system, we implement a Gaussian single-spin-flip update, an over-relaxation algorithm –, and a multi-valley average between independent cMC simulations inspired by the study of spin glasses. In addition to thermodynamic quantities, we compute the equal-time spin-structure factor.

Figure 4 shows the internal energy and specific heat of the system obtained from a cooling scheme. These quantities smoothly evolve down to low T, with the specific heat plateauing at a value of C / k B = 1 and the energy per site tending to E ~ −1.52 J χ. No signatures of a transition to a symmetry-broken phase are visible. We note that, although the measured internal energy of the system is very close to the value obtained from the single-tetrahedron analysis, there is a small deviation when this is measured in a cooling-down scheme in cMC. We discuss this deviation, as well as the double-bump structure in C (T), in the next section.

FIGURE 1
A, Gray dots depict part of the hexagonal grid in a transverse section of a stack of spirals or echo‐planar readouts. Blue dots mark the revolutions acquired within a shot for N = 1, 2, and 3 shots per k‐space plane. B, The hexagonal grid is described by oblique coordinates. All existing distances between grid points are represented in distances of the origin to points in one dodecant (yellow wedge), including its edges. Blue rings mark the distances reflected in (A), and the red ring highlights a distance not available with integer N. C, This distance is used when tilting the grid with respect to the rotational axis of the stack. The FE lines or spiral revolutions acquired in three subsequent shots are highlighted in red, orange, and yellow. D, The hexagonal grid is tilted as shown in (C). Red and yellow dots mark the points of the hexagonal grid that are covered by two subsequent shots. Green lines in the background show that all points of the hexagonal grid lie on nodes of a finer, rectilinear lattice, from which the starting angle of each spiral shot can be derived. Subsequent shots start with linearly progressing angles. The pattern is repetitive. E, Background: An entire mono‐planar T‐Hex stack of spirals cut open. The uppermost shot and the sites of puncture of the spirals are marked in dark gray. The resulting hexagonal grid shows the tilt as visualized in (C) and (D). In a representative patch, grid points that belong to spiral shots with the same phasing are colored the same. Foreground: Cross‐section corresponding to the stack in the upper panel, the acquisition time point is color‐coded, indicating a smoothfilter. Owing to the cross‐sectional depiction, "holes" appear on the central k‐space axis. In fact, this region is equally uniformly sampled, since all spirals start from the rotational axis of the cylinder

### Rigorous location of phase transitions in hard optimization problems [^d98ebea5]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

It is widely believed that for many optimization problems, no algorithm is substantially more efficient than exhaustive search. This means that finding optimal solutions for many practical problems is completely beyond any current or projected computational capacity. To understand the origin of this extreme 'hardness', computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists have been investigating for two decades a connection between computational complexity and phase transitions in random instances of constraint satisfaction problems. Here we present a mathematically rigorous method for locating such phase transitions. Our method works by analysing the distribution of distances between pairs of solutions as constraints are added. By identifying critical behaviour in the evolution of this distribution, we can pinpoint the threshold location for a number of problems, including the two most-studied ones: random k-SAT and random graph colouring. Our results prove that the heuristic predictions of statistical physics in this context are essentially correct. Moreover, we establish that random instances of constraint satisfaction problems have solutions well beyond the reach of any analysed algorithm.

### A delay in sampling information from temporally autocorrelated visual stimuli [^84e077c6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

There were two conditions in Experiment 1, each with 44 trials that were intermixed within block. The first condition was the Smooth condition where the color of the disks advanced 16° every 108 ms through the selected color ring. The second condition was the Random condition where the color disks changed pseudo-randomly every 108 ms. The selection of the next color was randomly chosen from the color ring of that disk with the constraint that the new color had to be at least 30° away from the previous color. Thus, in both conditions color information changed with the same presentation rate but the relationship in color space across time points differed.

The serial position error was calculated the same way for all experiments. On each trial the difference was taken between the reported color and the cued color as well as every color presented in the seven positions before and after the cue. The serial position error then was determined by the minimum difference (i.e. the color which was closest to the reported value) and translated into milliseconds using the SOA. The trial was excluded if the reported value was an equal distance from the two closest colors presented (i.e. a tie). Additionally, if this minimum difference between the reported color and the color of the closest matching stimulus was > 16° of the 360° of the color circle, that trial was excluded from analysis. The rationale was that such reports are especially likely to be guesses or gross misperceptions of the color. This second exclusion criteria was chosen a priori as a compromise between the Random condition, which requires no such criteria, and the Smooth condition which does in order to avoid edge effects, where the histograms bins at the edges of the minimum color response distribution (i.e. ± 7 serial positions) would be assigned any guess responses from other portions of the color wheel. To check for robustness, additional analyses were performed varying the threshold for both Experiments 1 and its replication. The results are included in the Supplementary information (Supplementary Table 1) with corresponding figures (Supplementary Figs. 3, 4).

In Experiment 1 these exclusion criteria resulted in an average of 5 trials (SD = 3) excluded from the Smooth condition and 7 trials (SD = 2) excluded from the Random condition, per participant. In the replication study, 5 trials (SD = 3) on average were excluded from the Smooth condition and 8 trials (SD = 3) in the Random condition per participant.

### Prospective motion correction improves the sensitivity of fMRI pattern decoding [^2a1a0303]. Human Brain Mapping (2018). Low credibility.

During all runs, including the functional localizer scans, participants were instructed to continuously fixate a central blue dot (diameter: 0.1° visual angle). At randomized time points during the experiment, the dot flashed green for 250 ms at an average rate of once per 3.5 s (with a minimum gap of 1.5 s between color changes). The participants were tasked to press a button with their right index finger in response to every flash to encourage fixation. Task accuracy was calculated by dividing the number of flashes that the participant responded to within 2 s by the total number of flashes. Three participants with lower than 50% response accuracy on the task for any run were completely excluded from further analysis.

2.5 Data analysis

The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of the PMC system for a standard fMRI experiment and its impact on the quality of the data obtained. To accomplish this, several different metrics were employed to study the imaging data quality.

The first three image volumes for each scan were discarded to allow for the signal to reach steady state. The data sets were processed in a standard pipeline using SPM8 (Penny et al. 2011), which included rigid‐body realignment to correct for head motion followed by temporal sinc interpolation to correct for differences in slice acquisition times. Linear and first‐order sinusoidal detrending were applied to the data to remove signal drift.

2.6 Analysis of SPM motion parameters

The realignment parameters were extracted from SPM and collated. In condition P+M+, this measure indicates the amount of residual motion that PMC failed to correct. Comparing condition P−M+ and condition P−M− allowed for quantification of the impact of the mouthpiece. To combine data from all six degrees of freedom into one integrated motion metric per scan, rotation angles were converted into displacement measures using a rotational radius of 5.7 cm (which is reasonable considering the typical head size of an adult, Todd et al. 2015), and the square root of the sum of squares of the resulting six displacement parameters were calculated per unit time.

### A space-time tradeoff for implementing a function with master equation dynamics [^57fa10b0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of physical systems, including systems that implement single-valued functions like a computer's update step. However, many such functions cannot be implemented by any master equation, even approximately, which raises the question of how they can occur in the real world. Here we show how any function over some "visible" states can be implemented with master equation dynamics-if the dynamics exploits additional, "hidden" states at intermediate times. We also show that any master equation implementing a function can be decomposed into a sequence of "hidden" timesteps, demarcated by changes in what state-to-state transitions have nonzero probability. In many real-world situations there is a cost both for more hidden states and for more hidden timesteps. Accordingly, we derive a "space-time" tradeoff between the number of hidden states and the number of hidden timesteps needed to implement any given function.

5) Select the pouch with the blue, red or yellow colors labeled clonidine transdermal system and open it as illustrated in Figure 3. Remove the square to rectangular, tan PATCH from the pouch. Remove the translucent to clear secondary protective liner card that rests over the PATCH.

6) Remove the translucent to clear protective backing from the PATCH by gently peeling it off as shown in Figure 4. Avoid prolonged touching of the sticky side of the clonidine transdermal PATCH.

7) Place the clonidine transdermal PATCH on the prepared skin site (sticky side down) by applying firm pressure over the PATCH to ensure good contact with the skin, especially around the edges (Figure 5). Discard the translucent to clear protective backing and wash your hands with soap and water to remove any drug from your hands.

8) After one week, remove the old PATCH and discard it (refer to Instructions for Disposal). After choosing a different skin site, repeat instructions 2 through 7 for the application of your next clonidine transdermal PATCH.

What to do if your clonidine transderm al PATCH becomes loose while wearing:

How to Apply the ADHESIVE COVER

Note: The white to slightly yellow, round to elliptical, ADHESIVE COVER does not contain any drug and should not be used alone. The COVER should be applied directly over the clonidine transdermal PATCH only if the PATCH begins to separate from the skin, thereby ensuring that it sticks to the skin for seven full days.

The perceived color of a light varies with the background on which it is seen. In the present study, patterned backgrounds composed of two different chromaticities caused larger shifts in perceived color than did a uniform background at either chromaticity within the pattern. Cortical receptive-field organization, but not optical factors or known retinal neurons, can account for the color shifts from patterned backgrounds.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### The non-opponent nature of colour afterimages [^b6a8e108]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Procedure

In each trial, participants were asked to fixate the centre of the display until the moving circle reached maximum colourfulness. Then, they used the cursor keys to adjust the hue (left/right) and saturation (up/down) of the centre circle. The initial colour of this circle was set to a random hue at inducer chroma. During a coarse adjustment, participants could continuously change colours; but before confirming the adjusted colour, participants needed to do a fine adjustment (by holding space). In the fine adjustment, the colour changes by single steps (in radius or in 1 deg azimuth) with each separate key press.

Since the adjustment takes time, observers would see afterimages from the adjusted colour attenuating the perceived chroma of the adjusted colour. Two measures were taken to avoid this: During coarse adjustment, black and white circles (not areas) were extending from the centre of the adjusted disk to its rim. These circles would disappear during fine adjustments to avoid interference with the finalised match. In addition, holding the control key would turn the centre disk temporarily into grey until the key was released. Observers were asked to wipe out unwanted afterimages from the adjusted centre disk using that key before confirming the adjustment. So, they would hold control, wait and move their eyes until the centre disk appeared achromatic. They would then stare at the grey circle until the moving circle reached maximum chroma. Only then would they release the key and compare the colour they had previously adjusted with the colour of the moving circle. Typically, the adjusted colour was too saturated due to the overlaying of its own afterimage during the adjustment. So, participants needed to lower chroma after readaptation. They reiterated this procedure until the chroma did not need adjustment after releasing the control key. Only then did participants confirmed their adjustments by pressing enter. As in Experiment 1, an intertrial period was used to prevent afterimage carry-over across trials.

### The non-opponent nature of colour afterimages [^da003445]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Experiment 1–2.

The first row (a – d) illustrates stimulus displays and task (a), and results (c, d) for Experiment 1. Observers adapt to the inducer display for 30 s (yellow in a). Then the inducer display is replaced by a circle of background grey together with nine comparison colours (purple in a) in a circular arrangement around the grey circle. The grey circle in the centre is perceived as the induced afterimage, and observers select the comparison colour that best matches the colour they see in the centre. b gives examples of afterimage matches averaged across N = 31 participants in Experiment 1a with maximally saturated colours. Discs correspond to inducers, stars to average matches of perceived afterimages. The thin line in the background indicates the cone-opponent direction, the dashed line the prediction of the cone-adaptation model (see Figs. S2a and S3 for results with the other four colours). c, d illustrate results from N = 52 participants in Experiment 1b. The second row (e – h) corresponds to Experiment 2a with the chaser-like paradigm. In (e), the chromatic ring is the inducer. Participants fixate the centre, and the moving grey circle on the ring reveals the afterimage. Observers adjusted hue and chroma of the centre circle to match the moving one. Average afterimage matches from N = 10 participants and overall N = 45 measurements per colour (black curve in f) closely correspond with predictions by cone adaptation (red outline), yielding a correlation (bottom left) between measured and simulated afterimage intensity (i.e. chroma) across the N = 72 inducer colours. The curves in the third column (c, g) show the deviation of the cone-adaptation model (red curve) and of the measured afterimages (black curve) from the colours opponent to the inducers. Correlations between simulated and measured deviations from opponency are shown at the bottom of the diagrams. The correlation reflects the high similarity in profile of the two curves. The hue histograms in the last column (d, h) counts hue responses (azimuth in f) and displays the resulting frequencies as a function of azimuth in a polar plot. The histogram of the measurements is shown by the grey area in the background, and the histogram of the simulated afterimages by the red outline. Panel d provides the hue histogram for the N = 52 measurements for 24 colours in Experiment 1b and (h) those for the N = 45 measurements for 72 inducer colours in Experiment 2a. In (h), a smoothed version of the hue histogram is shown by the black line. Hue histograms feature three clusters that closely correspond with model predictions (red line), hence confirming the results from (c, f, g). Additional results from Experiment 2b with stimuli in DKL space are provided by Fig. S12 of Supplementary Material. The last row illustrates average deviations of different model predictions from measured afterimage hue (i) and chroma (j). The top and bottom edges of each box are the upper and lower quartiles, the line inside each box is the median; whiskers are the minimum and maximum values that are not outliers, and dots outside the whiskers are outliers identified as values outside the interquartile range (box) by 1.5 times the size of the interquartile range. The grey symbols (Noise) provide estimates of noise calculated as the average difference of each individual's measurement from the group mean (interindividual variation) in Experiment 1 and of each single measurement from the mean of each participant (intraindividual variation) in Experiment 2. Chroma has been z-scored to focus on relative differences across hues. Supplementary Movies 1–4 visualise the differences between opponent and afterimage hues (see also section A and Fig. S1 of Supplementary Material).

### Cognitive computational model reveals repetition bias in a sequential decision-making task [^bc693aa7]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Note that most studies that investigate the influence of repetition on value-based decisions use options with either fixed rewards (e.g. refs.), or fixed rewards combined with changing reward probabilities (e.g. refs.). In our task, through changing goals and grid layouts, we transparently vary the (relative) reward of the different options. With this, repeating an option throughout the task is not optimal. This results in a lower correlation between reward magnitude and behavioral repetition.

We selected these four trajectories to represent different principled trajectories that would make it difficult for participants to predict whether the DAS would remain optimal during the duration of a block. All four trajectories started out close to the expected points obtainable by the DAS so that the DAS was one of the best action sequences to select in the initial trials of a block. Only later into the block goals started to deviate from this initial value, or not. For example, one goal trajectory increased after half the block but then decreased again (trajectory ID 1, blue color) while another was remaining mostly close to points obtainable by the DAS (trajectory ID 4, red color).

With this procedure we effectively proposed an optimal sequence of actions at the first few trials of each block that was slowly devalued during subsequent trials. A repetition bias should manifest by increased DAS choices over the course of the experiment for the same expected rewards and should be detectable with summary statistics.

We subdivided the blocks into four segments of four blocks each (see Fig. 2 D). Within each segment all four trajectories of goals were used once in a pseudo-random order so that no trajectory was repeated in two consecutive blocks. This order of goal trajectories was the same for each participant.

To promote the use of the DAS, we manipulated three features of the task. First, at least the first two trials of each block had a trial-specific goal close to the points of the DAS (see Fig. 2 B). Overall, in 43.75% of all trials, the absolute difference between the trial goals and the expected points of the DAS was between zero and five points. Therefore, for these trials, due to the minimum difference of ten points between circles of different color, the DAS was one of the available action sequences with the highest expected reward. In the remaining trials, there was always at least one sequence with a higher expected reward than the DAS.

### Actomyosin pulsation and flows in an active elastomer with turnover and network remodeling [^d47540d9]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

These equations are numerically solved with either periodic or Neumann boundary conditions using a finite difference scheme (see "Methods" section). Initial conditions are small amplitude random fluctuations about the homogeneous unstrained state. The numerical phase diagram, displayed in Fig. 2 shows several new features compared to the linear phase diagram, which we discuss below.

Fig. 2
Phase diagram obtained from numerical solutions of Eqs. 7 and 8. a Effective elastic stress density vs. contractile stress density, with k = 0.1. b Effective contractile stress density vs. inverse-lifetime, with B = 5. The phases are (i) Stable (yellow), (ii) spontaneous Oscillatory (blue), (iii) spontaneous Moving (grey) and (iv) contractile Collapse (light-green). The corresponding kymographs of the bound myosin density (indicated by the color and symbol on the upper right corner) is shown in c, d, f and h, respectively. The regions marked violet and dark-green are the coexistence phases — the oscillatory-moving coexistence (open circle) and the collapse-moving coexistence (open square), with the corresponding kymographs shown in e and g, respectively. Apart from the new phases, the topology of the phase diagrams are roughly similar to the linear stability diagram (Fig. 1b), except for the upturn of the phase boundaries towards larger active stress in b, which arises from the nonlinear strain-dependent unbinding. Symbols are points at which numerical solutions have been obtained. Rest of the dimensionless parameters are, α = 3, c = 0.1, χ (ρ 0) ζ 1 = −0.5, and ζ 2 = 0.1 (see "Methods" section)

M-mode echocardiography — operator settings and variations are outlined: "using rapid sweep speeds of 100 to 200 mm/sec is advantageous for making the most accurate time-related measurements," whereas "Other physiologic conditions that require observation of multiple beats may benefit from a slow sweep speed." "Color M mode integrates the color Doppler image with the M-mode tracing" and "may be used to assist with timing of certain color-flow events within the cardiac cycle." "Steerable M mode permits the M-mode cursor to be rotated" so it "can be directed perpendicular to a structure of interest, improving the accuracy of linear M-mode measurements," though "temporal and range resolution are no better than the 2D image parameters, much inferior to directly obtained M-mode images."

### 3D echocardiography: a review of the current status and future directions [^df3afece]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT3D) left ventricular (LV) imaging and quantification — Simultaneous display of 3 planes (colored red, green, and blue) of an RT3D data set is available, and each imaging plane can be manipulated to obtain the proper alignment for LV volume calculation. LV volumes can be calculated with a 5-point tracing algorithm obtained using 2 planes (4- and 2-chamber views). Plane orientation options are described: the short-axis view can be visualized from the perspective of the apex or base; the coronal plane can be viewed from above or below; and the sagittal plane can be viewed from the left or right. The choice of narrow-angle or wide-angle imaging acquisition modes depends on the cardiac structure to be examined. For imaging of the ventricles, it is best to use a wide-angle acquisition in the apical window (4-chamber) so as to include the entire ventricle, whereas for smaller structures, such as the aortic valve, a narrow-angle acquisition may be adequate. EDV indicates end-diastolic volume and ESV end-systolic volume.

Curved M‑mode strain rate imaging in left anterior descending (LAD) ischemia — image layout and ischemic patterns are described across rest and exercise. Color-coded curved M‑mode images display Doppler strain rate with the cardiac cycle on the horizontal axis and segment location vertically, with the apex at the midline. Increasing rates of shortening are shown in yellow to brown to red, increasing diastolic lengthening in blue, and absence of contraction or relaxation in green. At rest, systolic strain rate is relatively homogeneous except for artifactually low apex values due to interrogation angle. With exercise, basal septal and lateral segments become hyperdynamic (red hue), while mid‑apical septal and lateral segments show delayed onset of contraction and reduced systolic strain rate with prominent post‑systolic shortening (PSS).

### Sensory experience modulates the reorganization of auditory regions for executive processing [^ba9a413e]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

For the working memory task, we used a visuospatial task, contrasted with a perceptual control task (Fig. 1). A visual cue (1500 ms) indicated which task participants should perform. The cue was followed by a 3 × 4 grid. Black squares were displayed two at a time at random locations on the grid for 1000 ms, three times. In the HEF condition, participants were asked to memorize the six locations. Then they indicated their cumulative memory for these locations by choosing between two grids in a two-alternative, forced-choice paradigm via a button press. The response grids were displayed until the participant responded, or for a maximum of 3750 ms. In the control condition (LEF), participants indicated whether a blue square was present in any of the grids, ignoring the configuration of the highlighted squares. Trials were separated by an inter-trial interval with duration jittered between 2000 and 3500 ms. Each experimental run had 30 working memory trials and 30 control trials.

For the planning task, we used a computer version of the classic Tower of London task, (Fig. 1). In each trial, two configurations of coloured beads placed on three vertical rods appeared on a grey screen, with the tallest rod containing up to three beads, the middle rod containing up to two beads and the shortest rod containing up to one bead. In the Tower of London condition (HEF), participants had to determine the minimum number of moves needed to transform the starting configuration into the goal configuration following two rules: (i) only one bead can be moved at a time; and (ii) a bead cannot be moved when another bead is on top. There were four levels of complexity, depending on the number of moves required (2, 3, 4 and 5). In the control condition (LEF), participants were asked to count the number of yellow and blue beads in both displays. For both conditions, two numbers were displayed at the bottom of the screen: one was the correct response and the other was incorrect by +1 or −1. Participants answered with their left hand when they chose the number on the left side of the screen, and with their right hand when their choice was on the right. The maximum display time for each stimulus was 30 s. The duration of the inter-trial interval was jittered between 2000 and 3500 ms. There were 30 trials in the Tower of London condition and 30 trials in the control condition.

7T experiment sequence parameters

The RF shimming calculation was carried out on a single Gaussian or VERSE pulse, producing a single shim which was applied to the whole labeling train. The VERSE pulse was obtained using an approach proposed by Hargreaves et al with a targeted RF power reduction factor of 2, 19 and VERSE was applied before optimization of the weights. This reduction factor permitted the inter‐pulse separation to be preserved. The labeling pulse FA optimization strategy was based on an algorithm by Dupas et al, 20 and was formulated in the small tip angle approximation and in 2D. This is because themap resolution is relatively coarse (4 mm isotropic) and thefield does not change with high spatial frequency in the vicinity of the labeling plane. The pulse calculation was performed on a MacBook Pro laptop (Apple Inc. Cupertino, CA) with a 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 processer (Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA) and 16 GB memory. A spin dynamics matrix, A, was constructed the same way as described by Equation 1 of Dupas et al, 20 including off‐resonance measurements taken from the B 0 maps, transmit sensitivities taken from themaps, and each voxel's position, and the gradient waveforms and RF pulse shape for the Gaussian and the VERSE pulse. The RF shimming problem is then presented as one that minimizes ||| Ab |−θ|| 2, subject to explicit per‐channel and sum‐of‐channels average and absolute power limits, where b is the complex weight of each RF channel in Volts, and θ is the desired FA in each voxel in the ROI. 21 The RF power limit was explicitly incorporated into the optimization algorithm. Therefore, this limit was relaxed to investigate how much gain in FA could be achieved if future vendor updates were to allow for a less conservative RF power limit. A relaxation factor of two corresponds to twice the locally adopted RF power limit being applied. Such RF power relaxations are achieved by changing the constraint of the fmincon function. The RF shims were only applied to the labeling pulses, and no pTx strategy was used to mitigate the excitationinhomogeneity in this study. The FA of the excitation pulse used in imaging was 90°.

### Shearing-induced asymmetry in entorhinal grid cells [^57d11eea]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

Grid cells are neurons with periodic spatial receptive fields (grids) that tile two-dimensional space in a hexagonal pattern. To provide useful information about location, grids must be stably anchored to an external reference frame. The mechanisms underlying this anchoring process have remained elusive. Here we show in differently sized familiar square enclosures that the axes of the grids are offset from the walls by an angle that minimizes symmetry with the borders of the environment. This rotational offset is invariably accompanied by an elliptic distortion of the grid pattern. Reversing the ellipticity analytically by a shearing transformation removes the angular offset. This, together with the near-absence of rotation in novel environments, suggests that the rotation emerges through non-coaxial strain as a function of experience. The systematic relationship between rotation and distortion of the grid pattern points to shear forces arising from anchoring to specific geometric reference points as key elements of the mechanism for alignment of grid patterns to the external world.

### Task state representations in vmPFC mediate relevant and irrelevant value signals and their behavioral influence [^2711acd4]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The staircasing started after a short training (choosing correct in 8 out of 12 consecutive trials mixed of both contexts) and consisted of two parts: two adjustment blocks an two measurement blocks. All adjustments of color-speed and motion-coherence followed this formula:whererepresents the new coherence/speed for motion or color feature i during the upcoming time interval/block t + 1, is the level at the time of adjustment, is the mean RT for the specific feature i during time interval t, RT 0 is the "anchor" RT toward which the adjustment is made and α represents a step size of the adjustment, which changed over time as described below.

The basic building block of adjustment blocks consisted of 24 cued-feature choices for each context (4 × 3 × 2 = 24, i.e. 4 colors, each discriminated against 3 other colors, on 2 sides of screen). The same feature was not cued more than twice in a row. Due to time constrains, we could not include all possible feature-pairing combinations between the cued and uncued features. We therefore pseudo-randomly choose from all possible background combinations for each feature choice (unlike later stages, this procedure was validated on and therefore included also trials with identical background features). In the first adjustment block, participants completed 72 trials, i.e. 36 color-cued and 36 motion-cued, interleaved in chunks of 4–6 trials in a non-predictive manner. This included, for each context, a mixture of one building block of 2D trials and half a block of 1D trials, balanced to include 3 trials for each cued-feature. 1D or 2D trials did not repeat more than three times in a row. At the end of the first adjustment block, the mean RT of the last 48 (accurate) trials was taken as the anchor (RT 0) and each individual feature was adjusted using the above formula with α = 1. The second adjustment block started with 24 motion-cued only trials which were used to compute a new anchor. Then, throughout a series of 144 trials (72 motion-cued followed by 72 color-cued trials, all 2D), every three correct answers for the same feature resulted in an adjustment step for that specific feature (Eq. (1)) using the average RT of these trials and the motion anchor RT 0 for both contexts. This resulted in a maximum of six adjustment steps per feature, where alpha decreased from 0.6 to 0.1 in steps of 0.1 to prevent over-adjustment.

### Large-area patterning of full-color quantum dot arrays beyond 1, 000 pixels per inch by selective electrophoretic deposition [^f4b97391]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Based on the above results, we demonstrated a multi-step SEPD method to construct a full-color QD pattern array. In this demonstration, QDs terminated with PEG-COOH (or PEG-NH 2) were selected due to their stable single polarity electrode deposition characteristic. As shown in Fig. 3c, the in-plane three-electrode substrate (preparation method shown in Supplementary Fig. 24) with applied voltage was sequentially placed into the PGMEA solution containing red, green, and blue QDs (see Methods for experimental details). Then these QDs were successively deposited on the corresponding positive (negative) electrodes. Finally, the RGB pattern array was obtained (Fig. 3c). It can be seen from the fluorescent images shown in Fig. 3c that, the second SEPD process did not affect the prefabricated QD patterns due to the excellent stability of QD films. Moreover, the luminescence characteristics of underlying QD layers were not affected by solvent washing and deposition of another QD layer (Supplementary Fig. 25). In a similar way, red-green, green-blue and red-blue arrays of different shapes were successfully obtained using QDs with different color combinations (Supplementary Fig. 26). Figure 3d, e displays fluorescence images of a large-area RGB QD pattern array after three-step SEPD. The size of every RGB square pixel in the image (Fig. 3e) is 14 × 14 µm, and the spacing between two adjacent color squares is 7.0 µm. Considering Fig. 3e (consisting of 12 RGB pixels horizontally and 16 RGB pixels vertically), the resolution is about 1075 PPI (> 1000 PPI). In addition to the patterns placed side-by-side, exploiting the feasibility of vertically stacking different colored QDs is interesting. Figure 3f shows a fluorescence image of cyan, magenta, yellow, and white tandem QD patterns, formed by sequentially depositing different colored QDs on the same electrode. The spatially uniform patterns of multicolor fluorescence suggest flexibility of the SEPD processes and the potential applications in constructing PL and electroluminescence (EL) layers for full-color displays.

### Point-source irradiation with eccentric rotation causes inhomogeneous dose distribution [^8188be78]. Radiation Research (2006). Low credibility.

Radioactive point sources are regularly used for irradiating cell culture and other biological materials. Eccentric rotation is often used to minimize dose disparities that arise from irradiating samples that span a distance from the point source. Rotation provides a great improvement in dose homogeneity compared to inert irradiation yet still presents an obvious shortcoming for exposures in which the sample completes only partial rotation or fractional rotation. In such cases, certain areas of the sample have a closer average distance to the radiation source than other areas within the same sample. This obstacle can be partially overcome by adjusting rotation speed so the sample traverses a full rotation (or multiple thereof) throughout the total irradiation time. Here we investigate the effects of irradiation with eccentric rotation on dose homogeneity. We show that due to the inverse square law that governs dose, even exposures with full rotation result in inhomogeneous dose distributions. This dose inhomogeneity can be substantial, especially for large samples and small source- sample distances. We observed a 33% difference in survival across 100-mm dishes and a 400% difference for 150-mm dishes. The dose inhomogeneity inherent to eccentric rotation increases the actual average dose delivered across the sample compared to that delivered at sample center. We offer a table of correction factors that account for this dose increase and correct the dose delivered at center to the actual average dose delivered across the entire sample.

### A hierarchical anti-hebbian network model for the formation of spatial cells in three-dimensional space [^81c5a14f]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Since the spatially periodic neurons from the model show less tendency towards the FCC structure (mean is < 50% of the maximum value of FCC score), to check the symmetry adopted by the grids in the model, rate maps are projected on to the three major orthogonal planes XY, YZ, and XZ, respectively (Fig. 3h, i). Sixty degree rotational symmetry is checked on each plane by computing their HGS. Along with the HGS, square gridness score (SGS) is also computed to consider the possibility of 90° planar symmetry. A gridness score greater than the threshold value (obtained by shuffling analysis; see Supplementary Note 2b) on any one of the planes means that the grid cell shows a planar symmetry in the 3D space. Scattering the computed gridness scores on a 2D space of HGS and SGS (Fig. 3j) confirmed the planar symmetry of the spatially periodic neurons from the model. The critical information conveyed by this figure (Fig. 3j) is that the grid activities of the simulated neurons show both square and hexagonal symmetry with a preference for the hexagonal symmetry (55%), and, although a minority (7%), the remaining neurons evolve neither square nor hexagonal symmetry in the model.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### An all-photonic full color RGB system based on molecular photoswitches [^a62cba3a]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

On-command changes in the emission color of functional materials is a sought-after property in many contexts. Of particular interest are systems using light as the external trigger to induce the color changes. Here we report on a tri-component cocktail consisting of a fluorescent donor molecule and two photochromic acceptor molecules encapsulated in polymer micelles and we show that the color of the emitted fluorescence can be continuously changed from blue-to-green and from blue-to-red upon selective light-induced isomerization of the photochromic acceptors to the fluorescent forms. Interestingly, isomerization of both acceptors to different degrees allows for the generation of all emission colors within the red-green-blue (RGB) color system. The function relies on orthogonally controlled FRET reactions between the blue emitting donor and the green and red emitting acceptors, respectively.

### Crystalline metamaterials for topological properties at subwavelength scales [^1e8a649b]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The presence of this double Dirac cone is of primary importance to induce nontrivial topology. Indeed, a single Dirac degeneracy is not sufficient to obtain topological properties in a time-reversal invariant system and the presence of degenerate time-reversed Kramers pairs is also required, or in other words, the band structure should feature two overlapped, time-reversed Dirac cones, as those obtained in Fig. 1d. For fermions, for which the time-reversal operator squares to −1, this condition is automatically fulfilled due to Kramers theorem. Conversely, for bosons or classical waves, the time-reversal operator squares to +1. In systems below three dimensions, this prevents topological properties to be protected by time-reversal symmetry alone. In order to circumvent this obstacle, it is possible to design an effective fermionic time-reversal operator, augmenting time-reversal symmetry with another symmetry operation, such as electromagnetic duality, inversionor rotational symmetry. In this way, as long as this additional symmetry is preserved, we can use the same formalism as for fermionic time-reversal invariant system and construct Kramers pairs. Here, following the seminal proposal of Wu and Hu, we have exploited the six-fold rotational (C6v) symmetry of a triangular lattice, by considering a honeycomb lattice but with a supercell. We now show that very simple C6 compatible modifications of the honeycomb structured metamaterial can provide a physical folding of the band structure and result in the opening of a topological band gap, which allows the emergence of subwavelength photonic states with non-zero topological charge.

### A problem of persistence: still more questions than answers? [^1078e4fd]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2013). Medium credibility.

The current antibiotic resistance crisis has led to increased pressure to prioritize strategies to tackle the issue, with a strong focus being placed on the development of novel antimicrobials. However, one major obstacle that is often overlooked is persister cells, which are refractory to antibiotic treatment. Tackling persistence is a challenge because these cell types are extremely difficult to study and, consequently, little is known about their physiology and the factors that lead to their emergence. Here, four experts contemplate the main physiological features that define persistence and the implications of persistence for antibiotic treatment regimens, and consider what the study of bacterial persistence has taught us about the heterogeneity of bacterial populations.

### The design and implementation of an obstetric triage system for unscheduled pregnancy related attendances: a mixed methods evaluation [^582f38e9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Inter-rater reliability study

Thirty clinical midwives, who had undergone the BSOTS training and were currently working in Triage were randomly selected and agreed to participate in the study.

The lower level clinical midwives were more likely to be rotational than more senior staff, have worked for a shorter time in midwifery, and be younger. There were no other differences between band levels and demographics (Additional file 2: Table S5). Midwives most frequently worked in triage 1–2/week (43.3%, followed by 1–2/month, 36.7%), and rated the tool as extremely (43.3%) or fairly useful (50.0%).

Excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC 0.961 (95% CI 0.91–0.99) was demonstrated (Table 3). Total accuracy was 90.8%, and scenarios with the highest and lowest clinical importance were most consistently assessed accurately. Chi square goodness-of-fit calculation indicated the frequency of incorrect answers for the yellow category was significantly higher than in all other categories [χ 2 (2) = 27.91, p < .001].

d Bootstrap – t utilised to adjust confidence intervals

There was no apparent relationship between demographic variables (e.g. band level, triage experience), and the level of accuracy or inter-rater agreement (p > 0.05). The 'yellow' scenario for reduced fetal movements accounted for 68.2% (n = 15) of all incorrect answers which were consistently an upgrading of risk from yellow to orange risk level. Upgrading of priority (n = 17; 77.3% of incorrect responses) was more common than downgrading (n = 5; 22.7% of incorrect responses).

During the main treatment phase (from baseline [week 0] to week 68), semaglutide reduced body weight more than placebo (Figure 1A and Tables 2 and S1); observed mean weight loss was 17.3% (standard deviation [SD]: 9.3%) with semaglutide versus 2.0% (SD: 6.1%) with placebo (Table S1). After treatment withdrawal, body weight regain was observed in both the semaglutide and placebo arms (Figure 1A and Tables 2 and S1). Participants regained a mean of 11.6 percentage points (SD: 7.7) of body weight in the semaglutide arm versus 1.9 percentage points (SD: 4.8) in the placebo arm (Table S1). The net mean body weight loss over the full duration of the main treatment phase and off‐treatment extension phase (from week 0 to week 120) was 5.6% (SD: 8.9%) in the semaglutide arm versus 0.1% (SD: 5.8%) in the placebo arm (Figure 1A). At week 120, 5% or higher weight loss from baseline was observed in 48.2% of participants (95 of 197) in the semaglutide arm and in 22.6% (21 of 93) in the placebo arm.

### Theoretical and experimental analysis of circularly polarized luminescence spectrophotometers for artifact-free measurements using a single CCD camera [^021ae119]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Robustness and artifacts

In order to characterize the measurement's artifacts with the CCD-based setup we proceed as follows. We first align our setup as well as possible. We take great care to make the two sensing paths as identical as possible (same lenses, same relative position of the optical elements, and top and bottom tracks centered on the camera). The spectrophotometer is also precisely aligned: slit, grating, and camera being parallel to each other, within one pixel. Then we measure the CPL spectra according to our spatial-time procedure (red line curves in Fig. 5). After the removal of the quarter waveplate, we record exactly the same spectra. Assuming no linear fluorescence effects, we should obtain a zero CPL signal. However, because of the geometrical and spatial imperfections described in the theoretical part, the non-zero signal can arise. Mathematically speaking, taking off the QWP makes the Q q (Supplementary Eq. 9) equals to the identity matrix. Therefore, because S 1 = 0 (no linear dichroism) only the S 0 term remains and the recording signals are the artifacts listed in Table 2 (fourth column).

Fig. 5
Measured CPL artifacts.

CPL artifacts of 1 (a) and 2 (b) were recorded without the QWP (green-blue and black). To compare the CPL measured by the four signals combination is plotted in red. 1 is excited with a λ = 450 nm laser and 15 s integration time. 2 is excited with a λ = 365 nm emitting diode and 2 s integration time. Signals are normalized to the maximum of luminescence. The green curves are the signal difference between the two polarization-encoded arms: it images the unbalance of the optical paths. In blue, the signal difference for two measurements delayed by 20 s obtained on the same arm, this is the Δ ϕ light source relative variation. 10 s represents the required time to rotate the QWP by 90 ∘. Black curves result from the spatial-time combination.

### Critical factors in achieving fine-scale functional MRI: removing sources of inadvertent spatial smoothing [^dac9db76]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

3.6 Higher resolution increases motion estimation accuracy

There are other aspects of preprocessing that may not influence the spatial blur directly but are indeed beneficial to the spatial accuracy of the data. In the previous section, we showed how volume upsampling can improve spatial specificity. However, volume upsampling can also potentially improve motion estimation and correction accuracy. To quantify the impact of voxel grid spacing on motion estimation accuracy, we performed a series of tests on synthetic 4D data with known motion. As shown in Figure 7, the difference between the true motion parameters and the estimated motion parameters decreases after upsampling the volume, indicating that a finer grid spacing can increase motion estimation accuracy. Conversely, using a coarser grid spacing decreased motion estimation accuracy, with larger voxels further underestimating the motion. This indicates that upsampling the image volume prior to estimating motion can be beneficial, and then when correcting the motion with the resulting spatial transformations also provides benefits indicated above in terms of reducing resolution losses due to interpolation.
