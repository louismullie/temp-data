## Question

Should you continue fluid bolus when a patient is hypertensive in sepsis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to continue fluid boluses in a patient with sepsis who becomes hypertensive during resuscitation, and how to decide what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is still in the initial resuscitation window or in the optimization/stabilization phase. Then, I should verify the patient's fluid responsiveness and perfusion status rather than relying on blood pressure alone. Next, I will review guideline positions on stopping fluids and when to pivot to vasopressors. After that, I need to consider special populations like chronic hypertension, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and state a clear recommendation with monitoring checkpoints and safety criteria.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and timing, because the phase of resuscitation changes the risk–benefit calculus for fluids. In the first few hours, rapid crystalloid administration is suggested to reverse sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, but after the initial 30 mL/kg or once perfusion improves, the emphasis shifts to individualized, response-guided therapy with frequent reassessment rather than fixed-volume boluses [^1164Az2o] [^113ohx4k] [^1168pvSh].

> Wait, let me verify the key principle here: hypertension during sepsis resuscitation is not a reliable indicator of adequate perfusion or fluid responsiveness. The primary goal of fluids is to increase stroke volume and cardiac output to improve tissue oxygen delivery; mean arterial pressure is an imperfect surrogate and may even rise incidentally as sympathetic tone compensates, so I should not equate a higher MAP with successful resuscitation or a need for more fluid [^114ATPk6] [^113xYFGN].

> I need to check the patient's fluid responsiveness and perfusion status dynamically rather than using static blood pressure. Dynamic tests such as passive leg raise with stroke volume measurement, pulse pressure variation in appropriate contexts, or echocardiography can identify who will increase cardiac output with fluids; importantly, many septic patients are not fluid responsive even early on, and withholding fluids in non-responders appears safe without compromising outcomes when other steps are taken to secure perfusion [^116XQTiT] [^115qcXsx] [^1174rkx8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — what do high-quality guidelines say about stopping fluids after the initial bolus? The Surviving Sepsis Campaign advises that beyond the initial 30 mL/kg, additional fluids should be given as small, repeated boluses guided by objective measures of stroke volume or cardiac output, and that fluid administration after the initial phase should be driven by perfusion parameters rather than hemodynamic variables alone; importantly, there is no recommendation to continue fluids solely because blood pressure is high if perfusion is adequate or responsiveness is absent [^116XQTiT] [^1114EULe] [^115ynsKg].

> Let me consider special populations, because baseline hypertension changes targets and tolerance. In patients with chronic hypertension, targeting a higher MAP (about 75–85 mmHg) may reduce AKI and RRT, but this should be achieved with vasopressors rather than indiscriminate fluids; permissive lower MAP targets can be acceptable in older adults and may reduce vasopressor exposure without harm, so I should individualize the MAP goal and avoid using fluids to chase a number [^115JuLE8] [^1143yEmW] [^112BoBYN].

> I should double-check the risks of continuing fluids in a patient who is no longer fluid responsive or who is becoming hypertensive. Excessive fluid administration is associated with pulmonary edema, intra-abdominal hypertension, longer mechanical ventilation, and possibly higher mortality; fluid bolus effects on cardiac output are often transient in sepsis due to capillary leak, so persisting with fluids can worsen edema without durable hemodynamic benefit once responsiveness is lost [^115EFBDE] [^112ZRHCL] [^111rgkqh].

> Next, I should review when to pivot to vasopressors rather than more fluids. Early norepinephrine can rapidly restore perfusion pressure, recruit venous return via alpha-1 effects, and reduce total fluid exposure; starting vasopressors peripherally is acceptable when central access is pending, and adding vasopressin to norepinephrine is reasonable if MAP remains inadequate or to spare catecholamine dose, especially in vasoplegic shock [^116Pcsok] [^112AAVRd] [^111AYW9B].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. If the patient is within the initial 3-hour window and still hypoperfused, I would give the initial 30 mL/kg in 500–1000 mL aliquots with frequent reassessment of perfusion and fluid responsiveness; if MAP rises but perfusion is adequate and the patient is not fluid responsive, I should stop fluids and avoid chasing blood pressure. If outside the initial window or if hypertension emerges with adequate perfusion, I should halt further boluses, assess for fluid responsiveness with PLR or SV/CO monitoring, and if non-responsive, initiate or escalate vasopressors to an individualized MAP target rather than continuing fluids [^1164Az2o] [^116XQTiT] [^115JuLE8].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special-risk subgroup like pulmonary hypertension or acute decompensated heart failure? In those cases, I need to be even more conservative with fluids because of RV failure risk or pulmonary edema, and favor early vasopressor support and careful preload optimization rather than large crystalloid loads; observational data in PAH suggest that small-to-moderate fluid volumes may be acceptable when hemodynamics are favorable, but decisions should be individualized with bedside echo and close monitoring [^11676xzL] [^1125qQDd].

> I should confirm safety monitoring checkpoints to avoid fluid overload while ensuring perfusion. Serial assessment of capillary refill, lactate clearance, urine output, respiratory status, and lung ultrasound for B-lines, along with dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness, provide a more reliable guide than blood pressure alone; if CVP is rising or organ dysfunction is worsening despite higher MAP, that is a signal to stop fluids and reassess the hemodynamic strategy [^1126bUfo] [^117Mxtuh].

> Final recommendation: No, I should not continue fluid boluses solely because the patient has become hypertensive during sepsis resuscitation. I will stop further boluses when the patient is no longer fluid responsive, when perfusion is adequate, or when MAP is at or above the individualized target, and I will pivot to vasopressors to maintain perfusion pressure while avoiding the harms of fluid overload; this aligns with SSC guidance to individualize fluids after the initial phase and to prioritize perfusion over blood pressure normalization [^116XQTiT] [^1114EULe].

In sepsis, **stop fluid boluses when blood pressure rises above the patient's baseline or if there are signs of fluid overload** (e.g. pulmonary edema, rising JVP, or crackles) [^notfound]. Continued fluids in a hypertensive patient can cause harm, so **switch to vasopressors if perfusion remains inadequate** [^115ynsKg] [^112BoBYN]. Use dynamic measures (PLR, SVV/PPV, echo) to guide further fluids, and reassess frequently to avoid overload [^1164Az2o] [^1174rkx8].

---

## Physiological rationale for fluid administration in sepsis

Fluid resuscitation aims to **restore intravascular volume**, increase cardiac output, and improve tissue perfusion [^1168pvSh]. In sepsis, vasodilation and capillary leak cause relative hypovolemia and maldistribution of blood flow, so fluids can initially improve hemodynamics [^114qKpRA]. However, the response is variable and often transient, especially after the initial bolus [^114P8Wsu].

---

## Risks associated with continued fluid administration in hypertensive sepsis patients

Continued fluids after blood pressure normalizes can cause **fluid overload**, interstitial edema, and organ dysfunction [^117Mxtuh]. Risks include:

- **Pulmonary edema and respiratory failure**: Excess fluids can worsen oxygenation and prolong ventilation [^111CmJoN].

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Positive fluid balance is linked to AKI and higher mortality [^114qKpRA].

- **Abdominal compartment syndrome**: Over-resuscitation increases intra-abdominal pressure and organ failure risk [^111rgkqh].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Large volumes can cause metabolic derangements [^113d9FF3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized fluid management** and caution against continued fluids once blood pressure normalizes:

- **Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 2021**: Recommends at least 30 mL/kg crystalloids within 3 hours for sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, but fluids should be titrated to response and stopped if there is no improvement or if overload occurs [^1164Az2o] [^113ohx4k].

- **SSC 2021 (post-initial bolus)**: Recommends repeated small boluses guided by stroke volume/cardiac output or dynamic measures (e.g. passive leg raise) [^116XQTiT].

- **SSC 2021 (fluid strategy)**: No recommendation for restrictive vs liberal strategy after initial resuscitation; fluids should be guided by perfusion parameters, not hemodynamic variables alone [^1114EULe] [^112Syky8].

---

## Clinical scenarios where fluid administration should be stopped or modified

Fluid administration should be **stopped or modified** in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Blood pressure rises above patient's baseline | Risk of fluid overload and organ dysfunction |
| Signs of fluid overload (pulmonary edema, elevated JVP, crackles) | Risk of respiratory failure and AKI |
| No improvement in perfusion parameters after fluid bolus | Patient is likely non-fluid responsive [^notfound] |
| Dynamic measures indicate non-fluid responsiveness | Avoid unnecessary fluid administration [^1174rkx8] |

---

## Alternative strategies for managing hypertensive sepsis patients

When blood pressure rises but perfusion remains inadequate, **vasopressors** (especially norepinephrine) should be initiated or adjusted to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg [^112BoBYN]. Early vasopressor use can reduce fluid requirements and improve perfusion [^116Pcsok]. Dynamic assessment with PLR, SVV/PPV, or echocardiography helps determine fluid responsiveness and guide therapy [^1164Az2o] [^1174rkx8].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with continued fluid administration in hypertensive sepsis patients

Continued fluids after blood pressure normalizes are associated with **increased mortality**, longer mechanical ventilation, and higher rates of AKI and respiratory complications [^114qKpRA] [^1168pvSh]. Fluid overload independently predicts worse outcomes in septic patients [^115EFBDE].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment strategies

Frequent reassessment is essential to **avoid fluid overload** and ensure adequate perfusion:

- **Clinical parameters**: Capillary refill, mental status, urine output, and signs of overload [^1126bUfo].

- **Laboratory parameters**: Lactate, renal function, and electrolytes [^1164Az2o].

- **Dynamic measures**: Passive leg raise, stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, and echocardiography [^1164Az2o].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Stop fluid administration** when blood pressure rises above the patient's baseline or if signs of fluid overload develop.

- **Use vasopressors** if perfusion remains inadequate despite normalized blood pressure.

- **Guide further fluids** with dynamic measures and reassess frequently.

- **Avoid fluid overload** to reduce the risk of pulmonary edema, AKI, and other complications [^114qKpRA].

---

In sepsis, **stop fluids when blood pressure normalizes or overload signs appear**, and use vasopressors if perfusion remains inadequate. Dynamic assessment and frequent reassessment help balance benefit and harm.

How to personalize therapeutic targets?

Fluid boluses are aimed at increasing mean systemic pressure, cardiac preload, consequently stroke volume and CO, and ultimately at improving tissue oxygenation. However, the therapeutic targets must be adapted to the available haemodynamic monitoring and to the context.

Outside the ICU

When fluid therapy is conducted in the wards, in the pre-hospital or in the emergency department, the clinical examination must look for clinical signs of improvement in tissue perfusion: disappearance of skin mottling, shortening of capillary refill time, which disappears quite faster and might change even after a single fluid bolus. Improved organ function, especially increased diuresis, is rarely available because of the very short observation time (Fig. 1). Although these signs should always be looked for, they poorly reflect CO changes.

The primary effect of a bolus of fluid is to increase CO, and arterial pressure increases only incidentally. Of note, the target of mean arterial pressure may be adapted to the existence of previous hypertension. However, pulse pressure is the one that should be observed to monitor CO changes, because it is the pressure value that best reflects stroke volume. Changes in mean arterial pressure are attenuated, as the sympathetic system tends to keep it constant as CO varies. It is surprising to see that restoring mean arterial pressure can be considered as the objective of fluid therapy.

However, even changes in pulse pressure imperfectly reflect CO, likely even more when assessed through a brachial cuff. Similarly, the decrease in heart rate is unreliable to detect the fluid-induced increase in CO. This is what justifies measuring CO directly, when possible, to better assess the fluid effects.

### Recommendations for fluid management of adults with sepsis in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review of guidelines [^111qPvBh]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Scenario C describes the initial resuscitation, as well as criteria for terminating fluid therapy, in an elderly patient with suspected infection and evidence of possible hypovolaemia (tachycardia, systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg in the context of known hypertension), raised serum lactate and presenting comorbidities suggesting likely fluid intolerance (history of congestive cardiac failure).

Three guidelines gave recommendations that were insufficiently specific to apply to any of the pre-described clinical scenarios. Of the remaining seven, all except the NICE guidelines recommended fluid resuscitation with crystalloid in scenario A. The NICE guidelines do not provide a definitive guide to initiating therapy without a lactate measurement. In scenario B, following non-response to initial fluid resuscitation, two guidelines do not provide additional specific guidance, beyond their initial recommendations to resuscitate liberally with crystalloid. Of the five that do make recommendations, three recommend repeat boluses, whilst the WHO guideline recommends continuing infusion at 5–10 ml/kg/h. The Misango et al. guidelines for resource-limited settings provide a more general recommendation to continue fluid resuscitation to target clinical surrogate markers of peripheral perfusion. Considered against scenario C, designed to assess recommendations in the management of a patient with likely fluid intolerance, two guidelines do not provide any specific guidance regarding termination of fluid therapy in the context of clinical volume overload. Four of the remaining five guidelines recommend clinical reassessment to detect fluid overload and/or pulmonary oedema, with the WHO guideline recommending a reduction in the rate of fluid infusion if clinical signs of overload are present. The Reinhart et al. guideline recommends monitoring of central venous pressure alone to detect volume overload.

None of the guidelines suggested any refinement for patients with malnutrition.

### How I personalize fluid therapy in septic shock? [^117Mxtuh]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

How to customize the criteria for stopping fluid infusion?

Good fluid management should include safety criteria, indicating that the risk of fluid infusion outweighs the expected benefit. These criteria are particularly important in the stabilization phase, after having corrected the initial hypovolaemia (Fig. 2). Two clinical situations may justify monitoring of particular indices.

In patients with ARDS

In these patients, to alert to the risk of additional fluid infusion, one often uses the ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) to fractional inspiration of oxygen (FiO₂). However, it can also be lowered by pulmonary consolidations, shunt related to microthrombi, etc. which are not influenced by additional fluid infusion.

"Sophisticated" haemodynamic monitoring techniques estimate the pulmonary risk of fluid resuscitation more directly. The pulmonary artery catheter estimates the pulmonary capillary pressure, which propels fluid into the interstitium. The estimation of this pressure by echocardiography is poorly reliable in critically ill patients.

Extravascular lung water and pulmonary vascular permeability measured by transpulmonary thermodilution directly reflect the risk of fluid leakage towards the interstitium and alveoli. The maximum value of lung water influences the prognosis of ARDS patients, independently of other severity criteria.

Lung ultrasound evidences interstitial lung oedema by B-lines. While reliable for diagnosing interstitial oedema, its value for quantifying the total volume of pulmonary oedema can only go through a tedious count of the B-lines number. Moreover, it neglects alveolar oedema, so that it poorly reflects total lung water.

In patients with intra-abdominal hypertension

Especially in patients with abdominal problems, the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) should be considered to estimate the risk of fluid accumulation which, via visceral and parietal oedema, increases IAP. Intra-abdominal hypertension impairs the perfusion of abdominal organs, mainly the kidneys, and independently influences the prognosis of ICU patients. This variable must be considered before deciding to administer a fluid bolus during the stabilization phase.

Don't forget CVP!

Regardless of the patient, even if CVP does not predict preload responsiveness, its measurement provides a great deal of information that is often overlooked. CVP is the backward pressure of organ blood flow, and increased CVP levels are associated with organ dysfunction. Limiting the increase in CVP may be a reasonable goal, and it might be justified to target higher mean arterial pressure targets in patients with elevated CVP.

Table 2 — suspected sepsis intravenous fluids (out-of-hospital): we recommend a bolus of isotonic crystalloid for patients with systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg and no signs of fluid overload, with an initial administration of 500–1,000 mL as an acceptable common approach; a balanced crystalloid solution is preferred.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — fluid bolus strategy beyond initial resuscitation: If fluid therapy beyond the initial 30 mL/kg administration is required, clinicians may use repeated small boluses guided by objective measures of stroke volume (SV) and/or cardiac output (CO). In post-cardiac surgery patients, fluid challenges of 4 mL/kg compared to 1 to 3 mL/kg increased sensitivity for detecting fluid responsiveness based on CO measurement. In resource-limited regions where CO or SV cannot be measured, a > 15% increase in pulse pressure during a passive leg-raise test for 60–90 seconds could indicate fluid responsiveness.

### Management and outcomes in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with sepsis [^117VGGXE]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We found that fluid resuscitation may be beneficial in select PAH patients, as increased fluid boluses were associated with lower mortality in our cohort. It is worth noting that two recent randomized controlled trials of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock found no difference in mortality between restrictive or liberal fluid resuscitation strategies. However, both studies only included patients who were very ill with either severe sepsis or septic shock, and considerably more fluids were administered in the restrictive arm (mean 1.27 L and over 2 L, respectively) than were administered to the PAH patients in the present study (mean 0.41 L), and so their results likely do not generalize to our cohort. In the present study, IV fluids were associated with decreased mortality, non-significantly higher likelihood of resolution of AKI and improvement in lactate levels (Supplemental Table 4). Notably, these PAH patients had similar presenting vital signs, brain natriuretic peptide levels, and SEP-1 bundle criteria rates compared to controls. Fluid resuscitation was also associated with significantly early administration of antibiotics, suggesting earlier recognition of sepsis in patients who received fluids and which may underly some of the improvement in mortality, although interestingly time to antibiotics was not associated with improved mortality in our cohort. PAH patients who did not receive fluids had lower lactate levels, higher mean pulmonary artery pressures and trended towards greater RV dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiogram, which may reflect individualized decisions around the fluid management strategy and mortality given the known risks of fluid overload in this population.

Taken together, these findings suggest that systematic fluid restriction may be harmful, but also highlight the importance of careful hemodynamic evaluation and individualized risk-benefit assessment. As there are no current official guidelines for sepsis management in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, these findings provide information of clinical relevance and suggest that PAH patients with sepsis can be initially treated similarly to the general population of patients discussed in Surviving Sepsis guidelines, This includes initial treatment with early antibiotics and fluid administration, with vasopressors reserved for patients who show signs that they would not tolerate fluid administration (e.g. on bedside ultrasonography or physical assessment of fluid status). We also found that relatively small amounts of fluid may be of significant benefit in PAH patients with sepsis, unlike general sepsis patients who are recommended to receive 30 cc/kg of crystalloids in sepsis. Ultimately, our sample size was too small to arrive at concrete recommendations or to explore dose-response relationships, and fluid management decisions in this high risk population should be guided by individualized hemodynamic evaluations.

### Optimizing mean arterial pressure in septic shock: a critical reappraisal of the literature [^116xjPXB]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend that a mean arterial pressure (MAP) value greater than 65 mm Hg should be the initial blood pressure target in septic shock, but what evidence is there to support this statement? We searched Pubmed and Google Scholar by using the key words 'arterial pressure', 'septic shock', and 'norepinephrine' and retrieved human studies published between 1 January 2000 and 31 July 2014. We identified seven comparative studies: two randomized clinical trials and five observational studies. The results of the literature review suggest that a MAP target of 65 mm Hg is usually sufficient in patients with septic shock. However, a MAP of around 75 to 85 mm Hg may reduce the development of acute kidney injury in patients with chronic arterial hypertension. Because of the high prevalence of chronic arterial hypertension in patients who develop septic shock, this finding is of considerable importance. Future studies should assess interactions between time, fluid volumes administered, and doses of vasopressors.

Sepsis and septic shock intravenous fluid management after the initial bolus — panel position: Given the quality of the evidence and the variability among existing studies, the panel issued no recommendation for either restrictive or liberal fluid management in the first 24 hours of resuscitation after the initial fluid bolus in patients with sepsis and septic shock, and it emphasizes that this discussion does not affect the recommendation for the initial IV fluid bolus and that the administration of IV fluids after the initial fluid bolus should be guided by perfusion parameters and not only by a response in hemodynamic variables.

### Systematic assessment of fluid responsiveness during early septic shock resuscitation: secondary analysis of the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK trial [^115qcXsx]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our main findings can be summarized as follows: (a) fluid responsiveness status could be determined in 82% of early septic shock patients by using diverse tests depending on the clinical context; (b) 30% of patients were already non-fluid responsive before starting ICU-based resuscitation; and (c) despite receiving less fluids, non-fluid responders at baseline resolved hypoperfusion in a similar proportion than FR+ patients by following other steps of the protocol with no difference in clinically relevant outcomes. Our results do not support a clear benefit of FR assessment on major outcomes but suggest that withholding fluid boluses in FR− patients appears to be safe.

Fluid overload has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity in patients with septic shock. Therefore, several strategies to deliver fluid resuscitation in a more physiologic, rational, and restrictive way are being tested in ongoing trials. Among these strategies, early use of vasopressor support, and selecting more flow-sensitive and rapid-response targets, could be promising. Systematic assessment of FR might aid in preventing unnecessary fluid administration in FR− patients. However, one major concern could be the potential harm of restricting fluids during septic shock resuscitation. The 30% of patients who were FR− at baseline received around 1000 mL less fluids than FR+ patients during the first 2 h and 1500 mL less during the overall 8-h intervention period. Remarkably, they achieved resuscitation targets in the same proportion as FR+ patients, and exhibited comparable mortality and organ dysfunction improvement. Thus, these data suggest that stopping fluid resuscitation in FR− patients appears to be safe. Nevertheless, FR− patients were more frequently subjected to a protocolized vasopressor test to increase mean arterial pressure target in previously hypertensive patients, and/or to inodilators aimed at resolving hypoperfusion instead of insisting on fluid administration.

### Recommendations for fluid management of adults with sepsis in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review of guidelines [^1148DFXh]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Criteria for termination

Three guidelines gave no specific indication of stop criteria. Others suggested care in continuing therapy but were not specific about objective criteria to guide the decision; for example, " Fluid resuscitation should be stopped or interrupted when no improvement of tissue perfusion occurs in response to volume loading". and "possible repeat volume restitution is guided by the effects". Three guidelines specifically warned of the dangers of fluid overload or pulmonary oedema, with varying degrees of caution: "… even in the context of fluid-responsive patients, fluid management should be titrated carefully", stressing the need for arterial oxygenation monitoring and explicitly cautioning liberal fluids where there was no or limited access to vasopressors and mechanical ventilation.

Vasopressors

Three studies made no specific recommendations on choice of vasopressor. Norepinephrine was identified as the preferred first-line vasopressor therapy in 5 studies. Two studies recommended dopamine or epinephrine.

Starting criteria were not specified in one study. In those guidelines that gave them, thresholds of arterial hypotension were the main indicators on which to base commencement of pressor support, to be initiated after initial fluid management. Two other studies gave non-specific indications as "persistent tissue hypoperfusion" and inadequate "arterial pressure and organ perfusion". Only the WHO guidelines specified a fluid volume trigger for consideration of pressors; 60 ml/kg within the first 2 h. Once commenced, the most common target was arterial pressure of MAP 65 mmHg, with one guideline suggesting higher targets in chronic pre-existing hypertension. Two studies specifically recommended administration via a central venous line using a syringe or infusion pump when available.

### Moderate IV fluid resuscitation is associated with decreased sepsis mortality [^117MZPvy]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has three main clinical practice and research implications. First, the increased mortality rates associated with the very low fluid group support the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's recommended 30 mL/kg IV fluid bolus. While physicians should always consider a patient's individual clinical circumstances, our data suggests that very few should receive less than 2.0 L of IVFD 1. This is consistent with the CLOVERS trial, in which the restrictive arm received a mean of 3.3 L of fluids over the first 24 hours of care. Patients with congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and pulmonary hypertension should receive a lower amount of IVFD 1 (median, 2–3 L) compared with septic patients without these comorbidities. Our data also suggest a patient-dependent upper bound in IVFD 1, above which additional resuscitation is associated with increased mortality for all patients. This is consistent with artificial intelligence sepsis models that have examined IV fluid resuscitation and sepsis mortality. Second, the observed within- and between-hospital analysis suggests that the excess variation in IVFD 1 associated with increased mortality is mostly attributed to physician variation rather than differences in care between hospitals. Critical care guidelines, hospitals, and institutions should target reducing physician variation in IV fluid administration with sepsis resuscitation educational programs and pre-populated sepsis IV fluid ordering sets that suggest both minimum and maximum fluid limits. Third, the reported mortality effects and IVFD 1 volumes should be considered for planning future RCTs. Until comparison between more disparate fluid groups are prospectively tested, physicians should avoid giving volumes of IVFD 1 less than 2.0 L or more than 5.0 L to most ICU patients with sepsis.

### Vasopressor support in septic shock [^113xYFGN]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

When fluid administration fails to restore an adequate arterial pressure and organ perfusion in patients with septic shock, therapy with vasopressor agents should be initiated. The ultimate goals of such therapy in patients with shock are to restore effective tissue perfusion and to normalize cellular metabolism. Although arterial pressure is the end point of vasopressor therapy, and the restoration of adequate pressure is the criterion of effectiveness, BP does not always equate to blood flow; so, the precise BP goal to target is not necessarily the same in all patients. There has been longstanding debate about whether one catecholamine vasopressor agent is superior to another, but different agents have different effects on pressure and flow. The argument about which catecholamine is best in a given situation is best transformed into a discussion about which agent is best suited to implement the therapeutic strategy chosen. Despite the complex pathophysiology of sepsis, an underlying approach to its hemodynamic support can be formulated that takes both pressure and perfusion into account when choosing therapeutic interventions. The efficacy of hemodynamic therapy in sepsis should be assessed by monitoring a combination of clinical and hemodynamic parameters. How to optimize regional blood and microcirculatory blood flow remains uncertain. Thus, specific end points for therapy are debatable and are likely to evolve. Nonetheless, the idea that clinicians should define specific goals and end points, titrate therapies to those end points, and evaluate the results of their interventions on an ongoing basis remains a fundamental principle.

### Physiological changes after fluid bolus therapy in sepsis: a systematic review of contemporary data [^112ZRHCL]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Fluid bolus therapy (FBT) is a standard of care in the management of the septic, hypotensive, tachycardic and/or oliguric patient. However, contemporary evidence for FBT improving patient-centred outcomes is scant. Moreover, its physiological effects in contemporary ICU environments and populations are poorly understood. Using three electronic databases, we identified all studies describing FBT between January 2010 and December 2013. We found 33 studies describing 41 boluses. No randomised controlled trials compared FBT with alternative interventions, such as vasopressors. The median fluid bolus was 500 mL (range 100 to 1,000 ml) administered over 30 minutes (range 10 to 60 minutes) and the most commonly administered fluid was 0.9% sodium chloride solution. In 19 studies, a predetermined physiological trigger initiated FBT. Although 17 studies describe the temporal course of physiological changes after FBT in 31 patient groups, only three studies describe the physiological changes at 60 minutes, and only one study beyond this point. No studies related the physiological changes after FBT with clinically relevant outcomes. There is a clear need for at least obtaining randomised controlled evidence for the physiological effects of FBT in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock beyond the period immediately after its administration.

### Moderate IV fluid resuscitation is associated with decreased sepsis mortality [^111qD8Sh]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We examined physician and hospital IV fluid resuscitation practices for patients with sepsis and septic shock using the Premier Healthcare Database. We found that while baseline patient characteristics predict that patients with sepsis should receive a relatively narrow range of mean IV fluids on day-1 (95% range, 3.6–4.5 L), in practice they received a much wider range (95% range, 1.7–7.4 L). Our findings indicate that being treated by a physician who on average administers a moderate amount of IVFD 1 (4.0 L; IQR, 2.4–5.1 L) is associated with decreased mortality. Moderate IVFD 1 is also associated with decreased rates of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, and new hemodialysis. Contrary to current recommendations to initiate vasopressors early and the common practice of using early vasopressors to reduce resuscitation volumes, we did not observe increased utilization of vasopressors in the lower fluid groups despite increased mortality rates. This may reflect a component of clinical mismanagement as physicians who intentionally adopt a low fluid resuscitation strategy typically supplement fluid with vasopressors to achieve mean arterial pressure resuscitation targets. In a subgroup analysis of patients with baseline heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and pulmonary hypertension, resuscitation with a median of 2–3 L of IVFD 1 is associated with reduced mortality compared with lower or higher IVFD 1. This is consistent with prior work, which demonstrated septic patients with preexisting heart and renal failure experienced reduced mortality following implementation of a sepsis bundle that mandated a bolus of 30 mL/kg compared with lower volumes of IVFD 1. Finally, an analysis that accounted for within- and between-hospital differences found that most of the observed variation in IVFD 1 is attributed to within-hospital physician variation. Physician behavior, independent of patient characteristics that might either trigger IV fluid resuscitation or prompt withholding of IV fluid, accounts for the majority of variation in IVFD 1 practices observed between fluid groups.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^114P8Wsu]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Shortly after administration, most patients respond to fluids in the form of improved blood pressure, but this proportion decreases rapidly over time. After initial fluid bolusing, the amount of fluid required to maintain goal blood pressure varies between patients based upon a number of factors, ranging from severity of dehydration to ongoing fluid losses to severity of illness to underlying comorbidities. Understanding when to continue volume loading and when to discontinue additional fluid administration is of critical importance, since excessive fluid administration appears to be detrimental, as suggested by the association between positive fluid balance and poor outcome in observational trials. A meta-analysis of nine randomized trials comparing "low" versus "high" volumes of resuscitation found no difference in outcome, suggesting that individualization of fluid therapy is desired. The duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids is determined by the amount of fluid administered, capillary leak, and hemodynamic adjustments (including volume adjustments between stressed and nonstressed volumes) resulting from the resolution of compensatory mechanisms initiated during hypovolemia. Very few studies have evaluated the impact of the duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids in critically ill patients, and it seems that these effects may last less than 2 hours. Conceptually, fluid administration improves cardiac output and tissue perfusion. However, it is critical to note that fluid administration yields inconsistent effects in a cohort of patients. As such, there is increasing recognition of the need for individualizing care. Resuscitation by formula is not suitable for achieving endpoints of resuscitation across a heterogeneous group of patients, as varied needs would result in some patients receiving too much and others not enough fluids. Further, although the rationale for initiating fluid resuscitation is the correction of tissue malperfusion through an improvement in cardiac output, in practice, fluids are often administered in order to correct hypotension or oliguria, whereas indices assessing tissue perfusion, including cardiac output, are often not readily assessable.

### Is restriction of intravenous fluid beneficial for septic shock in ICU patients? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114qKpRA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. This condition is characterized by an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. Septic shock is the most critical stage of sepsis progression. The latest guidelines define sepsis as the presence of hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation and the need to rely on vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure ≥ 60 mmHg. The mortality rate of sepsis can reach 50% or higher. Under the new classification of shock types, septic shock is categorized as distributional shock owing to its unique mechanism of occurrence. The pathophysiology of septic shock includes loss of vascular tone regulation and increased vascular permeability, which cause abnormal vascular volume distribution and fluid leakage into the interstitial tissue.

The cornerstone of septic shock treatment is fluid resuscitation and the use of positive inotropic agents as well as vasopressors to increase cardiac preload and organ perfusion. For patients with septic shock, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) expert consensus guidelines recommend rapid resuscitation with a minimum of 30 ml/kg isotonic crystalloid intravenously within the first 3 h. This recommendation is based on retrospective studies and randomized controlled trials on the hemodynamic management of sepsis. However, there is limited evidence to guide fluid management after initial fluid resuscitation in septic shock. Intravenous fluids can increase cardiac output and organ perfusion but may compromise vascular integrity leading to organ edema and dysfunction. Furthermore, fluid overload is associated with higher mortality and increased incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure abdominal hypertension, and abdominal compartment syndrome. It has even been found that during early and adequate fluid resuscitation of patients with septic shock, the incidences of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome can be as high as 82.7% and 40.3%, respectively. Therefore, there is growing concern that increasing the amount of intravenous fluid replacement may be harmful.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^113icEQE]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric guidelines — fluid bolus in low-resource settings: For children without signs of fluid overload where advanced supportive and intensive care is not available, the panel recommends against bolus fluid administration in the first hour if hypotension is not present, and suggests administering up to 40 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10–20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour if hypotension is present; for the subset with septic shock and hypotension, the panel suggests cautious administration of fluid bolus therapy as a weak recommendation based on low quality of evidence. For this weak recommendation, hypotension can be defined as systolic blood pressure less than 50 mm Hg in children younger than 12 months old, less than 60 mm Hg in children 1 to 5 years old, and less than 70 mm Hg in children older than 5 years old, or by World Health Organization criteria of cold extremities with prolonged capillary refill greater than 3 seconds and weak, fast pulse; WHO recommends 10–20 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid over 30–60 minutes, followed by an additional 10 mL/kg over 30 minutes if condition has not improved and there are no signs of fluid overload, cardiac failure, or neurologic deterioration. In a FEAST analysis of children with moderate hypotension, fluid bolus therapy was not beneficial or harmful compared with maintenance fluid only (RR of death = 1.48; 95% CI, 0.61–3.66; p = 0.41), while among children reclassified as meeting all three WHO shock criteria mortality was 48% in the bolus groups versus 20% in the control group (p = 0.07), a very small proportion of FEAST participants (only 72 [2.3%] with moderate hypotension and 65 [2%] meeting full WHO shock criteria).

### Broad spectrum vasopressors: a new approach to the initial management of septic shock? [^117GBfE1]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis remains the most common cause of vasodilatory shock worldwide. International consensus guidelines describe specific recommendations regarding treatment. These include the timing of important interventions comprising blood culture collection, initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics, blood glucose targets, use of steroids, and restoration of optimal hemodynamic status. The mainstay of treatment with regard to restoring and maintaining optimal hemodynamic status is rapid and appropriate fluid bolus therapy (FBT) which, if insufficient, is followed by vasopressor therapy to maintain an acceptable mean arterial pressure (MAP). Despite this approach being a cornerstone of therapeutic guidelines, there is a lack of high-quality evidence demonstrating a survival benefit associated with the use of one vasopressor over another. Although current consensus guidelines recommend norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor, both selection and timing of second-line therapy in refractory hypotension due to septic shock is highly variable. Indeed, in a recent survey of practice, only 14% of respondents cited a predefined dose of the first agent as the stimulus for additional therapy. Selection of the vasopressor agent is also variable and further complicated by the recent data related to a "new" vasopressor, angiotensin II, which is currently only available in the United States.

Initial resuscitation — timing, volume, and assessment approach: Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies, and "we recommend that treatment and resuscitation begin immediately" (Best practice statement). For patients with sepsis induced hypoperfusion or septic shock, "we suggest that at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid should be given within the first 3 hours of resuscitation" (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, "we suggest using dynamic measures to guide fluid resuscitation over physical examination or static parameters alone" (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), with dynamic parameters including response to a passive leg raise or a fluid bolus using stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), or echocardiography. A retrospective analysis "showed that failure to receive 30 mL/kg of crystalloid fluid therapy within 3 hours of sepsis onset was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality, delayed resolution of hypotension and increased length of stay in ICU".

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^115rZTMg]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Should vasopressor agent selection be personalized based on patient characteristics (e.g. home medicines and chronic disease conditions)? A decisional process to determine how to individualize vasopressor therapies does not currently exist. Identifying patient-specific factors affecting organ perfusion and vasopressor response in order to adjust perfusion targets is not commonly used in clinical practice. There is recognition that underlying chronic disease states may affect organ perfusion, yet there is a lack of evidence as to how to guide vasopressor selection based on patient-specific factors in the clinical setting.
2) What should the starting dose of norepinephrine be?
3) Is norepinephrine always the appropriate choice as a first-line vasopressor in sepsis? The data surrounding this recommendation are relatively scant. Is there a potential benefit to use vasopressin as a first-line therapy in select patients with septic shock in the broader population or in a select group of patients (e.g. atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease)?
4) Which agent should be considered as second-line therapy, and does this change based upon patient characteristics?
5) What are appropriate thresholds for adding a second vasopressor agent? Trials comparing adjunctive vasopressor strategies have evaluated different endpoints. Whether adding adjunctive therapies to norepinephrine improves safety and survival is largely unknown. Meaningful clinical endpoints aside from survival may potentially include (but are not limited to) need for renal replacement therapy, new arrhythmias, heart failure, thromboembolic disease, digit necrosis, and quality of life. This is vital to understand since adding an adjunctive agent to reduce the dose of norepinephrine without improving survival or reducing adverse events would result in increased costs, possibly without improving patient-centric clinical outcomes.
6) When should patients receive fluid resuscitation versus vasopressor initiation versus both?
7) When should angiotensin II be initiated? Although the ATHOS-3 trial established the efficacy of angiotensin II as a vasopressor agent to raise blood pressure, important questions remain regarding angiotensin II's role in clinical practice, primarily due to the lack of comparative data and potential safety concerns related to the higher rate of thromboembolism observed in clinical trials to date. Although an argument can be made for the benefits of multimodal vasopressor therapy, more outcome and comparative data are necessary both to determine if angiotensin II is clearly beneficial in subpopulations (such as potentially in patients requiring renal replacement therapy) or is potentially harmful when compared with a strategy that does not use this agent.
8) What is the role of phenylephrine, if any, in the management of sepsis?
9) What is the ideal target MAP in septic patients?
10) How do chronic comorbidities (hypertension, CKD), and baseline medications, impact both goal MAP and vasopressor response?
11) What is the cost effectiveness of different vasopressor strategies? Although cost of care has traditionally not been prioritized, it is a significant factor in the clinical environment where utility and efficiency are measured by stakeholders. Understanding that healthcare economics vary widely between countries, in an environment where healthcare costs are rapidly increasing, evaluations of vasopressors need to factor in costs.
12) How should vasopressor therapies be weaned?

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^115KUzaA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Ongoing fluid administration — assessment‑driven resuscitation for suspected sepsis specifies that fluid administration after an initial bolus should be based on serial assessments of the patient and response to therapy. No singular assessment approach is superior, and we recommend using multiple assessments at multiple time intervals; if using a quantitative resuscitation approach, we recommend dynamic measures over static measures. Up to 50% of patients with septic shock fail to increase cardiac output in response to fluid administration and, when fluid loading does increase cardiac output, the response is often transient; all patients with ongoing hypotension or elevated lactate levels after initial fluid resuscitation need repeated hemodynamic assessment. Because no specific method of hemodynamic assessment is clearly superior in altering survival, we present 2 approaches — a clinical evaluation with basic techniques widely available in emergency care settings and a quantitative evaluation using more advanced assessment methods — and both are reasonable for monitoring and serial assessment; using either method, sepsis assessment should iteratively use multiple parameters to guide therapy. Patients who improve with the initial bolus of fluid are candidates for subsequent fluid boluses using aliquots such as 500 to 1,000 mL, followed by repeat serial clinical examinations to evaluate response and volume overload.

### Evidence for a personalized early start of norepinephrine in septic shock [^116Pcsok]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

During septic shock, vasopressor infusion is usually started only after having corrected the hypovolaemic component of circulatory failure, even in the most severe patients. However, earlier administration of norepinephrine, simultaneously with fluid resuscitation, should be considered in some cases. Duration and depth of hypotension strongly worsen outcomes in septic shock patients. However, the response of arterial pressure to volume expansion is inconstant, delayed, and transitory. In the case of profound, life-threatening hypotension, relying only on fluids to restore blood pressure may unduly prolong hypotension and organ hypoperfusion. Conversely, norepinephrine rapidly increases and better stabilizes arterial pressure. By binding venous adrenergic receptors, it transforms part of the unstressed blood volume into stressed blood volume. It increases the mean systemic filling pressure and increases the fluid-induced increase in mean systemic filling pressure, as observed in septic shock patients. This may improve end-organ perfusion, as shown by some animal studies. Two observational studies comparing early vs. later administration of norepinephrine in septic shock patients using a propensity score showed that early administration reduced the administered fluid volume and day-28 mortality. Conversely, in another propensity score-based study, norepinephrine administration within the first hour following shock diagnosis increased day-28 mortality. The only randomized controlled study that compared the early administration of norepinephrine alone to a placebo showed that the early continuous administration of norepinephrine at a fixed dose of 0.05 µg/kg/min, with norepinephrine added in open label, showed that shock control was achieved more often than in the placebo group. The choice of starting norepinephrine administration early should be adapted to the patient's condition. Logically, it should first be addressed to patients with profound hypotension, when the arterial tone is very low, as suggested by a low diastolic blood pressure (e.g. ≤ 40 mmHg), or by a high diastolic shock index (heart rate/diastolic blood pressure) (e.g. ≥ 3). Early administration of norepinephrine should also be considered in patients in whom fluid accumulation is likely to occur or in whom fluid accumulation would be particularly deleterious (in case of acute respiratory distress syndrome or intra-abdominal hypertension for example).

### Personalised fluid resuscitation in the ICU: still a fluid concept? [^112BJ2Ni]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Future directions

Going forward, we need to focus on several important issues.

First, we need to educate clinicians about the risks of fluid loading patients who are not fluid responsive. The potential of harm caused by fluid bolus therapy should more clearly feature in guidelines. Implementation of a physiologic, haemodynamically guided conservative approach to fluid therapy in patients with sepsis would possibly reduce the morbidity and improve the outcome. The safety, feasibility, and efficacy of targeted fluid minimisation strategies using protocol-guided assessments of fluid responsiveness holds promise, but needs to be further investigated.

Second, we urgently need to go back to the drawing board to design rigorous research to re-examine fluid therapy. The effects of fluid infusion on the immune system, on endothelial function, and on the integrity of the glycocalyx remain poorly understood. Degradation of the glycocalyx on the vascular luminal cell membrane has been identified to be an early step in septic vascular endothelial cell disorder. Fluid therapy has the potential to further damage the glycocalyx, especially when rapid infusions are used and when fluid infusion results in hypervolaemia. In addition to more basic science-type research, we also require experimental studies that accurately reflect the presentation of human septic shock and clinical studies testing either lower volumes of fluid resuscitation or supportive care without fluid resuscitation. Alternatives to fluid bolus therapy for the treatment of shock, such as the early use of vasoactive drugs, need to be further assessed in prospective randomised studies.

### How I personalize fluid therapy in septic shock? [^112MySN5]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Vasopressors may be administered early in some patients

These venous effects of norepinephrine are synergistic with the administration of fluid, which may reduce the quantity of fluid administered for resuscitation (Fig. 2). Observational studies in septic patients suggested that an early start of norepinephrine could reduce the fluid balance, and one of them matching patients with a propensity score suggested a better survival when norepinephrine was administered very early. However, opposite observational results have been reported.

The CLOVERS study randomized patients between a restrictive strategy, prioritizing lower intravenous fluid volumes and vasopressors, and a liberal strategy, prioritizing higher fluid volumes before starting vasopressors. Although less fluid was administered within the first 24 hours, mortality at day-90 did not differ between groups. However, the interventional arm combined early norepinephrine administration with a restrictive fluid strategy, suffering from the flaws of the studies mentioned above, so the prognostic impact of early norepinephrine administration alone cannot be inferred from these results.

Moreover, in this study, patients in whom norepinephrine was administered earlier were not selected. This early administration of norepinephrine should likely be considered in the most hypotensive septic patients, to prompt blood pressure restoration. Also, norepinephrine is likely most powerful in patients with marked vasodilation, as indicated by a low diastolic pressure (e.g. < 40 mmHg) (Fig. 1). The diastolic shock index (heart rate divided by diastolic arterial pressure), which predicts death better than each variable alone, may also be considered for this purpose.

In addition, the effectiveness of a fluid bolus on CO is ephemeral. In the perioperative context, the effects on CO of a 250-mL crystalloid bolus were shown to disappear after 10 minutes. This duration could be even shorter in septic patients, due to vasodilation and capillary leakage. Even if it has not been investigated, the effects of a fluid bolus on microcirculation are also likely transient. Therefore, in septic patients, restoring haemodynamics with norepinephrine probably allows a more persistent effect, although this has not been proved yet.

### Physiological changes after fluid bolus therapy in sepsis: a systematic review of contemporary data [^112YtefU]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Study inclusion criteria

Population of included studies

We considered clinical studies of any type describing a population of patients suffering from severe sepsis or septic shock. We also included those studies of shock or circulatory failure where either the majority of patients, or a defined subgroup of patients, had severe sepsis or septic shock.

Intervention - fluid bolus administration

For the purposes of this study a fluid bolus was a defined volume of a defined fluid administered over a defined time period. We recognised that most studies do not describe FBT in ideal terms (Figure 1) and therefore studies describing at least two of the three criteria were included in the review.

Comparator - alternatives to fluid administration

Any studies comparing FBT with the initiation of vasoactive medication, the increase of such medication or observation as an alternative to the administration of FBT were included in the review.

Between groups analysis

Where studies included in the review assigned patients to multiple treatment arms, each treatment group was treated as an individual group.

Outcome - physiological effects of bolus administration

Subsets of studies were selected from those describing FBT. The first included those reporting changes in cardiac output, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, venous oxygen saturation, blood lactate concentration, urine output or haemoglobin concentration following FBT; for the purposes of inclusion, studies could describe changes in any or all of the haemodynamic parameters listed, but the direction, magnitude and duration of the change had to be extractable from tables or figures contained in the paper. The second group included those reporting non-physiological, patient-centred outcomes. Our primary outcome of interest was mortality at all reported time points. Secondary outcomes of interest included duration of ICU and hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and need for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). We did not contact authors for additional information or individual patient data.

### A critique of fluid bolus resuscitation in severe sepsis [^115AfLgc]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Resuscitation of septic patients by means of one or more fluid boluses is recommended by guidelines from multiple relevant organizations and as a component of surviving sepsis campaigns. The technique is considered a key and life-saving intervention during the initial treatment of severe sepsis in children and adults. Such recommendations, however, are only based on expert opinion and lack adequate experimental or controlled human evidence. Despite these limitations, fluid bolus therapy (20 to 40 ml/kg) is widely practiced and is currently considered a cornerstone of the management of sepsis. In this pointof-view critique, we will argue that such therapy has weak physiological support, has limited experimental support, and is at odds with emerging observational data in several subgroups of critically ill patients or those having major abdominal surgery. Finally, we will argue that this paradigm is now challenged by the findings of a large randomized controlled trial in septic children. In the present article, we contend that the concept of large fluid bolus resuscitation in sepsis needs to be investigated further.

### A high mean arterial pressure target is associated with improved microcirculation in septic shock patients with previous hypertension: a prospective open label study [^115MU4Hk]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations

Our study has some limitations. Firstly, cardiac output was monitored by the NICOM system to minimize operative invasion. Although the most widely trusted technology for measuring cardiac output is still bolus thermodilution, NICOM is found to have similar monitoring capabilities compared with bolus thermodilution. Secondly, the target MAP level was obtained from previous physical examination records or was given by relatives. Although patients with chronic hypertension often undergo more blood pressure measurements in daily life than normotensive patients, the target might be over- or underestimated. Moreover, higher doses of NE may be associated with arrhythmias and other adverse events, which were not observed in our study. Last, but not the least, no assessment of fluid responsiveness was undertaken in our study. NE might have different effects on the microcirculation in patients with or without fluid responsiveness.

It is also important to note that this study is not a controlled study, and lacks a control group and a return to baseline blood pressure. Each patient, therefore, served as his/her own control when increasing MAP from 65 mmHg to the usual level. In addition, the lack of normotensive controls makes the results difficult to extend to normotensive subjects. However, there are several studies focusing on the role of different MAP targets in normotensive patients with septic shock. In a large multicenter, open-label trial, targeting a MAP of 80 to 85 mmHg, as compared with 65 to 70 mmHg, resulted in no significant differences in mortality for septic shock patients.

### Management and outcomes in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with sepsis [^113veGEw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, controls received larger IV fluid volumes within 24 h, while PAH patients were significantly more likely to receive vasopressors within 24 h. This suggests a difference in the approach to initial resuscitation in patients with PAH and sepsis. The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend fluid resuscitation as first line in patients with sepsis and organ hypoperfusion or septic shock, yet PAH patients with hypotension in this study frequently received pressors as the first treatment rather than IV fluid. For example, 5 out of 9 of the PAH patients who were categorized as in septic shock in fact did not receive any fluids.

This difference in management may in part be due to the challenge facing physicians in differentiating sepsis from non-infectious cardiac decompensation in patients with PAH. While all patients presented with at least two of four SIRS criteria, only about 40% of this cohort had positive blood cultures supporting a definitive infectious etiology. These findings highlight the diagnostic challenge that underlying PAH represents in the setting of organ malperfusion or hypotension, and may complicate the optimal volume management strategy given the risk of RV dysfunction with IV fluid administration.

### Fluid therapy for critically ill adults with sepsis: a review [^1168pvSh]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 20% to 30% of patients admitted to an intensive care unit have sepsis. While fluid therapy typically begins in the emergency department, intravenous fluids in the intensive care unit are an essential component of therapy for sepsis.

Observations

For patients with sepsis, intravenous fluid can increase cardiac output and blood pressure, maintain or increase intravascular fluid volume, and deliver medications. Fluid therapy can be conceptualized as 4 overlapping phases from early illness through resolution of sepsis: resuscitation (rapid fluid administered to restore perfusion); optimization (the risks and benefits of additional fluids to treat shock and ensure organ perfusion are evaluated); stabilization (fluid therapy is used only when there is a signal of fluid responsiveness); and evacuation (excess fluid accumulated during treatment of critical illness is eliminated). Among 3723 patients with sepsis who received 1 to 2 L of fluid, 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reported that goal-directed therapy administering fluid boluses to attain a central venous pressure of 8 to 12 mm Hg, vasopressors to attain a mean arterial blood pressure of 65 to 90 mm Hg, and red blood cell transfusions or inotropes to attain a central venous oxygen saturation of at least 70% did not decrease mortality compared with unstructured clinical care (24.9% vs 25.4%; p = 0.68). Among 1563 patients with sepsis and hypotension who received 1 L of fluid, an RCT reported that favoring vasopressor treatment did not improve mortality compared with further fluid administration (14.0% vs 14.9%; p = 0.61). Another RCT reported that among 1554 patients in the intensive care unit with septic shock treated with at least 1 L of fluid compared with more liberal fluid administration, restricting fluid administration in the absence of severe hypoperfusion did not reduce mortality (42.3% vs 42.1%; p = 0.96). An RCT of 1000 patients with acute respiratory distress during the evacuation phase reported that limiting fluid administration and administering diuretics improved the number of days alive without mechanical ventilation compared with fluid treatment to attain higher intracardiac pressure (14.6 vs 12.1 days; P < .001), and it reported that hydroxyethyl starch significantly increased the incidence of kidney replacement therapy compared with saline (7.0% vs 5.8%; p = 0.04), Ringer lactate, or Ringer acetate.

Conclusions and Relevance

Fluids are an important component of treating patients who are critically ill with sepsis. Although optimal fluid management in patients with sepsis remains uncertain, clinicians should consider the risks and benefits of fluid administration in each phase of critical illness, avoid use of hydroxyethyl starch, and facilitate fluid removal for patients recovering from acute respiratory distress syndrome.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^111rgkqh]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 19

Vasopressor agents should be administered to restore organ perfusion as soon as possible if blood pressure is not restored after initial fluid resuscitation (Low-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

If fluid resuscitation fails or is protracted, vasopressor agents should be administered to restore organ perfusion, maintaining but usually not exceeding the aforementioned target for mAP. The initial vasopressor of choice is norepinephrine, which has a beta-agonist effect at low doses but is increasingly an alpha-agonist at escalating doses. Although most patients in shock show improvement in hemodynamics after starting norepinephrine, a proportion of patients remains with a poor clinical response to catecholamines, e.g. requiring large doses (> 0.5 mcg/Kg/min of norepinephrine) to achieve mAP of 65 mm Hg, if the threshold is reached at all. In refractory cases, addition of a second vasopressor may be advantageous rather than increasing further the norepinephrine dose. Low-dose arginine vasopressin (0.03–0.06 IU/min by continuous infusion) has a "catecholamine-sparing" effect, and also reduces mortality.

Statement 20

Fluid overload should be avoided in adults with sepsis or septic shock of abdominal origin (Very low-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

To avoid an adverse outcome, fluid overload should be avoided in adults with sepsis or septic shock of abdominal origin for several reasons. Especially for patients requiring urgent surgical intervention, overly aggressive fluid resuscitation may increase intra-abdominal pressure and heighten the inflammatory response, which is associated with a higher risk of complications. The systemic inflammatory response, increased vascular permeability, and aggressive fluid resuscitation predispose to intralumenal and extravascular fluid sequestration, ascites formation, and bowel wall edema. These changes, if the abdominal wall has been closed, may result in intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (compromised organ function, primarily respiratory and renal).

### Fluid balance and cardiac function in septic shock as predictors of hospital mortality [^115EFBDE]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Other investigators have found associations between fluid balance and outcome in septic patients. Cordemans et al. observed that fluid balance and extravascular lung water index were predictors of mortality in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Maitland et al. studied children with severe febrile illness and impaired perfusion in resource-limited African countries who received either intravenous fluid boluses (20 to 40 mg/kg of body weight) or no fluid bolus. Fluid bolus administration was associated with significantly increased 48-hour and 4-week mortality. A recent investigation evaluating critically ill cancer patients, many of whom had underlying infections, also found that positive fluid balance was independently associated with mortality.

The mechanisms by which positive fluid balance can adversely influence outcomes are not known. However, prolonging time on mechanical ventilation, due to positive fluid balance and increased lung water, could contribute to the development of nosocomial infections and other adverse outcomes. The interruption of genetically-determined catecholamine-mediated host defense responses by the rapid increase in plasma volume might result in a reperfusion injury. Additionally, hypervolemia or hyperosmolarity might exacerbate capillary leaks in patients with septic shock contributing to intracranial hypertension or pulmonary edema. Positive fluid balance could also result in intra-abdominal hypertension contributing to the development of organ hypoperfusion and subsequent organ failure.

### Fluid therapy in resuscitated sepsis: less is more [^1149MoAe]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Fluid infusion may be lifesaving in patients with severe sepsis, especially in the earliest phases of treatment. Following initial resuscitation, however, fluid boluses often fail to augment perfusion and may be harmful. In this review, we seek to compare and contrast the impact of fluids in early and later sepsis; show that much fluid therapy is clinically ineffective in patients with severe sepsis; explore the detrimental aspects of excessive volume infusion; examine how clinicians assess the intravascular volume state; appraise the potential for dynamic indexes to predict fluid responsiveness; and recommend a clinical approach.

### Fluid resuscitation in severe sepsis and septic shock: an evidence-based review [^112UoWuf]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for fluid resuscitation in severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591.

Conclusion

Fluid resuscitation of severe sepsis may consist of natural or artificial colloids or crystalloids. Fluid challenge should be administered and repeated based on response (increase in blood pressure and urine output) and tolerance (evidence of intravascular volume overload).

### Effects of very early start of norepinephrine in patients with septic shock: a propensity score-based analysis [^115kzxCR]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have questioned the clinical benefit of fluid boluses in patients with sepsis and hypotension. In line with this, recent experimental data suggested that fluid resuscitation preceding the start of vasopressors is associated with higher lactate levels and a paradoxical increase in vasopressor requirements when compared with an immediate start of vasopressor therapy without previous fluid administration. Likewise, a number of observational studies suggest that the volume of resuscitation fluids and net fluid balance is associated with mortality in sepsis. Nevertheless, other data indicates that vasopressors should be administered in combination with fluids since isolated vasopressors can improve arterial pressure but not regional blood flow.

An early start of vasopressor therapy may have several beneficial effects. First, norepinephrine may increase cardiac output by increasing stressed volume, by improving myocardial contractility, and through other various mechanisms. Second, norepinephrine might increase microcirculatory perfusion in septic shock, especially when the baseline microcirculatory blood flow is abnormal. Third, early use of norepinephrine may improve the regional distribution of blood flow and prevent fluid overload. Finally, delays in correcting hypotension are associated with increased risk of death in septic patients, whereby prompt correction of hypotension might influence clinical outcomes. Indeed, a recent phase II randomized controlled trial suggested that early use of norepinephrine might improve the possibility to achieve more sustained mean arterial pressure levels and adequate tissue perfusion parameters. However, this trial was limited by a specificity of the protocol requesting administration of a fixed dose of vasopressors in the early group, which is not the usual way of administering vasopressors.

Since the optimal timing of the introduction of vasopressors remains unknown and whether the benefits or harm of vasopressor introduction even preceding fluid resuscitation has not been still answered, we evaluated the impact of very early and the concurrent start of vasopressor support and fluid resuscitation on clinical outcomes in patients with septic shock.

### Non-invasive assessment of fluid responsiveness to guide fluid therapy in patients with sepsis in the emergency department: a prospective cohort study [^1174jEwG]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we found that a (standardised) fluid bolus in patients with sepsis presenting to the ED did not increase (non-invasively measured) CI in the majority of the patients. Surprisingly, we found that only 23% of the ED patients demonstrated a > 15% increase in CI, which is generally accepted as a cut-off value for a clinically relevant change. Responsiveness to fluid, as measured by CI, was strongly correlated with a PLR performed prior to the fluid bolus. However, static measurements of cardiac indices were not predictive of fluid responsiveness.

Fluid therapy for sepsis has become more restrictive over the recent years after publication of the ProMISE, ARISE, Process and FEAST trials that showed no benefit of early goal directed therapy, or even potential harm of fluid bolus administration. However, to date most guidelinesstill recommend early intravenous fluid administration to hypotensive sepsis patients to correct overt hypovolemia under the presumption that this may improve CO, oxygen delivery and organ function. In these guidelines, the administration of an initial intravenous crystalloid bolus of up to 30 mL/kg of body weight is recommended as a reasonable first step in the haemodynamic management of an adult patient with septic shock. These guidelines, however, do not provide clear recommendations for patients with sepsis who are not in shock: Although some guidelines mention that intravenous fluids should be considered, it is not mentioned when, nor how much fluids should be administered.

### Early goal-directed resuscitation of patients with septic shock: current evidence and future directions [^117RRzT1]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The optimal timing of vasopressors relative to fluid infusion remains more controversial. Recently, a large multi-center observational study was undertaken in Canada, the United States, and Saudi Arabia to address this question. In a retrospective analysis of 2,849 patients with septic shock, investigators found that mortality was lowest when vasopressors were delayed by 1 hour and infused from hours 1 to 6 following onset of shock. These findings are consistent with those of other retrospective cohort studies that support the early initiation of vasopressors. This approach may decrease the volume of fluids necessary to maintain blood pressure. Indeed, patients in the recent ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe trials were more likely to receive vasopressors and required less fluids than patients in the original study by Rivers and colleagues (Table 2). Still, prospective randomized trials are needed to elucidate the optimal timing of vasopressors and volume of fluids during initial resuscitation.

### Effects of very early start of norepinephrine in patients with septic shock: a propensity score-based analysis [^112Pewt4]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Early detection and prompt reversion of sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion are key elements in the treatment of patients with septic shock. Fluid administration is widely accepted as the first-line therapy followed by vasopressor use in persistently hypotensive patients or in those in whom arterial pressure is judged to be insufficient to ensure an adequate tissue perfusion. Studies on implementation of therapeutic bundles in sepsis and recent randomized controlled trials on early goal-directed therapy in septic shock highlighted the importance of the initial fluid loading and turned this into a standard for the clinical practice. Indeed, current guidelines on sepsis management emphasize on the administration of at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloids within the first 3 h of identification of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, but a recommendation on the timing to start vasopressor support was not clearly stated. Nevertheless, a recent update on the last recommendations of Surviving Sepsis Campaign claims for an immediate start of resuscitation and treatment in a "1-h bundle" including the use of vasopressors in the case of life-threatening hypotension, during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg. Although this initiative embraces the concept of sepsis as a medical emergency, the level of evidence for these recommendations is quite limited and remains debatable.

### Practical considerations in sepsis resuscitation [^115d89JC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common condition managed in the emergency department, and the majority of patients respond to resuscitation measures, including antibiotics and i.v. fluids. However, a proportion of patients will fail to respond to standard treatment.

Objective

This review elucidates practical considerations for management of sepsis in patients who fail to respond to standard treatment.

Discussion

Early goal-directed therapy revolutionized sepsis management. However, there is a paucity of literature that provides a well-defined treatment algorithm for patients who fail to improve with therapy. Refractory shock can be defined as continued patient hemodynamic instability (mean arterial pressure, ≤ 65 mm Hg, lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L, altered mental status) after adequate fluid loading (at least 30 mL/kg i.v.), the use of two vasopressors (with one as norepinephrine), and provision of antibiotics. When a lack of improvement is evident in the early stages of resuscitation, systematically considering source control, appropriate volume resuscitation, adequate antimicrobial coverage, vasopressor selection, presence of metabolic pathology, and complications of resuscitation, such as abdominal compartment syndrome and respiratory failure, allow emergency physicians to address the entire clinical scenario.

Conclusions

The care of sepsis has experienced many changes in recent years. Care of the patient with sepsis who is not responding appropriately to initial resuscitation is troublesome for emergency physicians. This review provides practical considerations for resuscitation of the patient with septic shock. When a septic patient is refractory to standard therapy, systematically evaluating the patient and clinical course may lead to improved outcomes.

Red Cross guidelines — initial resuscitation of adults with sepsis and septic shock state that patients "should be treated immediately and resuscitated, to include:" administering at least 30 milliliters per kilogram of intravenous crystalloid fluid within the first 3 hours of resuscitation of patients with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or septic shock and use of dynamic parameters, such as response to passive leg raise or fluid bolus, stroke volume variation or pulse pressure variation over static parameters or physical examination alone to guide fluid resuscitation. They also include using capillary refill time as an adjunct to other measures of perfusion to help guide resuscitation, with use of capillary refill time to guide resuscitation accompanied by frequent and repeated comprehensive patient evaluation to predict or improve early recognition of fluid overload. Additional guidance includes using a decrease in serum lactate to help guide fluid resuscitation of patients with an elevated lactate level and using an initial target mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg for septic shock requiring vasopressors.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1125qQDd]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis, a life-threatening syndrome resulting from a dysregulated host response to infection, continues to be a significant global health concern. Timely and appropriate fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of sepsis management. According to the latest guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC), it is still recommended to administer an initial intravenous (IV) 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus within 3 h for septic patients with hypotension, indiscriminate of comorbidities. However, it is important to note that this recommendation is primarily based on several early observational studies. Despite being endorsed in the SSC guidelines, it is considered a weak recommendation with low-quality evidence.

The lack of consideration in this standard fluid resuscitation dose for the heterogeneity among patient populations, particularly those with heart failure (HF), is a significant concern. This one-size-fits-all fluid resuscitation strategy fails to acknowledge the complexities associated with specific comorbidities. Patients with HF may respond differently to excessive fluid resuscitation due to compromised cardiac function, potentially leading to an increased risk of further deterioration.

Limited literature exists regarding fluid resuscitation in septic patients with comorbid HF. However, the available evidence tends to support guideline recommendations. Despite the inclination to align with the recommended 30 mL/kg resuscitation volume in sepsis guidelines, there is still a critical gap in understanding whether this approach is suitable for the heterogeneous population of patients with varying degrees of HF. Real-world clinical practice shows that septic patients with HF often receive less fluid resuscitation or experience delays in achieving the recommended 30 mL/kg target. These deviations from guidelines may have different impacts on patient outcomes, highlighting clinicians' concerns regarding fluid resuscitation in this population.

In the case of a septic patient with HF, there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the appropriate amount of fluid resuscitation and its tolerability. Our study aims to address this knowledge gap by examining the relationship between initial fluid resuscitation volumes and mortality rates in septic patients with HF. Our study specifically examines the impact of early fluid dosing in septic patients with ADHF, a scenario that presents unique challenges compared to stable chronic HF. While the overall prevalence of HF in sepsis is well-documented, the acute decompensation superimposed on sepsis is less studied, and our work aims to fill this gap. By focusing on this distinct subset of patients, we aim to provide more nuanced insights into fluid management strategies that could potentially improve clinical outcomes.

### Evolving management practices for early sepsis-induced hypoperfusion: a narrative review [^115i13zs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Resuscitation is a cornerstone of management. This review covers five areas of evolving practice in the management of early sepsis-induced hypoperfusion: fluid resuscitation volume, timing of vasopressor initiation, resuscitation targets, route of vasopressor administration, and use of invasive blood pressure monitoring. For each topic, we review the seminal evidence, discuss the evolution of practice over time, and highlight questions for additional research. Intravenous fluids are a core component of early sepsis resuscitation. However, with growing concerns about the harms of fluid, practice is evolving toward smaller-volume resuscitation, which is often paired with earlier vasopressor initiation. Large trials of fluid-restrictive, vasopressor-early strategies are providing more information about the safety and potential benefit of these approaches. Lowering blood pressure targets is a means to prevent fluid overload and reduce exposure to vasopressors; mean arterial pressure targets of 60–65 mm Hg appear to be safe, at least in older patients. With the trend toward earlier vasopressor initiation, the need for central administration of vasopressors has been questioned, and peripheral vasopressor use is increasing, although it is not universally accepted. Similarly, although guidelines suggest the use of invasive blood pressure monitoring with arterial catheters in patients receiving vasopressors, blood pressure cuffs are less invasive and often sufficient. Overall, the management of early sepsis-induced hypoperfusion is evolving toward fluid-sparing and less-invasive strategies. However, many questions remain, and additional data are needed to further optimize our approach to resuscitation.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^1143yEmW]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

When administering vasopressors, blood pressure targets have been evaluated in a number of different studies. The SEPSIS-SPAM trial found that there was no difference in mortality when comparing a MAP target of 65–70 mm Hg to a MAP target of 80–85 mm Hg. Notably, increasing MAP goal in patients with chronic hypertension led to reduced need for renal replacement therapy. However, targeting a higher MAP was associated with a greater occurrence of atrial fibrillation. A pooled analysis reported that targeting higher MAP targets is associated with higher mortality in patients treated with vasopressors for more than 6 hours. More recently, a randomized trial comparing permissive hypotension (MAP 60–65) compared with usual care (defined as at the discretion of the treating clinicians allowing a more personalized approach) demonstrated no difference in mortality with a trend toward improved mortality in the former group. Of note, mean MAP was 66.7 mm Hg in the permissive hypotension group and 72.6 mm Hg in the usual care group. The 65 Trial sought to determine optimal MAP target in a cohort of patients greater than or equal to 65 years old by randomizing subjects to a strategy of permissive hypotension (MAP target of 60–65 mm Hg) or usual care in the ICU to determine a difference of all-cause mortality at 90 days. Importantly, this was a trial in the ICU setting following adequate fluid resuscitation as assessed by treating clinicians. At the conclusion of the trial, there was no difference in mortality although a notable difference in the point estimate (–2.85%; 95% CI, –6.75 to 1.05; p = 0.15). In the subgroup of patients with chronic hypertension (n = 1,131), there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the permissive hypotension strategy (adjusted odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–0.88; p = 0.047). Although the 65 Trial did not yield a conclusive result, it did reinforce the logic that treatment goals need to be personalized to individual patients and that a lower MAP target may be acceptable and counterintuitively may be beneficial in elderly patients with chronic hypertension at baseline.

Hypovolemia is frequent in patients with sepsis and may contribute to worse outcome. The management of these patients is impeded by the low quality of the evidence for many of the specific components of the care. In this paper, we discuss recent advances and controversies in this field and give expert statements for the management of hypovolemia in patients with sepsis including triggers and targets for fluid therapy and volumes and types of fluid to be given. Finally, we point to unanswered questions and suggest a roadmap for future research.

### Fluid response evaluation in sepsis hypotension and shock: a randomized clinical trial [^1174rkx8]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluid and vasopressor management in septic shock remains controversial. In this randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy of dynamic measures (stroke volume change during passive leg raise) to guide resuscitation and improve patient outcome.

Research Question

Will resuscitation that is guided by dynamic assessments of fluid responsiveness in patients with septic shock improve patient outcomes?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial at 13 hospitals in the United States and United Kingdom. Patients presented to EDs with sepsis that was associated hypotension and anticipated ICU admission. Intervention arm patients were assessed for fluid responsiveness before clinically driven fluid bolus or increase in vasopressors occurred. The protocol included reassessment and therapy as indicated by the passive leg raise result. The control arm received usual care. The primary clinical outcome was positive fluid balance at 72 hours or ICU discharge, whichever occurred first.

Results

In modified intent-to-treat analysis that included 83 intervention and 41 usual care eligible patients, fluid balance at 72 hours or ICU discharge was significantly lower (−1.37 L favoring the intervention arm; 0.65 ± 2.85 L intervention arm vs 2.02 ± 3.44 L usual care arm; p = 0.021. Fewer patients required renal replacement therapy (5.1% vs 17.5%; p = 0.04) or mechanical ventilation (17.7% vs 34.1%; p = 0.04) in the intervention arm compared with usual care. In the all-randomized intent-to-treat population (102 intervention, 48 usual care), there were no significant differences in safety signals.

Interpretation

Physiologically informed fluid and vasopressor resuscitation with the use of the passive leg raise-induced stroke volume change to guide management of septic shock is safe and demonstrated lower net fluid balance and reductions in the risk of renal and respiratory failure. Dynamic assessments to guide fluid administration may improve outcomes for patients with septic shock compared with usual care.

### Management and outcomes in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with sepsis [^11676xzL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This was a retrospective study characterizing patients with PAH who presented with sepsis compared to propensity weighted controls without PAH. Patients with underlying PAH had high mortality, received lower volume of fluids during initial resuscitation, and had higher rates of vasopressor use compared to controls. Among PAH patients, those who received fluid resuscitation had improved mortality and shorter time to antibiotics. These findings reflect the challenges around early fluid resuscitation in PAH patients presenting with sepsis, weighing the risks of precipitating RV decompensation against under-resuscitation. Individualized assessment around fluid administration and dynamic hemodynamic evaluation is warranted. These findings also suggest that early identification of sepsis in these patients is critical in shortening time to antibiotics. Further research is needed to help guide decision-making around early fluid management in patients with PAH presenting with sepsis.

### Efficacy of targeting high mean arterial pressure for older patients with septic shock (OPTPRESS): a multicentre, pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^115VjmNe]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a major health care challenge worldwide. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis with a high mortality rate of approximately 38.5% even in developed countries; it is characterised by sustained hypotension despite adequate fluid infusion and requires immediate stabilisation of patient haemodynamics. However, the optimal target blood pressure, a key factor in circulatory management for septic shock, remains debatable.

Recent randomised trials in Europe and North America showed that a target MAP of > 65 mmHg in vasodilatory shock is not always beneficial. However, targeting an MAP of 80–85 mmHg was suggested to benefit septic shock patients with chronic hypertension in some studies. A previous trial suggested that a lower target MAP of 60–65 mmHg is preferable in older patients; fewer than half of the participants in the trial had septic shock, and subgroup analysis reported that the effect of target blood pressure varied by disease. Since autoregulation controlling organ perfusion varies depending on patient demographics, disease type, and severity, the effect of the target MAP requires further examination in the population that has not been examined in previous trials regarding race, disease specificity, or prevalence of chronic hypertension. Additionally, since the results of previous trials might have been affected by catecholamine-related adverse events, the effect of a high-target MAP should be examined using a protocol minimising catecholamine dosage.

Therefore, we conducted a randomised trial evaluating the effects of high-target MAP, using a protocol of early concomitant use of vasopressin, in patients with septic shock aged ≥ 65 years in Japan in those the reported prevalence of chronic hypertension was 66.9%, according to a national survey.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^115LhiBg]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Septic shock vasopressors — agent choice, targets, and access: Norepinephrine is an excellent first-line vasopressor for patients with septic shock, and early vasopressors can be administered through a well-secured nondistal peripheral IV catheter. We recommend titrating vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65 mm Hg unless the patient has baseline hypertension and evidence of hypoperfusion with a MAP of more than 65, and adding vasopressin (0.03 to 0.04 U/min) is a reasonable approach to reduce norepinephrine requirements and decrease complications, especially at high doses. In patients with ongoing hypotension despite high doses of norepinephrine, or in patients with echocardiographic evidence of myocardial depression, epinephrine is a second-line vasopressor and inotropic agent. Current limited data suggest that early administration of peripheral norepinephrine through large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters for short intervals with appropriate monitoring is safe during resuscitation, and clinicians should consider titration to improve markers of organ perfusion (urine output, lactate) in patients with baseline hypertension.

### Personalised fluid resuscitation in the ICU: still a fluid concept? [^111CmJoN]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Finally, FBT carries a significant potential for harm, especially if used indiscriminately. Rather alarmingly, clinicians do not appear to be particularly good at determining whether a patient will benefit from the administration of a fluid bolus, especially when basing this decision on clinical examination and static haemodynamic indices such as central venous pressure. In studies summarised in a review by Michard and Teboul in 2002, around 50% of patients who received a fluid bolus based on clinical signs and static haemodynamic measurements such as central venous pressure turned out to be not fluid responsive. In other words, the decision-making process to administer a fluid bolus was not much better than tossing a coin. Another important conclusion based on that observation is that we may be causing harm in about 50% of our patients who are given a fluid bolus in error. Fluid resuscitation therefore should ideally be based on dynamic indices of fluid responsiveness, such as stroke volume or pulse pressure variation, but the presence of arrhythmias and spontaneous breathing activity and the use of lung protective ventilation may preclude these indices from being used. The easy-to-perform passive leg raising test has been well validated in situations where these dynamic indices cannot be used reliably in the intensive care environment. Bedside echocardiography and the recently described end-expiratory occlusion test are other means to identify preload responsiveness. The dynamic tests are complementary, and clinicians should choose between them based on the status of the patient and the cardiac output monitoring technique. Unfortunately, this approach does not seem to be routinely practiced in the real world. Clinicians do not widely use measures of fluid responsiveness in their usual practice, as evidenced by the earlier referenced observational FENICE study. Not only was prediction of fluid responsiveness not used routinely, safety limits for FBT were also rarely used. Even more concerning was the observation in this study that there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who received further fluids after the previous fluid bolus between those with a positive, with an uncertain, or with a negatively judged response to fluids. In other words, patients who were proven to be not fluid responsive continued to receive the same amount of subsequent fluid boluses as did fluid responsive patients. This practice undoubtedly increases the risk of fluid overload in critically ill patients. As already mentioned, FBT has been shown to independently contribute to a cumulative positive fluid balance, with associated organ failure. An increasing number of studies link fluid overload in septic patients to worse outcomes. The ARDS Network Fluids and Catheters Treatment Trial showed that a conservative fluid strategy may improve patient outcomes. In this study, 1000 patients with acute lung injury were randomised into a conservative and a liberal strategy of fluid management using explicit protocols, which were applied for 7 days. Patients in the conservative strategy arm showed significantly improved lung function and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care without increasing non-pulmonary organ failures.

### Evidence for a personalized early start of norepinephrine in septic shock [^1143VCCo]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

During septic shock, vasopressors, first and foremost norepinephrine, are administered to restore tissue perfusion pressure. For a long time, the rule was to start vasopressors only after correcting the hypovolaemic component of circulatory failure, even in most severe patients. However, starting norepinephrine earlier, simultaneously with fluid resuscitation, should be considered. Initiating infusion peripherally may avoid delays in norepinephrine administration, as recognized by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. As this attitude is safe when low doses are used, the real question is: what may be the advantages of early start of norepinephrine?

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^113KRqXV]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Overview of the Presentation

The three fluid and vasopressor questions identified by the Task Force as a whole are as follows:

1) What are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?
2) What is the optimal fluid for sepsis resuscitation?
3) What is the optimal approach to selection, dose titration, and escalation of vasopressor therapy?

The format for each of the three questions directly mirrors that used in the previously published overview, which contains a more extensive description of the methods. One question was assigned to each author for review and summary. The presentation of each question is followed by a critique of the existing evidence of what is currently known of the subject. Subsequently, each author presented what is not known regarding each question and the gaps in our current understanding of the subject. For each question, the suggested research questions are iterative and aim to address broad areas of uncertainty. Accordingly, clinical outcomes may need to be refined to not only determine mortality benefit but also inform stakeholders on relevant outcomes of interest, such as, quality of life, organ function, and resource utilization. Finally, each author concluded their overarching question by presenting a proposed list of research questions deemed worthy of further inquiry. This list of questions was purposefully intended to be exhaustive, and the authors acknowledge that they may not be answered in the coming decade but are necessary to describe so as to provide a roadmap for where research efforts should be directed.

Question 1: What Are Ideal Endpoints for Volume Resuscitation and How Should Volume Resuscitation Be Titrated?

What is known.

The rationale for fluid resuscitation is largely derived from multiple experimental and clinical studies. Fluid resuscitation increases cardiac output, at least at the early stages of sepsis. In addition, fluid resuscitation increases microvascular perfusion in patients with septic shock, and this is associated with improved organ function.

The impact of fluid resuscitation on outcome is less obvious and is mostly supported by experimental data. Large-scale interventional trials investigating goal-directed therapy did not directly address the amount, timing, or guiding clinical variables beyond central venous oxygenation (Sc 2). In preclinical models of sepsis, fluid administration prolongs survival time compared with no fluid resuscitation, even though long-term outcomes could not be evaluated from these types of studies. Specifically, out-of-hospital fluid administration during transport by paramedics is associated with an improved outcome in hypotensive patients (19), it has not been associated with a benefit, and it may even be associated with increased mortality, in normotensive patients.

### Recommendations for fluid management of adults with sepsis in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review of guidelines [^114sL7Rc]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis guidelines are widely used in high-income countries and intravenous fluids are an important supportive treatment modality. However, fluids have been harmful in intervention trials in low-income countries, most notably in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the relevance, quality and applicability of available guidelines for the fluid management of adult patients with sepsis in this region.

Methods

We identified sepsis guidelines by systematic review with broad search terms, duplicate screening and data extraction. We included peer-reviewed publications with explicit relevance to sepsis and fluid therapy. We excluded those designed exclusively for specific aetiologies of sepsis, for limited geographic locations, or for non-adult populations. We used the AGREE II tool to assess the quality of guideline development, performed a narrative synthesis and used theoretical case scenarios to assess practical applicability to everyday clinical practice in resource-constrained settings.

Results

Published sepsis guidelines are heterogeneous in sepsis definition and in quality: 8/10 guidelines had significant deficits in applicability, particularly with reference to resource considerations in low-income settings. Indications for intravenous fluid were hypotension (8/10), clinical markers of hypoperfusion (6/10) and lactataemia (3/10). Crystalloids were overwhelmingly recommended (9/10). Suggested volumes varied; 5/10 explicitly recommended "fluid challenges" with reassessment, totalling between 1L and 4L during initial resuscitation. Fluid balance, including later de-escalation of therapy, was not specifically described in any. Norepinephrine was the preferred initial vasopressor (5/10), specifically targeted to MAP > 65mmHg (3/10), with higher values suggested in pre-existing hypertension (1/10). Recommendations for guidelines were almost universally derived from evidence in high-income countries. None of the guidelines suggested any refinement for patients with malnutrition.

Conclusions

Widely used international guidelines contain disparate recommendations on intravenous fluid use, lack specificity and are largely unattainable in low-income countries given available resources. A relative lack of high-quality evidence from sub-Saharan Africa increases reliance on recommendations which may not be relevant or implementable.

Sepsis early care — intravenous fluid and timing of vasopressors — We agree with delivering an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus during initial management of patients who have hypotension or findings of hypoperfusion absent signs of fluid overload. We do not support a prespecified volume or body mass–adjusted volume of fluid for all patients, though we recognize many patients benefit from 30 mL/kg of crystalloid; patient response may serve as the best indicator of the appropriateness of fluid resuscitation volume, rather than the delivery of a prespecified volume. We do not recognize a specific minimum fluid amount before starting vasopressor support, and vasopressor support may be coupled with plasma volume expansion in severe hypotension or life‑threatening hypoperfusion without requiring that a fluid administration threshold be reached prior to vasopressor initiation. We think serial examinations using more than one bedside tool to assess adequacy of resuscitation are best, with no one approach demonstrated as superior. We support using balanced crystalloid solutions as the primary resuscitation fluid in patients with sepsis, especially if volumes of more than 1 L are used, and note that infusions of saline solution can cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and may impair renal performance in commonly prescribed resuscitative doses.

Fluid balance in sepsis and septic shock — restrictive versus liberal strategies after initial resuscitation: Recommendation 45 states "There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of restrictive versus liberal fluid strategies in the first 24 hours of resuscitation in patients with sepsis and septic shock who still have signs of hypoperfusion and volume depletion after initial resuscitation", with the remark that "Fluid resuscitation should be given only if patients present with signs of hypoperfusion". The rationale notes that "The four largest clinical trials in sepsis resuscitation used moderate to large amounts of fluids in the first 72 hours", with Rivers administering "over 13 L of fluids" and ProCESS, ARISE and ProMISe "approximately 7 to 8 L in the usual care groups"; recent evidence "suggests that IV fluids used to restore organ perfusion may damage vascular integrity and lead to organ dysfunction", and observational and African data have shown an "association of high-volume fluid resuscitation and increased mortality", though generalizability is limited by comorbidities and resource constraints.

### Management and outcomes in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with sepsis [^1164V9UN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease characterized by pulmonary arterial remodeling leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, and right heart failure. Sepsis is the second most common cause of in-hospital death in PAH patients. Recent data suggests that about 25% of patients with PAH who present for sepsis will die while in the hospital. Prompt recognition and treatment of sepsis is vital in the management of this high-risk condition.

Sepsis causes numerous systemic changes with adverse effects on the cardiac and pulmonary systems. These changes include decreased right ventricular preload, increased right ventricular afterload, and reduced contractility, all in the setting of increased myocardial oxygen demand. Each of these factors are further exacerbated in patients with PAH, with unique implications for management. Current management of sepsis in PAH patients is based on expert opinion rather than clinical data, and includes treating the underlying etiology, optimizing preload, reducing right ventricular afterload, and supporting myocardial function to achieve adequate systemic perfusion. Decisions around fluid management are particularly challenging in PAH patients with sepsis. Fluid resuscitation is recommended as part of initial resuscitation to restore preload in septic patients. However, differentiating sepsis from other causes of acute on chronic right ventricular dysfunction is challenging given the often non-specific signs in early sepsis in patients with PAH. Furthermore, administering fluids to increase preload risks worsening right ventricular dilatation, ventricular interdependence, and coronary perfusion in the setting of sepsis-induced increased PVR. This presents a major challenge in the management of sepsis in PAH patients as right ventricular volume overload can lead to impaired cardiac output, with catastrophic implications for the pulmonary and systemic circulations.

Currently, there is little data describing clinical characteristics or treatment strategies for sepsis in this acutely ill population. Current treatment recommendations for PAH patients presenting with sepsis are based on expert opinion rooted in clinical practice or the results of registry or administrative database studies with incompletely characterized cohorts, and so the recommendations are frequently vague or lack supporting data. This retrospective study investigates the treatment approaches and outcomes in a well-characterized cohort of patients with PAH verified by right heart catheterization who presented with sepsis between 2013 and 2022, with a particular focus on initial fluid resuscitation. We hypothesized that PAH patients would receive less fluids and that increased fluid resuscitation would be associated with worse outcomes.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^113nDd1r]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In patients with sepsis, the 2016 SCC guidelines suggest that initial hemodynamic resuscitation should be achieved within 3 h.

Fluid therapy is needed to improve microvascular blood flow through an increased cardiac output as an essential part of the treatment of sepsis. A fluid challenge should incorporate four determinant elements: (1) crystalloid solutions should be the first choice because they are well tolerated and cheap; (2) fluids should be infused rapidly to induce a quick response but not so fast that an artificial stress response develops; (3) the goal should be an increase in systemic arterial pressure; and (4) avoidance of pulmonary edema which is the most serious complication of fluid infusion through appropriate monitoring that is necessary to prevent edema occurrence.

Hypotension is the most common indicator of inadequate perfusion. Restoring a mean arterial pressure of 65 to 70 mmHg is a good initial goal during hemodynamic support of patients with sepsis.

Statement 44

Fluid overload should be avoided in patients with generalized peritonitis, (Recommendation 1C).

In patients with generalized peritonitis, fluid resuscitation should avoid fluid overload, which may aggravate gut edema and lead to increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP).

The systemic inflammatory response syndrome, increased vascular permeability, and aggressive crystalloid resuscitation predispose to fluid sequestration and collection in the peritoneum. Patients with advanced sepsis commonly develop bowel edema. These changes along with an associated forced closure of the abdominal wall may result in increased IAP ultimately leading to intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). Elevated IAP may reduce both regional and global perfusion resulting in significant organ failure. An uncontrolled IAH, with an IAP exceeding 20 mmHg, and new organ failure onset leads to abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). ACS is a potentially lethal complication affecting splanchnic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and central nervous systems.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116JnXM9]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Should we individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation and, if so, how? Applying a standard fluid dose to all patients with sepsis is inconsistent with other areas of sepsis management, where efforts are made to personalize care where possible. What alternative strategies can be readily used in clinical practice to individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation to maximize benefit and reduce harms?
2) Which variables should be used to titrate fluid resuscitation? Rigorous trials comparing various dynamic and static variables to evaluate fluid responsiveness are needed. Furthermore, testing various dynamic variables in subgroups of patients with sepsis would be informative. Trials should be designed to incorporate multiple methods of assessing fluid responsiveness.
3) What is the optimal timing for fluid resuscitation? After rapid identification of sepsis and septic shock, time-series studies of fluid resuscitation are needed, especially evaluating the benefits and harms of additional therapies (e.g. vasopressors) and their respective interplay.
4) Which variables should be used to trigger fluid resuscitation and deresuscitation? Related to the timing of fluid resuscitation, should a particular set of physiologic variables be assessed in a serial fashion to determine when to shift from resuscitation to deresuscitation in a structured manner?
5) Is a combined approach using several indices of fluid responsiveness better than using a single measurement in isolation? Furthermore, how should various measures be prioritized to inform clinical judgment?
6) What is the efficacy of using CRT to guide resuscitation in patients with normal lactate levels? Would the use of a rapidly assessable physiologic test be of value in patients without a derangement in lactate levels?
7) What is the duration of effect of fluid resuscitation? Recognizing that the duration of benefit of fluid resuscitation will vary between patients, having some population estimates in mind via pharmacokinetic studies would be useful to clinicians in evaluating therapeutic options and subsequent care.
8) Do early vasopressors limit the amount of fluids required to reach the same hemodynamic target? If so, what is the appropriate ratio of fluids and vasopressors? Identifying if there is a benefit to applying a polytherapeutic approach to early resuscitation is particularly interesting given the concerns regarding excessive fluid administration. A polytherapeutic approach of early fluid administration and vasopressors using a standardized assessment approach considerate of patient variables may be more precise and individualized, thereby maximizing benefit and limiting adverse effects.
9) Should the initial resuscitation of fluids be restricted to hypotensive patients or patients with lactate greater than or equal to 4 mmol/L? In an effort to limit the effects of excessive fluid administration while maximizing benefit in those patients with malperfusion, comparing strategies of fluid resuscitation in distinctive groups of septic shock would be useful.
10) Should the initial fluid resuscitation be administered as a fixed dose of 30 mL/kg or should it be administered in smaller aliquots, with further administration contingent on reassessing the patient condition prior to administering the next bolus? Although the 30 mL/kg bolus carries the risk of under- and overdosing, it has the advantage of being relatively simple to apply, especially in resource-limited settings where advanced measurements cannot be obtained. Administration of smaller doses, repeated as needed according to hemodynamic assessment, has the advantage of fine-tuning fluid administration according to an individual patient's needs. The risk associated with this approach is the potential for adding additional complexity, while still resulting with relatively similar amount of fluids administered and diverting the healthcare team from completing other essential tasks in the initial management of the patient with sepsis.
11) Should sicker patients receive a greater amount of initial resuscitation? In the continuum of sepsis and septic shock, should those patients with more severe physiologic derangements receive greater initial amounts of fluid resuscitation to restore perfusion at the cellular level? Understanding that there may be dose gradient to the initial volume of fluid resuscitation based on the severity of shock would be informative and guide further, targeted research in the field.
12) Should resuscitation differ in patient populations less able to tolerate large volumes? In an effort to individualize sepsis care for subgroups at greater risk of harm from vigorous resuscitation, trials evaluating subgroups of patients with particular comorbidities (heart failure, dysrhythmias, end-stage renal disease) are necessary. The ideal trial in this domain should test two fluid resuscitation strategies using tiered severity in the triggering variables, whereas the fluid boluses should be of similar amount and given only after the evaluation of fluid responsiveness. Ideally, the study should be stratified for subgroups such as heart failure and kidney disease.
13) What is the optimal strategy for fluid resuscitation in resource-limited settings? Data on resuscitation vary significantly between well-resourced and resource-limited settings, as in sub-Saharan Africa, the administration of fluids was associated with an increased risk of death. Understanding the physiology of fluid resuscitation in the absence of other elements of critical care provided in ICUs with higher resources is a key question for a large portion of the world's population. Developing simplified strategies for patient assessment and fluid administration would greatly improve the quality of care delivered.

### Emergency medicine updates: management of sepsis and septic shock [^114fvkcb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a common condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Emergency physicians play a key role in the diagnosis and management of this condition.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning the management of sepsis and septic shock for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome, and rapid diagnosis and management are essential. Antimicrobials should be administered as soon as possible, as delays are associated with increased mortality. Resuscitation targets include mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg, mental status, capillary refill time, lactate, and urine output. Intravenous fluid resuscitation plays an integral role in those who are fluid responsive. Balanced crystalloids and normal saline are both reasonable options for resuscitation. Early vasopressors should be initiated in those who are not fluid-responsive. Norepinephrine is the recommended first-line vasopressor, and if hypotension persists, vasopressin should be considered, followed by epinephrine. Administration of vasopressors through a peripheral 20-gauge or larger intravenous line is safe and effective. Steroids such as hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone should be considered in those with refractory septic shock.

Conclusion

An understanding of the recent updates in the literature concerning sepsis and septic shock can assist emergency clinicians and improve the care of these patients.

### Efficacy of targeting high mean arterial pressure for older patients with septic shock (OPTPRESS): a multicentre, pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^113ajqkD]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The Optimal Target Blood Pressure in Elderly with Septic Shock (OPTPRESS) trial was a multicentre, pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial conducted at 29 Japanese centres. Patients aged ≥ 65 years with septic shock were screened and randomised. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients or their relatives. In cases of emergency, the trial procedures were applied, and informed consent was obtained subsequently. The trial protocol was published elsewhere. This trial was pre-registered to the UMIN-Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000041775).

Participants

Eligible patients were individuals aged ≥ 65 years, clinically diagnosed with septic shock, and admitted to an intensive care unit. Septic shock was diagnosed based on the Sepsis-3 definition. Fluid resuscitation for the diagnosis of septic shock was not based on the uniform approach of "at least 30 mL/kg of a crystalloid solution within 3 h of the diagnosis" but instead left to the clinician's discretion because of recent findings suggesting the harmful effects of excessive fluid, especially in older populations. Patients who had been on vasopressors for ≥ 3 h, including settings before admission, were excluded, as a previous meta-analysis suggested the potential risk of targeting high MAP after 6 h of norepinephrine administration. Details of the exclusion criteria are provided in ESM 1.

Randomisation and masking

The patients were randomly assigned via an online-based system to the high-target group (target MAP = 80–85 mmHg) or the control group (target MAP = 65–70 mmHg) in a 1:1 ratio, using a centralised, computer-generated allocation sequence prepared by a programmer, independent of the conduct of the trial. Stratified block randomisation was performed according to the presence or absence of a history of chronic hypertension and age (< 80 years or older). Chronic hypertension was determined by previous diagnosis or history of antihypertensive medication. The block size was ten which was not disclosed to all study members, to reduce the predictability of the random sequence. Given the pragmatic character of the trial, a history of chronic hypertension for stratification was determined according to the information at enrolment, regardless of the actual morbidity. The treating physicians were not blinded to the assigned groups owing to the nature of the trial. However, the statisticians were masked to the group allocation until all analyses were completed.

### Evidence for a personalized early start of norepinephrine in septic shock [^111xs9oU]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Only early vasopressor administration can quickly correct severe hypotension

Duration and depth of hypotension are strongly associated with poor outcomes in septic shock. Volume expansion may induce variable responses in arterial pressure, first because its effects on stroke volume are inconstant, delayed, and transitory, second because arterial elastance, which determines the relationship between the fluid-induced changes in flow and in arterial pressure, is variable. In the case of profound, life-threatening hypotension, relying only on fluids to restore blood pressure may unduly prolong hypotension and consequently organ hypoperfusion. Conversely, norepinephrine rapidly increases arterial pressure, its dose being adjusted according to the arterial pressure target (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).

### A rational approach to fluid therapy in sepsis [^112ePTTs]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Aggressive fluid resuscitation to achieve a central venous pressure (CVP) greater than 8 mm Hg has been promoted as the standard of care, in the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. However recent clinical trials have demonstrated that this approach does not improve the outcome of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Pathophysiologically, sepsis is characterized by vasoplegia with loss of arterial tone, venodilation with sequestration of blood in the unstressed blood compartment and changes in ventricular function with reduced compliance and reduced preload responsiveness. These data suggest that sepsis is primarily not a volume-depleted state and recent evidence demonstrates that most septic patients are poorly responsive to fluids. Furthermore, almost all of the administered fluid is sequestered in the tissues, resulting in severe oedema in vital organs and, thereby, increasing the risk of organ dysfunction. These data suggest that a physiologic, haemodynamically guided conservative approach to fluid therapy in patients with sepsis would be prudent and would likely reduce the morbidity and improve the outcome of this disease.

### Evidence for a personalized early start of norepinephrine in septic shock [^112YL8AF]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Timing of norepinephrine administration should be individualized

From the expected effects of the early administration of norepinephrine, it should first be used in patients with severe hypotension even though there is no consensual definition about the level. On the other hand, it should be used in patients with very low arterial tone, as suggested by low diastolic blood pressure (e.g. ≤ 40 mmHg), or a high diastolic shock index (heart rate/diastolic blood pressure) (e.g. ≥ 3). Computation of arterial elastance may identify patients who would necessitate norepinephrine to correct hypotension, but this approach requires cardiac output monitors which are not available at this very early stage of resuscitation.

Early administration of norepinephrine should also be considered in patients in whom fluid accumulation has occurred prior to hypotension, is likely to occur (patients who are anuric, who received large fluid amounts before hypotension occurred), or those in whom fluid accumulation would be particularly deleterious (e.g. in case of acute respiratory distress syndrome, left or right ventricular failure, or intra-abdominal hypertension) (Fig. 1). Administration of norepinephrine should go hand in hand with reasoned fluid administration, based on physiological needs and assessment of preload responsiveness, as in the study by Ospina Tascon et al. (Fig. 1).

### Effect of initial infusion rates of fluid resuscitation on outcomes in patients with septic shock: a historical cohort study [^1139DgbN]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Septic shock refers to sepsis with cardiovascular dysfunction. It is prevalent and is associated with a high rate of mortality. It is characterized by systemic vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. These changes result in impaired microcirculatory blood flow and reduced tissue perfusion. The fluid resuscitation for septic shock can restore perfusion before the onset of irreversible tissue damage and prevent cardiovascular collapse and death, and, hence, lower mortality. Therefore, appropriate fluid resuscitation within the first 3 h of shock state is strongly recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines as the cornerstone of septic shock treatment.

The challenge remains to identify the optimal fluid resuscitation strategy. While the standard of practice is the use of boluses of intravascular (IV) fluid for resuscitation, a few trials have shown increased mortality with fluid resuscitation. Also, three recent multi-center randomized controlled trials and a follow-up meta-analysis showed that early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) bundles in comparison with usual care were not associated with improved outcomes in septic shock. Additionally, fluid boluses could lead to a positive fluid balance and excess fluid in the interstitial space, resulting in tissue edema, decreased oxygen delivery, and increased mortality.

These controversies surrounding the optimal strategies of initial bolus-fluid administration during septic shock resuscitation make searching for the optimal dose, type, and rate of fluid resuscitation in septic shock a research priority. The current guidelines recommend at least 30 ml/kg of intravenous crystalloid fluid to be given within the first 3 h of resuscitation, but the influence may be different based on the time to attainment of this target in fluid resuscitation. So the goal of this study is to examine the relationship between initial fluid resuscitation rate and septic shock resolution in septic shock patients.

### Choice of vasopressor in septic shock: does it matter? [^114bHW5Z]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Septic shock is a medical emergency that is associated with mortality rates of 40–70%. Prompt recognition and institution of effective therapy is required for optimal outcome. When the shock state persists after adequate fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy is required to improve and maintain adequate tissue/organ perfusion in an attempt to improve survival and prevent the development of multiple organ dysfunction and failure. Controversy surrounding the optimum choice of vasopressor strategy to utilize in the management of patients with septic shock continues. A recent randomized study of epinephrine compared to norepinephrine (plus dobutamine when indicated) leads to more questions than answers.

Fluid resuscitation associations

There were 14 PAH patients who received fluid resuscitation within the first 24 h, compared to 16 patients who received no fluids (Supplemental Table 6). Both groups had similar presenting vitals, laboratory findings, and sepsis severity. Only 28.6% of those who received fluids were on three PH drugs compared to 50% of patients who did not receive fluids, and those who received fluids were less likely to be on parental PH medication (35.7% v. 87.5%, p = 0.011), had lower mean pulmonary artery pressures (37 mmHg IQR 27–45 vs. 45.5 mmHg IQR 40–52, p = 0.037) and were less likely to have reduced RV systolic function (28.6% v. 62.5%, p = 0.136). Those who received fluids had shorter time to antibiotics (2.3 IQR 1.2–4.5 h vs. 6.5 IQR 2.5–19.1 h, p = 0.041) and were less likely to receive diuretics in the first 48 h of their hospital stay (35.7% v. 81.2%, p = 0.030). Those who received fluids also trended towards resolution of AKI within 48 h (100% v. 50%) and greater improvement in lactate (median, IQR 6.5 mg/dL (0.8–10.2) v. 5 (4–6)). There was 1 patient who received fluids that died (7.1%), compared to 6 of the patients who did not receive fluids (37.5%), although this difference was not significant (p = 0.126).

Vasopressors

Recommendations

We recommend titrating vasopressors to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65–70 mmHg (Grade 1B) rather than a higher MAP target (80–85 mmHg) in patients with septic shock. However, for patients with chronic hypertension we recommend aiming for a higher target (80–85 mmHg) for renal protection in septic shock (Grade 1C).
We recommend lowering systolic pressure to 140–190 mmHg rather than to 110–139 mmHg in patients with acute cerebral haemorrhage with severe admission hypertension (Grade 1C).
If vasopressors are needed for treatment of hypotension, we recommend norepinephrine (along with correction of hypovolaemia) as the first-choice vasopressor to protect kidney function (Grade 1B) and suggest vasopressin in patients with vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery (Grade 2C).
We suggest individualizing target pressure when premorbid blood pressure is available (BPS).

Rationale for MAP target

Preservation or improvement of renal perfusion can theoretically be achieved through increasing cardiac output by fluid resuscitation or inotropic drugs, through renal vasodilators or systemic vasopressors. Optimal target mean arterial pressure (MAP) was studied in a large open-label multicentre RCT randomising 777 patients with septic shock to resuscitation with a MAP target of either 80–85 mmHg or 65–70 mmHg. In most of the patients the achieved MAP was above the set target. The study found no difference in mortality, incidence of AKI stage 2 (38.7% vs. 41.5%, p = 0.42) or need for RRT (33.5% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.5), but more atrial fibrillation in the high target group. However, in patients with known chronic hypertension a higher MAP resulted in a lower incidence of AKI stage 2 (38.9% vs. 52%, p = 0.02) and less RRT (31.7% vs 42.2%, p = 0.046); mortality was unchanged.

The safety of lowering systolic pressure was studied in a larger RCT in patients with acute cerebral haemorrhage with severe hypertension on admission. Patients were randomised to a systolic blood pressure target of 110–139 or 140–179 mmHg. The primary endpoint (death or disability) was not different between groups. However, the rate of serious renal adverse events was higher in the lower target group (9% vs. 4%, p = 0.002) (ESM_2 Table S5).

### Resuscitation with early adrenaline infusion for children with septic shock: a randomized pilot trial [^113VF8fK]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this multicenter open label randomized pilot trial of children presenting with early septic shock to ED, a sepsis resuscitation algorithm incorporating early initiation of adrenaline infusion after 20 mL/kg fluid bolus was associated with significantly more and earlier inotrope use, and less fluid volume load during the first 24 hours after randomization as compared with standard SSC resuscitation with 40–60 mL/kg fluid. The intervention did not lead to more or longer PICU admissions. The consent rate was 100% among families approached for consent, and consent-to-continue was used in over 80% of cases given the time constraints associated with the intervention. However, only 69% of eligible patients were enrolled, and the recruitment rate was 1.2 per month at the largest study site.

Founded on concerns about high mortality associated with delayed sepsis resuscitation, previous pediatric sepsis guidelines have emphasized the importance of rapid delivery of 40–60 mL/kg fluid bolus during initial resuscitation. The FEAST study demonstrated a 45% (95% CI, 13–86%) relative mortality risk increase associated with any 20 to 40 mL/kg bolus compared with no bolus. Contrary to septic adults, where the recent Conservative versus Liberal Approach to Fluid Therapy of Septic Shock in Intensive Care (CLASSIC) and Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) trials showed that a restrictive compared to a liberal fluid resuscitation regimen had similar outcomes, no comparable data are available for children, and controversy surrounding optimal fluid volume persists. Although the 2020 pediatric SSC recommendations emphasize that in settings where no intensive care support is available, fluid boluses should be avoided in the absence of hypotension, the guidelines otherwise still recommend 40–60 mL/kg fluids.

### Association of arterial blood pressure and vasopressor load with septic shock mortality: a post hoc analysis of a multicenter trial [^1174vvki]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Key messages

- MAP levels of 70 mmHg or higher do not appear to be associated with improved survival in septic shock.

- Augmenting vasopressor dosages to elevate MAP to more than 70 mmHg may increase mortality.

- Future trials are needed to identify the lowest acceptable MAP level to ensure tissue perfusion and avoid unnecessary high catecholamine infusions.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock, 2012 [^114zHw6V]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a PaO₂/FiO₂ < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5–10 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

Investigations

She was subsequently admitted to the inpatient floor unit where repeat laboratories still revealed leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes. A chest X-ray (figure 1) the following day showed pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial oedema pattern, but the patient had persistently low BP (mean arterial pressure < 65 mm Hg) so intravenous fluid was increased to 125 mL/hour with a total of 5.5 L bolus. Repeat lactic acid was still normal at 0.8 mmol/L. Empiric antibiotics with vancomycin 1 g for one dose and piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g every 4 hours were started in the ED and were continued on the floors. Doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours was also started due to a history of tick exposure. She was initially diagnosed as viral syndrome. Overnight for persistent hypotension, additional 1 L of normal saline was given. Subsequently, a decision to start norepinephrine intravenously was made and she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for severe sepsis.

### Association between the first-hour intravenous fluid volume and mortality in pediatric septic shock [^111H8oCY]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To determine whether the receipt of more than or equal to 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluid in the first hour after emergency department (ED) arrival is associated with sepsis-attributable mortality among children with hypotensive septic shock.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study set in 57 EDs in the Improving Pediatric Sepsis Outcomes quality improvement collaborative. Patients less than 18 years of age with hypotensive septic shock who received their first intravenous fluid bolus within 1 hour of arrival at the ED were propensity-score matched for probability of receiving more than or equal to 30 mL/kg in the first hour. Sepsis-attributable mortality was compared. We secondarily evaluated the association between the first-hour fluid volume and sepsis-attributable mortality in all children with suspected sepsis in the first hour after arrival at the ED, regardless of blood pressure.

Results

Of the 1,982 subjects who had hypotensive septic shock and received a first fluid bolus within 1 hour of arrival at the ED, 1,204 subjects were propensity matched. In the matched patients receiving more than or equal to 30 mL/kg of fluid, 26 (4.3%) of 602 subjects had 30-day sepsis-attributable mortality compared with 25 (4.2%) of 602 receiving less than 30 mL/kg (odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 1.83). Among the patients with suspected sepsis regardless of blood pressure, 30-day sepsis-attributable mortality was 3.0% in those receiving more than or equal to 30 mL/kg versus 2.0% in those receiving less than 30 ml/kg (odds ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 2.44.) CONCLUSION: In children with hypotensive septic shock receiving a timely first fluid bolus within the first hour of ED care, receiving more than or equal to 30 mL/kg of bolus intravenous fluids in the first hour after arrival at the ED was not associated with mortality compared with receiving less than 30 mL/kg.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1133QL6E]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Individualized fluid management in sepsis improves outcomes in patients with septic shock. The recommendation of 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation originates from the early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) trial conducted by Rivers et al. in 2001. Subsequently, both the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) and Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Early Management Bundle (SEP-1) have endorsed this approach. From 2014 to 2015, three independent, government-funded, multicenter randomized controlled trials were conducted: early septic shock in the United States (ProCESS), sepsis resuscitation assessment in Australia (ARISE), and sepsis programmed management in the UK (ProMISe). The average fluid volume administered to patients prior to randomization in these studies was also around 30 mL/kg, which led to the adoption of 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation volume in routine clinical practice. However, there has been significant debate regarding the optimal fluid volume for sepsis management. Increasing evidence suggests that the fluid administration during the EGDT era, which followed a permissive intravenous fluid strategy, resulted in suboptimal treatment outcomes. This has raised persistent questions about the appropriateness of the 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation volume. Additionally, the guidelines do not mention a specific rehydration scheme for septic patients at risk of volume overload, and there is no randomized controlled study for reference. Individualized fluid resuscitation may be necessary for patients at risk of volume overload, as the fixed fluid rehydration amount of 30 mL/kg may not be suitable for all sepsis subgroups. The CLOVERS trial demonstrated that early administration of vasopressors to reduce fluid resuscitation volumes did not decrease the 90-day mortality rate in patients with septic hypotension. In line with these findings, our study emphasizes the importance of tailored fluid management strategies in sepsis, particularly for patients with comorbid heart failure, where the optimal initial fluid resuscitation volume of 10–15 mL/kg within the first 3 h may offer the best clinical outcomes.

### Fluid response evaluation in sepsis hypotension and shock: a randomized clinical trial [^11747ysa]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

FOR EDITORIAL COMMENT, SEE

Fluid resuscitation is a central component of septic shock treatment. Excessive fluid administration causes hypervolemia and is associated with tissue edema, organ dysfunction, increased ICU length of stay, prolonged ventilator dependence, and higher mortality rates. Guidelines recommend crystalloid fluid administration of at least 30 mL/kg for sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion or septic shock and suggest that "fluid administration beyond initial resuscitation requires careful assessment of the likelihood that the patient remains fluid responsive". Robust evidence that supports this recommendation is lacking. Two-thirds of patients with septic shock demonstrate fluid overload on day 1, and fluid resuscitation often continues beyond the first day of care. However, only one-half of septic patients will be fluid responsive and potentially benefit from fluid administration. A propensity model analysis of 23,513 patients with sepsis demonstrated that day 1 fluid administration > 5 L was associated with significantly increased risk of death.

Take-home Points

Traditional methods of the assessment of fluid responsiveness (FR) such as vital signs, physical examination, and static measurements of circulatory pressure do not reliably correlate with FR. In contrast, dynamic measurement of stroke volume (SV) after an IV fluid bolus or passive leg raise (PLR) is a safe and feasible method of rapidly assessing the effectiveness of fluid-induced augmentation of SV and cardiac output (CO). This approach has been associated with reduced length of stay, fewer postoperative complications, and earlier return to regular diet in surgical patients.

A retrospective study of real-time, noninvasive bioreactance SV and cardiac performance measurements incorporated PLR to assess FR and guide resuscitation in patients with septic shock in an ICU. Bioreactance analyzes the relative phase shift of an oscillating current passing through the thoracic cavity. Dynamic SV-guided resuscitation was associated with decreased net fluid balance, reduced ICU length of stay, risk of mechanical ventilation, time on vasopressors, and risk of renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the benefits of dynamic measure-guided fluid resuscitation, we designed the Fluid Responsiveness Evaluation in Sepsis-associated Hypotension (FRESH) Trial (NCT02837731). The primary objective was to determine if SV-guided dynamic assessment could guide the amount of IV fluid administered to patients with septic shock.
