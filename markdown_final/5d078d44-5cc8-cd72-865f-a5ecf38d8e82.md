## Question

How soon after birth, can you have your first period

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how soon after giving birth a person can have their first period. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the question refers to the first postpartum menstrual period versus the first period ever (menarche). Then, I should verify how breastfeeding status changes the timing of ovulation and menses. Next, I will review the evidence for nonlactating and lactating patients, including the earliest reported ovulation and menses. After that, I should consider clinical implications for contraception and what "reasonably certain not pregnant" means. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with ranges and caveats, and double-check that I'm aligning with current CDC/ACOG guidance and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. The phrase "first period after birth" almost always means the first postpartum menses, not menarche, so I should focus on the return of menstruation after delivery and explicitly distinguish nonlactating from lactating scenarios because breastfeeding profoundly delays ovulation and menses via prolactin-mediated suppression of GnRH, which is the key determinant of timing here [^bc721748] [^fe09f5f4].

> For nonlactating patients, I need to check the earliest possible ovulation and how that relates to bleeding. The CDC's 2024 Selected Practice Recommendations note that among postpartum nonlactating women, the mean day of first ovulation is 45–94 days after delivery, but the earliest reported ovulation is 25 days postpartum, and importantly, ovulation can precede the first menses, so pregnancy can occur before bleeding returns. This aligns with a systematic review showing that 20–71% of first postpartum menses are preceded by ovulation, and some of those ovulations are potentially fertile, which explains why contraception is needed even before the first period [^bc721748] [^fe09f5f4].

> Wait, let me verify the practical lower bound for nonlactating menses. While ovulation can occur as early as about 3.5 weeks, the first menses typically arrives after that, and most nonlactating patients will not ovulate until after 6 weeks; clinically, I often see the first period around 6–8 weeks, but it can be earlier, and isolated reports and guidelines acknowledge variability, so I should not overstate a single number. The safest clinical statement is that the earliest reported ovulation is 25 days, and menses commonly returns by 6–8 weeks, though it may come earlier in some nonlactating patients [^bc721748] [^fe09f5f4].

> For lactating patients, I should confirm the LAM criteria and their implications. LAM is effective when three conditions are met: the infant is under 6 months, the parent is fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (≥ 85% of feeds), and the parent is amenorrheic; under these conditions, the risk of pregnancy is< 2%, but once any criterion is not met, fertility can return and ovulation may precede menses. Cochrane and ABM data show that life-table menstruation rates at 6 months vary widely across populations (about 11–39%), reflecting heterogeneity in breastfeeding intensity and biology, and that many first postpartum cycles during lactation are anovulatory, though not all are, so the protective effect wanes over time even with continued breastfeeding [^bc721748] [^6682de3f] [^52c4654a] [^66dadc6c].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical timing for lactating patients. Many exclusively breastfeeding patients remain amenorrheic for months; it is common not to have a period for 6 months or longer, and some will not menstruate for a year or more while breastfeeding. However, ovulation can occur before any bleeding, so the absence of menses does not guarantee protection from pregnancy after the early postpartum weeks, which is why contraception counseling is essential even when periods have not returned [^bc721748] [^6682de3f] [^52c4654a].

> Next, I should review the clinical implications so I don't jump to conclusions. Because ovulation can precede menses, especially in nonlactating patients, contraception should be initiated before the first period if fertility is a concern. CDC guidance supports starting many methods immediately postpartum if it is reasonably certain the patient is not pregnant, with specific back-up rules for combined hormonal contraception and progestin-only methods depending on timing and breastfeeding status. For example, nonlactating patients can often start progestin-only methods immediately, while combined hormonal contraception is generally delayed to≥ 21 days and sometimes≥ 42 days depending on VTE risk and breastfeeding status, with 7 days of back-up if started after certain thresholds [^bc721748] [^6d469d76] [^fa2d976f] [^d3bc9621].

> I should double-check what "reasonably certain not pregnant" entails in the immediate postpartum context. CDC allows that a patient within 4 weeks postpartum, with no signs of pregnancy, can be considered reasonably certain not pregnant for the purpose of starting contraception; this is particularly relevant for nonlactating patients who may ovulate early, enabling timely method initiation without waiting for menses, while still applying method-specific back-up rules if initiation occurs beyond certain postpartum days [^a6888529] [^f9575826].

> Putting this together, I will now synthesize the answer. For nonlactating patients, the earliest reported ovulation is 25 days postpartum, and the first menses commonly returns around 6–8 weeks, though it can be earlier in some cases. For lactating patients, many will not have a period for 6 months or more, and some remain amenorrheic beyond a year, but ovulation can still occur before any bleeding, so fertility may return earlier than menses. Across both groups, ovulation before the first period is possible, so contraception should be started based on risk and timing rather than waiting for menstruation to return [^bc721748] [^fe09f5f4] [^6682de3f] [^52c4654a].

The first postpartum period typically returns **4–6 weeks after delivery** in non-breastfeeding women, but can be delayed to **6–12 weeks or longer** with exclusive breastfeeding due to lactational amenorrhea. Early ovulation can occur before the first period, so **contraception is needed** even if menstruation hasn't resumed. Individual variation is common, and cycles may be irregular initially.

---

## Timing of the first postpartum period

### Non-breastfeeding women

In non-breastfeeding women, the first postpartum period usually returns **4–6 weeks after delivery**, though some may experience it earlier or later. Ovulation can precede the first period, so pregnancy is possible before menstruation resumes [^bc721748].

---

### Breastfeeding women

In breastfeeding women, the return of menstruation is **significantly delayed** due to lactational amenorrhea. Exclusive breastfeeding typically suppresses ovulation and menstruation for several months; the first period often returns after 6 months, but may be delayed up to a year or more. Once breastfeeding decreases or stops, menstruation usually resumes within a few months [^bc721748] [^6682de3f].

---

## Factors influencing the return of menstruation

Several factors influence **when menstruation resumes after childbirth**:

| **Factor** | **Effect on return of menstruation** |
|-|-|
| Breastfeeding frequency and exclusivity | Delays return of menstruation significantly |
| Hormonal fluctuations | Individual hormonal profiles affect timing |
| Maternal age and health | Younger, healthier mothers may resume earlier |
| Nutritional status | Poor nutrition may delay return |
| Stress and fatigue | Can delay return of menstruation |

---

## Physiological changes accompanying the first postpartum period

The first postpartum period may differ from pre-pregnancy cycles: flow may be **heavier or lighter**, cycles may be **irregular**, and cramping may be **more intense**. These changes reflect hormonal adjustments as the body transitions back to regular cycles [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Contraception**: Discuss and provide contraception before discharge, as ovulation can occur before the first period [^bc721748].
- **Breastfeeding support**: Encourage exclusive breastfeeding to support infant health and naturally delay menstruation [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Track bleeding patterns and educate patients on warning signs (e.g. excessive bleeding, foul-smelling discharge) [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The first postpartum period typically returns **4–6 weeks after delivery** in non-breastfeeding women, but exclusive breastfeeding can delay it for months. Because ovulation may precede menstruation, **contraception is essential** even when periods are absent.

### A comparison of recalled date of last menstrual period with prospectively recorded dates [^c6556276]. Journal of Women's Health (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Women are often asked to recall the first day of their last menstrual period (LMP date) in a clinic setting (i.e., pregnancy dating, x-rays). There are no data supporting the validity of these reports.

Methods

Using data from a group of 385 women ages 35-49 from a larger cohort study in the Washington, DC, area, we constructed menstrual segments from a prospective daily menstrual record. We then compared the first day of a menstrual segment to a woman's recalled LMP date at a subsequent study-related clinic appointment to assess the accuracy of recall.

Results

More than half of the women (56%) accurately recalled their LMP date; 74% were within 1 day, and 81% were within 2 days. Women tended to underreport (25%) the length of time since their last menstrual period rather than overreport the length of time (19%). Recall accuracy did not vary significantly with education or by whether the woman usually recorded her menstrual cycle when not in the study. As one might expect, women with a shorter recall duration tended to report more accurately.

Discussion

Women appear to recall their LMP dates fairly accurately, but inaccurate recall was not random. When length of recall was 3 weeks or longer, women tended to overestimate the time since LMP. This suggests that gestational age calculated from LMP date will tend to be overestimated. Most women can recall the date of their LMP reasonably well regardless of their education and whether they usually record their LMP dates.

### Committee opinion No 700: methods for estimating the due date [^bc185d2a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods for estimating the due date—abstract directives—As soon as data from the last menstrual period, the first accurate ultrasound examination, or both are obtained, the gestational age and the estimated due date (EDD) should be determined, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record. A pregnancy without an ultrasound examination that confirms or revises the EDD before 22 0/7 weeks of gestational age should be considered suboptimally dated. When determined from the methods outlined in this document for estimating the due date, gestational age at delivery represents the best obstetric estimate for the purpose of clinical care and should be recorded on the birth certificate, and for the purposes of research and surveillance, the best obstetric estimate, rather than estimates based on the last menstrual period alone, should be used as the measure for gestational age.

Ovulation timing and low-likelihood intervals for pregnancy risk assessment: During an average 28-day cycle, ovulation generally occurs during days 9–20, and the likelihood of ovulation is low from days 1–7 of the menstrual cycle. After a spontaneous or an induced abortion, ovulation can occur within 2–3 weeks and has been found as early as 8–13 days after the end of the pregnancy; therefore, the likelihood of ovulation is low ≤7 days after an abortion. Among postpartum nonlactating women, the mean day of first ovulation occurred 45–94 days after delivery, with the earliest ovulation reported at 25 days after delivery. Among women within 6 months postpartum who are fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (exclusively breastfeeding or the vast majority [≥85%] of feeds are breastfeeds) and are amenorrheic, the risk for pregnancy is <2%.

### The effects of a postmiscarriage menstrual period prior to reconceiving [^c19adf45]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal interpregnancy interval after a single pregnancy loss is controversial. It is common obstetrical practice to recommend that women who have had a miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy should wait for 1 or more menstrual cycles before attempting to conceive again.

Objective

This study aimed to assess whether conception before the first menstrual period after a spontaneous pregnancy loss is associated with a risk of repeat miscarriage or adverse perinatal outcomes.

Study Design

This retrospective cohort study included 107 women who had a spontaneous miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy followed by a subsequent pregnancy with an interpregnancy interval of <12 weeks. All miscarriages had ended in either spontaneous expulsion of the products of conception or medical or surgical evacuation of the uterus. The perinatal outcome measures of 57 women who conceived after the first menstrual period following a spontaneous miscarriage were compared with perinatal outcome measures of 50 women who conceived before the first menstrual period following a spontaneous miscarriage. The primary outcome was rate of pregnancy loss, and the secondary outcomes were gestational age at delivery and birthweight.

Results

The rate of recurrent miscarriage was 10.4% for women who conceived before the first menstrual period following a spontaneous miscarriage and 15.8% for those who conceived after (P=.604). There were no differences in the gestational age at delivery (38.9 vs 38.7 weeks; P=.66) or the birthweight (3347±173 vs 3412±156 g; P=.5) between the 2 groups. Other outcomes, such as mode of delivery and 5-minute Apgar score, were also similar for both groups. A multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed that conception before the first menstrual period following a spontaneous miscarriage was not associated with a higher incidence of subsequent miscarriage (odds ratio, 1.74; P=.46) or any other untoward outcome.

Conclusion

Conception shortly after a spontaneous miscarriage without waiting for at least the first postmiscarriage menstrual period is not associated with adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes compared with those of women with similar interpregnancy intervals who conceived after their next menstrual period.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^cc98b265]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Comments and evidence—ovulation timing and postpartum risk: During an average 28-day cycle, ovulation generally occurs during days 9–20, and the likelihood of ovulation is low from days 1–7 of the menstrual cycle. After a spontaneous or an induced abortion, ovulation can occur within 2–3 weeks and has been found to occur as early as 8–13 days after the end of the pregnancy; therefore, the likelihood of ovulation is low ≤7 days after an abortion. Among postpartum patients, the mean day of first ovulation among postpartum nonlactating women occurred 45–94 days after delivery, with the earliest ovulation reported at 25 days after delivery. Among women who are within 6 months postpartum, are fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (exclusively breastfeeding or the vast majority [≥85%] of feeds are breastfeeds), and are amenorrheic, the risk for pregnancy is <2%.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^0833e792]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Comments and Evidence Summary. The criteria for determining whether a patient is pregnant depend on the assurance that the patient has not ovulated within a certain amount of time after their last menses, spontaneous or induced abortion, or delivery. Among menstruating patients, the timing of ovulation can vary widely. During an average 28-day cycle, ovulation generally occurs during days 9–20. In addition, the likelihood of ovulation is low from days 1–7 of the menstrual cycle. After a spontaneous or an induced abortion, ovulation can occur within 2–3 weeks and has been found to occur as early as 8–13 days after the end of the pregnancy. Therefore, the likelihood of ovulation is low ≤7 days after an abortion (–). A systematic review reported that the mean day of first ovulation among postpartum nonlactating women occurred 45–94 days after delivery. In one study, the earliest ovulation was reported at 25 days after delivery. Among women who are within 6 months postpartum, are fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (exclusively breastfeeding or the vast majority [≥85%] of feeds are breastfeeds), and are amenorrheic, the risk for pregnancy is <2%.

Although pregnancy tests often are performed before initiating contraception, the accuracy of qualitative urine pregnancy tests varies depending on the timing of the test relative to missed menses, recent sexual intercourse, or recent pregnancy. The sensitivity of a pregnancy test is defined as the concentration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at which 95% of tests are positive. Most qualitative pregnancy tests approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) report a sensitivity of 20–25 mIU/mL in urine (–). However, pregnancy detection rates can vary widely because of differences in test sensitivity and the timing of testing relative to missed menses. Certain studies have demonstrated that an additional 11 days past the day of expected menses are needed to detect 100% of pregnancies using qualitative tests. In addition, pregnancy tests cannot detect a pregnancy resulting from recent sexual intercourse. Qualitative tests also might have positive results for several weeks after termination of pregnancy because hCG can be present for several weeks after delivery or abortion (spontaneous or induced) (–).

### Norethindrone (Heather) [^78a1201a]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

STARTING POPS

It’s best to take your first POP on the first day of your menstrual period.
If you decide to take your first POP on another day, use a backup method (such as a condom and/or spermicide) every time you have sex during the next 48 hours.
If you have had a miscarriage or an abortion, you can start POPs the next day.

IF YOU ARE LATE OR MISS TAKING YOUR POPS

If you are more than 3 hours late or you miss one or more POPs:
TAKE a missed pill as soon as you remember that you missed it,
THEN go back to taking POPs at your regular time.
BUT be sure to use a backup method (such as condom and/or spermicide) every time you have sex for the next 48 hours.
If you are not sure what to do about the pills you have missed, keep taking POPs and use a backup method until you can talk to your doctor or clinic.

IF YOU ARE BREASTFEEDING

If you are fully breastfeeding (not giving your baby any food or formula), you may start your pills 6 weeks after delivery.
If you are partially breastfeeding (giving your baby some food or formula), you should start taking pills by 3 weeks after delivery.

IF YOU ARE SWITCHING PILLS

If you are switching from the combined pills to POPs, take the first POP the day after you finish the last active combined pill. Do not take any of the 7 inactive pills from the combined pill pack. You should know that many women have irregular periods after switching to POPs, but this is normal and to be expected.
If you are switching from POPs to the combined pills, take the first active combined pill on the first day of your period, even if your POPs pack is not finished.
If you switch to another brand of POPs, start the new brand anytime.
If you are breastfeeding, you can switch to another method of birth control at any time, except do not switch to the combined pills until you stop breastfeeding or at least until 6 months after delivery.

### Levonorgestrel (My way) [^e6afd588]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

How can I get the best results from My Way?

You have only a few days to try to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. The sooner you take My Way, the better it works. My Way should be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected sex.

How effective is My Way?

The sooner you take My Way, the better it will work. Take My Way as soon as possible after unprotected sex. If it is taken as soon as possible within 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected sex, it will significantly decrease the chance that you will get pregnant. Seven out of every 8 women who would have gotten pregnant will not become pregnant.

How will I know if My Way worked?

Most women will have their menstrual period at the expected time or within a week of the expected time. If your menstrual period is delayed beyond 1 week, you may be pregnant. You should get a pregnancy test and follow up with your healthcare professional.

What if I am already pregnant and use My Way?

There is no medical evidence that My Way would harm a developing baby. If you take My Way (accidentally) after you are already pregnant or it does not work and you become pregnant, it is not likely to cause any harm to you or your pregnancy. The pregnancy will continue. My Way will not work if you are already pregnant.

### Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol (Zafemy) [^431ee6a0]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

If you are starting ZAFEMY after childbirth:

If you are not breastfeeding, wait 4 weeks before using ZAFEMY and use a non-hormonal contraceptive method of birth control, such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide, for the first 7 days of your first cycle only. If you have had sex since your baby was born, wait for your first period, or see your healthcare provider to make sure you are not pregnant before starting ZAFEMY.

If you are starting ZAFEMY after a miscarriage or abortion:

You may start ZAFEMY immediately after a miscarriage or abortion that occurs in the first 12 weeks (first trimester) of pregnancy. You do not need to use another contraceptive method.
If you do not start ZAFEMY within 5 days after a first trimester miscarriage or abortion, use a non-hormonal contraceptive method of birth control, such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide, while you wait for your period to start. You have 2 ways to begin using your ZAFEMY patch. Choose the way that is best for you:

First day start: Apply your first ZAFEMY patch during the first 24 hours of your menstrual period.
Sunday start: Apply your first ZAFEMY patch on the first Sunday after your menstrual period begins. Use a non-hormonal contraceptive method of birth control, such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide, for the first 7 days of your first cycle only. If your period starts on Sunday, apply your first ZAFEMY patch that day, and no back-up birth control is needed.

### "I can guess the month … but beyond that, I can' T tell" an exploratory qualitative study of health care provider perspectives on gestational age estimation in rajasthan, India [^ae92e742]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the challenges with widespread early access to ultrasound, gestational age estimation using last menstrual period remains a viable option for frontline health workers in low resource settings. However, this method yields accurate estimates only among women who had regular menstruation prior to pregnancy, something frontline healthcare providers may not account for. The proportion of pregnant women in low resource setting who have irregular or absent periods prior to pregnancy, which proscribes the use of LMP for gestational age estimation, is likely high due to undernutrition, hormonal disorders, early menopause, becoming pregnant again before postpartum menses regulates, and the use of many forms of contraception. Even among women who were menstruating regularly before becoming pregnant, communication about LMP is hindered by low client recall, poor client-provider rapport, shame around menstruation, and traditional approaches to timekeeping (harvests, festivals). Efforts to reduce shame and improve women’s reproductive health knowledge may indirectly improve the use of LMP for gestational age estimation.

Late ANC reduces the likelihood that a woman will accurately recall the date of her last menstrual period and limits the capacity for ultrasound to produce an accurate gestational age estimate. ANC after the first trimester is common in many low and middle income countries, particularly among rural areas and among less educated women. Cultural norms around shame or bad omens influence when the news of a pregnancy can be shared with one’s community: first ANC is delayed among women who wait until pregnancy is visible before talking to others, including health workers, often linked to an understanding that early pregnancy is a period of vulnerability. Women in South Africa and India have explained that they consider pregnancy a natural process with little risk to one’s health (as opposed to labour, which has clear health risks), and thus does not require multiple or early ANC. Interventions have been moderately successful at changing these norms to increase ANC uptake through participatory community groups, as well as media campaigns, financial incentives, and home visits by healthcare providers.

### Committee opinion No 700: methods for estimating the due date [^4ec8dc44]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Estimated due date (EDD) by last menstrual period (LMP)—conventions and limitations—By convention, the EDD is 280 days after the first day of the LMP, an approach that assumes a regular menstrual cycle of 28 days with ovulation on the 14th day and does not account for inaccurate recall or cycle variability; it has been reported that approximately one half of women accurately recall their LMP. In one study, 40% of women randomized to receive first-trimester ultrasonography had their EDD adjusted because of a discrepancy of more than 5 days between ultrasound dating and LMP dating, whereas estimated due dates were adjusted in only 10% of controls who had second-trimester ultrasonography, which suggests that first-trimester ultrasound examination can improve the accuracy of the EDD, even when the first day of the LMP is known. Accurate determination of gestational age can positively affect outcomes; one study found a reduction in the need for postterm inductions with routine first-trimester ultrasonography compared with second-trimester only, and a Cochrane review concluded that ultrasonography can reduce the need for postterm induction and lead to earlier detection of multiple gestations.

### Introducing the World Health Organization postpartum family planning compendium [^7ff9c602]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2017). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Up to two‐thirds of women would like to avoid pregnancy in the first year after a delivery but are not using contraception. 1, 2 This unmet need is an important public health concern, because approximately 20% of obstetric deaths are attributable to non‐use of modern contraception. 3 Additionally, family planning has the potential to avert maternal and child morbidity by allowing couples to space their pregnancies more than 2 years apart. 4, 5

Providers have traditionally given women postpartum family planning recommendations approximately 6 weeks after delivery. However, the immediate postpartum period (within 48 hours of delivery) is an ideal time to address family planning needs, given that women are often in contact with the medical system and can be assured that they are not pregnant. Furthermore, the extension of family planning services through the first year after delivery is appropriate in view of the changing needs and preferences of women during this period. For example, a change in a woman's breastfeeding status could trigger a need for initiation of a family planning method. The postpartum period provides women important opportunities of contact with the health system, during times of care for themselves and their newborns, and women can be highly motivated to initiate contraceptive methods at these times. These opportunities—whether part of routine or emergency care—should be taken to provide life‐saving family planning services.

However, the postpartum period is a complex time for family planning decision making. Recommendations on the timing and safety of hormonal and non‐hormonal contraceptive initiation are influenced by many changing factors: breastfeeding status, uterine involution, venous thromboembolism risk, and—in the case of intrauterine devices—expulsion risk. For program managers and policy makers, decisions about which methods will be available at the point of care (either at delivery or at outpatient visits) are influenced by women's interest in particular methods, clinician recommendations, and their own knowledge regarding safety and efficacy of each method.

To date, guidance on family planning in the postpartum period has been included in various WHO documents, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 each of which focuses on a different aspect of family planning care. Providers have substantial time constraints at the point of patient care, and need quickly accessible and comprehensive references. Therefore, the WHO Postpartum Family Planning Compendium was developed with the aim of creating a user‐friendly platform for WHO guidance regarding postpartum family planning in one web‐based location for use by clinicians, program managers, and policy makers.

Early (dating) ultrasound—The Work Group advises a first-trimester ultrasound to establish or confirm the gestational age and estimated birth date and to confirm the presence of cardiac activity; for pregnant patients who present after the first trimester, we advise performing a dating and anatomical ultrasound at the earliest opportunity, preferably before 22 weeks. The estimated due date is initially established by calculating 280 days from the first day of the last normal menstrual period, but only about 50% of patients accurately recall the date of the last menstrual period and menstrual cycles might be shorter or longer than 28 days, supporting ultrasound confirmation. Beyond dating, early ultrasound indications include evaluation of vaginal bleeding, confirmation of an intrauterine location, presence and chronicity of multiple gestations, presence of uterine anomalies, or presence of other pelvic pathology, and patients with complaints of bleeding or pain should be referred for immediate ultrasound on presentation.

The clinical calculator "Due Date Calculator for Pregnant Patients (last menstrual period)" for intrauterine growth restriction, termination of pregnancy, Cesarean delivery, assisted vaginal delivery, premature rupture of membranes, preterm labor, induction of labor, advanced maternal age pregnancy, early pregnancy, assisted human reproduction and early pregnancy loss.

The Due Date Calculator for Pregnant Patients, often referred to as the Last Menstrual Period (LMP) Calculator, is specifically designed to estimate the expected date of delivery (EDD) or "due date" based on the first day of a woman's last menstrual period. This is a critical aspect of prenatal care, as it helps clinicians to monitor fetal development, schedule appropriate prenatal tests, and anticipate potential complications. 

The LMP calculator assumes a standard 28-day menstrual cycle and that ovulation occurs on day 14. Therefore, it may not be accurate for women with irregular cycles, those who cannot recall the first day of their last menstrual period, or those who conceived while using contraceptive methods that suppress menstruation. Additionally, it may not be applicable for pregnancies resulting from assisted reproductive technologies such as in-vitro fertilization, where the date of conception is known. In such cases, alternative methods of estimating the due date may be more appropriate.

### Menstrual cycle changes as women approach the final menses: what matters? [^fcd1ea4d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Increased variability in menstrual cycle length marks the onset of the menopausal transition, with the likelihood of long cycles increasing as women approach menopause. This article describes the STRAW+10 bleeding criteria for recognizing onset of the early and late menopausal transition, as well as the specific bleeding changes a woman may experience during this life stage, including how women's bleeding experiences differ. The high probability of episodes of excessive and prolonged bleeding as women approach their final menstrual period is documented, as is the continuing probability of ovulation as women reach their final menstrual period.

### Committee opinion No 700: methods for estimating the due date [^4b9f5e4d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods for estimating the due date—recommendations—Ultrasound measurement of the embryo or fetus in the first trimester (up to and including 13 6/7 weeks of gestation) is the most accurate method to establish or confirm gestational age. If pregnancy resulted from assisted reproductive technology (ART), the ART-derived gestational age should be used to assign the estimated due date (EDD). For instance, the EDD for a pregnancy that resulted from in vitro fertilization should be assigned using the age of the embryo and the date of transfer. As soon as data from the last menstrual period (LMP), the first accurate ultrasound examination, or both are obtained, the gestational age and the EDD should be determined, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record. Subsequent changes to the EDD should be reserved for rare circumstances, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record. When determined from the methods outlined in this document for estimating the due date, gestational age at delivery represents the best obstetric estimate for the purpose of clinical care and should be recorded on the birth certificate. For the purposes of research and surveillance, the best obstetric estimate, rather than estimates based on the LMP alone, should be used as the measure for gestational age.

### Postpartum uptake of contraception in rural Northern Malawi: a prospective study [^662bed68]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Women who have recently given birth can be cost-effectively targeted for family planning (FP) education and engagement because often they are already connected with health professionals,,. In Malawi, women are expected to contact health services either for themselves or their infant during the first 9 months after delivery. Although 42% of married women in Malawi reported using modern contraception in cross-sectional surveys in 2010 (higher than other countries in the region), the total fertility rate remains high at 5.7; this disconnect between contraceptive use and fertility deserves exploration. Maternal mortality is high, estimated at 675 deaths per 100,000 live births, and underfive mortality is estimated at 112 deaths per 1000 live births in 2010. Contraception to help women prevent mistimed or unintended pregnancies is an important public health intervention.

The postpartum period refers to the time from delivering a baby until menses start again, which varies between women. Some researchers refer to an immediate 6-week postpartum period for clinical reasons or an extended postpartum period that is the first year after birth,. This 1-year postpartum period is important for the welfare of mother and child and is complex in terms of fertility return: sexual activity, breastfeeding, amenorrhea, postpartum reduced fecundity and use of contraception may all change rapidly,. Typically, postpartum women do not wish to become pregnant again soon after delivering an infant, but many women in sub-Saharan Africa do not use contraception during this time. Sexually active women whose fecundity has returned are at risk of unintended pregnancy.

Postpartum abstinence (PPA) in Malawi is a traditional means to space births, and in northern Malawi, traditions are strengthened because women are considered to be “polluted” after delivering a baby until menses have returned. A study found that northern Malawi has longer PPA than other regions (17 months in northern Malawi compared to 10 months in the south and 7 months in the central region, in 1998). However, it appears that the duration of PPA in Malawi has been decreasing in the context of the HIV epidemic, as women may be concerned that their husbands would stray. A more recent estimate by the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) using cross-sectional data estimates the median duration of PPA to be 4.6 months in Malawi overall, 4.9 months for the northern region, 3.1 in the central region and 6.5 in the southern region.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^a6888529]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Contraceptive initiation—criteria to be reasonably certain a patient is not pregnant: CDC recommends that health care providers use specific criteria with high accuracy to rule out pregnancy (negative predictive value 99%–100%). A health care provider can be reasonably certain a patient is not pregnant if the patient has no symptoms or signs of pregnancy and meets any one criterion, including: is ≤7 days after the start of normal menses; has not had sexual intercourse since the start of last normal menses; has been correctly and consistently using a reliable method of contraception; is ≤7 days after spontaneous or induced abortion; is within 4 weeks postpartum; or is fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (exclusively breastfeeding or the vast majority [≥85%] of feeds are breastfeeds), amenorrheic, and <6 months postpartum. If a patient meets one of these criteria, a urine pregnancy test might be considered based on clinical judgment, recognizing limitations; if no criteria are met, the provider cannot be reasonably certain even with a negative test. Routine pregnancy testing for every patient is not necessary.

2. You may not have your period this month but this is expected.

However, if you miss your period 2 months in a row, call your health-care provider because you might be pregnant.

3. You COULD BECOME PREGNANT if you have sex in the 7 days after you restart your pills. You MUST use a nonhormonal birth-control method (such as condoms or spermicide) as a back-up for those 7 days.

If you forget any of the 7 white "reminder" pills in Week 4:

THROW AWAY the pills you missed.

Keep taking 1 pill each day until the pack is empty.

You do not need a back-up nonhormonal birth-control method if you start your next pack on time.

FINALLY, IF YOU ARE STILL NOT SURE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE PILLS YOU HAVE MISSED

Use a BACK-UP NONHORMONAL BIRTH-CONTROL METHOD anytime you have sex.

KEEP TAKING ONE PILL EACH DAY until you can reach your health-care provider.

BIRTH CONTROL AFTER STOPPING THE PILL

If you do not wish to become pregnant after stopping the pill, speak to your health-care provider about another method of birth control.

DETAILED PATIENT LABELING

This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. Oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis.

INTRODUCTION

Any woman who considers using oral contraceptives (the "birth-control pill" or "the pill") should understand the benefits and risks of using this form of birth control. This leaflet will give you much of the information you will need to make this decision and will also help you determine if you are at risk of developing any of the serious side effects of the pill. It will tell you how to use the pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. However, this leaflet is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your health-care provider. You should discuss the information provided in this leaflet with him or her, both when you first start taking the pill and during your revisits. You should also follow your health-care provider's advice with regard to regular check-ups while you are on the pill.

### Effects of breastfeeding education interventions during pregnancy on breastfeeding practices in rural south Ethiopia: a protocol for cluster randomized controlled trial [^e7e5b00c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Population, intervention, control and outcome (PICO)

Population

Null-parous pregnant women who are in between the end of their first trimester and the early second trimester (< 16 weeks) of pregnancy, who have not given birth before (nullipara), who will give consent, and who have resided in the area for at least six months will be included. This is to allow at least five months to change behavior after the initial intervention. Women with a previous history of stillbirth will be excluded. Pregnant women whose mother-in-law died or was unavailable will be excluded. Pregnant women who have already received breastfeeding practice education interventions from previous trials, if any, will be excluded to avoid cumulative effects. During the study follow-up, in case participants experience adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes such as abortion and stillbirth, they will not be followed-up any more. Most of the time, women in their first trimester do not know whether they are pregnant, especially rural women. Thus, to confirm their pregnancy, we will do a pregnancy test using urine samples (HCG test). Before doing the pregnancy test, we will ask the women for the following information: when did a woman observe her last menstrual period; whether a woman is currently using any contraceptive method; if she has been tested and confirmed pregnant; and whether a woman feels that she is pregnant. Based on this information, we do register women for sampling. After sampling, we do a pregnancy test to confirm pregnancy. In case a woman or women are not pregnant, we substitute them from the registration and test them as well. We preferred these pregnancy testing procedures to minimize cost, as testing all potential women for pregnancy is not feasible. Once eligible pregnant women are identified, baseline data collection and interventions will be started.

### Menstruation in girls and adolescents: using the menstrual cycle as a vital sign (...) [^01416f2e]. publications.aap.org (2006). Low credibility.

Young patients and their parents often are unsure about what represents normal menstrual patterns, and clinicians also may be unsure about normal ranges for menstrual cycle length and amount and duration of flow through adolescence. It is important to be able to educate young patients and their parents regarding what to expect of a first period and about the range for normal cycle length of subsequent menses. Menarche typically occurs within 2 to 3 years after thelarche, at Tanner stage IV breast development, and is rare before Tanner stage III development. 10 Menarche correlates with age at onset of puberty and breast development. In girls with early onset of breast development, the interval to menarche is longer than in girls with later onset. 11–13 By 15 years of age, 98% of females will have had menarche. 3, 14. 16 Most females bleed for 2 to 7 days during their first menses.

17–19 Early menstrual life is characterized by anovulatory cycles, 20, 21 but the frequency of ovulation is related to both time since menarche and age at menarche. 21–23 Early menarche is associated with early onset of ovulatory cycles. When the age at menarche is younger than 12 years, 50% of cycles are ovulatory in the first gynecologic year. 23 Despite variability, most normal cycles range from 21 to 45 days, even in the first gynecologic year, 16–18 although short cycles of fewer than 20 days and long cycles of more than 45 days may occur. Because long cycles most often occur in the first 3 years postmenarche, the overall trend is toward shorter and more regular cycles with increasing age. By the third year after menarche, 60% to 80% of menstrual cycles are 21 to 34 days long, as is typical of adults. 16, 18, 24 An individual's normal cycle length is established around the sixth gynecologic year, at a chronologic age of approximately 19 or 20 years. 16, 18.

Two large studies, one cataloging 275947 cycles in 2702 females and another reporting on 31645 cycles in 656 females, support the observation that menstrual cycles in girls and adolescents typically range from 21 to approximately 45 days, even in the first gynecologic year.

### Committee opinion No 700: methods for estimating the due date [^0aa46e05]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy due date estimation—conclusion and EDD adjustment guidance states that the best available data support adjusting the estimated due date (EDD) if the first ultrasonography is in the third trimester and suggests a discrepancy in gestational dating of more than 21 days. As soon as data from the last menstrual period (LMP) or the first accurate ultrasound examination are obtained, the gestational age and the EDD should be determined, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record, and subsequent changes to the EDD should be reserved for rare circumstances. When determined from the outlined methods, gestational age at delivery represents the best obstetric estimate for the purpose of clinical care and should be recorded on the birth certificate, and for research and surveillance the best obstetric estimate, rather than estimates based on the LMP alone, should be used as the measure for gestational age. A pregnancy without an ultrasound examination that confirms or revises the EDD before 22 0/7 weeks of gestation age should be considered suboptimally dated. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, and the Society for Maternal–Fetal Medicine recognize the advantages of a single dating paradigm being used within and between institutions, and Table 1 provides guidelines for estimating the due date based on ultrasonography and the LMP with single-point cutoffs and ranges.

If unknown gestational age, rough estimated gestational age with palpation of the uterine fundus at the umbilicus is 20 weeks, and only ask for estimated last menstrual period (first day of last period) if patient has not had prenatal care/ultrasound and does not know their due date. The location where patient receives care is considered a preferred destination if time delay is not an issue and based on local protocols.

### Return of ovulation and menses in postpartum nonlactating women: a systematic review [^fe09f5f4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate, from the literature, when nonlactating postpartum women regain fertility.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed and Cochrane Library databases for all articles (in all languages) published in peer-reviewed journals from database inception through May 2010 for evidence related to the return of ovulation and menses in nonlactating postpartum women. Search terms included "Fertility" (Mesh) OR "Ovulation" (Mesh) OR "Ovulation Detection" (Mesh) OR "Ovulation Prediction" (Mesh) OR fertility OR ovulat* AND "Postpartum Period" (Mesh) OR postpartum OR puerperium AND Human AND Female.

Methods Of Study Selection

We included articles assessing nonlactating women's first ovulation postpartum. Studies in which women breastfed for any period of time or in whom lactation was suppressed with medications were excluded.

Tabulation, Integration and Results

We identified 1,623 articles; six articles reported four studies met our inclusion criteria. In three studies utilizing urinary pregnanediol levels to measure ovulation, mean day of first ovulation ranged from 45 to 94 days postpartum; 20%-71% of first menses were preceded by ovulation and 0%-60% of these ovulations were potentially fertile. In one study that used basal body temperature to measure ovulation, mean first ovulation occurred on day 74 postpartum; 33% of first menses were preceded by ovulation and 70% of these were potentially fertile.

Conclusion

Most nonlactating women will not ovulate until 6 weeks postpartum. A small number of women will ovulate earlier, potentially putting them at risk for pregnancy sooner, although the fertility of these early ovulations is not well-established. The potential risk of pregnancy soon after delivery underscores the importance of initiating postpartum contraception in a timely fashion.

### Timed intercourse for couples trying to conceive [^49ada7ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fertility problems are very common, as subfertility affects about 10% to 15% of couples trying to conceive. There are many factors that may impact a couple's ability to conceive and one of these may be incorrect timing of intercourse. Conception is only possible from approximately five days before up to several hours after ovulation. Therefore, to be effective, intercourse must take place during this fertile period. 'Timed intercourse' is the practice of prospectively identifying ovulation and, thus, the fertile period to increase the likelihood of conception. Whilst timed intercourse may increase conception rates and reduce unnecessary intervention and costs, there may be associated adverse aspects including time consumption and stress. Ovulation prediction methods used for timing intercourse include urinary hormone measurement (luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen), tracking basal body temperatures, cervical mucus investigation, calendar charting and ultrasonography. This review considered the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the use of timed intercourse on positive pregnancy outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and risks of ovulation prediction methods for timing intercourse on conception in couples trying to conceive.

Search Methods

We searched the following sources to identify relevant randomised controlled trials, the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, LILACS, Web of Knowledge, the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Register Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Furthermore, we manually searched the references of relevant articles. The search was not restricted by language or publication status. The last search was on 5 August 2014.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction or comparing different methods of ovulation prediction for timing intercourse against each other in couples trying to conceive.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. The primary review outcomes were cumulative live birth and adverse events (such as quality of life, depression and stress). Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, pregnancy (clinical or self-reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) and time to conception. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods.

Main Results

We included five RCTs (2840 women or couples) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction. Unfortunately one large study (n = 1453) reporting live birth and pregnancy had not published outcome data by randomised group and therefore could not be analysed. Consequently, four RCTs (n = 1387) were included in the meta-analysis. The evidence was of low to very low quality. Main limitations for downgrading the evidence included imprecision, lack of reporting clinically relevant outcomes and the high risk of publication bias.One study reported live birth, but the sample size was too small to draw any relevant conclusions on the effect of timed intercourse (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.41, 1 RCT, n = 17, very low quality).One study reported stress as an adverse event. There was no evidence of a difference in levels of stress (mean difference 1.98, 95 CI% -0.87 to 4.83, 1 RCT, n = 77, low level evidence). No other studies reported adverse events.Two studies reported clinical pregnancy. There was no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy rates (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.12, 2 RCTs, n = 177, I(2) = 0%, low level evidence). This suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 16%, the chance of success following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%.Four studies reported pregnancy rate (clinical or self-reported pregnancy). Timed intercourse was associated with higher pregnancy rates compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction in couples trying to conceive (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.71, 4 RCTs, n = 1387, I(2) = 0%, very low level evidence). This suggests that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. Subgroup analysis by duration of subfertility showed no difference in effect between couples trying to conceive for < 12 months versus couples trying for ≥ 12 months. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception.

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient data available to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of timed intercourse for the outcomes of live birth, adverse events and clinical pregnancy. Timed intercourse may improve pregnancy rates (clinical or self-reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction. The quality of this evidence is low to very low and therefore findings should be regarded with caution. There is a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished 8 years after recruitment finished. Further research is required, reporting clinically relevant outcomes (live birth, clinical pregnancy rates and adverse effects), to determine if timed intercourse is safe and effective in couples trying to conceive.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^046be0d1]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea—definitions and thresholds for evaluation—Amenorrhea is the absence or abnormal cessation of menses, with primary amenorrhea evaluated when there is failure to menstruate by the age of 15 in the presence of normal secondary sexual development (2 standard deviations above the mean of 13 years), or within 5 years after breast development if that occurs before the age of 10; failure to initiate breast development by the age of 13 (2 standard deviations above the mean of 10 years) also requires investigation. In women with regular menstrual cycles, a delay of menses for as little as 1 week may require the exclusion of pregnancy. Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for > 3 months in those with previously regular cycles or 6 months in those with irregular menses, and requires investigation.

### Efficacy of a new postpartum transition protocol for avoiding pregnancy [^014aef23]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The postpartum period is a challenging time for family planning, especially for women who breastfeed. Breastfeeding delays the return of menses (lactational amenorrhea), but ovulation often occurs before first menses. For this reason, a protocol was developed to assist women in identifying their return of fertility postpartum to avoid pregnancy.

Methods

In this prospective, 12-month, longitudinal cohort study, 198 postpartum women aged 20 to 45 years (mean age, 30.2 years) were taught a protocol for avoiding pregnancy with either online or in-person instruction. A hand-held fertility monitor was used to identify the fertile period by testing for urinary changes in estrogen and luteinizing hormone, and the results were tracked on a web site. During lactational amenorrhea, urine testing was done in 20-day intervals. When menses returned, the monitor was reset at the onset of each new menstrual cycle. Participants were instructed to avoid intercourse during the identified fertile period. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to calculate unintentional pregnancy rates through the first 12 months postpartum.

Results

There were 8 unintended pregnancies per 100 women at 12 months postpartum. With correct use, there were 2 unintended pregnancies per 100 women at 12 months.

Conclusion

The online postpartum protocol may effectively assist a select group of women in avoiding pregnancy during the transition to regular menstrual cycles.

### Global, regional, and national estimates of levels of preterm birth in 2014: a systematic review and modelling analysis [^484c9a75]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

WHO defines preterm birth as all births before 37 completed weeks of gestation, or fewer than 259 days from the first date of a woman's last menstrual period.Complications of preterm birth were the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years of age globally in 2016, accounting for approximately 16% of all deaths, and 35% of deaths among newborn babies.

Preterm neonates who survive are at greater risk of a range of short-term and long-term morbidities. Common complications of preterm birth are high rates of respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, periventricular leucomalacia, seizures, intraventricular haemorrhage, cerebral palsy, infections, feeding difficulties, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, and visual and hearing problems.,,,,,,Preterm birth is associated with significant costs to health systems, and families of preterm newborns often experience considerable psychological and financial hardship.,Although the risks of mortality and morbidity are much higher in early gestation (<34 weeks), late preterm birth (34<37 weeks) occurs more often, and newborn babies born late preterm have significantly higher risks of adverse outcomes than babies born at term.The 37 week cutoff for preterm birth is somewhat arbitrary, as early term births (37 and 38 weeks) have higher rates of adverse outcomes than full term gestations (39 and 40 weeks).Preterm births can be classified as spontaneous (due to spontaneous preterm labour or preterm prelabour rupture of membranes) or provider-initiated (caesarean or labour induction, for a maternal or fetal indication).Although many sociodemographic, nutritional, biological, and environmental factors can increase the risk of spontaneous preterm birth, the cause is not fully understood.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2016—Recommendation 84: We suggest that women who are treated with antithyroid drugs (ATD) and who may potentially become pregnant should be instructed to perform a pregnancy test within the first days after a missed or unusually light menstrual period, because the period of major risk of birth defects caused by intake of medication in pregnancy is gestational weeks 6–10 and withdrawal of ATD therapy before week 5 of pregnancy may theoretically prevent birth defects, with pregnancy tests normally becoming positive early in gestational week 5. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### ABM clinical protocol # 13: contraception during breastfeeding, revised 2015 [^52c4654a]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) criteria and counseling—LAM includes three criteria for defining the period of lowest pregnancy risk, and if one criterion is not met, women should immediately initiate another method. Clinically, mothers are asked: Are you amenorrheic, meaning that you have not had a menstrual bleed or any bleed of > 2 days in duration, discounting any bleed in the first 2 months; Are you fully or nearly fully breastfeeding; and Is your infant less than 6 months of age. If she answers yes to all three questions, she meets the requirements for LAM; if any answer is no, her chance of pregnancy is increased and she should be advised to initiate another form of contraception to prevent pregnancy. Definitions specify that full or nearly full breastfeeding includes exclusive, nearly exclusive, and some irregularly provided supplements as long as they do not disrupt the frequency of feeds, and that menses return is defined as any bleeding that occurs after 56 days postpartum that is perceived by the patient as a menses, or any two consecutive days of bleeding. Clinicians should ensure that she has chosen her next method of contraception and either has it on hand or knows how to obtain it if it is an implant or intrauterine device (IUD).

### Induction of labour at or beyond 37 weeks' gestation [^e0f8fabf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Risks of stillbirth or neonatal death increase as gestation continues beyond term (around 40 weeks' gestation). It is unclear whether a policy of labour induction can reduce these risks. This Cochrane Review is an update of a review that was originally published in 2006 and subsequently updated in 2012 and 2018.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a policy of labour induction at or beyond 37 weeks' gestation compared with a policy of awaiting spontaneous labour indefinitely (or until a later gestational age, or until a maternal or fetal indication for induction of labour arises) on pregnancy outcomes for the infant and the mother.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (17 July 2019), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in pregnant women at or beyond 37 weeks, comparing a policy of labour induction with a policy of awaiting spontaneous onset of labour (expectant management). We also included trials published in abstract form only. Cluster-RCTs, quasi-RCTs and trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion in this review. We included pregnant women at or beyond 37 weeks' gestation. Since risk factors at this stage of pregnancy would normally require intervention, only trials including women at low risk for complications, as defined by trialists, were eligible. The trials of induction of labour in women with prelabour rupture of membranes at or beyond term were not considered in this review but are considered in a separate Cochrane Review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

In this updated review, we included 34 RCTs (reporting on over 21,000 women and infants) mostly conducted in high-income settings. The trials compared a policy to induce labour usually after 41 completed weeks of gestation (> 287 days) with waiting for labour to start and/or waiting for a period before inducing labour. The trials were generally at low to moderate risk of bias. Compared with a policy of expectant management, a policy of labour induction was associated with fewer (all-cause) perinatal deaths (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.64; 22 trials, 18,795 infants; high-certainty evidence). There were four perinatal deaths in the labour induction policy group compared with 25 perinatal deaths in the expectant management group. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) with induction of labour, in order to prevent one perinatal death, was 544 (95% CI 441 to 1042). There were also fewer stillbirths in the induction group (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.75; 22 trials, 18,795 infants; high-certainty evidence); two in the induction policy group and 16 in the expectant management group. For women in the policy of induction arms of trials, there were probably fewer caesarean sections compared with expectant management (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.95; 31 trials, 21,030 women; moderate-certainty evidence); and probably little or no difference in operative vaginal births with induction (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.10; 22 trials, 18,584 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Induction may make little or difference to perineal trauma (severe perineal tear: RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.26; 5 trials; 11,589 women; low-certainty evidence). Induction probably makes little or no difference to postpartum haemorrhage (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.15, 9 trials; 12,609 women; moderate-certainty evidence), or breastfeeding at discharge (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04; 2 trials, 7487 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Very low certainty evidence means that we are uncertain about the effect of induction or expectant management on the length of maternal hospital stay (average mean difference (MD) -0.19 days, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.18; 7 trials; 4120 women; Tau² = 0.20; I² = 94%). Rates of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission were lower (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.96; 17 trials, 17,826 infants; high-certainty evidence), and probably fewer babies had Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes in the induction groups compared with expectant management (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.96; 20 trials, 18,345 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). Induction or expectant management may make little or no difference for neonatal encephalopathy (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.31; 2 trials, 8851 infants; low-certainty evidence, and probably makes little or no difference for neonatal trauma (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.49; 5 trials, 13,106 infants; moderate-certainty evidence) for induction compared with expectant management. Neurodevelopment at childhood follow-up and postnatal depression were not reported by any trials. In subgroup analyses, no differences were seen for timing of induction (< 40 versus 40-41 versus > 41 weeks' gestation), by parity (primiparous versus multiparous) or state of cervix for any of the main outcomes (perinatal death, stillbirth, NICU admission, caesarean section, operative vaginal birth, or perineal trauma).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a clear reduction in perinatal death with a policy of labour induction at or beyond 37 weeks compared with expectant management, though absolute rates are small (0.4 versus 3 deaths per 1000). There were also lower caesarean rates without increasing rates of operative vaginal births and there were fewer NICU admissions with a policy of induction. Most of the important outcomes assessed using GRADE had high- or moderate-certainty ratings. While existing trials have not yet reported on childhood neurodevelopment, this is an important area for future research. The optimal timing of offering induction of labour to women at or beyond 37 weeks' gestation needs further investigation, as does further exploration of risk profiles of women and their values and preferences. Offering women tailored counselling may help them make an informed choice between induction of labour for pregnancies, particularly those continuing beyond 41 weeks - or waiting for labour to start and/or waiting before inducing labour.

### Segesterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (annovera) [^8153e1dc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If you are starting ANNOVERA after childbirth:

You may start using ANNOVERA no sooner than 4 weeks (28 days) after having a baby if you are not breastfeeding.
If you have not gotten your menstrual period after childbirth, you should talk to your healthcare provider. You may need a pregnancy test to make sure you are not pregnant before you start using ANNOVERA.
Use another birth control method, such as a male condom or spermicide, during sexual intercourse for the first 7 days you use ANNOVERA if you have not yet had a period.

If you are breastfeeding, you should not use ANNOVERA. Use other birth control methods until you are no longer breastfeeding.

How do I use ANNOVERA?

What else should I know about ANNOVERA?

The day of the week when you first insert ANNOVERA (called "Day 1") is your vaginal system change day. This is described further in the Patient Information section entitled "How should I use ANNOVERA?"
For each cycle, you put the vaginal system into your vagina and let it stay there 3 weeks (21 full days). Remember to keep the vaginal system in for the whole 3 weeks (21 full days).
You take the vaginal system out on your vaginal system change day (Day 22) and let it stay out for 1 week (7 full days). Note that your vaginal system should be stored in the case provided, away from children, pets, and extreme temperatures.
Then you start over again for another 4 weeks. You may not be bleeding when you put the vaginal system in.
Always put the vaginal system in or take it out on your vaginal system change day at about the same time of day. For example, if you put your vaginal system in on Monday at 9:00 in the morning, always take it out or put it back in on Monday at about 9:00 in the morning.
You do not have to take the vaginal system out when you have sex. If you decide to remove it, remember to reinsert it within 2 hours after removing it or you may not be protected from pregnancy. However, if ANNOVERA is out of your vagina for more than 2 hours at one time or if ANNOVERA is out of your vagina at different times that add up to more than a total of 2 hours over the first 21 days of your cycle, you will need to use another method of birth control until ANNOVERA has been in your vagina for 7 days in a row, such as male condoms or spermicides.
Repeat the 4-week cycle for all 13 cycles of the use of the vaginal system.
Do not use the vaginal system for more than 13 cycles (1 year). When you take the vaginal system out of your vagina at the end of the 13 cycles, dispose of it. See " How should I dispose of (throw away) ANNOVERA? " below.
If you want to continue using ANNOVERA after 13 cycles, you will need to get a new prescription from your healthcare provider to obtain a new vaginal system.
Do not to use any vaginal products such as oil-based suppositories, oil-based creams, or oil-based gels while the vaginal system is in your vagina. Do not use any vaginal lubricants that have silicone or oil in them. Water-based lubricants are ok to use. Be sure to read the ingredients on the labels carefully before you buy a vaginal lubricant.
First insertion of ANNOVERA must be prior to the date of expiration. Discard one year after first insertion. See " How should I dispose of (throw away) ANNOVERA? " below.
Do not take any medicines unless your healthcare provider says it is ok to take them.

### Age among women and men, time to pregnancy and risk of miscarriage [^14631347]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Time to pregnancy and miscarriage

As described earlier, time to pregnancy and mode of conception were assessed through questionnaires in preconception and early pregnancy. We used questions regarding the date at which women started trying to conceive and refrained from using contraceptives (start date pursuing pregnancy) or the date of assisted reproductive technology, including intrauterine insemination (IUI), ovulation induction, in vitro fertilization (IVF), and intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Time to pregnancy was calculated as the difference between the start date of pursuing pregnancy and the first day of the last menstrual period. When participants were included during the preconception period, they informed the study group when they obtained a self-performed positive pregnancy test and were asked what their first day of the last menstrual period was. Also, all women without information about a conception received a questionnaire about fertility outcomes 1 year after their enrollment. If participants were included during the first trimester, the first day of the last menstrual period was obtained during their registration visit and in questionnaires. The first day of the last menstrual period was then reconfirmed during the ultrasounds at the 7, 9, or 11 weeks visits to the research center. In women who did not conceive, the duration of pursuing pregnancy was calculated from the start date of pursuing pregnancy and the last day of study participation (i.e. the date when voluntarily withdrawing) or the study end date. Inclusion of participants ended on December 31, 2020, and non-pregnant women were followed up until July 1, 2021 (study end date). Ongoing pregnancies at that point were followed up until birth. Time to pregnancy was assessed both continuously and categorized. Continuous time to pregnancy was used to assess fecundability. Fecundability was defined as the per-month probability of conceiving, defined as 4 weeks (28 days), to represent a regular menstrual cycle length. Time to pregnancy was categorized as fertile (time to pregnancy of 0–52 weeks, corresponding to 0–12 months) or infertile (time to pregnancy or, in case of not conceiving, duration of pursuing pregnancy of > 52 weeks, corresponding to > 12 months, or the use of assisted reproductive technology), according to the clinical definition. Spontaneous miscarriage was defined as a pregnancy loss before 22 weeks of gestation. Date of miscarriage was obtained from the obstetric caregiver. Gestational age at miscarriage was based on the first day of the last menstrual period, the due date based on ultrasonography, date of IUI, or embryo implant day minus 14 days in case of IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection.

### Time to the final menstrual period [^061c497b]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine, for a woman aged >45 years, whether selected hormonal, health status, and demographic measures are related to the time to final menstrual period (FMP) from a point where 6 weeks separate the shortest and longest cycles experienced to date.

Design

Cohort study.

Setting

Volunteers in an academic research environment.

Patient(S)

Ninety-nine menstruating women aged 46 years to 55 years on entry completed menstrual diaries, gave annual blood samples, and were interviewed annually. They were observed for a mean period of 1.5 years. Seventy-seven reached FMP during observation.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Time to reach FMP from the date of a marker event-the difference between the longest and shortest of recent cycles reaching 6 weeks.

Result(S)

Women self-rating as in the transition have a greater "hazard" or probability of FMP at any time after the marker event. Allowing for this and other covariates, the hazard is estimated to increase by 30% (confidence interval [CI]: 10%, 60%) for each year of age and 50% (CI: 7%, 118%) for each unit increase in log FSH, measured at the time of the marker event.

Conclusion(S)

For women aged >45 years, the time remaining in the menopausal transition from the day on which >or=6 weeks separate the longest and shortest recent cycles is related to self-rating of menopausal status and to serum FSH level. The median number of months remaining ranges from 11 for those with FSH of >20 IU/L and who see themselves as in transition to 21 months for those with lower FSH and who notice little evidence of being in transition.

### Immediate start of hormonal contraceptives for contraception [^1b594600]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Health care providers often tell women to wait until the next menses to begin hormonal contraception. The intent is to avoid contraceptive use during an undetected pregnancy. An alternative is to start hormonal contraception immediately with back-up birth control for the first seven days. Immediate initiation was introduced with combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and has expanded to other hormonal contraceptives. At the time of the initial review, how immediate start compared to conventional menses-dependent start was unclear regarding effectiveness, continuation, and acceptability. The immediate-start approach may improve women's access to, and continuation of, hormonal contraception.

Objectives

This review examined randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of immediate-start hormonal contraception for differences in effectiveness, continuation, and acceptability.

Search Methods

In August 2012, we searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, POPLINE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP for trials of immediate-start hormonal contraceptives. We contacted researchers to find other studies. Earlier searches also included EMBASE.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared immediate start to conventional start of hormonal contraception. Also included were trials that compared immediate start of different hormonal contraceptive methods with each other.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted by two authors and entered into RevMan. The Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated.

Main Results

Five studies were included. No new eligible studies have been found since the review was initially conducted. Method discontinuation was similar between groups in all trials. Bleeding patterns and side effects were similar in trials that compared immediate with conventional start. In a study of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), immediate start of DMPA showed fewer pregnancies than a 'bridge' method before DMPA (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.84). Further, more women in the immediate-DMPA group were very satisfied versus those with a 'bridge' method (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.77). A trial of two immediate-start methods showed the vaginal ring group had less prolonged bleeding (OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.89) and less frequent bleeding (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.05 to 1.03) than COC users. The ring group also reported fewer side effects. Also, more immediate ring users were very satisfied than immediate COC users (OR 2.88; 95% CI 1.59 to 5.22).

Authors' Conclusions

We found limited evidence that immediate start of hormonal contraception reduces unintended pregnancies or increases method continuation. However, the pregnancy rate was lower with immediate start of DMPA versus another method. Some differences were associated with contraceptive type rather than initiation method, i.e., immediate ring versus immediate COC. More studies are needed of immediate versus conventional start of the same hormonal contraceptive.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^a4396e01]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Fertility awareness–based (FAB) methods—postpartum nonbreastfeeding categories designate <4 weeks as Delay for both methods and ≥4 weeks as Accept for symptoms-based and Delay for calendar-based. Nonbreastfeeding persons are not likely to have detectable fertility signs or hormonal changes before 4 weeks postpartum, and ovulation before first menses is common; therefore, a method appropriate for the postpartum period should be offered. At ≥4 weeks, ovarian function sufficient to produce detectable fertility signs is likely, and calendar-based methods can be used as soon as three postpartum menses have been completed; methods appropriate for the postpartum period should be offered before that time.

### Menstruation: choosing whether...and when [^7d338257]. Contraception (2000). Low credibility.

For many women in the United States, menstruation is a major health concern because menstrual disorders and other conditions that may be aggravated during menses (e.g., migraine headaches, epilepsy) carry substantial morbidity. Women today menstruate nearly 3 times as often as in primitive societies, and evidence suggests that frequent, repetitive menstrual cycles may increase health risks. Because the conventional 21/7 combination oral contraceptive (OC) regimen provides only limited relief for women with menstrual disorders, alternative OC regimens that reduce menstrual frequency have been proposed. A new OC formulation specifically designed to decrease menstrual bleeding to 4 times per year is currently under investigation. Most women welcome less frequent menses or even amenorrhea. Women who may derive particular benefit from reduced menstrual frequency include not only those with medical conditions directly caused or aggravated by menses, but also those serving in the military, female athletes, mentally-retarded women with menstrual hygiene problems, young teens, and perimenopausal women.

### Age among women and men, time to pregnancy and risk of miscarriage [^80396868]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Age among women and men

Information on age was obtained through questionnaires at enrollment. We used self-reported questions regarding the date at which women and men started trying to conceive or, if missing, the date at which women refrained from using contraceptives (start date pursuing pregnancy). The first day of the last menstrual period was obtained from the obstetric caregiver, based on the due date calculated at ultrasonography. Age at pursuing pregnancy of women and men was calculated by subtracting the birth date of women and men from the start date of actively trying to conceive. Age at conception was calculated by subtracting the birth date from the first day of the last menstrual period. Age was categorized in < 25.0 years, 25.0–29.9 years, 30.0–34.9 years, 35.0–39.9 years and ≥ 40.0 years. Age of women and men combined was categorized in both aged < 35 years, only men aged ≥ 35 years, only women aged ≥ 35 years, and both aged ≥ 35 years.

Fertility awareness–based (FAB) methods—breastfeeding: For ≤6 weeks postpartum, symptoms-based and calendar-based methods are Delay; for ≥6 weeks postpartum, symptoms-based is Caution and calendar-based is Delay; after menses begin, both are Caution. “Use of FAB methods when breastfeeding might be less effective than when not breastfeeding,” and among persons primarily breastfeeding and amenorrheic, detectable fertility signs and hormonal changes are unlikely “during the first 6 months postpartum.” “Once fertility signs are noted, particularly cervical secretions, then symptoms-based methods can be used.” For calendar-based use, “When there have been at least three postpartum menses and cycles are regular again, a calendar-based method can be used”; furthermore, “When there have been at least four postpartum menses and the most recent cycle lasted 26–32 days, the standard days method can be used,” and “Before that time, a barrier method should be offered if the patient plans to use a FAB method later.”

### Birth intervals and breast cancer risk [^ff5d773d]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Theories of hormonal mechanisms of breast cancer development are primarily based on exposure to excessive endogenous oestrogens (;). The influence of endogenous hormones on the risk of breast cancer of women may involve in addition to estrogens effects of progesterone, prolactin, testosterone and IGF-1 on terminal differentiation of mammary stem cells. Estrogens and progesterone are mitogenic for epithelial breast cells, and may stimulate breast cell proliferation. During pregnancy, progesterone induces lobular–alveolar development and differentiation for lactation, and estrogens regulate ductal growth. Older premenopausal and perimenopausal women have been claimed to be at increased risk, possibly implying an increased growth rate for present tumours during the menopause, perhaps due to the effects of oestrogen unopposed by progesterone.

Studies on the possible role of prolactin in breast cancer have yielded inconsistent results – protective or carcinogenic effects or no effect (;). The most recent prospective study suggests that prolactin might increase the risk of breast cancer. During pregnancy, prolactin level rises strongly from the eighth week onwards reaching the peak concentration at term. Thereafter prolactin, the principal hormone for milk biosynthesis, remains elevated only in nursing mothers, in whom each breastfeeding induces a transient peak in its level. In non-lactating woman prolactin concentration declines rapidly, which allows early resumption of ovulatory menstrual cycle and early fecundation after the birth. The contraceptive effect of prolactin is not absolute; the efficacy weakens especially from the fourth postpartum month onward. Fecundation of lactating GM mother within 3–4 months after her first childbirth is thus possible but supposedly a rare phenomenon. In such a case, the joint actions of prolactin, (induced by suckling) and progesterone (from corpus luteum of the second pregnancy) would initiate, in the beginning of second pregnancy, abnormal cellular changes owing to the potential for breast cancer development. Alternatively, the long-term joint stimulatory actions of placental hormones (estrogens and progesterone) and prolactin during two closely consecutive pregnancies may serve as initiators for malignant transformation of epithelial breast cells.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^f2a48f34]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs)—timing and evidence: When pregnancy status is uncertain, starting CHCs should be considered at any time, with a follow-up pregnancy test in 2–4 weeks, and if additional protection is needed when switching, consider continuing the previous method for 7 days after starting CHCs. A systematic review found pregnancy rates did not differ by the timing of CHC initiation, and physiologic data report no ovulations occurred when COCs were started at a follicle diameter of 10 mm (mean cycle day 7.6) or when the ring was started at 13 mm (median cycle day 11). Bleeding patterns and other side effects did not vary with the timing of CHC initiation, and although the “quick start” approach initially improved continuation, the advantage disappeared over time.

### Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol (tri-nymyo) [^232bbf1b]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2 How to Take Tri-Nymyo

Starting Tri-Nymyo after Abortion or Miscarriage

First-trimester

After a first-trimester abortion or miscarriage, Tri-Nymyo may be started immediately. An additional method of contraception is not needed if Tri-Nymyo is started immediately.
If Tri-Nymyo is not started within 5 days after termination of the pregnancy, the patient should use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of her first cycle pack of Tri-Nymyo.

Second-trimester

Do not start until 4 weeks after a second-trimester abortion or miscarriage, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start Tri-Nymyo, following the instructions in Table 1 for Day 1 or Sunday start, as desired. If using Sunday start, use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of the patient's first cycle pack of Tri-Nymyo. [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and FDA-Approved Patient Labeling .]

Starting Tri-Nymyo after Childbirth

Do not start until 4 weeks after delivery, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start contraceptive therapy with Tri-Nymyo following the instructions in Table 1 for women not currently using hormonal contraception.
Tri-Nymyo is not recommended for use in lactating women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
If the woman has not yet had a period postpartum, consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to use of Tri-Nymyo. [See Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3), and FDA-Approved Patient Labeling].

Compact Blister Dispenser

If the patient starts pill-taking on Sunday,the first active pill should be taken on the first Sunday after the patient's menstrual period begins.Remove the first active pill at the top of the dispenser (Sunday) by pressing the pill through the blister foil.

If the patient will start pill-taking on "Day 1," place a day-label sticker on the compact which starts with the day of the week the patient will take the first pill. Remove the first active pill at the top of the dispenser (Day 1) by pressing the pill through the blister foil.

### Determinants of postpartum uterine atony in urban south Ethiopia: a community-based unmatched nested case-control study [^8a6d5fcc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Independent variables

Independent variables were: Socio-demographic, economic and reproductive characteristics, which are measured as follows: The age of a woman is measured in years by asking how old she is and when she was born. Age at first childbirth measures at what age she has given her first birth, irrespective of the outcomes of the birth, and is reported in completed years. Parity is measured by asking a woman the number of times she gives birth, irrespective of the birth outcomes. The response was reported in numbers, and categorized as prim-para (if she has given birth only once) or multipara (if she has had more than one birth). The inter-pregnancy interval is measured by asking women about the dates of their most recent childbirth and their last menstrual period. Then it was computed by subtracting the date of recent childbirth from the date of the last menstrual period (LMP). For women who had difficulty recalling the date of LMP, ultrasound was used to estimate gestational age at the hospitals. LMP was computed by subtracting the duration of gestation, and then the value of the inter-pregnancy interval was calculated. The inter-pregnancy interval was categorized as < 24 months (short) and 24–60 months (normal), which is based on the World Health Organization recommendation for birth spacing. Pregnancy intention refers to whether the woman had a plan for pregnancy at the time of conception. If a woman had a plan, the response was categorized as ‘intended; if not, it was categorized as 'unintended'. Unintended pregnancy includes both mistimed and totally unwanted pregnancies. Pre-eclampsia was measured as the presence of pregnancy-related high blood pressure (≥ 140/90 mmHg) and protein in the urine, after 20 weeks of gestation, and was taken from the clients’ chart. If it occurs, it is reported as "present," otherwise it is reported as "absent." Premature rupture of membranes was measured as a rupture of membranes before the onset of labor and is categorized as ‘present’ or ‘absent. The duration of labor is the time that a woman stays in labor. If the true labor exceeds 12 h, irrespective of the stages, then it is categorized as ‘prolonged labor, otherwise ‘not prolonged'. The progress of labor refers to whether labor progresses in its natural course or is augmented or induced using utero-tonic drugs. If labor was induced or augmented, then it was classified as ‘assisted’, otherwise 'normal'. The mode of delivery is whether a woman gives birth spontaneously vaginally, assisted vaginally with instruments (forceps and vacuum), or via cesarean section. Birth characteristics refer to the number of babies born at the time of delivery (single or multiple). Gestational age refers to the number of weeks elapsed from the date of a woman’s last menstrual period until the date of delivery. If it was < 37 completed weeks, it was categorized as ‘preterm’, if it was from 37–41 weeks, including the 37 th week, it was categorized as ‘term’, and if it exceeded 41 weeks, it was categorized as 'post-term'. Birth weight is the weight of the newborn at birth, measured in grams. It was categorized as < 4500gms and ≥ 4500gms (macrosomia).

### Menarche and time to cycle regularity among individuals born between 1950 and 2005 in the US [^e0d36d4e]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Birth Year and Age at Menarche

We grouped self-reported year of birth as 1950 to 1969 (n = 5223), 1970 to 1979 (n = 12 226), 1980 to 1989 (n = 22 086), 1990 to 1999 (n = 23 894), and 2000 to 2005 (n = 7912). Participants were asked the question, “ At what age did you have your first menstrual period? It’s okay to estimate,” with the following response options: “7 years old or younger,” integer options between 8 and 15 years old, “16 years old or older,” “I don’t know,” or “I prefer not to answer.” Those who indicated they did not know or preferred not to answer or did not respond were excluded. We derived the following measures: (1) age at menarche (in years) (we assigned the value of 7 to those aged ≤7 years [196 (0.3%)] and the value of 16 to those aged ≥16 years [2447 (3.4%)]); (2) early menarche (yes/no) (age at menarche <11 years); (3) very early menarche (yes/no) (age at menarche <9 years); and (4) late menarche (yes/no) (age at menarche ≥16 years).

Time to Cycle Regularity

Participants were asked, “After your first menstrual cycle, how long did it take for your cycle to become regular?” with the following response options: “less than 1 year,” “1-2 years,” “3-4 years,” “more than 5 years,” “after using hormones (eg, birth control pills),” “They’re not yet regular,” “I don’t know,” or “I prefer not to answer.” Those who indicated don’t know or prefer not to answer or who did not respond were considered missing. We further excluded 224 individuals with potentially inaccurate time-to-regularity information (eMethods in Supplement 1). For the remaining 61 932 participants, we categorized time to regularity as 2 years or less, 3 to 4 years, more than 5 years, not yet regular, or regular after using hormones.

If the patient is <6 months postpartum, amenorrheic, and fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (exclusively breastfeeding or the vast majority [≥85%] of feeds are breastfeeds), no additional contraceptive protection is needed. Otherwise, a patient who is ≥21 days postpartum and whose menstrual cycle has not returned needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for the next 7 days; if the patient’s menstrual cycle has returned and it has been >7 days since menstrual bleeding began, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for the next 7 days.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 736—postpartum care timing and structure recommends that the timing of the comprehensive postpartum visit should be individualized and woman centered, and states that postpartum care should become an ongoing process, rather than a single encounter, with services and support tailored to each woman’s individual needs. To better meet needs, care would ideally include an initial assessment, either in person or by phone, within the first 3 weeks postpartum to address acute postpartum issues, followed by ongoing care as needed, concluding with a comprehensive well-woman visit no later than 12 weeks after birth. Context underscores that most women in the United States must independently navigate the postpartum transition until the traditional postpartum visit (4–6 weeks after delivery), that many cultures prescribe a 30–40-day period of rest, and that for many women in the United States the 6-week postpartum visit punctuates a period devoid of formal or informal maternal support; additionally, more than one half of pregnancy-related deaths occur after the birth of the infant. Insurance coverage policies should be aligned to support this tailored approach to “fourth trimester” care.

### Menstrual disorders (...) [^515cbdda]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

One of the major milestones during pubertal development in females is menarche. Although most adolescent women pass through this transition with relative ease, menstrual disorders such as amenorrhea, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and dysmenorrhea are common complaints that present to the primary care physician. .. . The median age of menarche in this country, according to the National Health Examination Survey, is 12. 77 years, with African-American females reaching menarche a few months before Caucasian females. Although almost 90% of females have achieved menarche by the time they reach Tanner stage 4 breast and pubic hair development, there is a mean of slightly more than 2 years between the onset of breast development and menarche. .. .

### The menstrual cycle: an overlooked vital sign in psychiatry? [^77cd2bed]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

An opportunity for stratified medicine

If a patient experiences mental state changes during the menstrual cycle, are they at risk of developing mental illness at other times of reproductive transition, such as childbirth and the perimenopause? Preliminary evidence suggests this is the case. Premenstrual syndrome is the strongest risk factor for postpartum depression identified by meta-analysis.A large survey of over 500 women with clinician-assessed major depressive disorder found that having premenstrual mood symptoms predicted both postpartum and perimenopausal mood symptoms.Improving understanding of ‘Hormonal trigger events’ has been identified as a research priority in PMDD by a recent UK-wide consultation.

An opportunity for intervention

What can be done if a patient reports menstrual cycle-related symptom worsening? At the simplest level, routine enquiry of menstrual cycle phase can improve understanding of triggers by uncovering a pattern of illness that is not always apparent to the patient. SA comments:

I was glad when my CPN first pointed out the link between my periods and psychotic symptoms as it wasn’t obvious to me.

Further, there is growing evidence that hormonal approaches can be efficacious for severe mental illness. A meta-analysis of six randomised controlled trials using adjunctive oestradiol in women with schizophrenia found benefits over placebo in both positive and negative symptom scalesand receiving hormone replacement therapy reduced hospitalisation rate for schizophrenia by 16%.If a female patient in mid-life is not responding to standard treatment for psychosis, evidence suggests adjunctive hormonal treatment should be considered.

An opportunity to enhance dignity

Respectfully enquiring about menstrual cycle phase may also be a way to support inpatients experiencing menstruation in as dignified and humane a way as possible. A 2024 patient-led reportfound that patients’ needs while menstruating in hospital are often overlooked, with inadequate access to period products, inadequate means of disposing of products and restriction of usual self-care approaches such as analgesia. SA comments:

The nurses thought they were helping my mental health by insisting I got out of bed but when I’m on my period I just want to rest.

For some patients, the intimate and gendered nature of menstruation means that negative staff interactions in this regard resonate with their experience of gendered violence and trauma. This is another blind spot: surveys showed that staff consistently think they support patients’ menstrual needs better than patients feel they are supported.

### Contraception in perimenopause [^6043eee9]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Perimenopause is characterized by wide hormone fluctuations and irregular menstrual cycles for 5 or more years preceding menopause and lasts until 12 months of amenorrhea have been achieved. It represents a period of reproductive transition with a decline in fertility. However, unintended pregnancies do occur, with a high risk for poor outcomes and maternal complications. All women transitioning through perimenopause should be adequately counseled. There are many hormone and nonhormone contraceptive methods that are highly effective and suited to the personal and medical needs of the perimenopausal woman. Contraception should continue until menopause is confirmed.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^5fd06c32]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

Antithyroid medication in early pregnancy (Question 55)—when pregnancy is diagnosed in a woman receiving ATD therapy for GD and who appears to be in remission, one option is to withdraw ATD medication and perform repeated thyroid function testing during the first trimester of pregnancy; if ATD therapy is needed during the first trimester, PTU is preferred over MMI because the risk for severe birth defects is lower, and cessation of medication has to be recommended early in gestation, before the major teratogenic periods (gestational weeks 6–10). Evidence supporting potential withdrawal includes a prospective study in which of 218 GD patients treated with ATD for 12 months, only 5% of TRAb-negative patients became hyperthyroid within 8 weeks after ATD withdrawal. Patients at high risk for rapid relapse after withdrawal include those treated for a short period (<6 months), those who require >5–10 mg of MMI per day to stay euthyroid, those with suppressed or low serum TSH, large goiter or orbitopathy, or high levels of TRAb; in such cases, medication should not be withdrawn, and PTU should be administered as the drug of choice. Optimally, women receiving ATD should test for pregnancy within the first days of missing or unusually weak menstruation, and if the test is positive, the woman should contact the caregiver responsible for their therapy to receive instruction regarding withdrawing or modifying ATD therapy and to discuss thyroid function testing.

### Helping midlife women predict the onset of the final menses: SWAN, the study of women's health across the nation [^10cfbe04]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Women approaching menopause often ask their doctors, "When are my periods going to end?" The objective of this study was to predict time to the final menstrual period (FMP).

Design

This multiethnic, observational cohort study, the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, has been ongoing since 1996. Data collected from seven annual study visits were used. The community-based cohort from seven national sites included 3,302 white, African American, Hispanic, Chinese, and Japanese women aged 42 to 52 years at baseline with a uterus and at least one ovary, who were not pregnant or taking reproductive hormones, and had at least one menstrual period within the past 3 months at baseline. The time to the FMP was defined retrospectively after 12 months of amenorrhea. Uni- and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% CIs were computed for variables of interest.

Results

A total of 2,662 women, of whom 706 had an observed FMP, were included. Age, menstrual cycles that had become farther apart (HR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.94-3.39) or more variable (HR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.45-2.21), and current smoking (HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.35-2.08) were all associated with shorter time to the FMP. Higher (log) follicle-stimulating hormone (HR = 2.32, 95% CI = 2.02-2.67) was related to a shorter time to the FMP, but the highest estradiol category (>or=100 pg/mL [367 pmol/L]) was associated with an earlier onset of the FMP (HR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.63-2.89). The number of vasomotor symptoms was related to an earlier FMP, whereas higher physical activity and educational levels were associated with a later FMP.

Conclusions

Age, menstrual cycle recall, smoking status, and hormone measurements can be used to estimate when the FMP will occur, allowing for more precise estimates for older midlife women: in the most extreme cases, ie, age 54, high estradiol level, current smoking, and high follicle-stimulating hormone level, the FMP can be estimated to within 1 year.

### General approaches to medical management of menstrual suppression: ACOG clinical consensus no. 3 [^b1268a81]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Adolescent menstrual suppression—hormonal medications (estrogen and progestin methods) for the specific purpose of menstrual suppression should not be initiated before the onset of menarche, but menstrual suppression can be initiated after the onset of menarche and adolescent patients do not need to wait a certain period of time after the first menstrual period to proceed with suppression; hormonal therapy options for menstrual suppression are safe and effective in adolescents, routine pelvic examination is not required for prescription of these medications except if needed for method insertion (eg, IUD), and for adolescents seeking both contraceptive efficacy and menstrual suppression, long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (eg, IUDs, implant) are effective options with high rates of medication adherence and continuation and acceptable rates of amenorrhea; the LNG-IUD is both safe and efficacious for menstrual management in adolescents, and insertion has not been shown to be more difficult in adolescents compared with older individuals or in nulliparous patients compared with parous patients.

### Risk of cesarean delivery when second-trimester ultrasound dating disagrees with definite last menstrual period [^5150573a]. American Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Estimates of gestational age based on early second-trimester ultrasound often differ from that based on the last menstrual period (LMP) even when a woman is certain about her LMP. Discrepancies in these gestational age estimates may be associated with an increased risk of cesarean section and low birth weight. We analyzed 7228 singleton, low-risk, white women from The Routine Antenatal Diagnostic Imaging with Ultrasound trial. The women were recruited at less than 14 weeks of gestation and received ultrasound exams between 15 and 22 weeks. Our results indicate that among nulliparous women, the risk of cesarean section increased from 10% when the ultrasound-based gestational age exceeded the LMP-based estimate by 4 days to 60% when the discrepancy increased to 21 days. Moreover, for each additional day the ultrasound-based estimate exceeded the LMP-based estimate, birth weight was higher by 9.6 g. Our findings indicate that a positive discrepancy (i.e., ultrasound-based estimate exceeds LMP-based estimate) in gestational age is associated with an increased risk of cesarean section. A negative discrepancy, by contrast, may reflect early intrauterine growth restriction and an increased risk of low birth weight.

### A bridge for postpartum women to standard days method ®: II. efficacy study [^0e431507]. Contraception (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In a companion article, we described the development of a new fertility-awareness-based Bridge for postpartum women starting with their first postpartum menses and until they are eligible to use the Standard Days Method®. This article presents the results of an efficacy trial to test the Bridge.

Study Design

This was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter study following 157 women for up to 9 months. Participants were aged 18-39 years, had menstruated at least once since their baby was born, and wished to avoid or delay pregnancy using a fertility-awareness-based approach. Acceptability and correct use were examined. Life table pregnancy rates were calculated to assess method effectiveness.

Results

The typical-use failure rate is 11.2 for 6 months of Bridge use.

Conclusion

The Bridge can offer significant protection from pregnancy for postpartum women who prefer using a fertility-awareness-based approach to avoiding pregnancy but are not yet eligible to use the Standard Days Method. Counseling should emphasize the importance of following the Bridge guidelines for it to be effective.

### Are babies conceived during ramadan born smaller and sooner than babies conceived at other times of the year? A born in bradford cohort study [^db7629b2]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2017). Low credibility.

Background

It is not known whether infants exposed to intermittent maternal fasting at conception are born smaller or have a higher risk of premature birth than those who are not. Doctors are therefore unsure about what advice to give women about the safety of Ramadan fasting. This cohort study aimed to investigate these questions in Muslim mother-infant pairs to inform prenatal care.

Methods

Routinely collected data accessed from maternity records were the source for information. Mothers were considered exposed if they were Muslim and Ramadan overlapped with their infant conception date, estimated to be 14days after the last menstrual period. Infants were included as exposed if their estimated conception date was in the first 21days of Ramadan or 7days prior to Ramadan.

Results

After adjusting for gestational age, maternal age, infant gender, maternal body mass index at booking, smoking status, gestational diabetes, parity and year of birth, there was no significant difference in birth weight between infants born to Muslim mothers who were conceived during Ramadan (n=479) and those who were not (n=4677) (adjusted mean difference =24.3g, 95% CI -16.4 to 64.9). There was no difference in rates of premature births in exposed and unexposed women (5.2% vs 4.9%; OR=1.08, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.65).

Conclusions

Healthy Muslim women considering becoming pregnant prior to, or during Ramadan, can be advised that fasting does not seem to have a detrimental effect on the size (weight) of their baby and it appears not to increase the likelihood of giving birth prematurely.

### Comparison of pregnancy dating by last menstrual period, ultrasound scanning, and their combination [^7c6ab757]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of algorithms for the assignment of gestational age with the use of the last menstrual period and early ultrasound information.

Study Design

Gestational age estimates that are based on last menstrual period, ultrasound scanning, or their combination were compared among women who attended prenatal care clinics in central North Carolina (n = 3655) by an evaluation of digit preference in the last menstrual period dates and a comparison of mean gestational age, preterm and postterm categories with the use of kappa statistics, difference between actual and expected delivery date, and birth weight among subgroups with discrepant assignments.

Results

Last menstrual period reports show digit preference, assign gestation 2.8 days longer on average than ultrasound scanning, yield substantially more postterm births (12.1% vs 3.4%), and predict delivery among term births less accurately. Misclassification of births as postterm was more common in younger women, those of nonoptimal prepregnancy body weight, cigarette smokers, and women who reported last menstrual period using preferred dates of the month.

Conclusion

Last menstrual period estimates of the duration of gestation are subject to both random error and a systematic tendency to overstate the duration of gestation, most likely because of delayed ovulation.

### History of breast feeding and risk of incident endometriosis: prospective cohort study [^5961be67]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Definition of exposure

Since 1989, participants have reported all pregnancies (lasting at least six months) every two years. In 1993, women were asked about lifetime history of breast feeding. In 1997, women were asked detailed information on their history of breast feeding and duration for each of their first four children, as described elsewhere.Women with more than four children were asked to report combined breast feeding information for each additional child. A supplementary questionnaire was sent to women reporting pregnancies subsequent to 1997 so that information on duration of breast feeding could be collected to 2003 (at which point the youngest participant was 39). The combination of detailed child specific information on duration of breast feeding with the annual information on pregnancy history allows us to update history of breast feeding over time.

To estimate total duration of breast feeding, women were asked, “If you breastfed, at what month did you stop breast feeding altogether?” and were given the following categories: “1-2 months, 3-5 months, 6-8 months, 9-11 months, 12-18 months, ≥19 months.” To approximate duration of exclusive breast feeding, women were asked “At what month did you start giving formula or purchased milk at least once daily?” and “At what month did you start giving solid food at least once daily (baby food, cereal, table food, etc)?” and could respond “0-2 months, 3 months, 4-5 months, 6-7 months, 8-11 months, ≥12 months.” We defined duration of exclusive breast feeding as the earlier of these two time points. Lastly, to quantify postpartum amenorrhea, women were asked “At what month after delivery did your menstrual periods return?” and were given the following categories: “1-2 months, 3-5 months, 6-9 months, ≥10 months, pregnant again, or never.” Our derived exposures of breast feeding and amenorrhea were updated every two years and were summed across reproductive history. To create a continuous variable of duration of breast feeding, women were assigned the mid-point of the reported category. Women in the highest category of total breast feeding were assigned 45 monthsand women in the highest category of exclusive breast feeding were assigned 20.5 months.

### Controversies in postpartum contraception: when is it safe to start oral contraceptives after childbirth? [^43a2ba2b]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

The timely initiation of contraception postpartum is an important consideration for breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women; many women prefer oral contraceptive pills to other methods. In breastfeeding women, combined hormonal pills are not recommended prior to 6 weeks postpartum, due to effects on milk production. Although progestogen-only pills do not adversely affect milk, lack of data regarding possible effects on infants exposed to progestogens in breastmilk renders timing of initiation of this method controversial. In non-breastfeeding women, elevated risk of venous thromboembolism restricts use of combined hormonal pills prior to 21 days postpartum. From 21 to 42 days, use of combined hormonal pills should be assessed based on a woman's personal venous thromboembolism risk profile; after 42 days postpartum there is no restriction in the use of combined hormonal pills for otherwise healthy women. Non-breastfeeding women may safely use progestogen-only pills at any time during the postpartum.

### Lactational amenorrhoea method for family planning [^6682de3f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

It is estimated that about 40% of pregnancies in the world are unintended and that the major part of these are unwanted. There are several reasons no or ineffective contraception is used to prevent these pregnancies, including difficulty in obtaining contraceptives. The lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) is a contraceptive method where the mother is informed and supported in how to use breastfeeding for contraception. LAM is available and accessible to many women.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of LAM, as defined in the 1988 Bellagio Consensus statement, as a contraceptive method in fully breastfeeding women, who remain amenorrheic, using pregnancy and menstruation life tables.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, and LILACS to 10 October 2014; reference lists of studies; review articles; books related to LAM; published abstracts from breastfeeding, reproductive health conferences; e-mails with study coordinators.

Selection Criteria

Out of 459 potentially relevant studies, 159 investigated the risk of pregnancy during LAM or lactational amenorrhoea. Our inclusion criteria were as follows: prospective study; cases (intervention group) and, if available, controls, had to be sexually active; pregnancy had to be confirmed by physical examination or a pregnancy test. Our endpoints were life table menstruation rates and life table pregnancy rates. We included 15 studies reporting on 11 intervention groups and three control groups. We identified one additional uncontrolled study in the 2007 update and one additional controlled study in this 2015 update.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data, resolving disagreements through discussion. We analysed the studies using narrative methods because of their heterogeneity.

Main Results

For the primary outcome, pregnancy, two controlled studies of LAM users reported life table pregnancy rates at six months of 0.45% and 2.45%, one controlled study reported 5% pregnancies in the absence of life table rates per month, and eight uncontrolled studies of LAM users reported pregnancy rates of 0% to 7.5%. Life table pregnancy rates for fully breastfeeding women who were amenorrheic but not using any contraceptive method were 0.88% in one study and 0.9% to 1.2% (95% confidence interval 0.0 to 2.4) in a second study, depending on the definition of menstruation used. The life table menstruation rate at six months in all studies varied between 11.1% and 39.4%.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no clear differences in life table pregnancy rates between women using LAM and being supported in doing so, and fully breastfeeding amenorrheic women not using any method. As the length of lactation amenorrhoea in women using LAM differed greatly between the populations studied, and was population specific, it is uncertain whether LAM extends lactational amenorrhoea.

### "I can guess the month … but beyond that, I can' T tell" an exploratory qualitative study of health care provider perspectives on gestational age estimation in rajasthan, India [^87c33997]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

13.7 million preterm births (births prior to 37 weeks’ gestation) occur annually in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) – over 90% of the global burden. Preterm birth complications are the leading cause of mortality among children under five years. Of the 2.7 million annual neonatal deaths (occurring in the first 27 days), 0.94 million (35%) are attributable to conditions related to preterm birth. In India, approximately 3.5 million infants are born too early each year and preterm birth-related conditions are the cause of 0.3 million deaths among Indian children under five. Conditions related to preterm birth cause 43% of all neonatal mortality and 27% of all under five mortality in India.

Knowing the gestational age of a fetus is vital to the provision of antenatal corticosteroids to women at risk of preterm delivery, which could save 370,000 lives each year. While the administration of antenatal corticosteroids is recommended for women at risk of preterm birth from 24 weeks to 34 weeks, administration after 34 weeks’ gestation brings risk of harm to mature fetuses exposed to corticosteroid in-utero that may outweigh the benefits. The World Health Organization thus recommends that: “antenatal corticosteroid should not be routinely administered in situations where the gestational age cannot be confirmed”.

Accurate gestational age assessment also enables the timely initiation of appropriate care for a preterm infant. Furthermore, many aspects of maternal healthcare rely on gestational age estimates, including mobile phone-based health messaging programs that provide stage-based pregnancy information to millions of women in LMICs.

In high-resource settings, early pregnancy ultrasound-based dating is standard practice and considered the most accurate method of gestational age estimation. The gold standard is ultrasound prior to 14 weeks gestation, while estimates prior to 22 weeks are considered adequate. Ultrasound-based dating during the first trimester often uses crown–rump length to estimate gestational age, since there is a linear relationship between this measurement and gestation age during early pregnancy. Later in pregnancy, gestational age can be estimated, albeit with lower accuracy, through ultrasound measurement of combinations of biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference and femur (diaphysis) length. Menstrual-based dating is also widely used, and calculates the estimated date of full term delivery (40 weeks’ gestation) as 280 days from the first day of a woman’s last menstrual period (LMP), but is only accurate among women who menstruated regularly and can recall their LMP.

### Menstruation and the menopausal transition [^cee2d24a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

This paper characterizes changes in menstrual bleeding during perimenopause,including bleeding changes that represent markers of the menopausal transition. Recent results from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation and other cohort studies are reviewed. Emerging data describing subpopulation differences in the transition experience are highlighted. When treating women in the midlife, clinicians should pay careful attention to medical factors, including both conditions and treatments, that may increase menstrual blood loss or alter menstrual cycle characteristics sufficiently to obscure the onset of the menopausal transition or the final menstrual period.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^f59a7410]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Fertility awareness–based (FAB) methods—pregnancy, life stage, and breastfeeding categories are outlined as follows. During pregnancy, symptoms-based and calendar-based methods are NA, and FAB methods are not relevant during pregnancy. For life stages, postmenarche and perimenopause are Caution for both symptoms-based and calendar-based methods; menstrual irregularities are common in these stages and might complicate FAB use. For breastfeeding persons, <6 weeks postpartum is Delay for both methods, ≥6 weeks postpartum is Caution for symptoms-based and Delay for calendar-based, and after menses begin both are Caution. Persons who are primarily breastfeeding and amenorrheic are unlikely to have sufficient ovarian function to produce detectable fertility signs during the first 6 months postpartum. Once fertility signs are noted, particularly cervical secretions, symptoms-based methods can be used; calendar-based methods can be used when there have been at least three postpartum menses and cycles are regular again, and the standard days method when there have been at least four postpartum menses and the most recent cycle lasted 26–32 days; before that time, a barrier method should be offered.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs)—when pregnancy status is uncertain, starting CHCs should be considered at any time with a follow-up pregnancy test in 2–4 weeks, and if additional protection is needed when switching methods, consider continuing the previous method for 7 days after starting CHCs; evidence from a systematic review of 18 studies found that pregnancy rates did not differ by timing of CHC initiation, and no ovulations occurred when combined oral contraceptives (COCs) were started at a follicle diameter of 10 mm (mean cycle day 7.6) or when the ring was started at 13 mm (median cycle day 11); bleeding patterns and other side effects did not vary with timing, and although continuation rates were initially improved by the “quick start” approach, the advantage disappeared over time.

### 'I wanted to enjoy our marriage first … but I got pregnant right away': a qualitative study of family planning understandings and decisions of women in urban yogyakarta, Indonesia [^48db0d0e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Belinda: Nine months, and then you began using an IUD?

Ida: Yes, that’s right, after menstruation that’s what the midwife at the puskesmas (primary health clinic) told me, if you want to change KB methods, you have to wait for your menstruation and after that, ya, I began using an IUD.

Ida’s narrative illuminates how her understandings of postpartum family planning had been shaped by misinformation provided by a family planning provider that was assumed to be accurate. This compelled Ida to delay using the IUD, and for the first nine months following delivery she relied on the POP. Given that the POP has to be taken at exactly the same time each day to be effective, compared with the IUD (which once inserted is effective immediately) this potentially increased the chance of Ida experiencing unintended pregnancy. In this way, Ida’s reproductive agency was constrained, as her intention to use the method she wished to use, when she wanted to use it, was undermined by directives of her family planning provider.

Thirty-seven-year-old Prima had an IUD inserted postpartum immediately following her vaginal delivery by a public family planning provider. Prima’s IUD was removed soon after insertion due to postpartum bleeding and she had not had another inserted, nor begun using another contraceptive method. She was unsure which method she would use in the future and expressed concerns that family planning providers did not share adequate information during family planning counselling, despite her clear desire to know more:

… Maybe it would be different if I was socialised again, I would have a better understanding of the side effects associated with KB. The government has to be more transparent … whether the side effect is drowsiness, increased heartbeat or changes to the normal menstrual cycle… or if the hormones or ingredients used can lead to illness or cancer in people who are already susceptible… Health workers and doctors know more, and they need to be more open in their delivery of information, so we know the bad, the good, and the risks, so we can make the right choice.

### Lactational amenorrhoea among adolescent girls in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic scoping review [^66dadc6c]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) is the name given to the informed use of breast feeding as a method of contraception. For lactational amenorrhoea to serve as an effective method of contraception, the woman must be exclusively or near exclusively breast feeding (at least 85% of infant feeding coming from breast feeding),be within the first 6 months following childbirth, and remain amenorrhoeic. The typical use failure rate of LAM is 0.45%–7.5%.In the first 6 months post partum, amenorrhoeic women have a very low cumulative chance of conception, even if they are not exclusively breast feeding, because a large fraction of first menstrual cycles in this period are anovulatory.As the duration of post partum lengthens, the protective effect of amenorrhoea progressively weakens. Nevertheless, among amenorrhoeic women, the level of risk of conception remains at 6% at 12 months post partum,which is not substantively different from that of condoms or oral contraception under real-life conditions. Literature has shown that reliance on the absence of menses as an indicator that conception is unlikely is widespread.However, most women do not associate breast feeding with a reduced risk of conception.Beyond 6 months post partum, women might continue breast feeding and remain amenorrhoeic. While this period is included in calculations of the duration of lactational amenorrhoea, it is no longer considered to be an effective contraceptive method.

Fertility awareness–based (FAB) methods—postpartum (nonbreastfeeding): For <4 weeks postpartum, both symptoms-based and calendar-based methods are Delay, with the clarification that nonbreastfeeding persons are not likely to have detectable fertility signs or hormonal changes before 4 weeks postpartum and ovulation before menses is common, so a method appropriate for the postpartum period should be offered. At ≥4 weeks, symptoms-based is Accept and calendar-based is Delay; nonbreastfeeding persons are likely to have sufficient ovarian function to produce detectable fertility signs or hormonal changes at this time, and calendar-based methods can be used “as soon as three postpartum menses have been completed,” with postpartum-appropriate methods offered before that time.

Postpartum (Breastfeeding)

Timing: CHCs may be started when the patient is medically eligible to use the method and if it is reasonably certain that they are not pregnant. (Box 3).
Postpartum patients who are breastfeeding should not use CHCs <21 days postpartum (U.S. MEC 4). Postpartum patients who are breastfeeding generally should not use CHCs during 21 to <30 days postpartum (U.S. MEC 3). Postpartum breastfeeding patients with other risk factors for venous thromboembolism generally should not use CHCs 30–42 days postpartum (U.S. MEC 3). However, postpartum breastfeeding patients without other risk factors for venous thromboembolism generally can use CHCs 30–42 days postpartum (U.S. MEC 2), and all breastfeeding patients generally can use CHCs >42 days postpartum (U.S. MEC 2).
Need for back-up contraception: If the patient is <6 months postpartum, amenorrheic, and fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (exclusively breastfeeding or the vast majority [≥85%] of feeds are breastfeeds), no additional contraceptive protection is needed. Otherwise, a patient who is ≥21 days postpartum and whose menstrual cycle has not returned needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^b7a4c9ed]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Comments and Evidence Summary. In situations in which the health care provider is uncertain whether the patient might be pregnant, the benefits of starting CHCs likely exceed any risk; therefore, starting CHCs should be considered at any time, with a follow-up pregnancy test in 2–4 weeks. If a patient needs to use additional contraceptive protection when switching to CHCs from another contraceptive method, consider continuing their previous method for 7 days after starting CHCs. (As appropriate, see recommendations for Emergency Contraception.)

A systematic review of 18 studies examined the effects of starting CHCs on different days of the menstrual cycle. Overall, the evidence suggested that pregnancy rates did not differ by the timing of CHC initiation (,–) (Level of evidence: I to II-3, fair, indirect). The more follicular activity that occurred before starting COCs, the more likely ovulation was to occur; however, no ovulations occurred when COCs were started at a follicle diameter of 10 mm (mean cycle day 7.6) or when the ring was started at 13 mm (median cycle day 11) (–) (Level of evidence: I to II-3, fair, indirect). Bleeding patterns and other side effects did not vary with the timing of CHC initiation (,,–) (Level of evidence: I to II-2, good to poor, direct). Although continuation rates of CHCs were initially improved by the “quick start” approach (i.e. starting on the day of the visit), the advantage disappeared over time (,,–) (Level of evidence: I to II-2, good to poor, direct).

### An approach to the postpartum office visit [^a4bb75bb]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The postpartum period (typically the first six weeks after delivery) may underscore physical and emotional health issues in new mothers. A structured approach to the postpartum office visit ensures that relevant conditions and concerns are discussed and appropriately addressed. Common medical complications during this period include persistent postpartum bleeding, endometritis, urinary incontinence, and thyroid disorders. Breastfeeding education and behavioral counseling may increase breastfeeding continuance. Postpartum depression can cause significant morbidity for the mother and baby; a postnatal depression screening tool may assist in diagnosing depression-related conditions. Decreased libido can affect sexual functioning after a woman gives birth. Physicians should also discuss contraception with postpartum patients, even those who are breastfeeding. Progestin-only contraceptives are recommended for breastfeeding women. The lactational amenorrhea method may be a birth control option but requires strict criteria for effectiveness.

### Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600, 000 menstrual cycles [^0c90b00c]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Some fertility apps are based on sophisticated algorithms for individualised identification of the fertile window relying on physiological parameters such as BBT which are more acceptable for large numbers of women. Whilst LH test kits have been used to determine the day of ovulation for decades, they have a significant margin of error when used in isolation. The addition of BBT and the use of a fertility app may help to narrow down testing days and therefore be more convenient and cheaper. Individualised identification of the fertile window based on BBT and menstruation dates can help to reduce the time to conception in some cases.

With women globally delaying fertilitythe potential value of fertility tracking apps as a platform for delivery of individualised fertility education and preconception care should not be underestimated. Anecdotally there is poor understanding of fertility amongst the general population, which can lead to both unintended pregnancies and delayed time to conception with associated psychological suffering for those wishing to start a family.Fertility education delivered through an app has the potential to improve doctor–patient interactionsand communication between partners. The value of fertility apps as educational platforms to achieve public health benefits through standardised health promotion messages during key stages of reproductive life such as preconception, pregnancy and birth spacing is also being explored.

Finally, the widespread use of mobile phone apps for personal health monitoring is generating large amounts of data on the menstrual cycle. Provided that the real-world data can be validated against traditional clinical studies done in controlled settings, there is enormous potential to uncover new scientific discoveries. This is one of the largest ever analyses of menstrual cycle characteristics. These initial results only scratch the surface of what can be achieved. We hope to stimulate greater interest in this field of research for the benefit of public health.

### Association between mode of first delivery and subsequent fecundity and fertility [^3d1ef496]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The results of this study are consistent with previous studies, which have reported lower rates of childbearing after cesarean compared with vaginal delivery. However, there was 1 previous study of a cohort of primiparous Danish women who were trying to conceive that reported no difference in rate of conception when comparing women who had delivered by unplanned cesarean (112 women) with those who had spontaneous vaginal delivery (585 women), although in that study women who had attempted pregnancy for more than 6 menstrual cycles were excluded.

To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study beginning before first childbirth that measured unprotected intercourse in each month over the course of 36 months after first childbirth, to test whether women who delivered by cesarean were less likely to try to conceive subsequently than women who delivered vaginally, as has been hypothesized, or less likely to conceive after unprotected intercourse. The prospective design of this study was an important strength because we were able to measure women’s plans for subsequent childbearing before and after first childbirth, as well as unprotected intercourse in each month subsequent to first delivery among women who were trying to conceive and those who were not. Additional strengths of this study included a large sample size with adequate power to reject the null hypothesis, and a high retention rate.

### Duration and determinants of birth interval among women of child bearing age in Southern Ethiopia [^98dfcab5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Birth interval is the length of time between two successive live births. Beginning with a live birth, the birth interval can be divided into the period of postpartum amenorrhea, the menstruating interval, and the following period of gestation. Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa next to Nigeria, with population size of 73,918,505 million and total fertility rate of 5.4. Like many other African countries, Ethiopia has so far shown little change in fertility.

Fertility is an important component of population dynamics which plays a major role in changing the size and structure of a given population. Factors affecting fertility are broadly classified into proximate (direct) and distal (indirect) factors. The proximal factors are bio-behavioral factors, like being sexually active, use of contraceptive, duration of postpartum infecundability, abortion and sterility which affect fertility directly, whereas, distal determinants, are socio-cultural factors which affect fertility indirectly through affecting the bio-behavioral factors.

Optimal spacing until the next pregnancy is generally understood to refer to resting period between pregnancies that allows the mother time to recover from pregnancy, labor and lactation. Longer time period between births allows the next pregnancy and birth to occur more likely to be at full gestation and growth. For years, family planning programs have advocated two years intervals between births for infant and child health and survival. Recent research found that birth intervals of 3 to 5 years are safer for mothers and babies compared to birth intervals of two years or less. Some researchers also opined that birth intervals longer than five years are less healthy suggesting that such mothers may lose the protective benefit of previous child bearing and hence have complications as seen in primigravida. Few people including women themselves understand the risks involved in bearing children 

Women in developing countries have shorter birth intervals than they would prefer. The main reason for short birth intervals is that many women in developing countries do not use contraception after birth and therefore are likely to become pregnant once fecundity returns. Birth spacing is a well-known, underutilized, and admittedly not fully understood health intervention. Adequate child spacing is considered as a positive factor on the health of mothers and their children. A variety of demographic and socio economic characteristics influence women's spacing practices. Thus, understanding practice of birth interval and factors which influence women's birth interval is critical for countries like Ethiopia with a population policy aiming at reducing fertility. Hence, this study was conducted to determine duration and determinants of birth interval among women of child bearing age in Lemo district, southern Ethiopia in March 2010.

2. You may not have your period this month but this is expected. However, if you miss your period 2 months in a row, call your healthcare professional because you might be pregnant.

3. You COULD BECOME PREGNANT if you have sex in the 7 days after you miss pills. You MUST use another birth control method (such as condoms or spermicide) as a back-up method for those 7 days.

DETAILED PATIENT LABELING

PLEASE NOTE: This labeling is revised from time to time as important new medical information becomes available. Therefore, please review this labeling carefully.

The following oral contraceptive product contains a combination of an estrogen and progestogen, the two kinds of female hormones:

DASETTA 1/35

Each orange tablet contains 1 mg norethindrone and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol. Each white tablet contains inert ingredients.

INTRODUCTION

Any woman who considers using oral contraceptives (the birth control pill or the pill) should understand the benefits and risks of using this form of birth control. This patient labeling will give you much of the information you will need to make this decision and will also help you determine if you are at risk of developing any of the serious side effects of the pill. It will tell you how to use the pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. However, this labeling is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your healthcare professional. You should discuss the information provided in this labeling with him or her, both when you first start taking the pill and during your revisits. You should also follow your healthcare professional's advice with regard to regular check-ups while you are on the pill.

### Postpartum uptake of contraception in rural Northern Malawi: a prospective study [^b0528e04]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

4 Discussion

At first glance, the prospective FP data revealed that there was relatively poor uptake of contraception after childbirth. This is despite women in antenatal, postpartum and vaccination clinics receiving intensive education messages on birth spacing. However, on further investigation, data from the cross-sectional adult sexual behaviour survey indicated that a significant proportion of women in the first year since delivery were not yet sexually active and/or had not commenced menstruation, suggesting that they were not at high risk of pregnancy. Of those who were sexually active and menses had returned, around three quarters reported modern contraceptive use, which is high.

Amongst women who were either abstinent or had not started their periods, around a quarter reported using contraception. This could be interpreted in two ways: (a) overreporting of contraceptive use in cross-sectional surveys (for abstinent women reporting use of condoms, this is not accurate: if they had not had sex in the last month, they cannot be currently using condoms) and (b) use of contraception by women who are at low risk of pregnancy. Both could explain the Malawi paradox of apparently high contraceptive use and high fertility.

Elsewhere we show high discontinuation of short-term methods in northern Malawi. Therefore, provision of short-term methods in the immediate postpartum period is unlikely to be effective, given the low risk of pregnancy for women during this time and high probability of discontinuation by the time the woman resumes sexual activity and menstruation. According to our prospective FP study, only a handful of women received a long-acting or permanent method of contraception within weeks of delivering their baby. Given that a large proportion of deliveries now take place at health facilities in this area (92%), this provides an opportunity for health care providers to either counsel women on their FP options before they return home (perhaps providing a date by when the woman should return to the health facility to start contraception) or indeed to provide a service such as an implant or intrauterine device (IUD) insertion,,,.

### Segesterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (annovera) [^32c1576c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

When does ANNOVERA become effective?

ANNOVERA becomes effective on the day it is inserted (Day 1), if it is inserted between Days 2 and 5 of your menstrual period. If ANNOVERA is inserted more than 5 days from when you start your menstrual period, you should use a barrier method of birth control, such as a male condom or spermicide, during sexual intercourse for the first 7 days you use ANNOVERA.

Will ANNOVERA interfere during sexual intercourse?

If ANNOVERA is placed as high as possible in your vagina, it will not interfere with sexual intercourse.

Can I take ANNOVERA out during the first 3 weeks of my cycle?

You should leave ANNOVERA in the entire 21 days (3 weeks).
If ANNOVERA comes out or if you remove it, put it back in as soon as possible. If you put ANNOVERA back into your vagina before 2 hours has passed, you do not need to use another method of birth control. However, if ANNOVERA is out of your vagina for more than 2 hours at one time or if ANNOVERA is out of your vagina at different times that add up to more than a total of 2 hours over the first 21 days of your cycle, you will need to use another method of birth control until ANNOVERA has been in your vagina for 7 days in a row, such as male condoms or spermicides.
