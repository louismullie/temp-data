## Question

After how many days should you not prescribe Tamiflu?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when Tamiflu (oseltamivir) should or should not be prescribed, specifically focusing on the number of days after symptom onset and any exceptions for high-risk or severely ill patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core indication boundaries in the FDA label. Then, I should verify guideline-based exceptions for high-risk, hospitalized, or severely ill patients. Next, I will review the strength of evidence by timing and population. After that, I should reconcile conflicting statements from regulators and societies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically framed recommendation and dosing summary with appropriate caveats and safety checks.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline so I don't overextend beyond labeled indications. The FDA labeling for treatment indicates oseltamivir for acute, uncomplicated influenza A or B in patients 2 weeks and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours, with a standard adult regimen of 75 mg twice daily for 5 days; outside of these parameters, treatment is not covered by the FDA-labeled indication, although clinical judgment may still apply in select scenarios [^115u1S2x] [^114eSLAd] [^116uv7HA] [^1177DJoR].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance for high-risk and hospitalized patients, because the "48-hour rule" is often overgeneralized. IDSA recommends treating patients with suspected or confirmed influenza who are hospitalized, have severe/complicated/progressive illness, or are at high risk for complications as soon as possible and generally without waiting for test results; importantly, benefit may extend beyond 48 hours, particularly up to 4–5 days, and even longer in select contexts, although magnitude of benefit declines with delay [^114tLpsz] [^117XnXm4]. Hold on, I should also confirm the WHO position: WHO advises considering oseltamivir in patients with suspected or confirmed severe influenza regardless of time since onset, acknowledging that randomized data are limited in severe disease but observational evidence supports potential benefit, especially with earlier initiation [^113pUKh7].

> I need to check the mortality signal that drives this practice. Multiple observational datasets suggest substantial reductions in mortality with early oseltamivir in hospitalized or critically ill patients; for example, an Israeli cohort showed more than a doubling of odds of death when treatment was initiated late, and a pooled analysis across countries found approximately 38% lower mortality when NAI treatment was started within 48 hours versus later, with some benefit even beyond 48 hours in critical illness; a Greek ICU cohort further linked early therapy to reduced mortality in H3N2, though not uniformly across all subtypes, underscoring variability by strain and patient mix [^115928Sd] [^115hgxJb] [^113xsrx4]. Hmm, wait a minute, these are observational data, so confounding by indication and timing biases must be acknowledged, but they align directionally with biological plausibility and guideline recommendations in severe disease [^115hgxJb].

> Next, I should review randomized evidence in hospitalized patients to ensure I'm not overinterpreting observational findings. A randomized trial in South East Asia found no advantage of double-dose oseltamivir over standard dosing in severe influenza, reinforcing that higher dose is not routinely beneficial, while still leaving unresolved the question of benefit versus no antiviral at all in severe disease. More recent high-quality reviews and meta-analyses continue to highlight the paucity of randomized data for severe influenza and emphasize the low-certainty nature of current evidence for hard outcomes like mortality and ICU transfer, which explains ongoing clinical equipoise in some settings [^115szebN] [^116LnWCW] [^1134vkos]. Hold on, I should verify that guideline panels are aware of this gap. Indeed, WHO explicitly notes the low-certainty evidence base in severe disease and supports empiric use while calling for better trials, which mirrors IDSA's pragmatic stance to treat anyway given potential benefit and minimal harm [^113pUKh7] [^114tLpsz].

> I will now examine data beyond 48 hours in outpatients, because that often changes practice in urgent care. The Bangladesh randomized trial demonstrated modest reductions in symptom duration and meaningful reductions in viral shedding even when treatment started at or beyond 48 hours, indicating that antiviral effect on replication may persist into day 3–5 of illness even if symptom benefit attenuates with delay; similarly, a pragmatic European RCT in primary care showed an average one-day faster recovery with oseltamivir across diverse subgroups, including some with longer pre-enrollment symptom duration, though absolute gains are smaller with later starts [^115Cp6z7] [^113HzWgj]. But wait, I should double-check the clinical significance threshold; the Lancet meta-analysis confirms about a one-day reduction in time to alleviation when started within 48 hours and shows fewer lower respiratory complications and hospitalizations, which strengthens the case for earlier initiation whenever feasible [^116AnA7U].

> Let me consider prophylaxis separately so I don't conflate treatment and prevention thresholds. Post-exposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir should be initiated within 48 hours of exposure for the best chance of preventing symptomatic infection; beyond this window, prophylaxis is not recommended, and clinicians should pivot to symptom-triggered treatment if illness develops, rather than attempting prophylaxis late [^11135C82] [^112f9Lp5]. I should confirm durations: typical post-exposure prophylaxis is 10 days, while seasonal outbreak prophylaxis may extend up to 6 weeks, and in immunocompromised hosts up to 12 weeks in select circumstances, which underscores that the timing threshold is about initiation, not duration [^11135C82] [^113UXSuQ].

> Now, I should reconcile conflicting guidance so recommendations are coherent. FDA labeling remains conservative and limits treatment indication to within 48 hours of symptom onset for acute, uncomplicated cases; outside this window, prescribing is off-label, which carries medico-legal implications even if guidelines support clinical judgment in high-risk scenarios [^115u1S2x] [^114eSLAd]. CDC/IDSA guidance operationalizes early treatment for high-risk or hospitalized patients without insisting on a hard 48-hour cutoff, aligning with WHO's stance in severe disease, while emphasizing that benefit diminishes with delay and that empiric therapy should not be deferred while awaiting test results in these populations [^114tLpsz] [^117XnXm4] [^113pUKh7]. Hold on, I should verify the testing caveat; yes, IDSA advises initiating antivirals without waiting for results in hospitalized or high-risk outpatients, and to use testing afterward to inform antibiotics and discontinuation decisions, which helps balance stewardship with timeliness [^115wydMM].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical framework and ensure I'm not missing key subgroups. For otherwise healthy outpatients presenting beyond 48 hours, routine oseltamivir is generally not recommended due to modest benefit and risk of adverse effects, so supportive care is appropriate; for high-risk outpatients (chronic cardiopulmonary disease, immunocompromise, pregnancy, age ≥ 65 years, or children < 2 years), treatment up to 4–5 days from onset can be reasonable, especially if symptoms are progressive, with shared decision-making about uncertain benefit; for hospitalized patients or those with severe/complicated/progressive disease, treat as soon as possible regardless of time since onset, and extend therapy to 7–10 days if disease is severe or immunocompromised, particularly if viral RNA remains detectable, while recognizing that the highest-quality mortality data are observational and that double-dose regimens are not routinely beneficial [^114tLpsz] [^117XnXm4] [^115szebN] [^113xsrx4]. I should double-check special populations: in pregnancy, oseltamivir is preferred and some experts consider modest dose escalation in severe cases based on PK modeling, though data are limited; in pediatrics, standard weight-based dosing applies, with evidence of reduced otitis media when treated very early and broader symptom benefits across age groups when started promptly [^113cc7A8] [^115vfgJE] [^116htSCm].

> I need to ensure dosing, duration, and safety are explicit. Standard adult treatment is 75 mg orally twice daily for 5 days if within 48 hours. In severe or immunocompromised cases, extending to 7–10 days is reasonable based on IDSA and virologic considerations, while double-dose therapy is not routinely recommended given lack of added benefit. Monitor for nausea and vomiting, rare neuropsychiatric events, and hypersensitivity reactions, and avoid delays in treating suspected secondary bacterial infections, which are not prevented by oseltamivir [^11463imJ] [^114tLpsz] [^116nUttK] [^114uYnPR]. But wait, I should verify renal dosing and drug–drug interactions. Dose adjustments are needed in renal impairment, and the oral suspension contains sorbitol, which matters for patients with hereditary fructose intolerance, so I should confirm formulation choice when applicable [^11135C82] [^114uYnPR].

> In summary, I should state the bottom line clearly while preserving the evidentiary caveats. For routine, otherwise healthy outpatients, do not prescribe oseltamivir after 48 hours from symptom onset. For high-risk outpatients, consider treatment up to 4–5 days if clinically indicated, with shared decision-making. For hospitalized patients or those with severe, complicated, or progressive illness, treat as soon as possible regardless of time since onset, extending duration in severe or immunocompromised cases as needed, and recognize that the strongest evidence for late initiation is observational for mortality and that randomized data in severe disease remain limited, guiding a pragmatic but evidence-aligned approach [^115u1S2x] [^114tLpsz] [^113pUKh7] [^115hgxJb] [^116LnWCW].

Do not prescribe Tamiflu (oseltamivir) for treatment if symptoms began **more than 48 hours ago** [^114eSLAd], except for hospitalized patients or those with severe, complicated, or progressive illness [^117XnXm4], in whom treatment may still be beneficial up to 4–5 days after onset [^117XnXm4] [^116xYNzB]. For prophylaxis, do not start if **more than 48 hours have passed since exposure** [^11135C82] [^112f9Lp5]. Beyond these windows, Tamiflu is not recommended due to diminished efficacy and limited evidence of benefit [^116htSCm] [^112f9Lp5].

---

## Recommended treatment window

- **Standard treatment window**: Tamiflu is indicated for treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours [^114eSLAd] [^115u1S2x].

- **Clinical benefit**: Initiating treatment within 48 hours of symptom onset significantly reduces the duration of illness, lowers the risk of complications, and decreases hospitalization rates [^116AnA7U] [^116htSCm].

- **Standard regimen**: 75 mg orally twice daily for 5 days, started within 48 hours of symptom onset [^1177DJoR] [^116uv7HA].

---

## Exceptions: treatment beyond 48 hours

Treatment beyond 48 hours is considered in specific scenarios — notably for **hospitalized patients** or those with severe, complicated, or progressive illness, in whom antiviral therapy may still confer benefit when started up to 4–5 days after symptom onset [^117XnXm4] [^116xYNzB]. Evidence suggests that **early treatment** (within 48 hours) is associated with reduced mortality, shorter hospital stay, and fewer complications, whereas benefits diminish with later initiation [^115hgxJb] [^113xsrx4].

---

## Prophylaxis window

Post-exposure prophylaxis should begin **within 48 hours** of exposure to an infected individual [^11135C82] [^112f9Lp5]. Starting prophylaxis after this window is not recommended due to limited efficacy.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the 48-hour rule

Multiple studies and meta-analyses support the **48-hour rule**:

- **Meta-analysis findings**: Early treatment with oseltamivir (within 48 hours) significantly reduces symptom duration, complications, and hospitalizations [^116AnA7U] [^116htSCm].

- **Hospitalized patients**: Early antiviral treatment in hospitalized patients reduces mortality and length of stay, even when initiated after 48 hours, though benefits diminish with delay [^115hgxJb] [^113xsrx4].

- **Pediatric patients**: Early treatment in children reduces complications such as acute otitis media and shortens illness duration [^116htSCm] [^115vfgJE].

---

## Risks and limitations of delayed treatment

Delayed initiation of Tamiflu (> 48 hours) is associated with:

- **Reduced efficacy**: Diminished antiviral effectiveness and limited clinical benefit [^117XnXm4] [^115Cp6z7].

- **Increased complications**: Higher risk of secondary bacterial infections, respiratory complications, and prolonged illness [^116htSCm] [^117XnXm4].

- **Limited evidence**: Sparse data supporting significant benefit beyond 48 hours in non-hospitalized patients [^116htSCm] [^115Cp6z7].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Prolonged viral shedding may warrant extended treatment (up to 10 days) and consideration of combination therapy, though evidence is limited [^114tLpsz] [^115xeq6M].

- **Pregnant women**: Early treatment is recommended due to increased risk of severe influenza complications [^113cc7A8].

- **Renal impairment**: Dosage adjustments are required based on creatinine clearance [^11135C82] [^11463imJ].

## Tamiflu treatment recommendations

| **Patient population** | **Recommended treatment window** | **Treatment beyond 48 hours** |
|-|-|-|
| General outpatient population | ≤ 48 hours | Not recommended |
| Hospitalized patients | ≤ 48 hours (ideal) | May be considered up to 4–5 days |
| Severe, complicated, or progressive illness | ≤ 48 hours (ideal) | May be considered up to 4–5 days |
| Immunocompromised patients | ≤ 48 hours (ideal) | Extended treatment (up to 10 days) may be considered |
| Pregnant women | ≤ 48 hours (ideal) | Early treatment strongly recommended |

---

Tamiflu should not be prescribed for treatment if symptoms began **more than 48 hours ago**, except for hospitalized patients or those with severe, complicated, or progressive illness, in whom treatment may still be beneficial up to 4–5 days after onset. For prophylaxis, Tamiflu should not be started **more than 48 hours after exposure**.

Discussion

In this large randomised controlled trial of antiviral treatment in patients with severe influenza we found that double dose oseltamivir was well tolerated but did not confer additional virological or clinical benefits over standard dose treatment in patients in South East Asia. There were no differences between the treatment arms in detection of viral RNA or infectious virus on day five, and there were also no differences in clinical failure rates, mortality in hospital, or rates of adverse events between the dose regimens on day five. We enrolled a heterogeneous population that included mostly children and also those infected with avian H5N1 or H1N1-pdm09 viruses. While subgroup analyses based on age cohorts, virus type and subtype, and time to treatment did not suggest additional virological efficacy of double dose oseltamivir in any subgroup, these results should be interpreted with caution as the study was not powered for these analyses.

Our patients presented relatively late after the onset of illness, a median of five days overall (seven days for H5N1). Despite administration of oseltamivir, about 30% of those enrolled remained positive for viral RNA (the primary endpoint) after five days of treatment. Timing of oseltamivir treatment is important as several studies have shown that early treatment confers greater virological and clinical benefits. In particular, later viral clearance has been noted with delayed treatment with oseltamivir compared with treatment within two to three days after onset of symptoms in observational reports from patients with H1N1-pdm09, especially those with severe illness. In the current trial, 73 (22.4%) patients presented within three days of illness, but even in this subpopulation, double dose oseltamivir was not associated with more rapid viral RNA clearance. Over a quarter of patients received neuraminidase inhibitors before enrolment, which could have influenced the effect size and contributed to the low proportion of patients shedding virus at day five in both treatment groups.

Background

Oseltamivir is widely used as treatment for influenza virus A subtype H5N1 (hereafter, "H5N1") infection but, like any intervention, is not always effective.

Methods

We used Avian Influenza Registry data from 10 countries to examine the risk of death in 215 patients with confirmed H5N1 infection who were treated with oseltamivir, according to viral clade, age, respiratory failure, and adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids or antibiotics.

Results

The median age of infected individuals was 18 years, and 50% were male. The highest fatality rate occurred in a country with clade 2.1 virus circulation, and the lowest occurred in countries with clade 2.2 virus circulation (P < .001). In univariate analyses, age of ≤ 5 years and treatment ≤ 2 days after symptom onset were protective against fatality. When accounting for all risk factors, early initiation of oseltamivir was found to be particularly effective in individuals without respiratory failure (odds ratio, 0.17; p = 0.04). Patients who had advanced respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support at the time of oseltamivir initiation were more likely to die from the episode of H5N1 infection than patients who did not (P < .001). Adjunctive therapy did not improve the likelihood of surviving the episode.

Conclusions

Oseltamivir is especially effective for treating H5N1 infection when given early and before onset of respiratory failure. The effect of viral clade on fatality and treatment response deserves further investigation.

Treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza A and B in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. (1.1)
Prophylaxis of influenza A and B in patients 1 year and older. (1.2)

Limitations of Use:

Not a substitute for annual influenza vaccination. (1.3)
Consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use. (1.3)
Not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease not undergoing dialysis. (1.3)

1.1 Treatment of Influenza

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are indicated for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated illness due to influenza A and B infection in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours.

1.2 Prophylaxis of Influenza

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are indicated for the prophylaxis of influenza A and B in patients 1 year and older.

1.3 Limitations of Use

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are not a substitute for early influenza vaccination on an annual basis as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Influenza viruses change over time. Emergence of resistance substitutions could decrease drug effectiveness. Other factors (for example, changes in viral virulence) might also diminish clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Prescribers should consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use oseltamivir phosphate capsules [see Microbiology (12.4)].
Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease not undergoing dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) [^114WpBgr]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical studies: Reduced susceptibility isolates have been obtained during treatment with oseltamivir and from sampling during community surveillance studies. Changes in the viral neuraminidase that have been associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate are summarized in Table 8. The clinical impact of this reduced susceptibility is unknown.

Hemagglutinin (HA) substitutions selected in cell culture and associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir include (influenza virus subtype-specific numbering) A11T, K173E, and R453M in H3N2; and H99Q in influenza B virus (Yamagata lineage). In some cases, HA substitutions were selected in conjunction with known NA resistance substitutions and may contribute to reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir; however, the impact of HA substitutions on antiviral activity of oseltamivir in humans is unknown and likely to be strain-dependent.

Selection of influenza A viruses resistant to oseltamivir can occur at higher frequencies in children. Oseltamivir treatment-associated resistance in pediatric treatment studies has been detected at frequencies of 27 to 37% and 3 to 18% (3/11 to 7/19 and 1/34 to 9/50 post-treatment isolates, respectively) for influenza A/H1N1 virus and influenza A/H3N2 virus, respectively.

In immunocompromised adults and pediatrics (1 year of age and older), selection of influenza viruses resistant to oseltamivir can occur at higher frequencies than in the otherwise healthy population. In a treatment study of immunocompromised subjects, treatment-associated genotypic resistance was detected in 27% (8/30), 12% (6/52), and 0% (0/42) of influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B virus infections, respectively. Treatment-emergent resistance was observed at a higher frequency in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (32%; 6/19).

The frequency of resistance selection to oseltamivir and the prevalence of such resistant virus vary seasonally and geographically.

Circulating seasonal influenza strains expressing neuraminidase resistance-associated substitutions have been observed in individuals who have not received oseltamivir treatment. The oseltamivir resistance-associated substitution H275Y was found in more than 99% of US-circulating 2008 H1N1 influenza virus isolates. The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus ("swine flu") was almost uniformly susceptible to oseltamivir; however, the frequency of circulating resistant variants can change from season to season. Prescribers should consider available information from the CDC on influenza virus drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use TAMIFLU.

14.1 Treatment of Influenza

Adults

Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of oseltamivir phosphate were conducted in adults between 18 and 65 years old, one in the U.S. and one outside the U.S., for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Eligible subjects had fever of at least 100ºF, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom (cough, nasal symptoms, or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue, or headache), and influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Subjects were randomized to receive oral oseltamivir phosphate or placebo for 5 days. All enrolled subjects were allowed to take fever-reducing medications.

Of 1,355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) subjects were influenza-infected (median age 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Of the 849 influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with influenza of unknown type.

Study medication was started within 40 hours of onset of symptoms and administered twice daily for 5 days. Subjects were required to self-assess the influenza-associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe". Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms were assessed as "none" or "mild". In both trials, there was a 1.3-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice a day for 5 days compared to subjects who received placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in men and women.

IDSA seasonal influenza — nonresponse or deterioration on antivirals: Clinicians should investigate other causes besides influenza virus infection in influenza patients who fail to improve or deteriorate despite antiviral treatment (A-III). In patients who do not demonstrate clinical improvement after at least 2–3 days of antiviral treatment, especially when treatment is initiated early in the clinical course, consideration should be given to potential alternative explanations. Evaluation and management should be individualized.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Reports of overdoses with TAMIFLU have been received from clinical trials and during postmarketing experience. In the majority of cases reporting overdose, no adverse reactions were reported. Adverse reactions reported following overdose were similar in nature to those observed with therapeutic doses of TAMIFLU [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

### Update: influenza activity-United States, September 28-December 6, 2014 [^115kqX51]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Antiviral medications continue to be an important adjunct to vaccination for reducing the health impact of influenza. On January 21, 2011, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations on the use of antiviral agents for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza were released. This guidance remains in effect for the 2014–15 season, and recommended antiviral medications include oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). All influenza viruses tested for the 2014–15 season since October 1 have been susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir. Amantadine and rimantadine are not recommended because of high levels of resistance to these drugs among circulating influenza A viruses. In addition, influenza B viruses are not susceptible to amantadine or rimantadine. Treatment with antivirals is recommended as soon as possible without waiting for confirmatory testing for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at higher risk for influenza complications §§§. Clinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is administered early. When indicated, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset. However, antiviral treatment might still have some benefits in patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness and in hospitalized patients when started after 48 hours of illness onset. Antiviral treatment also may be considered for previously healthy, symptomatic outpatients who are not considered to be at high risk and have confirmed or suspected influenza, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. Residents of long-term care facilities can experience severe and fatal illness during influenza outbreaks; residents with confirmed or suspected influenza should be treated with antivirals immediately, without waiting for laboratory confirmation of influenza. During periods where two or more residents of long-term care facilities are ill within 72 hours with confirmed or suspected influenza, antivirals should be given prophylactically to residents and should be considered for any unvaccinated staff. Additionally, antiviral chemoprophylaxis can be considered for all staff, regardless of vaccination status, if the outbreak is caused by a strain of influenza virus that is not well matched to the vaccine.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly and are available at. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A virus infections in humans is available at.

Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)

One double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trial was conducted in pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years (median age 5 years) who had fever (at least 100ºF) plus one respiratory symptom (cough or coryza) when influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Of 698 subjects enrolled in this trial, 452 (65%) were influenza-infected (50% male; 68% Caucasian). Of the 452 influenza-infected subjects, 67% were infected with influenza A and 33% with influenza B.

Efficacy in this trial was determined by the time to alleviation or resolution of influenza signs and symptoms, measured by a composite endpoint that required the following four individual conditions be met: i) alleviation of cough, ii) alleviation of coryza, iii) resolution of fever, and iv) parental opinion of a return to normal health and activity. Oseltamivir phosphate treatment of 2 mg per kg twice daily, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, reduced the total composite time to freedom from illness by 1.5 days compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in male and female pediatric subjects.

Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age)

Two open-label trials evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in influenza-infected pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age). Subjects received oseltamivir phosphate at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days depending on subject age. These clinical trials were not designed to evaluate clinical efficacy or virologic response.

Of the 136 subjects under the age of 1 year enrolled and dosed in the trials, the majority of the subjects were male (55%), white (79%), non-Hispanic (74%), full term (76%) and infected with influenza A (80%). Pharmacokinetic data indicated that a dose of 3 mg per kg twice daily in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age provided oseltamivir phosphate concentrations similar to or higher than those observed in older pediatric subjects and adults receiving the approved dose and provided the basis for approval [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Advise patients and/or caregivers of the risk of severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) or serious skin reactions. Instruct patients and/or caregiver to stop oseltamivir phosphate and seek immediate medical attention if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Neuropsychiatric Events

Advise patients and/or caregivers of the risk of neuropsychiatric events in oseltamivir phosphate-treated patients with influenza and instruct patients to contact their physician if they experience signs of abnormal behavior while receiving oseltamivir phosphate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Important Dosing Information

Instruct patients to begin treatment with oseltamivir phosphate as soon as possible from the first appearance of flu symptoms, within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. Similarly, instruct patients to start taking oseltamivir phosphate for prevention as soon as possible after exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Instruct patients to take any missed doses as soon as they remember, except if it is near the next scheduled dose (within 2 hours), and then continue to take oseltamivir phosphate at the usual times.

Influenza Vaccines

Instruct patients that oseltamivir phosphate is not a substitute for receiving an annual flu vaccination. Patients should continue receiving an annual flu vaccination according to guidelines on immunization practices. Because of the potential for oseltamivir phosphate to inhibit replication of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and possibly reduce efficacy of LAIV, avoid administration of LAIV within 2 weeks or 48 hours after oseltamivir phosphate administration, unless medically necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Adults

Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of TAMIFLU were conducted in adults between 18 and 65 years old, one in the U.S. and one outside the U.S., for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Eligible subjects had fever of at least 100ºF, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom (cough, nasal symptoms, or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue, or headache), and influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Subjects were randomized to receive oral TAMIFLU or placebo for 5 days. All enrolled subjects were allowed to take fever-reducing medications.

Of 1,355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) subjects were influenza-infected (median age 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Of the 849 influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with influenza of unknown type.

Study medication was started within 40 hours of onset of symptoms and administered twice daily for 5 days. Subjects were required to self-assess the influenza-associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe". Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms were assessed as "none" or "mild". In both trials, there was a 1.3-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received TAMIFLU 75 mg twice a day for 5 days compared to subjects who received placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of TAMIFLU in men and women.

In the treatment of influenza, no increased efficacy was demonstrated in subjects who received higher doses of TAMIFLU.

Prophylaxis of Influenza

The safety and efficacy of TAMIFLU for the prophylaxis of influenza in pediatric patients 1 year to 17 years old has been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.2)] and is based on:

13 to 17 years of age: Prophylaxis in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age is supported by one randomized, placebo-controlled post-exposure household prophylaxis trial of TAMIFLU 75 mg taken orally once daily for 7 days in household contacts including 207 adolescents [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].
1 year to 12 years of age: TAMIFLU for prophylaxis in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age is supported by one randomized, open-label, post-exposure household prophylaxis trial including pediatric subjects 1 year to 12 years of age who received 30 to 60 mg of TAMIFLU for oral suspension (supplied as powder) taken orally once daily for 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Additional safety information was provided in a 6-week seasonal prophylaxis (community outbreak) safety study in 49 patients 1 year to 12 years of age.

The safety and efficacy of TAMIFLU for prophylaxis of influenza have not been established for pediatric patients less than 1 year of age.

Seasonal influenza — evidence base and investigational strategies for resistant virus management note that there are no randomized trials to guide optimal care. Two studies in 2008–2009 when H275Y H1N1 variants circulated suggested that zanamivir or laninamivir led to superior clinical outcomes compared to oseltamivir. Most clinical data come from case reports and case series where patients on oseltamivir were switched late to other antivirals; the best outcomes appear to be associated with early changes to an agent with in vitro activity against the oseltamivir-resistant virus. Combination antiviral therapy with 2 or more active agents with different mechanisms of action is described as investigational and may reduce additional de novo resistance in immunocompromised and other higher-risk patients.

### Evaluation of oseltamivir used to prevent hospitalization in outpatients with influenza: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112JSnbC]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza was one of the most clinically burdensome respiratory viruses. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 29 million cases, 380 000 hospitalizations, and 28 000 deaths from influenza in the US during the 2018 to 2019 season. While COVID-19 led to a temporary reduction in infections, influenza is now expected to have a resurgence. Novel strains or a rise in a relatively less immune population could trigger an influenza pandemic resembling the crises experienced in 1968 or 2009. As such, the availability of safe and effective treatments is critical to avoid overwhelming health care systems and to reduce morbidity and mortality. Indeed, a breakthrough in the COVID-19 pandemic occurred when outpatient randomized clinical trials demonstrated reductions in hospitalization and death. In contrast, despite the substantial threat that influenza poses, there are no evidence-based outpatient treatments proven to prevent the progression to hospitalization.

Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is an antiviral that is commonly prescribed to outpatients with influenza to accelerate recovery and prevent complications. Detailing by key opinion leaders, guideline panels, and the manufacturer has even led to stockpiling of the medication as part of national pandemic responses. Yet, despite guideline recommendations, and millions of doses prescribed, it is unclear whether oseltamivir reduces severe complications requiring hospitalization. Three prior systematic reviews (1 independent and 2 supported by the manufacturer) have arrived at different conclusions. Since these publications, several large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been completed and have yet to be meta-analyzed. We, therefore, sought to clarify whether oseltamivir is a high-value medical treatment (achieving optimal results for patients balanced with an efficient use of resources). To do so, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of oseltamivir for the prevention of first hospitalization in adolescent and adult outpatients (efficacy) and treatment-associated adverse events (safety).

### Modeling influenza antiviral strategies: reducing burden and preventing resistance [^1115AJ9u]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Seasonal influenza remains a major cause of disease and death globally, leading to an estimated 290 000–650 000 deaths each year and causing many more people to be hospitalized. Annual vaccination campaigns help reduce that burden but are impeded by low coverage (< 50% of people receive the vaccine in a typical season) and limited vaccine effectiveness due to the rapid evolution of the influenza virus, which makes it challenging to match vaccine strains to circulating strains. Antiviral drugs are used both therapeutically to reduce illness duration and complications and, much less frequently, prophylactically to prevent illness, particularly in high-risk individuals. If taken shortly after the onset of symptoms, antivirals can reduce infectiousness and thereby reduce virus transmission to individuals who come in contact with treated case patients. In addition to mitigating the seasonal burden of influenza, antivirals are stockpiled by the United States and other nations as a first line of defense against novel influenza viruses that spill over from wild or domesticated animals, such as the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) observed in humans in the United States in 2024.

Two classes of antivirals are currently recommended for influenza treatment in the United States: the neuraminidase inhibitors, including the most commonly prescribed antiviral oseltamivir which is approved for all ages (brand name Tamiflu), and the endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil, approved for adults and children aged ≥ 5 years (brand name Xofluza; referred to as baloxavir hereafter). In Europe, baloxavir is approved for treatment and prevention of influenza starting at 1 year of age. Baloxavir and oseltamivir are effective in reducing the duration of symptoms in patients treated for influenza A virus illness, but clinical trial data indicate that upper respiratory tract infectious viral titers decrease faster in baloxavir-treated than oseltamivir-treated patients. Findings from prior observational studies and a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oseltamivir treatment indicate that its timely use may reduce virus transmission to household contacts. Observational data indicate that baloxavir treatment also reduces the risk of onward virus transmission to close contacts, and a randomized placebo-controlled trial measured this effect.

All hospitalized patients with suspected influenza should be tested, and influenza testing may be used to inform decisions on use of antibiotics or continuation of antiviral medication, on need for further diagnostic tests, on consideration for home care, or on recommendations for ill persons living with others who are at high risk for influenza complications; influenza testing may be useful in order to inform decisions in infection control practices. Antiviral treatment is recommended for outpatients with suspected influenza who are at high risk for complications or those with progressive disease not requiring hospital admission, and antiviral treatment of outpatients who are not at high risk can be considered based upon clinical judgment if presenting within 2 days of illness onset.

### Update: influenza activity-United States, October 1, 2017-February 3, 2018 [^117XS9VQ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors has been shown to reduce illness duration and severe outcomes of influenza based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. Treatment with influenza antiviral medications initiated as close to the onset of illness as possible is recommended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are not hospitalized but who are at high risk for developing serious influenza complications. Treatment should not be delayed while waiting for results of testing or even if rapid antigen-detection influenza diagnostic test results are negative. Clinical benefit of antiviral treatment is greatest when treatment begins within 48 hours after symptom onset; however, antiviral treatment initiated later than 48 hours after illness onset can still be beneficial for some patients. A CDC health advisory released on December 27, 2017, regarding treatment with antiviral medications is available at.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available online.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^115928Sd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Oseltamivir Treatment of Severe Influenza

Although necessary to consider oseltamivir's effect on more serious infections, no randomized controlled trials exist that can be included in a meta-analysis. The Cochrane group chooses only to conduct meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, which are generally accepted to be the highest level of evidence. Thus, the Cochrane group could not review severe outcomes of laboratory-confirmed influenza. Evidence is instead derived from observational studies on the use of oseltamivir to treat complications of influenza virus infection, as in hospitalized patients or in those who died. These studies are subject to uncontrolled bias. For instance, sicker patients may be more (or less) likely to be treated, thus attenuating (or exaggerating) the effect of the intervention. Also, a serious outcome may occur soon after the treatment was initiated in a severely ill patient, so that the treatment has not had a chance to succeed. Similarly, patients who receive early treatment are more likely to benefit from treatment than patients who receive late treatment. To minimize bias, researchers conducting observational studies have attempted to adjust for time from disease onset to treatment and time from treatment to outcome. Some observational studies have also adjusted for propensity to be treated as well as patient coexisting conditions and disease severity, which may affect treatment decisions and outcomes.

Observational studies that enrolled adults have often used death as an outcome, given its ease of definition. However, many observational studies fail to control completely for potential biases, including time biases. Among studies that have attempted to control for these biases, a decreased risk for death after oseltamivir treatment has been reported, and early treatment appears to be critical. For instance, in a retrospective cohort study from Israel of 449 patients hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, all patients were treated with oseltamivir, and 189 (42%) were treated within 48 hours. This observational study controlled for propensity to treat and patient coexisting conditions and demonstrated the odds of death increased by 2.2 times (95% CI 1.4–3.5 times) if treatment was started late (> 48 hours after symptom onset).

5.1	Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions

Cases of anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and erythema multiforme have been reported in postmarketing experience with TAMIFLU. Stop TAMIFLU and institute appropriate treatment if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected. The use of TAMIFLU is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to TAMIFLU [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.2	Neuropsychiatric Events

There have been postmarketing reports of delirium and abnormal behavior leading to injury, and in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes, in patients with influenza who were receiving TAMIFLU [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made but they appear to be uncommon based on TAMIFLU usage data. These events were reported primarily among pediatric patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of TAMIFLU to these events has not been established. Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioral symptoms that can include events such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behavior, in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur without obvious severe disease. Closely monitor TAMIFLU-treated patients with influenza for signs of abnormal behavior. If neuropsychiatric symptoms occur, evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing TAMIFLU for each patient.

5.3	Risk of Bacterial Infections

There is no evidence for efficacy of TAMIFLU in any illness caused by pathogens other than influenza viruses. Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza. TAMIFLU has not been shown to prevent such complications. Prescribers should be alert to the potential for secondary bacterial infections and treat them as appropriate.

5.4	Fructose Intolerance in Patients with Hereditary Fructose Intolerance

Fructose can be harmful to patients with hereditary fructose intolerance. One dose of 75 mg TAMIFLU for oral suspension delivers 2 grams of sorbitol. This is above the daily maximum limit of sorbitol for patients with hereditary fructose intolerance and may cause dyspepsia and diarrhea.

Oseltamivir (pronounced os-el-ta-mi-veer; Tamiflu — Roche), an oral anti-influenza drug that inhibits influenza virus neuraminidase, is now available in the UK. It has recently been licensed throughout the EU for use, when influenza is circulating in the community, in the treatment of patients with early influenza-like symptoms, and for prophylaxis in people who have had close contact with someone with influenza. Oseltamivir is the second neuraminidase inhibitor to be licensed in the UK, the other being zanamivir (Relenza — GlaxoSmithKline), which is taken by inhalation and licensed only for treatment.

### Influenza virus-related critical illness: prevention, diagnosis, treatment [^115hgxJb]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

No completed randomized, placebo-controlled trials of antiviral treatment have been conducted in hospitalized influenza patients to establish the efficacy of oseltamivir or other NAIs. A number of observational studies have reported clinical benefit of neuraminidase inhibitors in hospitalized patients, including reduction in duration of hospitalization and risk of death, including in ICU patients. Additionally, a systematic review of published reviews/meta-analyses reported survival benefit of NAI treatment in hospitalized patients, although another meta-analysis of observational studies did not. In particular, a large pooled individual patient-level meta-analysis of observational studies from 38 countries identified a 38% reduction in risk of mortality in critically ill adults and those aged ≥ 16 years old when comparing early NAI treatment (< 48 h) with later treatment (> 48 h), and a 69% reduction in mortality risk between influenza patients receiving early NAI treatment and those who did not receive NAIs. The mortality risk reduction of NAI treatment at any time versus no treatment was 28% for critically ill patients aged ≥ 16 years old; while a similar reduction in mortality was identified in critically ill children aged < 16 years, the result was not statistically significant and was likely underpowered because death is less common in hospitalized children with influenza than in adults.

Although studies have shown the greatest clinical benefit when antivirals are started within 2 days of illness onset, some observational studies have shown clinical benefit of neuraminidase inhibitors when started up to 5 days following symptom onset. The large meta-analysis mentioned above also identified a significantly reduced mortality risk reduction (35%) in critically ill patients aged ≥ 16 years old who received NAI treatment > 48 h after symptom onset compared with those who did not. A cohort study of early versus late oseltamivir treatment reported a significant reduction in mortality and median duration of ICU hospitalization in severely ill patients with influenza A(H3N2), but not A(H1N1pdm09) or B virus infection in Greece. One French study reported delays in initiation of oseltamivir treatment prescribed to hospitalized influenza patients and suggested empiric administration of oseltamivir treatment in the emergency department for patients being admitted with lower respiratory tract disease during influenza season. Overall, based upon available observational data to date in hospitalized patients with influenza, including ICU patients, initiation of neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza.

### Effect of early oseltamivir treatment on mortality in critically ill patients with different types of influenza: a multiseason cohort study [^113xsrx4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The available evidence on whether neuraminidase inhibitors reduce mortality in patients with influenza is inconclusive and focuses solely on influenza A/H1N1pdm09. We assessed whether early oseltamivir treatment (≤ 48 hours from symptom onset) decreases mortality compared to late treatment in a large cohort of critically ill patients with influenza of all types.

Methods

The study included all adults with laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) in Greece over 8 seasons (2010–2011 to 2017–2018) and treated with oseltamivir. The association of early oseltamivir with mortality was assessed with log-binomial models and a competing risks analysis estimating cause-specific and subdistribution hazards for death and discharge. Effect estimates were stratified by influenza type and adjusted for multiple covariates.

Results

A total of 1330 patients were studied, of whom 622 (46.8%) died in the ICU. Among patients with influenza A/H3N2, early treatment was associated with significantly lower mortality (relative risk, 0.69 [95% credible interval {CrI}, .49-.94]; subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.58 [95% CrI, .37-.88]). This effect was purely due to an increased cause-specific hazard for discharge, whereas the cause-specific hazard for death was not increased. Among survivors, the median length of ICU stay was shorter with early treatment by 1.8 days (95% CrI, .5–3.5 days). No effect on mortality was observed for A/H1N1 and influenza B patients.

Conclusions

Severely ill patients with suspected influenza should be promptly treated with oseltamivir, particularly when A/H3N2 is circulating. The efficacy of oseltamivir should not be assumed to be equal against all types of influenza.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^116FCHB8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The first pandemic of the 21st century occurred unexpectedly in 2009 after the global spread of a novel virus — influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 — of swine (rather than avian) origin. In response, many countries activated their stockpiles of antiviral agents or accessed existing community supplies. This was the first time that specific antiviral drugs were available in a pandemic. In the United States during 2009, 8.7 million oseltamivir prescriptions (28.4 prescriptions/1,000 persons) were dispensed from community pharmacies, not from the stockpile, at a cost of US $905 million.

Although the number of deaths due to the 2009 pandemic was lower than initially anticipated, a unique opportunity was provided to review the effectiveness of oseltamivir in the pandemic setting and to determine the benefit of oseltamivir for patients who were hospitalized with confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. Such observational data were valuable to ascertain the effect of oseltamivir in severely ill or hospitalized patients given the continued absence of data from placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials.

Questioning whether oseltamivir is useful for treating serious illness and whether it should be stockpiled has extended the debate on the effectiveness of oseltamivir in the community. We believe that these issues should be considered separately.

### Prescription of anti-influenza drugs for healthy adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129XpE1]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

In publicly funded health systems with finite resources, management decisions are based on assessments of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence commissioned a systematic review to inform their 2009 update to guidance on the use of antiviral drugs for the treatment of influenza. We searched databases for studies of the use of neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of seasonal influenza. We present the results for healthy adults (ie, adults without known comorbidities) and people at-risk of influenza-related complications. There was an overall reduction in the median time to symptom alleviation in healthy adults by 0.57 days (95% CI -1.07 to -0.08; p = 0.02; 2701 individuals) with zanamivir, and 0.55 days (95% CI -0.96 to -0.14; p = 0.008; 1410 individuals) with oseltamivir. In those at risk, the median time to symptom alleviation was reduced by 0.98 days (95% CI -1.84 to -0.11; p = 0.03; 1252 individuals) with zanamivir, and 0.74 days (95% CI -1.51 to 0.02; p = 0.06; 1472 individuals) with oseltamivir. Little information was available on the incidence of complications. In view of the advantages and disadvantages of different management strategies for controlling seasonal influenza in healthy adults recommending the use of antiviral drugs for the treatment of people presenting with symptoms is unlikely to be the most appropriate course of action.

### A randomized study evaluating the effectiveness of oseltamivir initiated at the time of hospital admission in adults hospitalized with influenza-associated lower respiratory tract infections [^115f8nSd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Influenza-associated hospitalizations result in high morbidity and mortality. We sought to determine if early empiric anti-influenza therapy improves outcomes of hospitalized patients with influenza-associated lower respiratory tract infections (I-LRTIs).

Methods

This was a randomized, unblinded, trial of adult patients hospitalized with I-LRTIs in Kentucky during 2009–2012. Patients were randomized to group A (standard of care) or group B (standard of care plus oseltamivir as early as possible but within 24 hours of enrollment). The primary outcome was development of clinical failure (composite variable including failure to reach clinical improvement within 7 days, transfer to intensive care 24 hours after admission, or rehospitalization or death within 30 days). Intent-to-treat (ITT) (all LRTI) and per-protocol (PP) (I-LRTI) analyses were done.

Results

A total of 1107 patients were enrolled and included in the ITT analysis, 556 in group A and 551 in group B. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 5 days (interquartile range, 5) for both groups; oseltamivir was initiated median day 6 in group B. There was no difference in the development of clinical failure (group A, 25%, and group B, 24%; p = 0.561). In the PP analysis, 11 of 45 (24%) patients in group A and 4 of 29 (14%) patients in group B had clinical failure (P = 0.414).

Conclusions

Initiation of oseltamivir more than 5 days after illness onset did not reduce clinical failures among hospitalized patients with I- LRTIs. However, we did not enroll our projected sample size of I-LRTI.

Evidence summary — early neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) therapy in outpatients: Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials that established the efficacy of NAIs in reducing the duration of fever and symptoms by approximately 1–2 days were conducted among mostly non–high-risk adult and pediatric outpatients with uncomplicated laboratory-confirmed influenza, enrolled within 36–48 hours of illness onset. Greater clinical benefit was reported when NAI treatment was started very early; in both adults and children, NAI treatment started within 6 hours of illness onset reduced symptoms by about 4 days. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate that early initiation (within 2 days of illness onset) of antiviral treatment can reduce the duration of fever and symptoms, especially in nonasthmatic children; decrease the risk of otitis media in children; and reduce the risk of lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics and of hospitalization in adults.

The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

We conducted a retrospective study to identify the risk factors for pneumonia in hospitalized pediatric patients with influenza B infection. Receiving oseltamivir within the first 48 hours of onset and frequent cough was respectively considered as a protective factor and a risk factor for the influenza B virus-associated pneumonia in hospitalized pediatric patients. Early administration of oseltamivir can reduce the risk of influenza B virus-associated pneumonia.

Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)

One double‐blind placebo‐controlled treatment trial was conducted in pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years (median age 5 years) who had fever (at least 100ºF) plus one respiratory symptom (cough or coryza) when influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Of 698 subjects enrolled in this trial, 452 (65%) were influenza‐infected (50% male; 68% Caucasian). Of the 452 influenza‐infected subjects, 67% were infected with influenza A and 33% with influenza B.

Efficacy in this trial was determined by the time to alleviation or resolution of influenza signs and symptoms, measured by a composite endpoint that required the following four individual conditions be met: i) alleviation of cough, ii) alleviation of coryza, iii) resolution of fever, and iv) parental opinion of a return to normal health and activity. Oseltamivir phosphate treatment of 2 mg per kg twice daily, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, reduced the total composite time to freedom from illness by 1.5 days compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in male and female pediatric subjects.

Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age)

Two open‐label trials evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in influenza‐infected pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age). Subjects received oseltamivir phosphate at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days depending on subject age. These clinical trials were not designed to evaluate clinical efficacy or virologic response.

Of the 136 subjects under the age of 1 year enrolled and dosed in the trials, the majority of the subjects were male (55%), white (79%), non‐Hispanic (74%), full term (76%) and infected with influenza A (80%). Pharmacokinetic data indicated that a dose of 3 mg per kg twice daily in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age provided oseltamivir phosphate concentrations similar to or higher than those observed in older pediatric subjects and adults receiving the approved dose and provided the basis for approval [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

In the post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts (aged 13 years or older) of an index influenza case, oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg once daily or placebo taken orally was administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms in the index case and continued for 7 days (index cases did not receive oseltamivir phosphate treatment). The incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was 12% (24/200) in the placebo-treated subjects compared to 1% (2/205) in the oseltamivir phosphate-treated subjects.

Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)

The efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness was demonstrated in a randomized, open-label post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts that included pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years, both as index cases and as family contacts. All index cases in this trial received oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension 30 to 60 mg taken orally once daily for 10 days. The efficacy parameter was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in the household. Laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was defined as meeting all of the following criteria:

oral temperature at least 100°F (37.8°C),
cough and/or coryza recorded within 48 hours, and
either a positive virus isolation or a four-fold or greater increase in virus antibody titers from baseline or at illness visits.

### Antivirals for treatment of severe influenza: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116LnWCW]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

One previous individual participant data meta-analysis that included observational studies of patients hospitalised with pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection reported that neuraminidase inhibitor treatment started on the day of admission, regardless of time since symptom onset, was associated with a reduction in the length of hospital stay compared with no or later initiation of neuraminidase inhibitor treatment. Our meta-analysis also found that oseltamivir and peramivir might reduce the duration of hospitalisation in patients with severe influenza compared with placebo or standard care. The WHO guideline panel discussed the evidence from observational studies and deemed that they did not provide a higher certainty of evidence for this population compared with the current systematic review of randomised controlled trials.

Due to limited data from the small number of randomised controlled trials of antivirals for treatment of patients with severe seasonal influenza and a lack of randomised controlled trials for treatment of severe zoonotic influenza, the current level of evidence for antiviral treatment of severe seasonal or zoonotic influenza is of low certainty. Additional clinical trials of antivirals are needed to inform the clinical benefit, safety, and effects on antiviral resistance in patients with severe influenza. Important gaps include better evidence on the effects of antiviral treatment for patients with severe influenza on admission to ICU, progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, mortality, and emergence of antiviral resistance, and the effects of antivirals on outcomes in key subgroup populations, including patients with severe zoonotic influenza.

Data from randomised controlled trials of antiviral treatment for patients with severe influenza are scarce. In patients with severe influenza, oseltamivir or peramivir might reduce the duration of hospitalisation compared with placebo or standard care. There is high uncertainty regarding the effects of oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir on ICU admission and mortality in patients with severe seasonal or zoonotic influenza. Sufficiently powered clinical trials in patients with severe influenza due to seasonal influenza virus infections and novel influenza A virus infections are needed to provide higher certainty evidence of the effects of antiviral treatment on important clinical outcomes.

### Oseltamivir treatment vs supportive care for seasonal influenza requiring hospitalization [^1134vkos]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Seasonal influenza is a common infection that can be severe and lead to hospitalization and death. Each year, influenza causes approximately 140 000 to 810 000 hospitalizations as well as 12 000 to 61 000 deaths in the US, and 12 200 hospitalizations as well as 3500 deaths in Canada.

Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor that can be used to treat severe influenza infection requiring hospitalization. The US and Canadian guidelines recommend treatment of all patients hospitalized with severe influenza regardless of illness duration, but this guidance is based on limited evidence. To date, there is a single randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing oseltamivir with supportive care in hospitalized patients with severe influenza. In the per-protocol population of 74 patients with confirmed influenza, there was no significant difference in clinical failures between the 2 groups. Observational studies showed a possible mortality benefit with oseltamivir in severe influenza, but most of the evidence was generated during the 2009 to 2010 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, and a newer study used a comparison group of delayed oseltamivir treatment. There is a knowledge gap in terms of effectiveness of oseltamivir compared with supportive care without oseltamivir in recent influenza seasons. Based on the suboptimal evidence, there continues to be equipoise resulting in low adherence to guideline recommendations on oseltamivir treatment for patients hospitalized with severe influenza. To add to the existing evidence, we conducted a large retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with severe influenza to evaluate the outcomes associated with oseltamivir treatment when compared with supportive care without oseltamivir treatment in terms of in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) use, time to discharge, and readmission.

### Management of influenza [^1115wpwD]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Influenza is a contagious airborne viral illness characterized by abrupt onset of symptoms. Fever, myalgia, headache, rhinitis, sore throat, and cough are commonly reported symptoms. The diagnosis should be made clinically, and the decision to begin antiviral therapy should not be delayed for laboratory confirmation of influenza. The 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus is expected to continue to circulate during the 2010–2011 season, but it is not certain whether it will replace or cocirculate with seasonal influenza A subtypes that have been circulating since 1977. The 2009 H1N1 virus is largely resistant to adamantanes, but it is sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir. Neuraminidase inhibitors have modest effectiveness in reducing influenza-related symptoms in patients at low risk of complications. Patients at high risk of complications, including pregnant women, should be treated with antiviral agents, preferably within 48 hours of symptom onset. Family physicians should follow guidelines from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when treating patients with influenza or influenza-like symptoms.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^112f9Lp5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza — postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis in noninstitutional settings: Clinicians can consider postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis for asymptomatic adults and children aged ≥ 3 months who are at very high risk of developing complications from influenza and for whom influenza vaccination is contraindicated, unavailable, or expected to have low effectiveness, after household exposure to influenza, and can consider postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis (in conjunction with influenza vaccination) for adults and children aged ≥ 3 months who are unvaccinated and are household contacts of a person at very high risk of complications from influenza, after exposure to influenza. Clinicians can consider educating patients and arranging for early empiric initiation of antiviral treatment as an alternative to postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis. If chemoprophylaxis is given, clinicians should administer postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis as soon as possible after exposure, ideally no later than 48 hours after exposure. Clinicians should not administer once-daily postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis if > 48 hours has elapsed since exposure, and full-dose empiric antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as symptoms occur, if treatment is indicated. Clinicians should administer postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis in a nonhousehold setting for 7 days after the most recent exposure to a close contact with influenza, and should test for influenza and switch to antiviral treatment dosing in persons receiving postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis who become symptomatic, preferably with an antiviral drug with a different resistance profile if not contraindicated. Clinicians should administer an NAI (inhaled zanamivir or oral oseltamivir) if postexposure chemoprophylaxis for influenza is given, rather than an adamantane antiviral.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^112UuYUb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Existing observational evidence on the benefits of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients, including assessing the risk for death, accrues from ecologic data from Japan, weak secondary analyses from randomized controlled trials of laboratory-confirmed influenza initially managed in the community, and the systematic reviews and analyses of observational studies of patients with confirmed infections caused by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H5N1) viruses. Methodologically less robust, small observational studies conducted before the pandemic support the finding that oseltamivir decreases the risk for death. However, well-designed prospective observational studies may provide the most informative data in the next 5–10 years.

We reached several conclusions regarding the use of oseltamivir and the considerations that will be necessary for future studies (Table). Nguyen-Van-Tam et al. recently outlined a list of covariates that would need to be collected to help strengthen the evidence that oseltamivir treatment benefits hospitalized patients with influenza. These include standardized data on illness onset and progression, comorbid conditions, disease severity, treatment, duration of hospital stay, the need for critical care, and influenza-related mortality. In addition, a review by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences, sponsored by the Wellcome Trust, has offered a range of approaches to potential future studies and called specifically for "pragmatic or adaptive [randomized controlled trial] designs" of neuraminidase inhibitors in hospitalized patients. Our conclusions are in broad agreement with those of this report.

Observational evidence on antiviral therapy — effects of oseltamivir timing, zanamivir comparisons, and evidence quality — reported that a meta-analysis of observational studies consisted of 74 articles, the analysis suggested that oseltamivir may reduce hospitalization in outpatients and decrease mortality in high-risk patients, and treatment was most effective when oral oseltamivir was started within 48 hours of symptom onset (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12–0.86 for mortality and OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33–0.81 for hospitalization); when inhaled zanamivir was compared with no treatment, patients were less likely to be hospitalized, studies comparing oral oseltamivir with inhaled zanamivir found no significant difference in hospitalization, overall evidence quality was very low to low for mortality and hospitalization, only one study reported mortality reduction with oral amantadine and adamantanes were considered more harmful than oseltamivir and zanamivir, and in a case series of older long-term care residents, those receiving oseltamivir within 48 hours were less likely to be prescribed antibiotics (38% vs 20%; P < .05).

Long-term care facility influenza outbreaks — duration of antiviral chemoprophylaxis is specified and supported by epidemiologic data: Clinicians should administer antiviral chemoprophylaxis for 14 days and continue for at least 7 days after the onset of symptoms in the last case identified during an institutional influenza outbreak (A-III). Supporting data include a randomized trial from 1991–1995 in which amantadine or rimantadine for 14 days (and for 7 days after the last confirmed influenza case) controlled outbreaks compared to 21 days, other reports using oseltamivir or zanamivir for 7–14 days, typical incubation 1–3 days (up to 4 days) with a mean serial interval of approximately 2–3 days, viral RNA detection for approximately 4–7 days after symptom onset with immunosuppressed, hospitalized and critically ill patients able to have prolonged shedding, household data showing transmission substantially reduced > 3 days after symptom onset but more than one-third with viral RNA detected at 7 days, and CDC guidance to administer chemoprophylaxis initially for 14 days and continue until 7 days after the last case has been identified if new cases continue to occur.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^116dXfMn]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Oseltamivir Treatment of Seasonal Influenza

After partially successful efforts to retrieve unpublished data from Roche, the Cochrane group conducted a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of oseltamivir in treating uncomplicated community-acquired influenza. Their findings led the group to conclude that oseltamivir had no specific antiviral effect, even though the drug had been specifically designed to achieve exactly that. The Cochrane systematic review, which focused only on an intention-to-treat analysis, confirmed that oseltamivir reduced symptom duration in the intention-to-treat group by < 24 hours. Earlier, the Cochrane group had noted, "We are unsure of the generalizability of our conclusions from seasonal to pandemic or avian influenza".

As noted previously, a subsequent meta-analysis (funded by an unrestricted grant from Roche) also confirmed a ≈1-day reduction in symptoms among adults and adolescents who had laboratory-confirmed influenza and were treated within 48 hours of symptom onset. This analysis included outcomes of both intention-to-treat and intention-to-treat-infected groups. Benefit was found for the intention-to-treat-infected group, but no benefit was found for patients with influenza-like illness who did not have laboratory-confirmed influenza (the intention-to-treat but not infected group). Given that the benefit of oseltamivir was confined to symptomatic patients with laboratory-confirmed infection, the authors concluded that the effect of oseltamivir was due to its effect on the influenza virus, rather than a nonspecific antiviral effect, as had been suggested by the Cochrane group.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Oseltamivir phosphate is an influenza neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) indicated for:

- Treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza A and B in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. (1.1)

- Prophylaxis of influenza A and B in patients 1 year and older. (1.2)

Limitations of Use:

- Not a substitute for annual influenza vaccination. (1.3)

- Consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use. (1.3)

- Not recommended for patients with end‐stage renal disease not undergoing dialysis. (1.3)

1.1	Treatment of Influenza

Oseltamivir phosphate is indicated for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated illness due to influenza A and B infection in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours.

1.2	Prophylaxis of Influenza

Oseltamivir phosphate is indicated for the prophylaxis of influenza A and B in patients 1 year and older.

1.3	Limitations of Use

- Oseltamivir phosphate is not a substitute for early influenza vaccination on an annual basis as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

- Influenza viruses change over time. Emergence of resistance substitutions could decrease drug effectiveness. Other factors (for example, changes in viral virulence) might also diminish clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Prescribers should consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use oseltamivir phosphate [see Microbiology (12.4)].

- Oseltamivir phosphate is not recommended for patients with end‐stage renal disease not undergoing dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Improving access to influenza testing and treatment: is It time for over-the-counter oseltamivir? [^114To32n]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Oseltamivir, an antiviral medication that has been used for influenza prophylaxis and treatment since 1999 and now available as a generic drug, is being considered for over-the-counter (OTC) status to allow individuals to access treatment without a prescription. This proposal has engendered controversy. With the rising availability of at-home diagnostic tests and the ever-present threat of an influenza pandemic, it is timely to revisit issues surrounding this controversy. In this commentary, we examine the potential benefits and risks of reclassifying oseltamivir as an OTC drug to enhance access to rapid influenza treatment. Additionally, we explore alternative models to improve oseltamivir accessibility, potentially utilizing rapid influenza testing. As newer drugs to treat influenza are proven safe and effective, they would be subject to similar considerations.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^111bv8Li]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

In an attempt to overcome the criticisms of design and analysis of the observational studies, Roche chose to fund a patient level meta-analysis of individual data from 78 different observational studies, which included > 29,000 patients. By adjusting for time, propensity to treat, and patient coexisting conditions, and comparing the effect of treatment with no treatment in patients infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, researchers found that the odds of death were reported as 0.50 (95% CI 0.37–0.67) for adults whose treatment was initiated within 48 hours, compared with the odds of death for untreated adults. However, in a series of exchanges published in the British Medical Journal and The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, even this carefully designed study has been criticized on methodologic grounds. A more recent meta-analysis of individual patient data from the same group of investigators examined the potential effect of oseltamivir on influenza-related pneumonia among > 20,000 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. However, this study has many of the predictable methodologic problems associated with retrospective reviews and does not add to the evidence base. There is scant other evidence for the benefit of oseltamivir on reducing the risk for death to help resolve residual uncertainty. The few potentially informative observational studies report on human infection with avian influenza strains and seasonal influenza, including an unpublished review sponsored by Roche.

2.1	Dosage and Administration Overview

Administer TAMIFLU for the treatment of influenza in patients 2 weeks of age or older [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] or for prophylaxis of influenza in patients 1 year and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] using:

TAMIFLU capsules or
TAMIFLU for oral suspension (supplied as a powder). This is the preferred formulation (6 mg per mL) for patients who cannot swallow capsules. Prior to use, the supplied TAMIFLU powder must be constituted with water by the pharmacist to produce the oral suspension [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

The capsules and oral suspension may be taken with or without food; however, tolerability may be enhanced if TAMIFLU is taken with food.

Adjust the TAMIFLU dosage in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

For patients who cannot swallow capsules, TAMIFLU for oral suspension is the preferred formulation. When TAMIFLU for oral suspension is not available from wholesaler or the manufacturer, TAMIFLU capsules may be opened and mixed with sweetened liquids such as regular or sugar-free chocolate syrup, corn syrup, caramel topping, or light brown sugar (dissolved in water). During emergency situations and when neither the oral suspension or the age-appropriate strengths of TAMIFLU capsules to mix with sweetened liquids are available, then a pharmacist may prepare an emergency supply of oral suspension from TAMIFLU 75 mg capsules [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

2.2	Recommended Dosage for Treatment of Influenza

Initiate treatment with TAMIFLU within 48 hours of influenza symptom onset.

Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older)

The recommended oral dosage of TAMIFLU for treatment of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg twice daily (one 75 mg capsule or 12.5 mL of oral suspension twice daily) for 5 days.

Pediatric Patients (2 weeks of age through 12 years of age)

Table 1 displays the recommended oral dosage of TAMIFLU for treatment of influenza in pediatric patients 2 weeks of age through 12 years of age and provides information about prescribing the capsule or the formulation for oral suspension.

### Effectiveness of oseltamivir on disease progression and viral RNA shedding in patients with mild pandemic 2009 influenza A H1N1: opportunistic retrospective study of medical charts in China [^112KoTEj]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Three quarters of our patients received oseltamivir treatment, and 37% of them were given treatment within two days of symptom onset. Thus, we analysed the effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment on the subsequent development of radiographic evidence of pneumonia and on two quantitative indicators — duration of fever and viral RNA shedding — rather than grouping only duration of viral RNA shedding as in a recent study. Our study suggests that oseltamivir reduces the risk of radiographically confirmed pneumonia, and early treatment within two days of symptoms onset can reduce the duration of fever and viral RNA shedding. Two small observational studies on 2009 H1N1 also suggested that early oseltamivir treatment reduced duration of viral shedding, viral load, and duration of fever. The evidence from previous randomised controlled trials of uncomplicated seasonal influenza is strongest for antiviral treatment started within 48 hours of illness onset. Current guidance recommends that antiviral treatment should be initiated immediately and without waiting for laboratory confirmation of diagnosis. Observational studies suggest that neuraminidase inhibitor treatment of patients in hospital can reduce disease severity and mortality, both for 2009 H1N1and seasonal influenza. Our results, however, do not suggest that early initiation of oseltamivir (that is, less than two days after onset) was more protective than later initiation. Consistent with the observational studies on seasonal infectionand human infection with H5N1, our patients still seemed to gain benefit (prevention of radiographically confirmed pneumonia) even when they received antiviral treatment more than 48 hours after symptom onset. Antiviral treatment should ideally be started early after the onset of symptoms, but it can also be used at any stage of active disease if ongoing viral replication is anticipated or documented.

We believe the absence of severely affected patients in our series is because of early admission to hospital and early treatment with oseltamivir for most patients. In contrast to previous reports on severely affected patients admitted to hospital in countries with sustained community-wide transmission, our case series reflects only the most commonly affected — that is, young healthy adults — at the beginning of the pandemic, which is not representative of the general Chinese population. Also, the prevalence of risk factors associated with severe disease from 2009 H1N1, including chronic comorbidities, pregnancy, and very young age, in our patients is much lower than in recent reports of severely affected patients admitted to hospital. These differences are probably because we included all patients positive for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, whereas in the other studies requirement for admission to hospital was an additional criterion.

### Early estimates of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness-United States, January 2015 [^1142oiVA]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

These early VE estimates underscore the need for additional influenza prevention and treatment measures, especially among persons aged ≥ 65 years, young children, and other persons at higher risk for serious influenza associated complications. § Influenza antiviral medications should be used as recommended for treatment in patients, regardless of their vaccination status. Antiviral treatment can reduce the duration of illness and reduce complications associated with influenza. Antiviral treatment should be used for any patient with suspected or confirmed influenza who is hospitalized, has severe or progressive illness, or is at high risk for complications from influenza, even if the illness seems mild. Persons at high risk include young children (especially children aged < 2 years), pregnant women, persons with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, or heart disease, and adults aged ≥ 65 years.

Ideally, antiviral treatment should be initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset, when treatment is most effective. However, antiviral treatment initiated later than 48 hours after illness onset can still be beneficial for some patients. Observational studies of hospitalized patients suggest some benefit when treatment was initiated up to 4 or 5 days after symptom onset. Also, a randomized placebo-controlled study suggested clinical benefit when oseltamivir was initiated 72 hours after illness onset among febrile children with uncomplicated influenza. Clinical judgment, on the basis of the patient's disease severity and progression, age, underlying medical conditions, likelihood of influenza, and time since onset of symptoms, is important when making antiviral treatment decisions for outpatients. The decision to initiate antiviral treatment should not be delayed pending laboratory confirmation of influenza, especially if performed by insensitive assays, such as rapid influenza diagnostic tests. Health care providers should advise patients at high risk to call promptly if they get symptoms of influenza. Also, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for influenza while influenza activity is widespread. Alternative strategies, such as health care provider–operated telephone triage, might enable patients at high risk to discuss symptoms over the phone and facilitate early initiation of treatment.

### Hospital-acquired influenza in an Australian tertiary centre 2017: a surveillance based study [^113Lu2o5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The median period (1 day) between symptom onset and diagnosis of hospital-acquired influenza suggests that when symptoms were identified in-hospital testing was performed rapidly and appropriately. Any acute development of symptoms in admitted high-risk hospital patients during the influenza season, whether it is ILI or non-ILI, should be approached with high suspicion that hospital-acquired influenza could be a potential diagnosis.

The majority of the hospital-acquired and community-acquired groups received antiviral treatment (88.9 and 93.2% respectively) and hospital-acquired influenza was treated sooner than community-acquired influenza. The benefits of antiviral treatment are best achieved when initiating within 48 h after symptom onset. The proportion of patients receiving treatment within this window was low (62.5% of hospital-acquired cases and 39.8% of community-acquired cases) thus potentially impacting outcomes of patients. Although it is difficult to commence treatment early for community-acquired cases due to a delay between symptom onset and hospital admission, no such delay should exist for hospital-acquired cases. Furthermore, early treatment with oseltamivir may decrease the infectivity of the individual. In the hospital setting oseltamivir treatment should be part of a bundle to limit ongoing spread as an adjunctive measure to isolation, hand hygiene and other infection control measures. As our institution has a policy of early treatment with oseltamivir, this study has provoked ongoing audit-based and qualitative research into the barriers for early prescribing of antivirals in hospital-acquired influenza.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^111tpE7f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

A lively, and sometimes heated, debate has recently been conducted in the popular press and medical literature about the effectiveness of oseltamivir, its usefulness in treating seasonal influenza, and the need for it to be stockpiled for use in a future influenza pandemic. Oseltamivir, manufactured by F. Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche) (Indianapolis, IN, USA), is the market leader of the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI), the first class of antiviral drugs designed specifically to treat influenza.

Oseltamivir came on the market in many countries in 2000 after clinical studies had been conducted among influenza virus–infected patients with uncomplicated illness. Trial data from outpatient studies have been summarized in a recent meta-analysis of individual patient data, including published and unpublished studies, which confirms that oseltamivir will reduce the duration of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed influenza in otherwise healthy adults from 5 days to 4 days, a result consistent with those of a previous systematic review by the Cochrane group.

After the drug's market release, oseltamivir use for treatment of seasonal influenza was modest in most countries, except for Japan, where widespread use of the drug was adopted. However, governments began to consider antiviral drug administration as a key component of their planned pandemic response after human infections with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus increased in 2003 and were associated with a case-fatality risk of > 50%. Suitable vaccines would not be available at the start of a pandemic; thus, use of antiviral agents was seen as a critical part of a pandemic response.

Because the mode of administration for oseltamivir was simpler (oral) than that for zanamivir (inhalation) and because the systemic effect of oseltamivir was expected to be appropriate for treatment of highly pathogenic viruses, oseltamivir was suddenly in high demand, apparently driven by warnings from Roche that preemptive stockpiling was the only way that governments could be assured of drug availability. Since 2005, governments of middle-income and high-income countries around the world have spent billions of dollars (estimated) stockpiling oseltamivir. However, by November 2015, the influenza A(H5N1) virus that initiated stockpiling had caused only 844 human cases of infection and 449 deaths (case-fatality risk 53.2%) across 16 countries worldwide, with only 7 countries reporting > 10 cases.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — antiviral timing and hospital admission management — Greatest clinical benefit was reported when antiviral treatment was started within 2 days of illness onset, but benefit was noted even when started in most patients 4–5 days and up to 7 days after illness onset, including when NAI treatment was started > 48 hours after illness onset; a meta-analysis in hospitalized A(H1N1)pdm09 cases suggested that antiviral treatment within 48 hours of illness onset was associated with lower mortality compared to later or no treatment. Early antiviral treatment of influenza in outpatients reduces the likelihood of antibiotic use or physician-diagnosed complications and may reduce secondary bacterial coinfection. For patients being admitted with suspected influenza, we recommend starting empiric antiviral treatment as soon as possible without waiting for influenza testing results.

Oseltamivir Policies for Seasonal and Pandemic Influenza

The evidence from randomized controlled trials is clear that oseltamivir treatment decreases the duration of symptoms by up to 1 day in adolescent and adult patients with laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza whose infections are able to be managed in the community. Oseltamivir provides no benefit to patients who have influenza-like illness not caused by influenza virus. Reviews of observational data regarding patients hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 or influenza A(H5N1) infections found that risk for death is cut in half if treatment is initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset. Small prepandemic observational studies, although they generally have controlled less for potential biases, also support the conclusion that risk for death is decreased with oseltamivir treatment.

These 2 lines of evidence may appear inconsistent. How would an intervention that has a modest effect on symptom duration in patients whose uncomplicated influenza was treated after a visit to a general practitioner be able to cut in half the risk for death among hospitalized patients?

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^116MjpuU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

A debate about the market-leading influenza antiviral medication, oseltamivir, which initially focused on treatment for generally mild illness, has been expanded to question the wisdom of stockpiling for use in future influenza pandemics. Although randomized controlled trial evidence confirms that oseltamivir will reduce symptom duration by 17–25 hours among otherwise healthy adolescents and adults with community-managed disease, no randomized controlled trials have examined the effectiveness of oseltamivir against more serious outcomes. Observational studies, although criticized on methodologic grounds, suggest that oseltamivir given early can reduce the risk for death by half among persons hospitalized with confirmed infection caused by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H5N1) viruses. However, available randomized controlled trial data may not be able to capture the effect of oseltamivir use among hospitalized patients with severe disease. We assert that data on outpatients with relatively mild disease should not form the basis for policies on the management of more severe disease.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^114tLpsz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza (IDSA 2018) — immunocompromised patients: Influenza viral replication, including asymptomatic shedding, can be prolonged and resistant variants during or after antiviral treatment can occur more frequently than in immunocompetent patients. Retrospectively collected data suggest treatment can safely extend to 10 days or longer, and rebound viral replication has been observed in some patients treated for 5 days; longer duration is advisable if disease is severe and influenza viral RNA remains detectable. There are no data to support the use of higher doses of oseltamivir in this population. Early initiation of antiviral therapy is associated with the best outcomes, although clinical benefit has been reported when starting treatment > 48 hours after symptom onset.

### Neuraminidase inhibitors for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in children: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112v9sT3]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

During epidemic years, influenza attack rates often exceed 40% in preschool children and 30% in school age children. School age children are the main source of spread of influenza into households. In some influenza seasons, a quarter of children presenting to emergency departments and paediatric clinics with respiratory symptoms or fever will have laboratory evidence of influenza. Moreover, complications of influenza are common in children and include respiratory tract infections (acute otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, croup), febrile convulsions, and exacerbations of asthma. Acute otitis media, for example, occurs in 20–50% of children under 6 after influenza. In contrast, deaths from seasonal influenza are rare. During the 2003–4 influenza season in the United States, 2.1 per million children died from influenza or its complications, such as pneumonia. In the current H1N1 pandemic, about 30% of cases in the United Kingdom have been in children aged under 10.

The primary strategy for control of influenza is vaccination. Coverage, however, might be low, and often there is inadequate time to produce and distribute vaccines in response to emerging strains, such as influenza A/H5N1 and the new variant influenza A/H1N1 (Mexico). Therefore, current control strategies include using antiviral medications for preventing spread, as well as for treating infected individuals. Because amantadine and rimantidine are effective only against influenza A, are limited by drug resistance, and have poor tolerability, they have been replaced by neuraminidase inhibitors. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is administered orally and in the UK is licensed for the treatment and postexposure prophylaxis of influenza in children aged over 1. Zanamivir (Relenza) is inhaled as a dry powder and is currently licensed in the UK for the treatment and postexposure prophylaxis of influenza in children aged 5 and over. For treatment to be effective, current guidelines for treating seasonal influenza state that oseltamivir should be administered within 48 hours and zanamivir within 36 hours of onset of symptoms.

The last update of our Cochrane review of this treatment was in 2005 and included three treatment trials and one prophylaxis trial. We need an accurate, up to date assessment of the benefits and harms of oseltamivir and zanamivir so that national bodies, clinicians, and parents can make evidence informed decisions about treating and preventing influenza in children. We assessed the current evidence for the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment and prevention of influenza in children.

### Early oseltamivir treatment of influenza in children 1–3 years of age: a randomized controlled trial [^115vfgJE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Oseltamivir provides modest clinical benefits to children with influenza when started within 48 hours of symptom onset. The effectiveness of oseltamivir could be substantially greater if the treatment were started earlier during the course of the illness.

Methods

We carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy of oseltamivir started within 24 hours of symptom onset in children 1–3 years of age with laboratory-confirmed influenza during the seasons of 2007–2008 and 2008–2009. Eligible children received either orally administered oseltamivir suspension or a matching placebo twice daily for 5 days. The children received clinical examinations, and the parents filled out detailed symptom diaries for 21 days.

Results

Of 408 randomized children who received the study drug (oseltamivir, 203, and placebo, 205), 98 had laboratory-confirmed influenza (influenza A, 79, and influenza B, 19). When started within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms, oseltamivir decreased the incidence of acute otitis media by 85% (95% confidence interval, 25%-97%), but no significant reduction was observed with treatment started within 24 hours. Among children with influenza A, oseltamivir treatment started within 24 hours shortened the median time to resolution of illness by 3.5 days (3.0 vs 6.5 days; p = 0.006) in all children and by 4.0 days (3.4 vs 7.3; p = 0.006) in unvaccinated children and reduced parental work absenteeism by 3.0 days. No efficacy was demonstrated against influenza B infections.

Conclusions

Oseltamivir treatment started within 24 hours of symptom onset provides substantial benefits to children with influenza A infection. Clinical trials registration. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00593502.

### Oseltamivir phosphate (oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension) [^1131N2Eu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Treatment of Influenza

Adults Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of oseltamivir phosphate were conducted in adults between 18 and 65 years old, one in the U.S. and one outside the U.S., for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Eligible subjects had fever of at least 100ºF, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom (cough, nasal symptoms, or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue, or headache), and influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Subjects were randomized to receive oral oseltamivir phosphate or placebo for 5 days. All enrolled subjects were allowed to take fever-reducing medications.

Of 1,355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) subjects were influenza-infected (median age 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Of the 849 influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with influenza of unknown type.

Study medication was started within 40 hours of onset of symptoms and administered twice daily for 5 days. Subjects were required to self-assess the influenza-associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe". Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms were assessed as "none" or "mild". In both trials, there was a 1.3-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice a day for 5 days compared to subjects who received placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in men and women.

Seasonal influenza (IDSA 2018) — pregnancy treatment approach: Observational studies suggest that early antiviral treatment provides improved clinical outcomes compared with no therapy or late initiation in hospitalized pregnant women with influenza, but no randomized, prospective, controlled trials in pregnant or postpartum women have been conducted to date. Oseltamivir is preferred for treatment of influenza in pregnant women over inhaled zanamivir and is also preferred over IV peramivir. Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, a 30% dose increase of oseltamivir phosphate was estimated to be needed to attain comparable systemic exposure to nonpregnant women (105 mg once daily for prophylaxis and 105 mg twice daily for treatment); therefore, higher dosing of oseltamivir can be considered, especially for pregnant women who are hospitalized with influenza complications, although there are no safety data supporting higher doses in pregnancy. Any potential benefit of higher oseltamivir dosing should be weighed against disease severity and potential unknown toxicities, and the lower systemic exposure might also compromise the effectiveness of once-daily oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis.

### Effect of double dose oseltamivir on clinical and virological outcomes in children and adults admitted to hospital with severe influenza: double blind randomised controlled trial [^111JNA2Z]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Human influenza is often considered an acute self limiting febrile illness. Occasionally, however, it is associated with respiratory complications, admission to hospital, and mortality. Clinical trials have shown that treatment with oseltamivir has clinical and virological benefit in patients with uncomplicated influenza when it is administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. Randomised trials in patients with severe influenza are lacking, but observational studies in patients admitted to hospital indicate that oseltamivir treatment, especially if it is given early, is associated with reduced mortality and shorter length of stay, although mortality can still be up to 6% with H1N1-pdm09 (pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza) or seasonal influenza. Timely oseltamivir treatment of patients with avian H5N1 influenza reduces mortality, but many patients die despite treatment.

Higher oseltamivir doses were tested in patients with uncomplicated influenza, but no consistently improved clinical or virological outcomes were found compared with the standard dose. Despite a lack of evidence, several authorities have suggested use of double dose oseltamivir for severe influenza. The use of higher doses has major implications for clinical management, public health, and planning for antiviral stockpiles. The sudden emergence of pandemic H1N1 virus in 2009, the persistent circulation of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses across large regions of the world since 1997, and the recent emergence and spread of avian H7N9 influenza virus in Chinaillustrate the continuing threat of influenza viruses to global health. Improvement of the evidence base for current treatment guidelines of severe influenza is clearly essential for optimal clinical management and pandemic preparedness. Consequently, we conducted a randomised controlled trial to ascertain whether double dose oseltamivir controls viral replication faster and improves clinical outcomes compared with standard dose in patients admitted to hospital with severe influenza.

### Update: influenza activity – United States, September 28, 2014-February 21, 2015 [^1138R71n]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

CDC recommends that antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after illness onset (ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset) for any patient with confirmed or suspected influenza who is hospitalized, has severe, complicated, or progressive illness, or is at high risk for influenza-associated complications, including children aged < 2 years and adults aged ≥ 65 years. However, even when started after 48 hours of illness onset, antiviral treatment might still be beneficial in patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness and in hospitalized patients. Antiviral treatment decisions should not be delayed awaiting laboratory confirmation of influenza.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly and are available at. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available at.

What is already known on this topic?

CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity year-round in the United States. The timing and severity of circulating influenza viruses can vary by geographic location and season.

What is added by this report?

Influenza activity in the United States began to increase in mid-November, remained elevated through February 21, 2015, and is expected to continue for several more weeks. This has been an especially severe season for adults aged ≥ 65 years; this group has the highest recorded influenza-associated hospitalization rate and accounts for the majority of pneumonia and influenza–associated deaths this season. During September 28, 2014–February 21, 2015, influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated. Characterization data indicate that most of the influenza A (H3N2) viruses have antigenically or genetically drifted and are different from the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2014–15 Northern Hemisphere vaccines. The vast majority of currently circulating influenza viruses are sensitive to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Although vaccine effectiveness is reduced this season, influenza vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent influenza illness. Antiviral medications are more important than usual as an adjunct to vaccination in the treatment and prevention of influenza. Early antiviral treatment is recommended for patients with severe, complicated, or progressive influenza illness and those at higher risk for influenza complications, including adults aged ≥ 65 years.

8.2	Lactation

Risk Summary

Based on limited published data, oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been shown to be present in human milk at low levels considered unlikely to lead to toxicity in the breastfed infant. Postmarketing experience has not reported any information to suggest serious adverse effects of oseltamivir exposure via breast milk in infants. It is not known if oseltamivir affects human milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for TAMIFLU and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.

Treatment of Influenza

The safety and efficacy of TAMIFLU for the treatment of influenza in pediatric patients 2 weeks old to 17 years of age has been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)] and is based on:

13 to 17 years of age: Safety and efficacy in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age was supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and adolescents and younger pediatric patients and safety data in adolescents treated with TAMIFLU in a study of treatment and prophylaxis.
1 year to 12 years of age: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age was supported by results of one double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 452 pediatric patients with influenza in whom TAMIFLU 2 mg per kg twice daily or placebo was administered within 48 hours of symptom onset [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Additional safety information was provided in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age with known asthma. Efficacy could not be established in pediatric patients with asthma.
2 weeks to less than 1 year of age: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age is supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and older pediatric patients and two open-label trials of TAMIFLU (2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days) in 136 pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age. In these two trials, the oseltamivir plasma concentrations in these subjects were similar to or higher than the oseltamivir plasma concentrations observed in older pediatric subjects and adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The safety and efficacy of TAMIFLU for treatment of influenza in pediatric patients less than 2 weeks of age have not been established.

- **Neuropsychiatric adverse events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as oseltamivir has been associated with an increased risk of abnormal behavior and delirium.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as oseltamivir has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, ans erythema multiforme.

Treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza A and B in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. (1.1)
Prophylaxis of influenza A and B in patients 1 year and older. (1.2)

Limitations of Use:

Not a substitute for annual influenza vaccination. (1.3)
Consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use. (1.3)
Not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease not undergoing dialysis. (1.3)

1.1 Treatment of Influenza

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are indicated for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated illness due to influenza A and B infection in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours.

1.2 Prophylaxis of Influenza

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are indicated for the prophylaxis of influenza A and B in patients 1 year and older.

1.3 Limitations of Use

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are not a substitute for early influenza vaccination on an annual basis as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Influenza viruses change over time. Emergence of resistance substitutions could decrease drug effectiveness. Other factors (for example, changes in viral virulence) might also diminish clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Prescribers should consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use oseltamivir phosphate capsules [see Microbiology (12.4)].
Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease not undergoing dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Oseltamivir for influenza in adults and children: systematic review of clinical study reports and summary of regulatory comments [^1178SyE7]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Sufficient plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate from orally administered oseltamivir phosphate may act directly on the host's endogenous neuraminidase to reduce (or suppress) the immune response. The potential hypothermic or antipyretic effect of free oseltamivir as a central nervous system depressant may also contribute to the apparent reduction of symptoms.

The apparent duration of effect on symptom relief afforded by oseltamivir is open to question because data on relapse after the five day treatment period were not reported in the clinical study reports. There was a mix-up with follow-up cards in the "pivotal" trials WV15670, WV15671, and WV15730, which does not allow for drawing any conclusions on the durability of symptom relief. This important information came to light from the FDA Summary Basis of Approval papers and not from the clinical study reports of the relevant trials. This points to the incomplete nature of reporting in the clinical study reports and the important role of Summary Basis of Approval information.

Oseltamivir relieves symptoms in otherwise healthy children but has no effect on children with asthma who have influenza-like illness, a population that should most benefit from its intake. An explanation for this finding is in the nature of the young asthmatic population, which is well cared for and used to a regular intake of powerful drugs and close follow-up. The incremental benefit of oseltamivir assumption is thus likely to be undetectable in such a population. Oseltamivir had no significant effect on admissions to hospital, an outcome that is important but poorly defined in the oseltamivir protocols and inconsistently reported in the clinical study reports.

The oseltamivir trials did not detect any influenza related mortality events, a reflection of the benign nature of influenza and influenza-like illness and perhaps trial design. In prophylaxis, oseltamivir prevented influenza symptoms in adults and households. However incomplete reporting of influenza-like illness did not allow us to properly determine the effect of oseltamivir. Its capacity to prevent the laboratory confirmation of symptomatic influenza-like illness may be due to a direct effect on antibodies, symptoms, and infection status of people exposed to the wild agents, but there was no visible effect of oseltamivir on complications or admissions to hospital.

### Oseltamivir treatment for influenza in adults: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116AnA7U]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Despite widespread use, questions remain about the efficacy of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza. We aimed to do an individual patient data meta-analysis for all clinical trials comparing oseltamivir with placebo for treatment of seasonal influenza in adults regarding symptom alleviation, complications, and safety.

Methods

We included all published and unpublished Roche-sponsored randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of 75 mg twice a day oseltamivir in adults. Trials of oseltamivir for treatment of naturally occurring influenza-like illness in adults reporting at least one of the study outcomes were eligible. We also searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register for other relevant trials published before Jan 1, 2014 (search last updated on Nov 27, 2014). We analysed intention-to-treat infected, intention-to-treat, and safety populations. The primary outcome was time to alleviation of all symptoms analysed with accelerated failure time methods. We used risk ratios and Mantel-Haenszel methods to work out complications, admittances to hospital, and safety outcomes.

Findings

We included data from nine trials including 4328 patients. In the intention-to-treat infected population, we noted a 21% shorter time to alleviation of all symptoms for oseltamivir versus placebo recipients (time ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.74–0.85; p < 0.0001). The median times to alleviation were 97.5 h for oseltamivir and 122.7 h for placebo groups (difference -25.2 h, 95% CI -36.2 to -16.0). For the intention-to-treat population, the estimated treatment effect was attenuated (time ratio 0.85) but remained highly significant (median difference -17.8 h). In the intention-to-treat infected population, we noted fewer lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics more than 48 h after randomisation (risk ratio [RR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.42–0.75; p = 0.0001; 4.9% oseltamivir vs 8.7% placebo, risk difference -3.8%, 95% CI -5.0 to -2.2) and also fewer admittances to hospital for any cause (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17–0.81; p = 0.013; 0.6% oseltamivir, 1.7% placebo, risk difference -1.1%, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.3). Regarding safety, oseltamivir increased the risk of nausea (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.29–1.99; p < 0.0001; 9.9% oseltamivir vs 6.2% placebo, risk difference 3.7%, 95% CI 1.8–6.1) and vomiting (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.83–3.23; p < 0.0001; 8.0% oseltamivir vs 3.3% placebo, risk difference 4.7%, 95% CI 2.7–7.3). We recorded no effect on neurological or psychiatric disorders or serious adverse events.

Interpretation

Our findings show that oseltamivir in adults with influenza accelerates time to clinical symptom alleviation, reduces risk of lower respiratory tract complications, and admittance to hospital, but increases the occurrence of nausea and vomiting.

2.5	Preparation and Storage of Constituted TAMIFLU Oral Suspension

Prior to dispensing to the patient, constitute TAMIFLU for oral suspension (supplied as powder):

Tap the closed bottle containing the supplied TAMIFLU white powder several times to loosen the powder.
Measure 55 mL of water in a graduated cylinder.
Add the total amount of water for constitution to the bottle.
Close bottle with child-resistant cap tightly and shake the closed bottle well for 15 seconds.
Label the bottle with instructions to "Shake Well Before Use".
The constituted oral suspension contains 360 mg of oseltamivir base per 60 mL of volume (6 mg per mL) and is white, tutti-frutti–flavored). Use the constituted oral suspension within 17 days of preparation when stored under refrigeration, 2º to 8ºC (36º to 46ºF), or within 10 days if stored at controlled room temperature, 25ºC (77ºF). Write the expiration date of the constituted oral suspension on the bottle label.
Ensure patients have an oral dosing dispenser that measures the appropriate volume in milliliters. Counsel patients on how to utilize the oral dosing dispenser and correctly measure the oral suspension as prescribed (see Tables 1 and 2).

2.6	Emergency Preparation of Oral Suspension from 75 mg TAMIFLU Capsules

The following directions are provided for use only during emergency situations and when FDA-approved, commercially manufactured TAMIFLU for oral suspension is not available from wholesalers or the manufacturer.

The following emergency preparation instructions will provide one patient with enough TAMIFLU for a 5-day course of treatment of influenza or a 10-day course of prophylaxis of influenza:

Step #1: Determine the dosage of TAMIFLU for the patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)] then determine the total volume of oral suspension needed to be prepared (see Table 3).

Step #2: Preparation must be performed with only one of the following vehicles (other vehicles have not been studied): Cherry Syrup (Humco®), Ora-Sweet®SF (sugar-free) (Paddock Laboratories), or simple syrup. Determine the number of capsules and the amount of water and vehicle needed to prepare the total volume (see Table 3) of prepared oral suspension (6 mg per mL) for a complete treatment or prophylaxis course (see Table 4).

### Oseltamivir phosphate (oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension) [^111Jw84R]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts (aged 13 years or older) of an index influenza case, oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg once daily or placebo taken orally was administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms in the index case and continued for 7 days (index cases did not receive oseltamivir phosphate treatment). The incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was 12% (24/200) in the placebo-treated subjects compared to 1% (2/205) in the oseltamivir phosphate-treated subjects.

Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)

The efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness was demonstrated in a randomized, open-label post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts that included pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years, both as index cases and as family contacts. All index cases in this trial received oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension 30 mg to 60 mg taken orally once daily for 10 days. The efficacy parameter was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in the household. Laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was defined as meeting all of the following criteria:

oral temperature at least 100°F (37.8ºC),
cough and/or coryza recorded within 48 hours, and
either a positive virus isolation or a four-fold or greater increase in virus antibody titers from baseline or at illness visits.

What treatments are available for influenza?

Influenza is usually self limiting in healthy individuals. Treatment of uncomplicated disease in healthy individuals is supportive and includes antipyretics, adequate fluid intake, rest, and staying off work or school until 24 hours after resolution of fever to limit spread to others.

Most randomised trials of antiviral drugs have been conducted among otherwise healthy individuals and have shown modest reductions in symptom duration (0.7 days). Fewer studies have been conducted among individuals at risk of complicated influenza. Data from observational studies and trials suggests that antiviral treatment may reduce adverse outcomes. For example, the meta-analysis from 2015 reported fewer lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics after oseltamivir treatment compared with placebo (risk difference −3.8%) and fewer hospital admissions (risk difference −1.1%).NICE, Public Health England, UK Chief Medical Officers, and the WHOrecommend treatment of suspected and confirmed influenza for individuals at risk of complicated influenza (box 1). General practitioners considering prescription of antivirals should discuss with patients likely benefits, as well as possible harms including nausea (number treated to cause nausea in one patient = 28)and vomiting (number treated to cause vomiting in one patient = 22).

Individuals with complicated influenza may be helped by antiviral treatment. Treatment is most effective if started within 48 hours of symptom onset, and it should not be delayed while awaiting results of investigations. Neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir inhibit viral release from infected cells and reduce the rate of viral replication. Meta-analysis of individual participant data found that, compared with late treatment, early treatment (within 48 hours of symptom onset) of hospitalised individuals with complicated influenza reduced the odds of mortality by 52%. Some individuals may require antibiotic therapy to treat secondary bacterial infections.

### Update: influenza activity-United States, October 1, 2017-February 3, 2018 [^116WvsNH]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

With several more weeks of elevated influenza activity anticipated this season, it is too early to assess overall severity of the season. However, estimates of the burden of influenza disease from the 2012–13 and 2014–15 seasons provide an indication of what might be anticipated for the 2017–18 season. CDC estimated that during each of those seasons influenza accounted for as many as 35.6 million illnesses, 16.6 million medically attended visits, 710,000 hospitalizations and 56,000 deaths.

Interim estimates of 2017–18 season vaccine effectiveness (VE) against influenza A and influenza B virus infection associated with medically attended acute respiratory illness in the United States was 36% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27%–44%). VE was estimated to be 25% (95% CI = 13%–36%) against illness caused by influenza A(H3N2) virus, 67% (95% CI = 54%–76%) against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and 42% (95% CI = 25%–56%) against influenza B virus. During the 2014–15 season, an A(H3N2) virus–predominant season with high severity and low vaccine effectiveness, influenza vaccine was estimated to have prevented millions of illnesses and tens of thousands of influenza-related hospitalizations. With several more weeks of elevated influenza activity expected, an increasing proportion of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses, and the potential to prevent significant illness through influenza vaccination, CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination at this time.

During influenza seasons with increased severity, influenza antiviral medications are an increasingly important adjunct to vaccination in the treatment of influenza. Three neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications are approved and recommended for use in the United States during the 2017–18 influenza season: oral oseltamivir (available as a generic or under the trade name Tamiflu [Genentech, South San Francisco, California]), inhaled zanamivir (Relenza [GlaxoSmithKline, London, England]) and intravenous peramivir (Rapivab [Seqirus, Summit, New Jersey]). Resistance to these medications is not a concern at this time because only four influenza viruses (all A[H1N1]pdm09 viruses) collected in the United States since October 1, 2017, were identified as not being sensitive to oseltamivir and peramivir.

2.3	Recommended Dosage for Prophylaxis of Influenza

Initiate post‐exposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate within 48 hours following close contact with an infected individual. Initiate seasonal prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate during a community outbreak.

Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older)

The recommended dosage of oseltamivir phosphate for prophylaxis of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg orally once daily (one 75 mg capsule once daily) for at least 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak. In immunocompromised patients, oseltamivir phosphate may be continued for up to 12 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.9)]. The duration of protection lasts for as long as oseltamivir phosphate dosing is continued.

Pediatric Patients (1 year to 12 years of age)

### Oseltamivir plus usual care versus usual care for influenza-like illness in primary care: an open-label, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial [^113HzWgj]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Antivirals are infrequently prescribed in European primary care for influenza-like illness, mostly because of perceived ineffectiveness in real world primary care and because individuals who will especially benefit have not been identified in independent trials. We aimed to determine whether adding antiviral treatment to usual primary care for patients with influenza-like illness reduces time to recovery overall and in key subgroups.

Methods

We did an open-label, pragmatic, adaptive, randomised controlled trial of adding oseltamivir to usual care in patients aged 1 year and older presenting with influenza-like illness in primary care. The primary endpoint was time to recovery, defined as return to usual activities, with fever, headache, and muscle ache minor or absent. The trial was designed and powered to assess oseltamivir benefit overall and in 36 prespecified subgroups defined by age, comorbidity, previous symptom duration, and symptom severity, using a Bayesian piece-wise exponential primary analysis model. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, number ISRCTN 27908921.

Findings

Between Jan 15, 2016, and April 12, 2018, we recruited 3266 participants in 15 European countries during three seasonal influenza seasons, allocated 1629 to usual care plus oseltamivir and 1637 to usual care, and ascertained the primary outcome in 1533 (94%) and 1526 (93%). 1590 (52%) of 3059 participants had PCR-confirmed influenza infection. Time to recovery was shorter in participants randomly assigned to oseltamivir (hazard ratio 1.29, 95% Bayesian credible interval [BCrI] 1.20–1.39) overall and in 30 of the 36 prespecified subgroups, with estimated hazard ratios ranging from 1.13 to 1.72. The estimated absolute mean benefit from oseltamivir was 1.02 days (95% [BCrI] 0.74–1.31) overall, and in the prespecified subgroups, ranged from 0.70 (95% BCrI 0.30–1.20) in patients younger than 12 years, with less severe symptoms, no comorbidities, and shorter previous illness duration to 3.20 (95% BCrI 1.00–5.50) in patients aged 65 years or older who had more severe illness, comorbidities, and longer previous illness duration. Regarding harms, an increased burden of vomiting or nausea was observed in the oseltamivir group.

Interpretation

Primary care patients with influenza-like illness treated with oseltamivir recovered one day sooner on average than those managed by usual care alone. Older, sicker patients with comorbidities and longer previous symptom duration recovered 2–3 days sooner.

### Efficacy of oseltamivir treatment started within 5 days of symptom onset to reduce influenza illness duration and virus shedding in an urban setting in Bangladesh: a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^115Cp6z7]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Influenza causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Few data exist for the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors, which are the only readily available influenza treatment options, especially in low-income settings. We assessed the efficacy of treatment with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir to reduce patient illness and viral shedding in people with influenza, in whom treatment was started within 5 days of symptom onset, in an urban setting in Bangladesh.

Methods

We undertook a double-blind, randomised, controlled trial between May, 2008, and December, 2010. Patients with a positive rapid influenza test identified by surveillance of households in Kamalapur, Bangladesh were randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to receive oseltamivir or placebo twice daily for 5 days. Randomisation lists for individuals enrolled less than 48 h and 48 h or longer since illness onset were generated with permuted blocks of variable length between two and eight. Participants and study staff were masked to treatment group. Participants provided nasal wash specimens at enrolment and 2, 4, and 7 days later, and were visited daily to record symptoms. All specimens were tested for influenza with reverse-transcriptase PCR, and if the result was positive, we isolated the virus. The primary endpoints were duration of clinical illness and viral shedding in patients treated less than and more than 48 h since illness onset and the frequency of oseltamivir resistance during treatment. Analyses were intention to treat unless otherwise specified. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00707941.

Findings

Overall, 1190 people with a median age of 5 years (IQR 2–9) were enrolled: 794 (67%) less than 48 h since symptom onset and 396 (33%) 48 h or longer since symptom onset. 592 participants were assigned to placebo and 598 to oseltamivir. The median duration of symptoms was shorter in the oseltamivir group (3 days, IQR 1–5) than in the placebo group (4 days, 1–6; p = 0.01). When stratified by timing of treatment initiation, in participants enrolled 48 h or longer since illness onset, the median duration of symptoms was similar in both groups (oseltamivir 3 days [IQR 2–5], placebo 3 days [1–5]; p = 0.04). The median duration of symptoms was reduced by 1 day in the group given oseltamivir who were enrolled less than 48 h since symptom onset compared with those given placebo, but this difference was not significant. In those with all swab specimens (n = 1134), oseltamivir significantly reduced virus isolation on days 2 (placebo 374 [66%] vs oseltamivir 321 [56%]; difference 15.2%, 95% CI 9.5–20.8, p = 0.0004), 4 (241 [43%] vs 174 [30%]; difference 30.2%, 95% CI 24.6–35.8, p < 0.0001), and 7 (68 [12%] vs 36 [6%]; difference 47.5%, 95% CI 44.2–50.8, p = 0.0009). In participants enrolled 48 h or longer since illness onset, oseltamivir treatment significantly reduced virus isolation on days 2 and 4, but not day 7. In participants enrolled less than 48 h since illness onset, oseltamivir treatment significantly reduced virus isolation on days 2, 4, and 7. The emergency of resistance to oseltamivir during treatment was rare overall (< 1%) and in influenza A H1N1pdm09 viruses (3.9%).

Interpretation

Oseltamivir treatment resulted in a modest reduction in the duration of symptoms and virus shedding in people with uncomplicated influenza infections, even when treatment was started 48 h or longer after illness onset.
