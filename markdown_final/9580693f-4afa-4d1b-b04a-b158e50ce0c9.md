## Question

Diff dx of foreign body sensation in esophagus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of "foreign body sensation" in the esophagus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history and exam to separate benign globus from true obstruction. Then, I should verify red flags that mandate urgent testing or intervention. Next, I will review imaging choices and their test characteristics. After that, I need to examine endoscopic timing and techniques. Finally, I will consider functional testing and the broader differential, including structural, inflammatory, and motility causes, with special attention to eosinophilic esophagitis and complications that change urgency thresholds [^111P6FRK] [^113ED8S8] [^111WCJL5] [^115twbAs] [^115GWqvF].

> Let me first confirm the core elements of history taking, because that will anchor triage and testing; I should elicit onset and circumstances (witnessed ingestion versus spontaneous), the quality of the sensation (lump versus painful blockage), and associated symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, chest or neck pain, drooling, and inability to handle secretions, while also checking for respiratory symptoms like stridor or wheeze that might hint at airway compromise or extrinsic compression, and risk factors such as extremes of age, intoxication, cognitive impairment, psychiatric disease, or developmental disability; importantly, I need to ask about the suspected object type (sharp fish or chicken bones, coins, batteries, dentures, food bolus) because that immediately alters risk and timing of intervention [^111P6FRK] [^113ED8S8] [^111WCJL5] [^112v44LY] [^1173Mhq7] [^111LYdTS].

> Wait, let me verify the key exam priorities — general appearance, vital signs, airway status, oral cavity and neck exam for crepitus or tenderness suggesting perforation, and signs of sepsis; I should confirm if there are alarm features warranting immediate workup: pain, weight loss, dysphagia or odynophagia, and especially complete esophageal obstruction marked by inability to tolerate secretions, which requires emergent endoscopic intervention within 2–6 hours, whereas other esophageal foreign bodies should be addressed within 24 hours to mitigate complications [^113ED8S8] [^115twbAs] [^115GWqvF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about globus; I need to check the characteristic pattern — globus is a non-painful tightness or lump sensation often improving during meals, with preserved swallowing and frequently negative objective testing, so it is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out laryngopharyngeal, thyroid, and esophageal disease via appropriate targeted evaluation, and I should remember that globus often associates with reflux, oropharyngeal hypersensitivity, or psychiatric comorbidity, though causation can be difficult to establish [^113ED8S8] [^111rwSPH].

> Conversely, features suggesting a true foreign body or impaction include abrupt onset after eating or a discrete event, progressive or focal pain, odynophagia, drooling, and inability to swallow saliva; button batteries and sharp objects drive urgency due to caustic injury or perforation risk (sharp-pointed objects up to 35% risk), and I should double-check that chest pain alone does not mislead toward cardiac causes before considering an obstructing or penetrating esophageal source [^111LYdTS] [^115GWqvF] [^116Qdh1m] [^113NjFDj] [^116LGGUk].

> But wait, what if the presentation is a red herring; respiratory symptoms such as stridor or wheeze can occur from proximal esophageal compression and may be misattributed to primary airway disease, chest pain can masquerade as cardiac ischemia, and sharp bones may migrate entirely through the esophageal wall such that repeat endoscopy appears "negative", or the object may actually lodge at the glottis rather than in the esophagus — so I should verify location carefully with imaging and thorough endoscopic inspection of the upper aerodigestive tract when suspicion remains high [^113Jt4iX] [^116LGGUk] [^111fNJcp] [^1117GTLc].

> Next, I should review radiologic strategy; plain radiographs (neck, chest, abdomen) are reasonable first-line for suspected radiopaque objects with biplanar views helping distinguish airway from esophagus, but I must remember their limitations, including high false-negative rates for radiolucent materials and low sensitivity for fish bones; when X-ray is negative but suspicion persists, or when complications like perforation are suspected, CT provides markedly higher sensitivity and specificity and delineates extraluminal complications, while barium swallow should be avoided acutely due to aspiration risk and interference with endoscopy; digital tomosynthesis may have a niche role in pediatrics for radiolucent FBs [^112jHiY7] [^116Qdh1m] [^116T4zey] [^115UugNu] [^111Gwok1] [^114Kq1CW].

> Hmm, wait a minute — should flexible laryngoscopy alone exclude an esophageal FB; I should confirm that FFL has poor sensitivity and cannot reliably rule out esophageal location, whereas CT meaningfully outperforms X-ray for detection and triage, so a negative laryngoscopy should not reassure me if clinical suspicion remains high, particularly for fish bones and thin, radiolucent objects [^114Kq1CW] [^116Qdh1m].

> I will now examine endoscopic management; upper endoscopy offers both diagnosis and therapy, with emergent intervention within 2–6 hours for complete obstruction, sharp objects, and button batteries, and urgent intervention within 24 hours for other esophageal foreign bodies or persistent food impaction; advanced approaches such as endoscopic ultrasound can localize embedded objects, video-mediastinoscopy may facilitate proximal sharp extractions, and transnasal esophagoscopy can aid rapid evaluation in selected settings; technique choices for food bolus include gentle push or en bloc/piecemeal extraction per operator judgment and safety [^115twbAs] [^115GWqvF] [^113XacB8] [^115bvF7F] [^113LfcFP] [^112uELC4] [^115AHHWg].

> I need to ensure I do not overuse contrast studies; I briefly thought a barium swallow might help in subtle impactions, but wait, I should verify guideline advice — barium is not recommended in acute suspected foreign body because of aspiration risk and impaired endoscopic visualization, so CT or direct endoscopy should take precedence when suspicion is significant [^115UugNu].

> For patients with ongoing symptoms but negative endoscopy for foreign body, I should double-check for functional and motility etiologies; high-resolution manometry detects abnormalities in a majority of globus patients compared with other modalities, pH testing can reveal reflux phenotypes, and videofluoroscopy is often normal, so the sequence after excluding dangerous causes is targeted toward HRM and reflux assessment if symptoms persist or are atypical, with manometry remaining the gold standard for major motility disorders [^111fgvRd] [^112j9zS4].

> Let me consider the broader differential systematically; beyond true foreign body and functional globus, structural causes include peptic or radiation strictures, Schatzki ring, webs, Zenker diverticulum, diverticula, and extrinsic compression such as an aberrant right subclavian artery; inflammatory causes include reflux and infectious esophagitis in immunocompromised hosts; motility disorders include achalasia and spasm; neuromuscular and central etiologies drive oropharyngeal dysphagia; and psychiatric comorbidity can amplify globus, so careful history narrows this field before testing is pursued [^114rYBVu] [^1173Mhq7] [^114q2XBF] [^111JgPvG] [^116qiid3] [^113LqLSq] [^111rwSPH].

> I should confirm a special focus on eosinophilic esophagitis because it is commonly unmasked by food impaction; biopsies during removal of food bolus or suspected EoE are recommended by guidelines, and pediatric data show that a nontrivial proportion of children with prior esophageal foreign body events later prove to have EoE, with typical features including older pediatric age, male sex, atopy, recurrent dysphagia or impactions, and endoscopic abnormalities — so missing EoE risks recurrent events unless diet and anti-inflammatory therapy are instituted [^115RyUU5] [^114czBGv] [^115rCEYU].

> Next, I should review timing and safety nuances; complete obstruction, sharp points, and button batteries mandate emergent removal due to aspiration, perforation, and caustic/electrical injury risks; by contrast, some blunt objects such as coins may be observed briefly in asymptomatic patients with planned removal if passage fails within 24 hours, but I must accurately distinguish coins from button batteries on imaging because delays with batteries cause devastating injury and radiographic differentiation is imperfect even with digital techniques, so a low threshold for emergent action is warranted when doubt remains [^115twbAs] [^115GWqvF] [^1156n9jG] [^113AafdE] [^11515M8V].

> Hold on, I should verify complication risks and the impact of delay; prolonged retention and elevated inflammatory markers correlate with major complications including perforation, mediastinitis, and need for surgical retrieval, and while most foreign bodies pass or are removed endoscopically, some chronic or large retained objects ultimately require thoracic surgery, underscoring the need for timely diagnosis and extraction when alarm features are present [^111FLCnZ] [^113onfDJ] [^1168W4Rv].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic pathway: start with careful history and focused exam to separate probable globus from likely impaction, identify red flags, and define the suspected object; obtain biplanar radiographs for radiopaque or unknown objects but pivot early to CT when X-ray is negative yet suspicion persists or complications are suspected; proceed to emergent or urgent endoscopy per risk category, ensuring airway protection; if endoscopy is negative and symptoms persist without alarms, pursue HRM and reflux testing for functional or motility disorders; and throughout, maintain vigilance for EoE with biopsies during food impaction management to prevent recurrence and missed diagnosis [^111P6FRK] [^112jHiY7] [^116Qdh1m] [^115twbAs] [^111fgvRd] [^115RyUU5].

Foreign body sensation in the esophagus has a broad differential, including **true foreign bodies** (coins, bones, dentures, batteries, magnets, food bolus), **structural lesions** [^112DobUW] (strictures, rings, webs, tumors, diverticula), **motility disorders** (achalasia, spasm, scleroderma) [^112aNc7Z], **inflammatory/infectious causes** (EoE, GERD, esophagitis) [^114rYBVu], and **functional/psychogenic disorders** (globus, anxiety) [^111ptpcU]. Evaluation should start with history and exam [^113q2ipT], then use **plain radiographs** [^112jHiY7] for radiopaque objects, **CT** for radiolucent or complicated cases [^116Qdh1m], and **endoscopy** for diagnosis and therapy [^115UugNu]. Management is guided by the cause, with urgent endoscopy for high-risk objects [^115GWqvF] and tailored therapy for structural, motility [^112aNc7Z], inflammatory, or functional etiologies [^111ptpcU].

---

## True foreign bodies

- **Coins**: Common in children; usually radiopaque and easily identified on plain radiographs [^11515M8V].
- **Bones**: Fish or chicken bones are common in adults; often radiolucent and may require CT for detection [^114Kq1CW].
- **Dentures**: Common in elderly; radiolucent and difficult to detect on plain films [^1165JTyp].
- **Batteries**: Button batteries are emergencies due to rapid mucosal injury; require immediate removal [^115GWqvF].
- **Magnets**: Multiple magnets can cause pressure necrosis and perforation; urgent removal indicated [^115GWqvF].
- **Food bolus**: Commonly meat; associated with underlying esophageal pathology such as strictures or eosinophilic esophagitis [^115RyUU5].

---

## Structural lesions

Structural lesions include **esophageal strictures** [^112DobUW] — benign (peptic, caustic, radiation-induced) or malignant — that cause progressive dysphagia and a foreign-body sensation. Esophageal rings and webs, such as a **Schatzki ring** or those seen in Plummer-Vinson syndrome, typically cause intermittent dysphagia and a foreign-body sensation [^111P6FRK]. Esophageal tumors may be benign (**leiomyoma**) or malignant (**adenocarcinoma**, **squamous cell carcinoma**) and usually present with progressive symptoms. Esophageal diverticula, including **Zenker's** and **epiphrenic diverticula**, are associated with regurgitation and halitosis.

---

## Motility disorders

Motility disorders include **achalasia**, defined by impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation with progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids [^116qiid3]. Diffuse esophageal spasm causes intermittent dysphagia and chest pain, whereas scleroderma results in esophageal dysmotility due to smooth-muscle atrophy and fibrosis [^112aNc7Z].

---

## Inflammatory and infectious causes

Inflammatory and infectious causes include **eosinophilic esophagitis** [^114rYBVu], an allergic condition common in younger patients with an atopic history that causes rings and strictures. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (**GERD**) leads to chronic reflux with **esophagitis** and **stricture formation** [^111P6FRK]. Infectious esophagitis due to **Candida**, **herpes simplex virus**, or **cytomegalovirus** is common in immunocompromised patients [^112Jv4bF].

---

## Functional and psychogenic disorders

Within functional and psychogenic disorders, **Globus sensation** [^111ptpcU] is a persistent sensation of a lump or foreign body without structural abnormality and is often associated with anxiety or stress. Functional esophageal disorders encompass **functional dysphagia** or **hypersensitivity** and are diagnosed by exclusion.

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **History and physical examination**: Essential to differentiate true foreign body ingestion from other causes [^113q2ipT].
- **Plain radiographs**: Initial imaging for suspected radiopaque foreign bodies (coins, batteries, metals) [^112jHiY7].
- **Computed tomography (CT)**: High sensitivity for radiolucent foreign bodies and complications (perforation, abscess) [^114Kq1CW].
- **Endoscopy**: Gold standard for diagnosis and removal of foreign bodies; also identifies structural lesions and allows biopsy [^113q2ipT].

---

## Management strategies

- **True foreign bodies**: Emergent endoscopic removal for batteries, magnets, sharp objects, and complete obstructions; urgent removal within 24 hours for other objects [^115twbAs].
- **Structural lesions**: Endoscopic dilation, surgical intervention, or oncologic treatment depending on etiology [^111P6FRK].
- **Motility disorders**: Medical therapy (calcium channel blockers, nitrates), botulinum toxin injection, or surgical myotomy [^116qiid3].
- **Inflammatory/infectious causes**: Medical management with proton pump inhibitors, corticosteroids, or antifungal/antiviral therapy [^112Jv4bF].
- **Functional disorders**: Reassurance, behavioral therapy, and neuromodulators [^111ptpcU].

---

Foreign body sensation in the esophagus has a broad differential, including true foreign bodies, structural lesions, motility disorders, inflammatory/infectious causes, and functional/psychogenic disorders. A **structured diagnostic approach** and targeted management are essential for effective treatment [^115yiHSc].

### ESNM/ANMS review. Diagnosis and management of globus sensation: A clinical challenge [^113ED8S8]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Low credibility.

Globus is a non-painful sensation of tightness or a lump/foreign body in the throat that is not associated with dysphagia and may actually improve during meals. While several otorhinolaryngologic, thyroid, and esophageal disorders have been linked to globus, cause-and-effect relationships are difficult to establish. Consequently, though part of the evaluation, objective otorhinolaryngologic and esophageal testing is often negative.

The presence of alarm symptoms — particularly pain, weight loss, dysphagia, or odynophagia — is an indication for objective testing. A diagnosis of idiopathic globus requires exclusion of pharyngeal, laryngeal, and esophageal disorders using laryngoscopy, endoscopy, high-resolution manometry, barium radiography, and/or ambulatory reflux monitoring. A trial of acid-suppressive therapy may be reasonable in the absence of alarm symptoms, especially if concurrent reflux symptoms are identified.

Ablation of heterotopic gastric mucosa in the proximal esophagus has been reported to improve globus symptoms. Beyond these specific approaches, further management of idiopathic globus consists of reassurance, neuromodulators, and complementary approaches. Globus has a benign course with no long-term consequences, and the overall prognosis is good as the magnitude of symptoms may decline over time.

### Aberrant right subclavian artery: Suggested mechanism for esophageal foreign body impaction: Case report [^1173Mhq7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In normal embryologic development, the subclavian arteries originate from the seventh intersegment arteries. The distal segment of the right dorsal aorta degenerates, and the right seventh intersegment artery becomes confluent with the right fourth arch.

In the anomaly of an aberrant right subclavian artery, abnormal development results from degeneration of the entire right fourth arch. The right seventh intersegment artery persists in its attachment to the distal descending aorta. In 80% of cases, it crosses between the esophagus and the vertebral column, in 15% of cases it runs between the esophagus and the trachea, and in 5% of cases it passes anterior to both the trachea and esophagus.

An aberrant right subclavian artery in the adult patient usually presents with dysphagia. Symptoms are primarily associated with solid food and include regurgitation, postprandial bloating, or chest pain. We could not find reports of ARSA resulting in esophageal foreign body impaction in adults.

The esophagus has three areas of narrowing where foreign bodies are most likely to become entrapped: the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), which consists of the cricopharyngeus muscle; the crossover of the aorta; and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Ingestion of foreign bodies is much more common in children than in adults. Considering the fact that most patients harboring an aberrant right subclavian artery are asymptomatic throughout their lifetime, the association between these two entities could be incidental.

In adults, the incidence of foreign body ingestion is rare.

### Migration of ingested sharp foreign body into the bronchus: A case report and review of the literature [^111LYdTS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Foreign body ingestion is a common emergency in gastroenterology. Foreign bodies are most likely to be embedded in the esophagus. The sharp ones may penetrate the esophageal wall and lead to serious complications.

- **Case presentation**: A 72-year-old Chinese female was admitted to our hospital with a 4-day history of retrosternal pain and a growing cough after eating fish. A chest computed tomography scan indicated that a high-density foreign body (a fish bone) penetrated through the esophageal wall and inserted into the left main bronchus. We first used a rigid esophagoscope to explore the esophagus under general anesthesia. However, the foreign body was invisible in the side of the esophagus. Then, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed. We divided the fish bone, which traversed the left main bronchus, into two segments under a holmium laser and removed the foreign body successfully. The operation time was short, and there were no complications. The patient was discharged 1 week postoperatively and was symptom-free even under a liquid diet.

- **Conclusions**: There are several challenges in the management of this rare condition. We applied the technique of interventional bronchoscopy to manage the esophageal foreign body flexibly in an emergency. A surgery was avoided, which was more invasive and costly.

### Esophageal emergencies: WSES guidelines [^116LiMAg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The esophagus traverses three body compartments — neck, thorax, and abdomen — and is surrounded at each level by vital organs. Injuries to the esophagus may be classified as foreign body ingestion, caustic ingestion, esophageal perforation, and esophageal trauma. These lesions can be life-threatening either by digestive contamination of surrounding structures in case of an esophageal wall breach or concomitant damage to surrounding organs. Early diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention are the keys to successful management.

### Value of helical computed tomography in the early diagnosis of esophageal foreign bodies in adults [^116T4zey]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

To investigate the relationship between the early use of computed tomography (CT) and complications associated with esophageal foreign body impaction in adults, a retrospective study was performed on 120 patients (63 females, 57 males, median age 50 years) with a history of foreign bodies. All had negative findings on clinical examination and underwent unenhanced helical CT. Patients with positive findings underwent esophagoscopy within 6 hours, and all were followed up postoperatively.

CT demonstrated a 100% sensitivity, 92.6% specificity, 100% negative predictive value, and 97.9% positive predictive value. Esophageal foreign bodies were associated with a high incidence of complications in adults, with a significant difference in the incidence of complications between different durations of impaction (P < .01). In total, 37 patients presented with complications: 32 patients with grade I, 3 with grade II, 2 with grade III, and 0 with grade IV.

The study concluded that esophageal foreign bodies were associated with a high incidence of complications in adults. CT could detect foreign bodies accurately in the early stages, allowing for early removal and potentially reducing the incidence of complications. Moreover, the majority of complications were of lower grades. Thus, CT may be a useful first-line radiological tool for the early diagnosis of esophageal foreign bodies in adults.

### Esophageal foreign body: A case of a neonate with stridor [^113Jt4iX]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

We present a case of a 7-week-old female with a 3-week history of progressively worsening stridor who was admitted to rule out a congenital anomaly in the airway or vasculature. After three different imaging modalities, we discovered an esophageal foreign body causing esophagitis and proximal airway compression. Young infants with symptoms of stridor, wheezing, or retractions will often have a common diagnosis, such as a viral infectious etiology or, in rarer cases, an anatomic anomaly. This case illustrates that the presence of a foreign body must still remain on the differential, even in this age group.

### Catch me if you can: Migrating oesophageal foreign body [^111fNJcp]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Foreign bodies of the cervical oesophagus are a common reason for presentations to the emergency department. In rare instances, the foreign body may move completely through the oesophageal lumen, such that it is unable to be visualized during endoscopy. Subsequent imaging may show the foreign body within the cervical soft tissue. This rare complication is known as a migrating oesophageal foreign body. We present the case of a 56-year-old woman who accidentally ingested a wire which became lodged in the proximal oesophagus. Subsequent to initial imaging, the wire migrated completely through the oesophageal lumen, such that it was unable to be visualized during endoscopy, ultimately requiring open neck exploration for removal.

### Unusual foreign body, a spoon, in the esophagus of a middle-aged female: A case report and review of the literature [^111MEGEi]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Low credibility.

In adults, a large metal foreign body in the esophagus is rarely seen and is usually caused accidentally. Here, we describe an unusual case of a foreign body (spoon) in the esophagus of an adult patient. A 48-year-old woman initially presented to the emergency department with marked dysphagia, drooling, and radiating pain to the chest. She had swallowed a spoon while trying to vomit due to feeling sick. Radiological images revealed a spoon stuck in the esophagus. The edge of the spoon was grabbed with forceps and safely extracted under hypnic anesthesia. No esophageal perforation was detected upon evaluation with esophagography using Gastrografin the next day. This case highlights an unusual situation in an adult patient, showing a long nonfood-type foreign body in the esophagus. It is important that an appropriate workup and removal of the foreign body is performed according to its location and type.

### Hide and seek: A case of almost missed ingested foreign body [^1117GTLc]. Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

A 33-year-old female was referred to our hospital requiring endoscopic removal of an ingested foreign body. She had swallowed a fishbone the day prior and was experiencing a persistent foreign body sensation in the esophagus. Computed tomography revealed a high-density shadow approximately 2 cm in length located at the level of the esophageal entranceway (Fig. 1). Consequently, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed. However, no foreign object or wound was found in the upper gastrointestinal tract after repeated inspection (Fig. 2).

Thus, the foreign body was considered to have been discharged into the middle/lower digestive tract, and the removal attempt was abandoned. Nevertheless, careful observation continued until the endoscope was withdrawn from the mouth. Suddenly, and quite unexpectedly, a thin and transparent fishbone was discovered inserted in the glottis and parallel with the left vocal cord (Fig. 3). Immediate foreign body removal was performed to prevent its displacement (Fig. 4). The fishbone was successfully removed using biopsy forceps (Video 1 and Fig. 5). Specific foreign body forceps were not utilized because the foreign body was too thin to be firmly clamped.

### Esophageal manometry, pH testing, endoscopy, and videofluoroscopy in patients with globus sensation [^111fgvRd]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Low credibility.

The study's objectives were to combine techniques commonly employed in the clinical workup of patients with isolated globus sensation to identify the most common pharyngoesophageal abnormality. The primary aim was to retrospectively review high-resolution manometry, pH probe testing, contrast videofluoroscopy, and endoscopy studies in patients with a primary complaint of globus sensation, with the specific hypothesis being that esophageal high-resolution manometry identifies the most significant proportion of abnormalities compared to all other modalities.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Methods**: An inclusive retrospective chart review was performed for patients evaluated between 2009 and 2016 with the primary complaint of globus sensation. Age at testing, self-identified gender, associated diagnoses, and results from each modality were collected. Descriptive statistics and pairwise comparisons were performed as well as sensitivity and specificity calculations.

- **Results**: One hundred seventy-two patients met the inclusion criteria. The cohort had an age range of 22.7 to 88.5 years and was predominantly female. Esophageal manometry identified abnormalities in 62.8% of patients, and pH testing identified abnormal acidification in approximately 20% of patients. The esophagram identified abnormalities in 24% of patients, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy identified abnormalities in 22%. Modified barium swallows were normal in 93% of patients. Measures of sensitivity and specificity of other modalities were poor compared to esophageal manometry and pH testing.

### Esophageal emergencies: Another important cause of acute chest pain [^113NjFDj]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with foreign body (FB) ingestions and food bolus impactions can present with retrosternal pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia. The CT appearance of various foreign bodies depends on the composition of the ingested product. Large radiopaque materials, such as batteries and metal, can be easily identified on radiograph and CT. However, awareness of medical devices, such as transesophageal voice prostheses, is required to avoid confusing them with abnormal FBs.

Although 80–90% of ingested foreign bodies can pass spontaneously, endoscopic intervention is needed in 10–20% of patients. According to clinical guidelines from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, emergent therapeutic endoscopic intervention (within 2–6 hours) is indicated for:

- **Complete esophageal obstruction**: Results in an inability to tolerate secretions.
- **Sharp-pointed objects and disk batteries**: Due to the increased risk of perforation, mucosal damage, and bleeding.

Retrospective studies have shown that delayed therapeutic endoscopy, greater than one day, in patients with sharp foreign body impactions, results in increased complications, especially among the elderly. Urgent endoscopic intervention (within 24 hours) is indicated for partial esophageal obstruction. Emergent surgical intervention is required in patients with esophageal perforation or failed endoscopic retrieval.

### Foreign body retained in the esophagus for more than a decade: Thoracic esophagotomy for retrieval [^1166mgvs]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

A foreign body (FB) lodged in the esophagus is not uncommon. Although endoscopic removal is successful in the majority of cases, it could prove to be difficult in those whose foreign bodies are large or have been incarcerated for a long time. We describe the case of a 23-year-old woman who had a FB in her esophagus for at least 13 years. She became symptomatic 2 years before presentation but sought treatment when dysphagia to both solids and liquids developed. Endoscopic retrieval of the incarcerated FB was unsuccessful, and she eventually required thoracotomy and esophagotomy for its extraction.

### Foreign bodies in the esophagus [^113onfDJ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

One third of foreign bodies retained in the gastrointestinal tract are present in the esophagus. Their management depends on the anatomic location, shape and size of the foreign body, and duration of impaction.

- **Methods**: Between 1971 and 2001, 32 patients with foreign bodies in the esophagus were admitted to our service in the Wolfson Medical Center. Their charts were reviewed for preoperative diagnosis, kind and location of foreign body, length of retention, management of patients, complications, and length of hospitalization.

- **Results**: One patient was admitted with perforation of the esophagus. Thirty of the foreign bodies have been extracted at rigid esophagoscopy and two at thoracotomy. There was one complication (tear of esophageal mucosa) and one death.

- **Conclusions**: The presence of a foreign body in the esophagus is a challenging problem. Perforations may result in death. Impaction mandates immediate extraction. Our experience indicates that the use of a rigid esophagoscope is safe and reliable. Based on this experience and that of other authors, we recommend the use of the rigid endoscope as the instrument of choice for extracting foreign bodies from the esophagus. Surgeons in training should be taught rigid esophagoscopy.

### Esophageal emergencies: Another important cause of acute chest pain [^114roZ2s]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

- **Normal radiographic appearance of the esophagus**: The computed tomography (CT) is an excellent first-line imaging modality for evaluating the esophagus in the emergent setting. It is fast, readily available, and offers the highest spatial resolution for assessing the extent of esophageal injuries and the surrounding mediastinum. The esophagus is partially visualized on the neck, abdomen, and thoracic spine CT, while the thoracic esophagus is fully identified on chest CT. Although the administration of oral contrast in the acute setting is not standardized practice, it can potentially elucidate esophageal wall injury with the presence of extraluminal contrast material. If suspicion of esophageal pathology is raised on an initial unenhanced study, a CT esophagography can be performed in patients too sick for fluoroscopic evaluation. In this setting, CT from the thoracic inlet to the diaphragm can be performed after quickly administering an approximately 50 mL solution containing 10% intravenous iodinated contrast material, water, and effervescent granules.

- **Esophageal wall thickness**: The normal esophageal wall thickness on CT varies depending on anatomical location, degree of distension, and sex and ranges from 1.9 to 5.68 mm, with the thickest area in the abdominal esophagus during contraction. While the esophagus is decompressed in the majority of studies, a normal air column can measure up to 10 mm in transverse dimension and up to 15 mm in the segment of the esophagus between the cardiac ventricles and gastroesophageal junction. Although the degree of tissue delineation is better appreciated with increased mediastinal fat, the visualization is still effective under normal conditions.

### AGA clinical practice update on esophageal dysfunction due to disordered immunity and infection: Expert review [^112Jv4bF]. Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for esophageal dysphagia, specifically concerning differential diagnosis, AGA 2024 guidelines recommend identifying risks for inflammatory or infectious causes of esophageal symptoms and evaluating these disorders as potential causes of esophageal dysfunction.

### Dysphagia: A review [^114rYBVu]. The Nurse Practitioner (2020). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, esophageal dysphagia can be caused by the following conditions:

- **Eosinophilic esophagitis, left atrial enlargement, and Candida esophagitis**: These are common conditions associated with esophageal dysphagia.

- **Esophageal cancer, acute pharyngitis, and Chagas disease**: Such conditions can lead to complications causing difficulty in swallowing.

- **Achalasia, mediastinitis, and esophageal foreign body**: These may require immediate medical attention due to the severity.

- **Central pontine myelinosis, globus pharyngis, and carotid body tumor**: Although less common, these can still contribute to dysphagia.

- **Systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, and myasthenia gravis**: These autoimmune diseases can impact esophageal function.

- **Gaucher disease, myotonic dystrophy, and vascular ring with right aortic arch**: Genetic and structural anomalies can also be involved.

- **Esophageal cyst, esophageal atresia, and goiter**: These are structural issues linked with swallowing difficulties.

- **Bulbar palsy, vagus nerve palsy, and Zenker's diverticulum**: Neurological impairments can disrupt proper swallowing mechanisms.

- **Riedel's thyroiditis, esophageal pouch, and Eagle's syndrome**: These can lead to significant complications affecting the esophagus.

- **Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and diffuse esophageal spasm**: These conditions can lead to spasms or restrictions.

- **Cricopharyngeal spasm, paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis, and esophageal web**: These rare conditions also play a role in esophageal dysphagia.

- **Barrett's esophagus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and esophageal stricture**: Common conditions often seen in clinical practice related to esophageal dysphagia.

### Esophageal emergencies: WSES guidelines [^111WCJL5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

For the purpose of the paper, we used an etiological classification of esophageal injuries: (1) foreign body ingestion, (2) caustic ingestion, (3) esophageal perforations (iatrogenic and spontaneous), and (4) esophageal trauma. Leading specialists in the field were asked to perform a thorough MEDLINE and EMBASE search for relevant papers on each of these topics between 1985 and June 2018. They focused their search to provide evidence-based answers to pertinent questions with immediate practical application. Topics were presented and discussed at the 5th WSES congress in Bertinoro, Italy, 28th–30th June 2018. The level of evidence for each recommendation statement was assigned using the grading system proposed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

Eventually, evidence-based guidelines for the management of esophageal injuries were developed to outline clinical recommendations.

- **Foreign body ingestion**: In the United States, esophageal foreign body (FB) ingestion accounts for more than 100,000 cases per year. In children, accidental ingestion of coins, batteries, toys, and magnets is common. Accidental ingestions also occur in adults, often in association with intoxication or in the elderly with cognitive impairment; intentional ingestion by patients with psychiatric disorders or by prisoners is not infrequent. Esophageal FB impaction depends on the size and shape of the FB. Impaction usually occurs at the level of the hypopharynx or in the upper thoracic esophagus for anatomical (cricopharyngeus, aortic arch) and physiological reasons.

### AGA clinical practice update on esophageal dysfunction due to disordered immunity and infection: Expert review [^112cXFHa]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for esophageal dysphagia, specifically in relation to differential diagnosis, the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend evaluating esophageal motility in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis. This is particularly important for those experiencing symptoms of esophageal dysfunction despite achieving histologic and endoscopic disease remission, as there is a possibility that these patients may develop motility disorders.

### Video-mediastinoscope: For extracting upper esophageal foreign bodies [^115bvF7F]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with esophageal foreign bodies require prompt diagnosis and therapy. The proximal dilatation method using a video-mediastinoscope is both safe and effective in removing sharp foreign bodies from the upper esophagus, thereby avoiding surgery and possible perforation. This technique with a video-mediastinoscope has proven to be effective and safe; it may represent the first use of this procedure in the literature. We recommend employing the video-mediastinoscope for extracting foreign bodies involving the upper esophagus narrowing.

### Diagnostic evaluation of dysphagia [^1153PJYZ]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Taking a careful history is vital for the evaluation of dysphagia. The history will yield the likely underlying pathophysiologic process and anatomic site of the problem in most patients, and is crucial for determining whether subsequently detected radiographic or endoscopic "anomalies" are relevant or incidental. Although the symptoms of pharyngeal dysphagia can be multiple and varied, the typical features of neurogenic pharyngeal dysphagia are highly specific, and can accurately distinguish pharyngeal from esophageal disorders. The history will also dictate whether the next diagnostic procedure should be endoscopy, a barium swallow, or esophageal manometry. In some difficult cases, all three diagnostic techniques may need to be performed to establish an accurate diagnosis. Stroke is the most common cause of pharyngeal dysphagia. A videoradiographic swallow study is vital in such cases to determine the extent and timing of aspiration and the severity and mechanics of dysfunction as a prelude to therapy.

### AGA clinical practice update on esophageal dysfunction due to disordered immunity and infection: Expert review [^111JgPvG]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for esophageal dysphagia, particularly in the context of differential diagnosis, the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend considering infectious and inflammatory causes of secondary achalasia during the initial evaluation. It is advised to assess for any history of recent COVID-19 infection, risks for Chagas disease, and symptoms or signs of eosinophilic disease.

### Complications of foreign bodies in the esophagus [^111FLCnZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Major complications of foreign bodies in the esophagus carry significant morbidity and mortality risks. A retrospective case-control study was performed to assess the factors associated with major complications. In total, 273 patients seen within a 7-year period were divided into two groups: 253 had no or minor complications, and 20 had major complications. Age, sex, duration of the foreign body, total white cell count (TWC), and the nature and site of the foreign body were analyzed in the two groups. The major complication rate was 7.3%. The duration of the foreign body and TWC were the only statistically significant factors associated with major complications. Six patients required open neck exploration, one had an open thoracotomy, and 13 were treated by endoscopic removal. There were two deaths. Given the significant morbidity and mortality risks, we conclude that patients with a prolonged history of a foreign body in the esophagus and a raised TWC should be treated urgently.

### Long-term follow-up for missed cases of eosinophilic esophagitis in children with previous foreign body in the esophagus [^115rCEYU]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

A foreign body impacted in the esophagus could be a sign of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Our aim was to investigate if children previously diagnosed with a foreign body in the esophagus had a missed diagnosis of EoE.

- **Methods**: In this population-based longitudinal study, all children (0–18 years) diagnosed with a foreign body in the esophagus in Stockholm, Sweden, from 2006 to 2016, were identified. In addition to a review of medical files, each family was contacted (n = 325) and asked standardized questions. Children with symptoms indicating EoE were offered esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

- **Results**: We found 325 pediatric cases of foreign body. Two hundred and seven (64%) underwent an endoscopy at the event; 3 of these had biopsies taken, whereby 2 were diagnosed with EoE. Six additional patients were diagnosed with EoE between the initial event and the study follow-up. Children with persisting symptoms suggestive of EoE at the follow-up (n = 21) were offered EGD, whereof 7 accepted. Four new cases of EoE were found. Hence, 12 (3.7%) of the children with a previous foreign body, either spontaneously released or endoscopically removed, were diagnosed with EoE. In the structured interview, dysphagia, food impactions, and drinking excessively with meals, as well as food allergies, were significantly more common in EoE patients.

- **Conclusions**: Children with a foreign body in the esophagus are at risk of having EoE. Biopsies should be taken during foreign body removal, and questions about swallowing problems and allergic diseases should be carefully explored in children.

### Management of ingested foreign bodies and food impactions [^115AHHWg]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2011). High credibility.

In the context of managing ingested foreign bodies, particularly in patients with food impaction, the ASGE 2011 guidelines suggest considering techniques such as en bloc removal, piecemeal removal, or the gentle push technique for handling esophageal food impactions.

### Use of fluoroscopic guidance to remove a migrating esophageal foreign body [^112bTYXQ]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Ingested foreign bodies that migrate extraluminally are rare. In such cases, exploration of the neck via an external approach is the recommended procedure to remove the object. However, locating such a foreign body can be a difficult task. We report what we believe is the first adult case of fluoroscopically guided localization of an accidentally ingested foreign body that had migrated into the soft tissues of the neck. We also review the other methods used to locate a migrating foreign body.

### Calcification of the epiglottis presenting as foreign body sensation in the neck [^1117wNgd]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The epiglottis plays an important role in preventing food of different consistencies from entering the airway during swallowing. Calcification of the epiglottis can potentially alter and limit its movement, causing aspiration among other swallowing problems. Isolated calcification of the epiglottis and its clinical presentation remains a poorly understood entity for radiologists as well as clinicians. Therefore, it is important to recognize the imaging features of epiglottic calcification and its known clinical presentations to help clinicians with early diagnosis and management.

### Application of a double-balloon method to remove button battery at the entrance of esophagus in a 17-month-old child: A case report [^114Ct5tc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Due to the natural curiosity and poor safety awareness of children, foreign body ingestion is particularly common in this age group. The types of foreign body impactions in the child's digestive tract are complex and diverse, including items such as batteries and magnetic foreign bodies. The associated complications and risks are also increasing. The treatment methods and outcomes vary depending on factors such as size, type, quantity, nature, impaction site, and retention time of foreign bodies.

Notably, 80–90% of gastrointestinal foreign bodies can be expelled naturally; however, 10–20% require endoscopic treatment, and less than 1% necessitate surgical intervention. Therefore, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of gastrointestinal foreign bodies are crucial. Endoscopic surgery is widely employed in treating foreign body ingestion, and it is one of the treatment methods strongly recommended by both domestic and international guidelines for gastrointestinal foreign body impaction.

### Pediatric esophageal foreign body: Possible role for digital tomosynthesis [^111Gwok1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Low credibility.

Foreign body (FB) ingestion is a common reason for emergency department visits, affecting more than 80,000 children in the United States annually. While most ingested FBs are coins or other radiopaque objects, some are radiolucent FBs, such as food. Digital tomosynthesis (DTS) is a radiographic technique that produces cross-sectional images with in-plane resolution similar to that of traditional radiographs. Our pilot study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of DTS to detect FB in comparison to esophagram and clinical impression.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective review of patients aged 0 to 18 years with suspected esophageal FB who received an esophagram with DTS at our institution between January 2014 and June 2016. Digital tomosynthesis images were analyzed by three readers for identification of FB impaction and compared with esophagram and discharge diagnosis. This study was approved by our local institutional review board.

- **Results**: A total of 17 patients underwent an esophagography with DTS for suspected esophageal FB, of which 9 (53%) were suspected of having an FB on esophagram. Compared with esophagram, DTS had a sensitivity of 44%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 62%. Compared with clinical impression, DTS had a sensitivity of 33%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 38%.

- **Conclusions**: This pilot study showed that chest DTS has a very high positive predictive value, compared with esophagram and clinical impression, in detecting radiolucent FB.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the assessment of uninvestigated esophageal dysphagia [^112DobUW]. Journal of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

The disease, esophageal dysphagia, can be associated with various conditions, including scleroderma, cough, and hoarseness. Other linked issues are esophageal tumors, weight loss, and esophageal ring. Potential causes also include esophageal foreign body, eosinophilic esophagitis, muscle spasms, and the bringing back up of undigested food. Additional related conditions are esophageal stricture, gastroesophageal reflux, heartburn, and achalasia. Furthermore, certain demographic and treatment factors, such as elderly age and radiation therapy, can contribute to the disease. Lastly, symptoms like food regurgitation and drooling are also observed in cases of esophageal dysphagia.

### Overlooked radiographic finding results in delayed diagnosis of a retained oesophageal foreign body [^113ykZBm]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Ingestion of foreign bodies in children is a commonly occurring event worldwide. Swallowed foreign bodies usually pass successfully through the alimentary canal, from the mouth to the anus, but occasionally they may become lodged in the lumen of the oesophagus and cause complications. Accurate diagnosis of a retained foreign body is crucial in anticipating and preventing complications, but diagnostic delay can occur. We present a case of delayed diagnosis of a foreign body ingestion in an infant. Based on our experience, we emphasize the importance of accurate interpretation of X-rays, with particular attention paid to the region of highest suspicion by the first touch physician.

### Diagnostic approach to patients with suspected motility disorders: One size does not fit all [^112j9zS4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Most importantly, most epidemiological studies in the field include only patients with typical esophageal symptoms, such as dysphagia and/or chest pain. However, according to guidelines, high-resolution manometry (HRM) is necessary for diagnosing different entities, such as globus or among patients with symptoms of GERD who do not respond to treatment. Data about the epidemiology of major esophageal motility disorders (mEMD) among patients with non-typical symptoms are lacking.

As previously stated, HRM is the gold standard for mEMD diagnosis. The initial diagnostic approach in a patient with either typical or atypical symptoms includes upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Studies indicate that the existence of compatible endoscopic findings among patients ultimately diagnosed with mEMD varies. A valuable weapon in the diagnostic modalities used for patients with esophageal motility disorders (EMD) is the barium swallow esophagogram. Particularly, since the introduction of timed-barium swallow (TBE), its diagnostic accuracy has increased, notably in the context of achalasia. Since TBE is easier to perform than HRM and less expensive, its use will not be abandoned any time soon. Once again, there are insufficient data about the findings from endoscopic and barium studies among patients with non-typical esophageal symptoms who are referred for HRM.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency of mEMD among patients with typical versus non-typical symptoms referred for HRM in the era of the Chicago IV classification. A secondary aim of our study was to identify possible differences among findings in endoscopy and TBE between these groups.

### Suspected esophageal coin — look again [^115XfWz5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A 4-year-old presented to the emergency department, asymptomatic, with a strong suspicion — based on history, physical examination, and initial radiographic interpretation by the emergency physician — of an esophageal coin. Closer inspection revealed radiographic signs associated with disk battery ingestion, a surgical emergency. In the operating room, superimposed coins, mimicking the radiographic appearance of a disk (button) battery, were extracted. This case highlights the important management differences between ingested coins and batteries, the need for cautious interpretation of radiographs, and presents a rare mimic of a serious ingestion.

### Thoracoscopic removal of dental prosthesis impacted in the upper thoracic esophagus [^1165JTyp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Accidental ingestion of foreign bodies is frequent in adult individuals with mental retardation or psychiatric disorders. Most of the ingested foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract without consequences. However, 10–20% of patients may require endoscopic removal, and 1% or fewer may require surgery due to entrapment of the foreign body in the cervical (57%), thoracic (26%), or distal (17%) esophagus. Dental appliances are the most common cause of accidental foreign body esophageal impaction, particularly in the elderly population with decreased oral sensory perception. The large size, sharp edges, and metal clasps of dental prostheses make endoscopic removal unsafe and carry a high risk of perforation in such circumstances. We present a case of successful thoracoscopic removal of a dental prosthesis impacted in the upper thoracic esophagus.

### Dysphagia: Evaluation and collaborative management [^113LqLSq]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is common but may be underreported. Specific symptoms, rather than their perceived location, should guide the initial evaluation and imaging. Obstructive symptoms that seem to originate in the throat or neck may actually be caused by distal esophageal lesions. Oropharyngeal dysphagia manifests as difficulty initiating swallowing, coughing, choking, or aspiration, and it is most commonly caused by chronic neurologic conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, or dementia. Symptoms should be thoroughly evaluated because of the risk of aspiration.

Patients with esophageal dysphagia may report a sensation of food getting stuck after swallowing. This condition is most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional esophageal disorders. Eosinophilic esophagitis is triggered by food allergens and is increasingly prevalent; esophageal biopsies should be performed to make the diagnosis. Esophageal motility disorders, such as achalasia, are relatively rare and may be overdiagnosed. Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction is becoming more common.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for the initial evaluation of esophageal dysphagia, with barium esophagography as an adjunct. Esophageal cancer and other serious conditions have a low prevalence, and testing in low-risk patients may be deferred while a four-week trial of acid-suppressing therapy is undertaken. Many frail older adults with progressive neurologic disease have significant but unrecognized dysphagia, which significantly increases their risk of aspiration pneumonia and malnourishment.

### Food allergy masquerading as foreign body obstruction [^111AB1WU]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Allergic reactions to peanut and tree nuts can present as upper airway obstruction. The objective of this study is to increase awareness that food allergy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of upper airway obstruction in children.

- **Methods**: We report an allergic reaction to cashew that was initially misdiagnosed as foreign body aspiration.

- **Results**: When the presenting signs and symptoms of food allergy are limited to upper airway obstruction, they can be confused with foreign body aspiration.

- **Conclusions**: As peanuts and tree nuts are common causes of both food allergy and foreign body aspiration in children, both of these diagnoses should be considered in the differential diagnosis of airway obstruction.

### Application of a double-balloon method to remove button battery at the entrance of esophagus in a 17-month-old child: a case report [^114jyuNA]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Foreign body impaction in the digestive tract is one of the most critical conditions in children, stemming from their strong desire for exploration and poor safety awareness. With the increasing popularity of electronic products, the incidence of accidental button battery ingestion in children is also rising. Button battery impaction in the esophagus can lead to serious complications, including esophageal cauterization and perforation, within a short time frame. It is crucial to adopt more active treatment strategies once button battery ingestion occurs. While surgical treatment is traumatic and can cause various complications, endoscopic removal of the foreign body retained in the esophagus is the preferred approach.

- **Case presentation**: We introduced a new method to remove a button battery retained in the esophagus of a 17-month-old child. Soon after the patient arrived at the hospital, we actively arranged for endoscopic surgery. After the gastroscope entered the esophageal inlet, we first cleared the esophageal residues, exposing the button battery. The surrounding esophageal mucosa showed slight cauterization-like damage. Initial attempts to remove the foreign body using forceps were unsuccessful despite repeated efforts. We then attempted to use a disposable balloon to aid in dragging the foreign body out. However, due to the patient's young age, narrow esophagus, and significant drag resistance of the foreign body, this method was also ineffective. Violent dragging might have resulted in tearing and perforation of the esophagus. Therefore, we utilized a columnar balloon to assist in the retrieval.

### Guideline for the management of ingested foreign bodies [^113y3ADM]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

This is one of a series of statements discussing the utilization of gastrointestinal endoscopy in common clinical situations. The Standards of Practice Committee of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy prepared this text. In preparing this guideline, a MEDLINE literature search was performed, and additional references were obtained from the bibliographies of the identified articles and from recommendations of expert consultants. When little or no data exist from well-designed prospective trials, emphasis is given to results from large series and reports from recognized experts. Guidelines for appropriate utilization of endoscopy are based on a critical review of the available data and expert consensus. Further controlled clinical studies are needed to clarify aspects of this statement, and revision may be necessary as new data appear. Clinical consideration may justify a course of action at variance with these recommendations.

### A new trend in the management of esophageal foreign body: Transnasal esophagoscopy [^113LfcFP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was twofold: to analyze the outcomes of patients with an esophageal foreign body managed by transnasal esophagoscopy, and to review the value of lateral neck X-ray.

- **Study design**: Case series with chart review.
- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center at Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.
- **Subjects and methods**: Lateral neck X-ray was used for initial screening in patients suspected of having an esophageal foreign body between 2007 and 2013. Rigid esophagoscopy was the standard for further investigations before July 2010, whereas transnasal esophagoscopy was used after July 2010.

- **Results**: From January 2007 to June 2010, 43 patients suspected of having an esophageal foreign body under lateral neck X-ray received rigid esophagoscopy. Of these, 31 were found to have an esophageal foreign body. From July 2010 to December 2013, 302 patients underwent transnasal esophagoscopy, and an esophageal foreign body was noted in only 52 of these patients. In the 302 patients who underwent transnasal esophagoscopy, the sensitivity and specificity of having an esophageal foreign body by lateral neck X-ray were 59% and 83%, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: The introduction of transnasal esophagoscopy has changed the diagnosis and management of esophageal foreign bodies. It is a quick and safe procedure that can be performed under local anesthesia. Transnasal esophagoscopy could replace lateral neck X-ray as the initial screening procedure and serve as a useful treatment for patients with an esophageal foreign body.

### Esophageal discoid foreign body detection and classification using artificial intelligence [^11515M8V]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Early and accurate radiographic diagnosis is required for the management of children with radio-opaque esophageal foreign bodies. Button batteries are among the most dangerous esophageal foreign bodies, and coins are among the most common. We hypothesized that artificial intelligence could be used to triage radiographs with esophageal button batteries and coins.

- **Objective**: Our primary objective was to train an object detector to detect esophageal foreign bodies, whether button battery or coin. Our secondary objective was to train an image classifier to classify the detected foreign body as either a button battery or a coin.

- **Materials and methods**: We trained an object detector to detect button batteries and coins. The training data set for the object detector was 57 radiographs, consisting of 3 groups of 19 images each with either an esophageal button battery, esophageal coin, or no foreign body. The foreign bodies were endoscopically confirmed, and the groups were age and gender matched. We then trained an image classifier to classify the detected foreign body as either a button battery or a coin. The training data set for the image classifier consisted of 19 radiographs of button batteries and 19 of coins, cropped from the object detector training data set. The object detector and image classifier were then tested on 103 radiographs with an esophageal foreign body and 103 radiographs without a foreign body.

- **Results**: The object detector was 100% sensitive and specific for detecting an esophageal foreign body. The image classifier accurately classified all 6/.

### Foreign body impaction as presentation of eosinophilic esophagitis [^114czBGv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Esophageal foreign body is a frequent pediatric presentation, and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an important underlying disease. To determine characteristics common in the presentation of esophageal foreign body indicative of underlying EoE and reach a recommendation for the appropriate scenario in which to obtain esophageal mucosal biopsy, 312 pediatric esophageal foreign bodies requiring operative removal were reviewed. Patients older than 18 years or with a known history of esophageal surgery or pathology were excluded. Eligibility criteria were met in 271 cases. Twenty-seven patients were biopsied, and 18 were diagnosed with EoE.

- **Factors identified in the EoE population**: Food impaction (89%), older age (average 12.2 years), male sex (78%), atopic disease (61%), previous esophageal foreign body or frequent dysphagia (83%), and endoscopic abnormalities (100%).

These factors are all associated with an underlying diagnosis of EoE, and patients meeting these criteria should be strongly considered for intraoperative esophageal mucosal biopsy.

### Hypopharyngeal venous malformation presenting with foreign body sensation and dysphagia [^1133DXxx]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Review the importance of imaging selection and clinico-anatomic correlation for vascular malformations presenting with unique symptomatology.

- **Methods**: Case study and literature review.

- **Results**: A 64-year-old female presented with globus and dysphagia ongoing for 40 years. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy discovered a hypopharyngeal mass. A CT scan showed a soft tissue mass with shotty calcifications. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed a bluish compressible mass. MRI showed T2 hyperintensity with heterogeneous enhancement, resulting in the diagnosis of a low-flow vascular malformation.

- **Conclusions**: All globus is not equal. Attention to symptoms, anatomy, and imaging selection is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of vascular malformations uniquely presenting with dysphagia.

### Globus: Current concepts and dilemmas [^111rwSPH]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Globus is an area of interest for many medical specialists, including otorhinolaryngologists, gastroenterologists, allergists, and psychiatrists. It may be caused by an organic disease, but often an underlying etiology remains unidentified even following a full workup. Patients who suffer from globus typically visit several physicians from different specialties without finding a solution for their symptoms.

Identifying the underlying cause of globus is not always a simple task; therefore, structural or functional abnormalities of the thyroid, larynx, pharynx, and esophagus should be investigated. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is commonly considered to be the underlying cause after being identified in an otorhinolaryngological (ear, nose, and throat) evaluation, which is usually the first diagnostic step. In recent years, an inlet patch in the proximal esophagus has been associated with globus, and its elimination has led to symptom resolution in some patients.

Globus can also be associated with psychiatric disorders and oropharyngeal hypersensitivity, which could be either chemical or mechanical in nature. Treatment is directed toward an identified organic cause; for those with a functional disorder, the mainstay of therapy includes neuromodulators and psychiatric/psychological interventions.

### Esophageal emergencies: WSES guidelines [^115GWqvF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Therapeutic flexible endoscopy is recommended as first-line treatment for persistent esophageal foreign bodies (Grade 1B), although 80–90% of ingested foreign bodies pass spontaneously through the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with persistent esophageal symptoms, an endoscopic evaluation should be performed, even if the radiographic examination is negative. In patients with food bolus impaction and no evidence of complications, endoscopy may be performed first. This approach will depend on local practices, but most cases will require anesthetic input, often involving a general anesthetic with endotracheal intubation to protect the airway.

Emergent flexible endoscopy (preferably within 2 hours, at latest within 6 hours) is recommended for sharp-pointed objects, batteries, magnets, and for foreign bodies inducing complete esophageal obstruction (Grade 1B). Emergent flexible endoscopy should be performed in the following cases: (a) sharp-pointed objects due to the high risk of full-thickness perforation (up to 35%); (b) button/disk battery ingestion because of the risk of pressure necrosis, electrical burns, and chemical injury; (c) magnet ingestion due to pressure necrosis; and (d) food bolus ingestion with complete esophageal obstruction because of the risk of aspiration as well as perforation.

- **Figure note**: Endoscopic view of esophageal injury from button battery ingestion (at 6 hours) in a 5-year-old with intellectual disability.

Urgent (< 24 hours) flexible endoscopy is recommended for other esophageal foreign bodies.

### Foley catheter technique for the extraction of coins lodged in the upper esophagus of children [^112NzQTp]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Foreign body ingestion most commonly occurs during the toddler period of childhood because of the behavior, physiology, and anatomical characteristics of children at that age. Coins are the most frequently ingested foreign body, and the ingested coins usually become lodged within the esophagus, most commonly in the upper and middle sections.

Symptoms of the presence of esophageal coins are nonspecific, including choking, respiratory distress, wheezing, dysphagia, drooling, and chest and abdominal pain. The clinical findings depend on the characteristics of the foreign body ingestion, such as the degree of obstruction, the site where the foreign body is lodged, and the length of time elapsed between ingestion and evaluation.

A coin lodged in the esophagus should be considered a clinical emergency. The aims of treatment are to prevent tissue damage and to decrease the risk of complications. It is important to diagnose the presence of and extract the coin from the esophagus as early as possible. The most common approach is extraction of the coin by rigid esophagoscopy under general anesthesia or, more recently, by balloon extraction under fluoroscopic guidance. However, one of these two methods requires general anesthesia, and the other requires additional exposure to radiation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate our patients who have undergone extraction of coins lodged in the esophagus retrospectively and the safety of this procedure.

### Esophageal obstruction and death in a nonverbal patient [^112v44LY]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

There are more than 100,000 cases of esophageal foreign body in the United States each year. Most cases resolve spontaneously; however, complete esophageal obstruction is a medical emergency. Patients with developmental disabilities are at high risk, as a large percentage of this population is affected by dysphagia, pica, tooth loss, or impulsive swallowing. In some cases, the diagnosis of esophageal foreign body can be made clinically, with typical presentations including coughing, inability to tolerate secretions, drooling, vomiting, and dysphagia. In other instances, imaging is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

- **Case report**: A nonverbal adult patient with a history of mental retardation and dysphagia presented to the emergency department (ED) following a choking episode with persistent coughing. An X-ray study of the chest showed mild opacity at the left lung base, and she was discharged with antibiotics. However, she returned to the ED that day with worsening symptoms suggestive of aspiration pneumonia. A computed tomography scan of the chest revealed numerous cylindrical objects in the esophagus, later identified as crayons. At least 28 crayons were removed via three endoscopies. During this time, the patient developed aspiration pneumonia, respiratory distress, and septic shock.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** Delayed recognition of foreign bodies puts patients at risk for esophageal perforation, aspiration, airway compromise, infection, sepsis, and death. In nonverbal patients presenting with upper respiratory symptoms, it is especially important to expedite diagnosis and management to prevent severe outcomes.

### Esophageal emergencies: WSES guidelines [^114Q8dip]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The esophagus traverses three body compartments (neck, thorax, and abdomen) and is surrounded at each level by vital organs. Injuries to the esophagus may be classified as foreign body ingestion, caustic ingestion, esophageal perforation, and esophageal trauma. These lesions can be life-threatening either by digestive contamination of surrounding structures in case of esophageal wall breach or concomitant damage of surrounding organs. Early diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention are the keys to successful management.

### Esophageal perforation caused by edible foreign bodies: a systematic review of the literature [^114ywxfd]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

Presentation of a case of esophageal perforation caused by the ingestion of a foreign body that was difficult to visualize endoscopically, and a systematic review of the literature with a focus on available diagnostic modalities and missed diagnoses.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE (1946–2014).

- **Review methods**: We conducted a systematic review of MEDLINE for cases and studies of esophageal perforation due to foreign bodies.

- **Results**: A systematic review of esophageal perforations caused by foreign bodies revealed 40 studies that included 168 patients. Neck/chest pain, odynophagia, and dysphagia were the most common presenting symptoms — each occurring in the majority of patients. Where reported, the diagnostic sensitivity of lateral neck X-rays was 56%, and computed tomography (CT) scan was 100%. Nine of 168 cases specifically mentioned a missed diagnosis. Very few studies reported a failure to visualize the foreign object at the time of primary rigid or flexible esophagoscopy. No studies reported non-visualization of the foreign body at the time of open surgery.

- **Conclusion**: Esophageal perforations due to foreign bodies are rare but carry potentially devastating complications. Delays in diagnosis are common, and no standard diagnostic algorithm exists. Lateral neck X-rays are an easy but insensitive screening test. Laryngoscopy is an excellent screening test but not always diagnostic. CT is a more sensitive diagnostic method, which can also help guide management based on the detection of complications. Although seldom described, if an object is not visualized at the time of initial examination, further investigation is necessary to prevent missed diagnoses.

### Removal of foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract in adults: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) clinical guideline [^115UugNu]. Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

This guideline is an official statement of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and addresses the removal of foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract in adults.

- **Recommendations**:
	- ESGE recommends diagnostic evaluation based on the patient's history and symptoms. A physical examination is recommended, focusing on the patient's general condition and assessing signs of any complications (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).
	- ESGE does not recommend radiological evaluation for patients with nonbony food bolus impaction without complications. However, plain radiography is recommended to assess the presence, location, size, configuration, and number of ingested foreign bodies if ingestion of radiopaque objects is suspected or the type of object is unknown (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).
	- Computed tomography (CT) scan is recommended in all patients with suspected perforation or other complications that may require surgery (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).
	- Barium swallow is not recommended due to the risk of aspiration and worsening of endoscopic visualization (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).
	- Clinical observation without the need for endoscopic removal is recommended for asymptomatic patients who have ingested blunt and small objects, except for batteries and magnets. Where feasible, outpatient management is appropriate (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).
	- Close observation is recommended in asymptomatic individuals who have concealed packets of drugs.

### Approach to the patient with dysphagia [^114VKEvY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a fascinating symptom. It is ostensibly simple when defined by trouble swallowing, yet its subtleties in deciphering and its variations in pathophysiology almost mandate a thorough knowledge of medicine itself. With patience and careful questioning, a multitude of various disorders may be suggested before an objective test is performed. Indeed, the ability to diligently and comprehensively explore the symptom of dysphagia is not only rewarding but also a real test for a physician who prides himself or herself on good history taking.

### Urgency of esophageal foreign body removal: Differentiation between coins and button cell batteries [^113AafdE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Coin-shaped button battery foreign bodies have a similar initial presentation to coin ingestion, but delayed retrieval of a battery from the esophagus can have devastating consequences. Variations in the timing of retrieval for children with the ingestion of coin foreign bodies have been reported. This study assesses the sensitivity and specificity of conventional and digital radiographs to differentiate button batteries from coin foreign bodies.

- **Study design**: 3B case control study.

- **Study setting**: Tertiary academic medical center.

- **Methods**: A radiographic study of the 12 most common commercially available button batteries and 66 coins of varying international origins was performed. Foreign bodies were placed at the cervical esophagus of a cadaver, and anteroposterior (AP) and lateral conventional radiographs of the neck were obtained. Digital AP and lateral radiographs of standalone coins and batteries were also obtained. Images were blindly read by 2 otolaryngologists and 2 radiologists. Statistical analysis was performed to determine accuracy in identifying coins vs. batteries.

- **Results**: Using conventional radiographs to identify button batteries yielded a sensitivity of 0.88 and a specificity of 0.92 (positive predictive value [PPV] = 0.75, negative predictive value [NPV] = 0.97). Digital radiography yielded an overall sensitivity of 0.98 and specificity of 0.97 (PPV = 0.87, NPV = 0.99). Features of button batteries were only seen on AP conventional radiographs using reverse contrast.

- **Conclusions**: Neither conventional nor digital radiographic imaging had perfect accuracy.

### Diagnostic approach to patients with suspected motility disorders: one size does not fit all [^111rmcwL]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Summary box**:
	- **What is already known**: Dysphagia and retrosternal chest pain are considered typical manifestations of major esophageal motility disorders. However, in many patients with non-typical symptoms, motility disorders are suspected as the origin of their symptoms. High-resolution manometry (HRM) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of motility disorders. There are insufficient data regarding the findings of endoscopy and barium studies in patients with non-typical esophageal symptoms referred for HRM.
	- **What the new findings are**: In the absence of typical symptoms, a lack of compatible endoscopic and timed-barium swallow findings almost completely rules out a diagnosis of major esophageal motility disorders (mEMD). More than half of the patients referred for HRM will be diagnosed with mEMD, and the rate will be higher when typical symptoms are reported. Achalasia, and especially type II achalasia, is the most commonly diagnosed major motility disorder, even among patients with non-typical esophageal symptoms.

### Esophageal emergencies: WSES guidelines [^116Qdh1m]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Initial evaluation should be based on the patient's history and physical examination. Recommended biochemical investigations include complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), blood gas analysis for base excess, and lactate (Grade 2C).

- **Radiographic investigations**: Neck, chest, and abdominal radiographs are useful for assessing the presence, location, shape, and size of radiopaque or unknown shape objects (Grade 1C). Plain neck, chest, and abdominal radiographs help evaluate the presence, location, size, shape, and number of ingested objects, as well as possible signs of perforation. Although plain radiography is typically employed for initial screening, it has a false-negative rate of up to 47%. Biplanar radiography is beneficial in reducing this rate, with the lateral projection being important to distinguish between tracheobronchial and esophageal foreign bodies (FBs). In cases of food bolus impaction, thin metal objects, wood and plastic objects, glass fragments, and fish or chicken bones, false-negative rates at X-ray evaluation can reach up to 85%.

- **Advanced imaging**: A computed tomography (CT) scan should be performed in patients with suspected perforation or other complications that may require interventional endoscopy or surgery (Grade 1B). In a prospective single-center study involving 358 adult patients with symptomatic fish bone impaction, the sensitivity of plain X-Ray was 32% while the sensitivity of the CT scan ranged from 90–100%, and specificity from 93.7–100%. Therefore, CT scan should be considered an essential tool in adult patients reporting accidental ingestion or suspicion of complications.

### Migration of ingested sharp foreign body into the bronchus: A case report and review of the literature [^115eaCxg]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

A female patient, 72 years old, was admitted for "retrosternal pain for 4 days during eating" with a previously healthy history. Four days prior, the patient experienced a foreign body sensation in the pharynx after eating freshwater fish. She continued eating as usual but felt retrosternal pain. One day before admission, the pain worsened after eating rice cake and was accompanied by a severe irritant dry cough, without fever, hemoptysis, or hematemesis. The patient was admitted to the Regional Medical Center for the National Institute of Respiratory Disease at Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University.

A chest plain computed tomography (CT) scan suggested "flat esophagus and bronchial bifurcation with a high-density shadow". A foreign body, considered to have a length of 2.8 cm, was observed crossing the left main bronchial wall, accompanied by thickening of the local bronchial wall mucosa (Figs. 1, 2). Treatment was supportive, involving fasting, fluid infusion, and monitoring.

During the operation, a rigid esophagoscope (S121; Hangzhou Tonglu Medical Optical Instrument Co. Ltd, Zhejiang, China) was used under general anesthesia with an endotracheal tube. It was observed that the mucosa ulcer was at the 2 o'clock direction in the esophagus, 26 cm away from the incisors, with hyperemia and swelling of the surrounding mucosa. No obvious foreign body was found in the cavity. Under a fiberoptic bronchoscope (BF-260; Olympus Optical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) via the endotracheal tube, a needle-shaped foreign body — considered to be a fish bone, in combination with medical history — was located in the proximal part.

### Endoscopic removal of esophageal foreign body embedded in muscularis propria [^113XacB8]. Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

A 53-year-old man presented with a 3-week history of retrosternal pain after the ingestion of hard food. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest indicated a transverse high-density opacity in the middle of the esophagus, extending into the right mediastinum. Esophagoscopy showed edema of the mucosa and granulation tissue at the right posterior esophageal wall, 31 cm from the incisors, surface erosion with a small amount of purulent discharge, and no foreign body found in the lumen. Ultrasonography suggested a hyperechoic area in the right posterior muscularis propria layer of the esophagus, connected to a hypoechoic lesion outside the esophagus; imaging indicated an entirely embedded esophagus-penetrating foreign body and mediastinal abscess. A routine chest and enhanced CT scan revealed a high-density line, 22.9 mm in length, embedded in the middle esophagus and protruding into the mediastinum, with uneven soft tissue enhancement. No vascular injury was detected.

### The role of esophageal hypersensitivity in functional esophageal disorders [^111ptpcU]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The Rome IV diagnostic criteria delineate five functional esophageal disorders: functional chest pain, functional heartburn, reflux hypersensitivity, globus, and functional dysphagia. These are a heterogeneous group of disorders which, despite having characteristic symptom profiles attributable to esophageal pathology, fail to demonstrate any structural, motility, or inflammatory abnormalities on standard clinical testing. These disorders are associated with a marked reduction in patient quality of life and considerable healthcare resource utilization. Furthermore, the pathophysiology of these disorders is incompletely understood.

In this narrative review, we provide an introductory primer on the structure and function of esophageal perception, including nociception that forms the basis of the putative mechanisms that may give rise to symptoms in functional esophageal disorders. We also discuss the provocative techniques and outcome measures by which esophageal hypersensitivity can be established.

### Oesophageal dysphagia: A stepwise approach to diagnosis and management [^115yiHSc]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a common symptom in the general population, with incidence varying depending on the specific definition used. A thorough medical history is vital for distinguishing true oesophageal dysphagia from oropharyngeal dysphagia or other causes. Oesophageal dysphagia is considered a red flag alarm symptom, necessitating oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. However, even after investigations such as oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (with biopsy), barium swallow, and oesophageal manometry, no obstructive cause may be found. This review suggests an algorithm of history-taking and investigation to identify the causes of non-obstructive dysphagia, including functional dysphagia. It then discusses management strategies and outcomes for functional dysphagia.

### Consultations for foreign bodies in aerodigestive tract: Assessment of diagnostic modalities [^114Kq1CW]. The Laryngoscope (2023). High credibility.

To evaluate test characteristics of various diagnostic modalities in the workup of foreign body (FB) sensation in the aerodigestive tract, a database containing all inpatient otolaryngology consultations between 2008 and 2020 was used. Cases of FB sensation were identified by documented encounter diagnosis or hospital problem of FB or globus sensation. Variables including basic patient demographics, clinical presentations, diagnostic imaging modalities, procedures, and outpatient follow-up were collected.

One hundred and six patients were included in the study. A FB was visualized in 55 patients (52%) and removed in 52 patients (49%); 3 patients had a FB that was visualized initially but not found in the operating room. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were found to be 41%, 50%, 58%, and 33%, respectively, for X-ray (XR); and 91%, 61%, 70%, and 87%, respectively, for computed tomography (CT). Sensitivity and NPV were 25% and 57%, respectively, for flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy (FFL). Seventy-one of 106 patients (67%) underwent invasive interventions during their workup for FBs. Ten out of 11 (91%) chicken bones were found in the digestive tract compared to 7 out of 19 (37%) fishbones (p = 0.0046).

In conclusion, in patients with a history of FB ingestion, CT may be more beneficial than XR as a screening tool for locating foreign bodies and guiding further management. FFL alone is inadequate for ruling out a FB in the aerodigestive tract given FB's high likelihood of being in the esophagus.

### Removal of foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract in adults: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) clinical guideline [^115twbAs]. Endoscopy (2016). High credibility.

The ESGE 2016 guidelines recommend conducting *emergent therapeutic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy* (preferably within 2 hours, but at most within 6 hours) for foreign bodies causing complete esophageal obstruction and for sharp-pointed objects or batteries located in the esophagus. For other esophageal foreign bodies that do not cause complete obstruction, an *urgent therapeutic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy* should be performed within 24 hours.
