## Question

Pneumonia diagnosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pneumonia diagnosis, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching diagnostic framework and the role of radiographic confirmation. Then, I should verify the clinical features that raise suspicion and how reliable they are. Next, I will examine imaging modalities, including chest radiography, lung ultrasound, and CT, and when each is appropriate. After that, I need to check microbiologic testing strategies and their limitations. I will then consider special populations such as immunocompromised hosts, children, and older adults. Finally, I should review severity assessment tools, site-of-care decisions, and the role of biomarkers, and close with a concise diagnostic algorithm that integrates these elements with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: in adults with suspected community-acquired pneumonia, definitive diagnosis generally requires a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiography or other imaging, interpreted in the clinical context of compatible signs and symptoms, because clinical features alone are insufficiently accurate and guidelines emphasize radiographic criteria for case ascertainment and comparability across studies [^112hi12x] [^116N8vas] [^111uqdQZ].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical features that should trigger imaging and how much weight to give them. Typical features include cough, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, fever or hypothermia, sputum production, and focal chest findings such as rales or bronchial breath sounds, but their sensitivity and specificity vary and are not sufficient to confirm pneumonia without imaging, particularly in older adults where symptoms may be blunted or absent [^111ukg7W] [^114Z96rf] [^114SuRN9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any single sign or symptom. I should double-check the diagnostic performance of individual elements. In older emergency department patients, fever and new or worsening cough are frequently absent, and existing diagnostic criteria show only modest test characteristics, reinforcing the need for imaging rather than relying on clinical gestalt alone [^114Z96rf]. Similarly, in children, no single clinical sign reliably diagnoses or excludes pneumonia, so combinations of findings and, when available, imaging are necessary to improve accuracy [^111f2c9p].

> Next, I should review imaging choices and their roles. Chest radiography remains the first-line imaging modality for suspected CAP, with lung ultrasound as an acceptable alternative in centers with appropriate expertise, and CT reserved for unresolved diagnostic uncertainty, suspected complications, or immunocompromised hosts where subtle or atypical infiltrates may be missed on CXR [^112hi12x] [^116NjiCc] [^112qDqRG]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought CT might be the gold standard for CAP, but I need to correct that: CT is more sensitive than CXR for small or early infiltrates, yet it is not the reference standard for routine CAP diagnosis and should be used selectively due to radiation and resource considerations [^112hi12x] [^112qDqRG].

> I will now examine microbiologic testing and its place in management. For most outpatients with CAP, routine etiologic testing is optional because yields are variable and rarely change immediate management; however, in hospitalized patients, obtaining sputum Gram stain and culture and blood cultures is reasonable, with urinary antigen testing for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella considered in selected cases, and multiplex panels or targeted PCR reserved for severe disease or immunocompromised hosts where results may alter therapy or isolation decisions [^113mgi8g] [^112hi12x] [^115a7M19]. But wait, what if I overinterpret a positive upper respiratory PCR? I should confirm that detection of a pathogen in the upper tract does not prove lower respiratory infection, so results must be integrated with clinical and radiographic data to avoid misattribution [^115a7M19].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with immunocompromised hosts. Diagnosis of pneumonia in this group requires clinical suspicion plus radiographic evidence of a new or worsening infiltrate, recognizing that symptoms may be atypical and CXR can be falsely negative; CT is often needed to detect subtle disease, and invasive testing with bronchoscopy and BAL is frequently indicated to identify opportunistic pathogens and exclude noninfectious mimics, with empiric therapy not delayed when clinically indicated [^116K5XcC] [^1112GDfv] [^1138DXGc]. I should confirm that detection of an opportunistic organism should prompt evaluation for an underlying immune defect even if none was previously known, which is a key principle in ICHP algorithms [^116Afzxs].

> Now, I need to check pediatric-specific diagnostic nuances. In children, especially in low-resource settings, WHO clinical criteria prioritize sensitivity with tachypnea and chest indrawing, accepting lower specificity to ensure antibiotic access; however, recent analyses show only moderate sensitivity and specificity for these signs, and adding fever can improve specificity without major sensitivity loss in wheezing children, while chest radiography is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty, hypoxemia, significant distress, or lack of clinical improvement [^112VVcKL] [^111XVs2f] [^111S9KGg]. Hold on, I should verify that no single clinical feature suffices in ambulatory children; indeed, combinations of signs and, when available, imaging are required to improve diagnostic accuracy and guide therapy [^111f2c9p].

> For older adults, I should confirm that atypical presentations are common and that existing ED diagnostic criteria may underperform. Prospective data show low frequencies of classic symptoms and only modest likelihood ratios for standard criteria, so a low threshold for imaging and a high index of suspicion for occult pneumonia are warranted, with clinical judgment integrated alongside validated severity tools for disposition decisions [^114Z96rf] [^112hi12x].

> Next, I should review severity assessment and site-of-care decisions. The IDSA/ATS severe CAP criteria remain the standard for identifying patients requiring ICU-level care, with either one major criterion or three or more minor criteria providing prognostic information; for initial site-of-care decisions, the Pneumonia Severity Index is preferred over CURB-65 to identify low-risk patients suitable for outpatient therapy, though clinical judgment must always be applied [^113SAXrE] [^112irMwM]. I need to ensure I remember that pediatric severity tools are not validated for ICU admission decisions and should not be used in isolation for that purpose [^111VvhHu].

> I should double-check the role of biomarkers. Procalcitonin and CRP lack sufficient accuracy to diagnose pneumonia or distinguish bacterial from viral etiologies in isolation, and guidelines recommend against using procalcitonin to guide antibiotic initiation in suspected HAP/VAP and against relying on procalcitonin to distinguish viral from bacterial CAP in the ED, emphasizing clinical criteria instead [^117Psfs2] [^111aTg81]. Let me reconsider whether any biomarker adds value; while some studies suggest adjunctive use, current evidence does not support routine biomarker-driven decisions for initial antibiotic therapy in CAP or HAP/VAP [^112hi12x] [^115915z1].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm while keeping these caveats in mind. In adults with suspected CAP, integrate compatible symptoms and signs with a new infiltrate on CXR or lung ultrasound to confirm pneumonia; if imaging is negative but suspicion remains high, especially in immunocompromised hosts or severe disease, proceed to CT and consider bronchoscopy with BAL for microbiology; apply IDSA/ATS severe CAP criteria to guide ICU admission and use PSI to inform site-of-care decisions, reserving microbiologic testing for hospitalized or high-risk patients where results are likely to change management [^112hi12x] [^112irMwM] [^116NjiCc] [^1138DXGc]. For children, apply WHO clinical criteria when imaging is unavailable, obtain CXR when diagnostic uncertainty exists or illness is severe, and avoid overreliance on any single sign; for older adults, maintain a low threshold for imaging given atypical presentations and integrate severity tools with clinical judgment for disposition [^111S9KGg] [^114Z96rf].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit. Radiographic confirmation is the diagnostic anchor in adults with suspected CAP, clinical features alone are insufficient, imaging modality should be tailored to context with CXR or ultrasound first and CT for complex cases, microbiologic testing is selective rather than routine, special populations require adapted thresholds and invasive strategies, and validated severity tools guide site-of-care while biomarkers should not override clinical judgment [^112hi12x] [^116NjiCc] [^113mgi8g] [^112irMwM].

Pneumonia diagnosis relies on **clinical features** (cough, fever, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, crackles) plus **radiographic confirmation** (CXR or lung ultrasound) [^116N8vas] [^116NjiCc]. In children, WHO clinical criteria (tachypnea, chest indrawing) guide diagnosis when imaging is unavailable [^112VVcKL] [^116pCHV7]. For immunocompromised patients, **CT is often required** to detect subtle infiltrates and distinguish infectious from noninfectious causes [^1112GDfv] [^112qDqRG]. Microbiology (sputum, blood cultures, urinary antigens, PCR) is used selectively based on severity and host factors [^115a7M19] [^113mgi8g]. No single test is definitive; diagnosis integrates clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic data, with severity tools (PSI, CURB-65, IDSA/ATS) guiding site of care and management [^112irMwM] [^113SAXrE].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

Pneumonia presents with respiratory and systemic symptoms; however, **clinical features alone are insufficient** for a definitive diagnosis [^111ukg7W]:

- **Cough**: Productive or non-productive, often with sputum [^111ukg7W].
- **Fever**: Common but may be absent in older adults or immunocompromised patients [^114Z96rf].
- **Dyspnea**: Shortness of breath, especially with exertion [^111ukg7W].
- **Pleuritic chest pain**: Sharp pain worsened by inspiration [^notfound].
- **Physical examination**: Crackles, bronchial breath sounds, egophony, and increased tactile fremitus [^114SuRN9].

---

## Radiographic confirmation

Radiographic imaging is essential to confirm pneumonia and distinguish it from other respiratory conditions [^116N8vas]. Chest radiography (CXR) is the **standard initial imaging modality**, demonstrating new infiltrates, consolidation, or interstitial changes [^116N8vas]. Lung ultrasound is an **acceptable alternative** to CXR in experienced hands, particularly in critically ill or resource-limited settings [^116NjiCc]. Computed tomography (CT) is reserved for **complex cases**, immunocompromised patients, or when CXR is inconclusive [^112qDqRG].

---

## Laboratory and microbiological tests

Microbiological testing is recommended based on disease severity, patient characteristics, and clinical setting [^113mgi8g] [^115a7M19]:

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Utility** |
|-|-|-|
| Sputum culture | Hospitalized patients, severe CAP | Identifies bacterial pathogens; limited by contamination [^113yNdz4] [^117NND7L] |
| Blood cultures | Severe CAP, immunocompromised | Detects bacteremia; guides therapy [^111zsppy] [^112vBdYm] |
| Urinary antigens | Severe CAP, ICU patients | Detects Legionella, pneumococcus [^111zsppy] |
| PCR | Severe CAP, immunocompromised | Detects viral and atypical pathogens [^115a7M19] |

---

## Diagnostic criteria and guidelines

Several **diagnostic criteria and guidelines** have been established to standardize pneumonia diagnosis:

- **IDSA/ATS guidelines**: Emphasize radiographic confirmation with clinical features; provide severity criteria for hospitalization and ICU admission [^115TSttT] [^113SAXrE].
- **WHO clinical criteria**: For pediatric pneumonia, particularly in resource-limited settings, using clinical signs such as tachypnea and chest indrawing [^112VVcKL] [^115QVXVr].
- **Immunocompromised host pneumonia**: Requires clinical suspicion, radiographic evidence, and consideration of opportunistic pathogens [^116K5XcC] [^1112GDfv].

---

## Severity assessment tools

Severity assessment tools guide site-of-care decisions and management strategies. The **Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)** is preferred for predicting mortality and guiding hospitalization decisions in adults [^112irMwM]. CURB-65 is a simpler alternative for rapid assessment of severity and hospitalization need [^112irMwM]. The **IDSA/ATS severe CAP criteria** define severe CAP, guiding ICU admission and aggressive management [^1157CvfE].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Pneumonia diagnosis faces several challenges, including **heterogeneity of definitions** — variability across studies and guidelines complicates standardization [^111uqdQZ] — and **limited accuracy of clinical signs**, as symptoms and signs alone are insufficient for definitive diagnosis [^11331Ns8]. In resource-limited settings, limited access to imaging and laboratory tests hampers accurate diagnosis [^116y1Fjb].

---

## Recent advances and emerging technologies

Recent advances aim to improve diagnostic accuracy and timeliness. Rapid molecular diagnostics (PCR and multiplex assays) enable **rapid pathogen detection** [^115QZqGp]. Biomarkers such as procalcitonin and CRP aid in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections, though their accuracy remains limited [^115DJLvH] [^111aTg81]. Artificial intelligence shows promise for enhancing radiographic interpretation and diagnostic accuracy [^notfound].

---

Pneumonia diagnosis relies on a **combination of clinical features, radiographic confirmation, and selective microbiological testing**. Severity assessment tools guide management decisions, while emerging technologies offer promising avenues for improved accuracy and timeliness.

### Decoding community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and analysis of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in clinical trials [^111uqdQZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a frequent and potentially life-threatening condition. Even though the disease is common, evidence on CAP management is often of variable quality. This may be reinforced by the lack of a systematic and homogeneous way of defining the disease in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Objectives

This study aims to assess the diagnostic criteria and definitions of the term 'community-acquired' used in RCTs on CAP management.

Data Sources

On the basis of the protocol (PROSPERO 2019 CRD42019147411), we conducted a systematic search of Medline/PubMed and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials for RCTs published or registered between 2010 and 2024.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Study eligibility criteria included completed and ongoing RCTs.

Participants

Participants included adults hospitalized with CAP.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Data were collected using a tested extraction sheet, as endorsed by the Cochrane Collaboration. After cross-checking, data were synthesized in a narrative and tabular form.

Results

In total, 7173 records were identified through our searches. After removing records that did not fulfil the eligibility criteria, 170 studies were included. Diagnostic criteria were provided in 69.4% of studies, and the term 'community-acquired' was defined in 55.3% of studies. The most frequently included diagnostic criteria were pulmonary infiltrates (94.1%), cough (78.8%), fever (77.1%), dyspnoea (62.7%), sputum (57.6%), auscultation/percussion abnormalities (55.9%), and chest pain/discomfort (52.5%). The different criteria were used in 87 different sets across the studies. The term 'community-acquired' was defined in 57 different ways.

Conclusions

The diagnostic criteria and definitions of CAP in RCTs exhibit significant heterogeneity. Standardizing these criteria in clinical trials is crucial to ensure comparability across studies.

### Defining pneumonia in critically ill infants and children [^114tbKrG]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To define pneumonia in critically ill children in the intensive care unit setting for surveillance of infection and for the design, conduct, and evaluation of clinical trials in the prevention and therapy of lower respiratory tract infections in this population.

Design

Summary of the literature with review and consensus by experts in the field.

Results

A variety of diagnostic criteria from the medical literature, professional societies, and governmental health agencies and regulators were identified. Very few of these diagnostic criteria have been validated for use in children. We propose definitions for definite, possible, and probable pneumonia that build on identified definitions in the literature and use combinations of symptoms, signs, and laboratory criteria. Gaps in knowledge were identified.

Conclusions

Although pneumonia is one of the most common diagnoses in critically ill children, there have been few studies validating diagnostic criteria. Definitions for definite, probable, and possible community-acquired pneumonia and nosocomial pneumonia were achieved by consensus of experts based on guidelines from governmental agencies, professional organizations, and published literature. Future research should determine the utility of these definitions in the critically ill child and adapt them accordingly.

### Unravelling the complexity of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic methodological literature review of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in clinical research [^114yR8pQ]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This systematic review provides an overview of diagnostic criteria for VAP used in RCTs and the definitions attributed to the term "ventilator-associated". Our findings highlight the heterogeneity and lack of standardisation in commonly used diagnostic criteria, as well as the variability in definitions of "ventilator-associated" across clinical trials. We emphasise the need for a uniform definition of VAP to enable better comparability between studies and interventions. The results of this review will inform the work of an upcoming task force aimed at establishing such standardised criteria.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^113738cu]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Defining diagnostic criteria of immunocompromised host pneumonia emphasizes that "The definition of ICHP is predicated on a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia and host factors rather than on infectious etiology", while "pathogen identification is central to the appropriate management of ICHP". The report acknowledges that the definition is "limited by a lack of universally reportable markers of host immune dysfunction, [and] diagnostic criteria for ICHP are complicated by limitations in diagnostic tools", and notes that "The second part of the workshop focused on diagnostic criteria for ICHP", outlining that discussion of diagnostic technologies "is followed by a proposed diagnostic algorithm and clarifying statements".

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^117R91bn]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop — immunocompromised host pneumonia scope and rationale: Pneumonia imposes a significant clinical burden on people with immunocompromising conditions, and many individuals have compromised immunity due to cytotoxic cancer treatments, biological therapies, organ transplants, and immunodeficiencies. Despite awareness of increased infectious pneumonia risk, immunocompromised people are often excluded from pneumonia clinical guidelines and treatment trials. The report states that the absence of a widely accepted definition for immunocompromised host pneumonia hampers consistent clinical care and research, and describes an American Thoracic Society workshop with participants across pulmonary disease, infectious diseases, immunology, genetics, and laboratory medicine aiming to define this entity and its diagnostic criteria.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112hi12x]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Methods: A multidisciplinary panel conducted pragmatic systematic reviews of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. Results: The panel addressed 16 specific areas for recommendations spanning questions of diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, the availability of results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. Conclusions: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### How is pneumonia diagnosed in clinical stroke research? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1163ipLG]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Diagnosis of pneumonia complicating stroke is challenging, and there are currently no consensus diagnostic criteria. As a first step in developing such consensus-based diagnostic criteria, we undertook a systematic review to identify the existing diagnostic approaches to pneumonia in recent clinical stroke research to establish the variation in diagnosis and terminology.

Methods

Studies of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or both, which reported occurrence of pneumonia from January 2009 to March 2014, were considered and independently screened for inclusion by 2 reviewers after multiple searches using electronic databases. The primary analysis was to identify existing diagnostic approaches for pneumonia. Secondary analyses explored potential reasons for any heterogeneity where standard criteria for pneumonia had been applied.

Results

Sixty-four studies (56% ischemic stroke, 6% intracerebral hemorrhage, 38% both) of 639953 patients were included. Six studies (9%) reported no information on the diagnostic approach, whereas 12 (19%) used unspecified clinician-reported diagnosis or initiation of antibiotics. The majority used objective diagnostic criteria: 20 studies (31%) used respiratory or other published standard criteria; 26 studies (41%) used previously unpublished ad hoc criteria. The overall occurrence of pneumonia was 14.3% (95% confidence interval 13.2%-15.4%; I² = 98.9%). Occurrence was highest in studies applying standard criteria (19.1%; 95% confidence interval 15.1%-23.4%; I² = 98.5%). The substantial heterogeneity observed was not explained by stratifying for other potential confounders.

Conclusions

We found considerable variation in terminology and the diagnostic approach to pneumonia. Our review supports the need for consensus development of operational diagnostic criteria for pneumonia complicating stroke.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1132ERyy]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions — intended use and future directions for the immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) definition and algorithms are summarized as follows: The use of the proposed definition of ICHP and diagnostic algorithms is twofold: first, to provide a conceptual framework for clinicians to recognize and diagnose pneumonia in ICHs; second, to provide consistent criteria for the inclusion of ICH in clinical studies and interventional trials. By consensus, we anchor the definition of ICHP on the presence of a host immune defense disorder that precedes infectious pneumonia. The report highlights the need to identify additional quantifiable biomarkers and composite indices of immune impairment that more accurately reflect an individual's state of immunocompromise, notes that immunophenotyping of ICH populations and correlation with disease presentations and pathogen burden would allow for ICH risk stratification that could be translated to the clinic, and states that the development of more sensitive techniques in pathogen detection, such as metagenomics, alongside clinical immunophenotyping, will improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and aid the refinement of our understanding of ICHP. It further emphasizes that ICHPs are a vulnerable and underserved population whose care will benefit from clearer definitions and further investigations.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115qR2bM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: what is relevant and what is not? [^116LA8Eg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in North America. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for community-acquired pneumonia management.

Recent Findings

All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other atypical organisms, but clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens.

Summary

The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of community-acquired pneumonia prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.

### Unravelling the complexity of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic methodological literature review of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in clinical research [^116TJk1W]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol and registration

The protocol for this systematic review was registered in advance with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO 2019 CRD42019147411), encompassing a broad review focusing on pneumonia outcomes and diagnostic criteria in RCTs. Recognising the limitations of discussing all findings in one manuscript, we opted to produce several focused and comprehensive manuscripts, all employing the same fundamental methodology, as registered with PROSPERO. While a previous publication focused on outcomes reported in RCTs on pneumonia management, the current submission specifically addresses diagnostic criteria for VAP.

Eligibility criteria

We included RCTs that were registered, planned, and/or completed that: (1) enrolled adults with VAP; and (2) assessed the safety, efficacy and/or effectiveness of pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions for treating VAP.

We have excluded systematic reviews, meta-analyses, narrative reviews, post hoc analyses from RCTs, observational studies, case reports, editorials, conference proceedings, and studies that do not exclusively focus on pneumonia (such as trials including patients with pneumonia alongside other diseases). Additionally, studies on pneumonia subtypes other than VAP, such as pneumonia without specifying a subtype, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and HAP, have also been excluded. To maintain focus and relevance, studies on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were excluded from this systematic review, as the viral aetiology and distinct clinical management protocols differ significantly from the nature and treatment strategies of VAP. RCT protocols were only included if the results have not been previously published in another article included in this systematic review. Due to resource constraints and the lack of multilingual expertise within the review team, this systematic review was restricted to English-language RCTs.

Information sources and search

On 20 May 2024, we searched MEDLINE/PubMed, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for RCTs published between 1 January 2010 and 19 May 2024. We used electronic algorithms introducing a combination of controlled vocabulary and search terms as reported in the Appendix.

Study selection

Two reviewers (FH, MF) independently screened titles and abstracts to identify eligible studies using Rayyan. In case of disagreement, a third reviewer was consulted (AGM). After immediate exclusion of duplicates using EndNote X9, four reviewers (AGM, FH, JH, MF) independently checked for eligibility at full-text level. The results of the selection process are reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^116K5XcC]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) — definition and diagnostic criteria are explicitly stated: ICHP is defined as infectious pneumonia in individuals with a quantitative or functional host immune defense disorder, and diagnostic criteria include clinical suspicion of a lung infection, with or without compatible clinical signs and symptoms, together with radiographic evidence of a new or worsening pulmonary infiltrate. The page notes that an American Thoracic Society workshop was convened to define ICHP and develop diagnostic criteria for this entity.

### Unravelling the complexity of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic methodological literature review of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in clinical research [^113ktNqk]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Variations in the eligibility criteria applied to VAP can have a significant impact on systematic reviews and meta-analyses that assess different interventions, primarily due to the potential lack of comparability among the studied populations. Furthermore, the incidence of VAP may be underestimated when excessively strict diagnostic criteria are employed.

A recent systematic review conducted by Weiss et al. focused on inclusion and judgment criteria used in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on nosocomial pneumonia and found considerable heterogeneity. However, the authors only considered RCTs evaluating antimicrobial treatment as interventions, did not distinguish between hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and VAP, and did not evaluate definitions of the term "ventilator-associated".

The objective of this systematic review was to provide a concise overview of the diagnostic criteria for VAP recently used in RCTs, as well as the definitions attributed to the term "ventilator-associated". Its findings will provide valuable insights to a forthcoming task force, which aims to establish a uniform definition and diagnostic criteria for VAP in clinical trials. The task force will be made up of representatives from prominent international societies with an interest in VAP, as well as patient partners with lived experience. The harmonisation of the diagnostic criteria for VAP in upcoming clinical research are vital for enhancing patient care, enabling accurate epidemiological studies, and guiding successful antimicrobial stewardship programs.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112DXJyG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline — scope and initial questions: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), developed by a multidisciplinary panel that conducted pragmatic systematic reviews and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. The panel addressed 16 specific areas spanning diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions, formulating recommendations and rationale on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult CAP. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The contents highlight early diagnostic questions for adults with CAP, including whether Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions or blood cultures should be obtained at the time of diagnosis, and also list a third question beginning "Question 3: In Adults with CAP, Should Legionella and".

### An analysis of clinical predictive values for radiographic pneumonia in children [^113jDDFt]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

The development of sensitive and specific diagnostic clinical criteria for childhood pneumonia is imperative as chest radiography is not routinely available in many low- and middle-income countries. Previous systematic reviews evaluating the utility of symptoms and physical examination findings for the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia have relied on data reported in published articles, without access to individual patient-level data. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of these investigations were conducted in high-income countries. The reliance on predetermined cut-points from published articles for clinical criteria such as respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SpO₂) may lead to imprecision in the analysis of diagnostic clinical criteria for childhood pneumonia.

With the aim of better understanding the clinical diagnostic criteria for childhood pneumonia, the WHO established the Pneumonia REsearch Partnership to Assess WHO Recommendations (PREPARE) study group. The PREPARE study group obtained patient-level data from 30 study groups, comprising 41 separate datasets on childhood pneumonia from across the world. Using the large, representative PREPARE dataset, our objective was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of key clinical features and combination of clinical features in the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia against a radiological reference standard. Accurate identification of children with pneumonia using clinical factors could potentially allow providers to more accurately diagnose childhood pneumonia and, subsequently, more appropriately target antibiotic therapy.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1171zyyb]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia clarifying statements define qualifying conditions and risks, stating that "The host immune defense disorder is present at the time of infection", that "Transient impairment of immune function, as may occur in the setting of severe sepsis, is not sufficient for the patient to be considered inherently immunocompromised", and that "Patients who have a history of immunocompromising conditions that have resolved should not be considered ICHs". They add that "Systemic conditions with known metabolic effects on immune function should be considered comorbidities but not immunocompromise-defining conditions", and "Persons of advanced age, a population at increased risk for pneumonia, would not be considered ICH under the proposed definition, as increased susceptibility to pneumonia is not synonymous with immunocompromise". Non-immune conditions are excluded because "Mechanical and structural lung diseases that increase the risk for pneumonia are not included in this definition of ICHP", and "Although these conditions add additional risk for pneumonia, they are not systemic immune defects". Regarding infection patterns, "The host immune defense disorder increases the individual's risk for more frequent or severe disease caused by common community pathogens", and "CAP in ICHs with typical organisms, such as S. pneumoniae, can present with more frequent, severe, prolonged, or recurrent manifestations compared with immunocompetent persons". They also note that "The host immune defense disorder increases the risk of pneumonia because of uncommon or opportunistic pathogens", and that an ICH with pneumonia "warrants consideration of additional diagnostic and/or alternative therapeutic strategies beyond those recommended in pneumonia guidelines", with the reminder that "Opportunistic and multiorganism infections can occur… pursuing the identification of a specific etiology is important while considering empiric coverage for patients who are ICHs on the basis of the underlying immune impairment".

### Unravelling the complexity of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic methodological literature review of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in clinical research [^1174NG85]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) stands as the most prevalent and serious hospital-acquired infection observed in intensive care units. VAP prolongs hospital stays, durations of mechanical ventilation, and is associated with considerable mortality and an increase in healthcare costs.

Diagnosing VAP can be challenging for clinicians as it shares clinical signs and symptoms with other forms of pneumonia as well as non-infectious conditions. The most recent international clinical guidelines define VAP as the presence of respiratory infection signs combined with new radiographic infiltrates in a patient who has been ventilated for at least 48 h. While the guidelines developed by ERS/ESICM/ESCMID/ALAT do not provide a detailed definition of signs of respiratory infection, the ATS/IDSA guidelines mention that clinical signs may include the new onset of fever, purulent sputum, leucocytosis, and decline in oxygenation. However, the ATS/IDSA guideline panel also acknowledges that there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of VAP. This lack of a standardised definition is further highlighted by the varying, surveillance-based definitions of VAP provided by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). These definitions, focusing on a combination of clinical, radiological, and microbiological signs to identify cases of VAP, were established to standardise reporting and facilitate the monitoring of infections in healthcare settings. However, the criteria given by the CDC and ECDC may not always align with the diagnostic criteria used by clinicians to confirm or rule out the condition.

### The definition of pneumonia, the assessment of severity, and clinical standardization in the pneumonia etiology research for child health study [^116y1Fjb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the fact that pneumonia is the most common cause of serious illness and death in young children worldwide, our ability, as clinicians, to infer an infectious pathological process in the lung from specific features of the history and examination is poor. Many common conditions of childhood, including malaria, bacterial sepsis, and severe anemia, produce a spectrum of clinical symptoms and signs that overlaps significantly with pneumonia, and differentiating between these conditions is challenging. In adults, the definition of pneumonia relies heavily on characteristic changes on the chest radiograph. However, many children who have suggestive clinical signs of pneumonia and who respond to appropriate antibiotics do not have any abnormalities on the chest radiograph taken at the onset of the illness; furthermore, radiological facilities are not always available in developing countries. In short, there is no single definition of pneumonia in childhood that is sensitive, specific, and can be widely implemented.

This article describes the clinical features and classifications available to define pneumonia in children and reports the rationale for the definition adopted by the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study and the process by which that definition was developed and is being standardized across the 7 PERCH sites.

Methods

Search strategy

We performed a systematic search for articles reporting the diagnostic value of items from history and/or physical examination and/or additional diagnostic tests for diagnosing pneumonia. We searched the databases PubMed and Embase without restriction in date of publication and language. Search terms included Mesh terms and free text terms on respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, clinical and laboratory test, infant or child, and ambulatory care or primary care. Full search strategy is listed in Appendix 1. The first search was undertaken in November 2016 and was updated in November 2017. We checked reference lists of all retrieved articles. The study was registered with PROSPERO.

Study selection

Two independent reviewers performed selection. Selection was done in two rounds, first based on titles and abstracts (performed by W.G.G. and M.J.C.S.), and in the second round, based on the full text article (performed by A.R.J.D. and M.J.C.S.). In case of doubt or conflict, a third reviewer (J.W.L.C.) was consulted.

Inclusion criteria for further evaluation are summarized in Box 1. We only included studies on children aged 0–12 years. Pneumonia was defined as radiological-confirmed pneumonia on CXR. We only included index tests that are currently available as point-of-care tests or have the possibility to soon be available as such a test, following the international consented definition for point-of-care tests in a primary care: "a test to support clinical decision making, which is performed by a qualified member of the practice staff nearby the patient and on any part of the patient's body or its derivatives, during or very close to the time of consultation, to help the patient and physician to decide upon the best suited approach, and of which the results should be known at the time of the clinical decision making". Further specified inclusion criteria were formulated for study design, population and setting; reported outcomes; and use of index tests and reference standard (Box 1).

Consensus statement — immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) diagnosis requires clinical suspicion of a lung infection, with or without compatible clinical signs and symptoms, and with radiographic evidence of a new or worsening pulmonary infiltrate; the panel determined that the formal diagnostic criteria for ICHP would be best presented as an algorithm, with an approach for hosts with a known immune defect determined by compatible clinical presentation, possible pathogen identification, and exclusion of competing causes of the clinical, microbiologic, and radiographic manifestations, and an alternate algorithm for patients without previously known immune defects who present with evidence of pneumonia caused by an unusual opportunistic pathogen; additionally, clarifying statement 1 notes that clinical presentations of pneumonia are often atypical in immunocompromised hosts, therefore signs and symptoms of pneumonia are not required.

CHRONIC PNEUMONIA

Children with chronic respiratory symptoms are likely to have a different spectrum of pathological processes. However, if their disease is sufficiently severe to warrant admission and to meet the definition of severe or very severe pneumonia, then acute pneumonia may be a component of their illness. The underlying etiology of this group may be different, and such differences will be drawn out in the analysis on the basis of length of history, but there are no exclusion criteria in PERCH based on the duration of symptoms.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

- clinical signs and symptoms, such as dyspnea and/or cough, fever, hypoxemia, chest pain

- imaging findings compatible with PCP, preferably chest CT

- with or without unexplained serum LDH elevation.

### Factors associated with pneumonia severity in children: a systematic review [^115t58aL]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia in children is associated with significant morbidity and mortality; however, data are limited in predicting which children will have negative outcomes, including clinical deterioration, severe disease, or development of complications. The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (PIDS/IDSA) pediatric pneumonia guideline includes criteria that were modified from adult criteria and define pneumonia severity to assist with resource allocation and site-of-care decision-making. However, the PIDS/IDSA criteria have not been formally developed or validated in children. Definitions for mild, moderate, and severe pneumonia also vary across the literature, further complicating the development of standardized severity criteria. This systematic review summarizes (1) the current state of the evidence for defining and predicting pneumonia severity in children as well as (2) emerging evidence focused on risk stratification of children with pneumonia.

### Clinical performance of existing diagnostic criteria for pneumonia in older emergency patients: a prospective cohort study [^114Z96rf]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumonia accounts for over half a million older adult emergency department (ED) visits annually, but ED pneumonia diagnosis is inaccurate. Geriatric-specific pneumonia diagnostic criteria exist for other settings; no prospective data exist to determine if application in the older adult ED population is feasible. The objective was to prospectively evaluate the utility of four current diagnostic criteria (Loeb; Modified McGeer; Infectious Disease Society of America/American Thoracic Society; American College of Emergency Physicians) in older adult ED patients.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational cohort study of older adult ED patients ≥ 65years of age in two U.S. EDs with suspected pneumonia defined as having chest radiography ordered and treating physician suspicion. The standard we used for defining the presence, absence, or inability to determine a diagnosis of pneumonia diagnosis was expert physician chart adjudication. We report the summary statistics for demographic characteristics and symptoms/exam findings and sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals of the existing diagnostic criteria. Pre-specified cutoff values of a positive LR > 10 and a negative LR < 0.3 were considered clinically significant.

Results

Of 135 patients enrolled, 27 had pneumonia by adjudicator review. Typical patient-reported pneumonia symptoms, such as fever (18.5%) and new/worse cough (51.9%), were not consistently present in pneumonia. The IDSA/ATS and ACEP criteria had positive LR > 10 and negative LR < 0.3; however, all confidence intervals included pre-specified cutoffs.

Conclusions

Older adults presented to the ED with low frequency of typical pneumonia symptoms. Although existing diagnostic definitions had promising test characteristics, they may not perform well enough for clinical application without refinement.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) severity assessment for hospitalized adults — use "the IDSA/ATS 2007 minor severity criteria… together with clinical judgment to guide the need for higher levels of treatment intensity (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)". The guideline states, "We recommend the 2007 IDSA/ATS severe CAP criteria over other published scores", with performance data: "one major or three minor criteria had a pooled sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 78% for predicting ICU admission", while "a threshold of three or more minor criteria… had a pooled sensitivity of 56% and specificity of 91%". For SMART-COP, there was "pooled sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 64%… but also uses PaO₂, and pH, which are not universally available for real-time clinical decision-making", and comparisons reported "equivalence… and another reported a significantly greater performance of the IDSA/ATS minor criteria", with "No randomized studies" evaluating illness-severity tools as decision aids for inpatient intensity of treatment.

### Systematic review of studies investigating ventilator associated pneumonia diagnostics in intensive care [^111fuXxG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is an important diagnosis in critical care. VAP research is complicated by the lack of agreed diagnostic criteria and reference standard test criteria. Our aim was to review which reference standard tests are used to evaluate novel index tests for suspected VAP.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive search using electronic databases and hand reference checks. The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINHAL, EMBASE, and web of science were searched from 2008 until November 2018. All terms related to VAP diagnostics in the intensive treatment unit were used to conduct the search. We adopted a checklist from the critical appraisal skills programme checklist for diagnostic studies to assess the quality of the included studies.

Results

We identified 2441 records, of which 178 were selected for full-text review. Following methodological examination and quality assessment, 44 studies were included in narrative data synthesis. Thirty-two (72.7%) studies utilised a sole microbiological reference standard; the remaining 12 studies utilised a composite reference standard, nine of which included a mandatory microbiological criterion. Histopathological criteria were optional in four studies but mandatory in none.

Conclusions

Nearly all reference standards for VAP used in diagnostic test research required some microbiological confirmation of infection, with BAL culture being the most common reference standard used.

### Pneumonia: challenges in the definition, diagnosis, and management of disease [^1122AJi7]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Defining health care-associated pneumonia, which includes both hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), is problematic and controversial. Aspiration pneumonia is often included as a subtype of HAP but may be related to community-acquired aspiration events. Scoring systems exist and new surveillance guidelines have been implemented to make early recognition of pneumonia more precise and objective. Management and prevention should follow recommendations, including early empirical therapy, targeted therapy, and limited duration of treatment. Patients with trauma present a challenge to the diagnosis and management of pneumonia, because of increased risk for aspiration and underlying chest and pulmonary injury.

CHALLENGES IN CURRENT PNEUMONIA ETIOLOGY STUDIES

Case Definitions Defining Different Syndromes

Unlike case definitions for acute gastroenteritis and febrile illness that are based on the presence of a specific symptom (eg, diarrhea) or sign (eg, fever), case definitions for pneumonia define a syndrome that is irreducible to a single, or even a constellation of, signs and/or symptoms. As already mentioned, WHO created a standardized clinical case management definition for children with suspected pneumonia in the 1980s, placing a priority on sensitivity rather than the specificity achieved in earlier radiologically based definitions. Throughout this article, we refer to sensitivity of a case definition (or test) as the percentage of all children with pneumonia who are identified. On the other hand, specificity refers to the percentage of all children without pneumonia who do not meet a case definition (or did not have a positive test result). High sensitivity usually comes at the expense of misdiagnosing some children without pneumonia as having pneumonia (false positives); high specificity usually comes at the expense of missing some children who have pneumonia (false negatives). Although the WHO's sensitive case definition was developed to maximize the likelihood that children with pneumonia would be treated with antibiotics in peripheral health facilities that lack radiologic capacity, it has been co-opted for use in many pneumonia etiology and disease burden studies. Using the WHO case management definitions results in misclassification, an acceptable consequence in the clinical setting, but a problematic one in the research setting. Many children with conditions other than pneumonia (eg, sepsis, malaria, upper respiratory tract infections) will be included as pneumonia cases; the pathogens detected in these children will therefore be falsely ascribed as causing pneumonia. Another problem is the variety of pneumonia case definitions used in etiology studies. In a review of pneumonia etiology studies done since the year 2000, 61% of the 153 studies used WHO clinical case definitions. However, even among these studies, not all chose the same definition, with some including definitions for "very severe pneumonia", some "severe pneumonia", and some "nonsevere pneumonia". Half also required the presence of a chest radiographic abnormality, whereas others required evidence of acute infection (eg, fever, leukocytosis). Just under half of the studies included children with wheezing, which is likely to include more cases with viral infections. Some studies side-stepped all of these rule-based definitions by using a definition of "physician-diagnosed pneumonia". Such heterogeneity in case definitions leads to incomparability of etiology results.

### The definition of pneumonia, the assessment of severity, and clinical standardization in the pneumonia etiology research for child health study [^112VVcKL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

World Health Organization Clinical Case Definition of Pneumonia

During the 1980s, pediatricians and public health physicians recognized that it was necessary to define, in terms easily memorable to primary HCWs, the clinical features that justified antibiotic use in children with potential pneumonia. A series of studies was undertaken in developing countries to examine the sensitivity and specificity of clinical symptoms and signs of pneumonia: these included a history of cough or breathlessness, inability to feed, raised respiratory rate, lower chest wall indrawing, fever, and tachycardia (Table 1). In 1990, the World Health Organization (WHO) reviewed the available evidence and produced a guideline that has been the foundation of pneumonia detection in developing countries ever since.

Table 1.
Studies of Childhood Pneumonia Contributing to the Formulation of the World Health Organization Clinical Case Definition

The WHO algorithm is applied to children who present with cough or difficulty breathing. These were introduced as "signs", suggesting that they are observed by HCWs, although in practice they are elicited more commonly as part of the clinical history from the parent. Fever was considered as a screening sign, but it lacked both sensitivity and specificity for pneumonia. Once captured by the entry definition, the rest of the algorithm is based around 3 management decisions: (1) Children with pneumonia are treated with antibiotics, (2) those with severe pneumonia are referred to the hospital, and (3) those with very severe pneumonia are treated with oxygen therapy.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) — diagnostic criteria and imaging: Clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, cough, sputum production, and hypoxemia should prompt evaluation with chest imaging, but these signs are not always present in immunocompromised hosts. Radiographic abnormalities are required for a diagnosis of infectious pneumonia, and given multiple nonpulmonary causes in this population, findings consistent with an infection on imaging must be present for ICHP diagnosis. In immunocompromised hosts, lung infiltrates may not be evident by chest X-ray and may require a computed tomography scan for detection, and noninfectious pulmonary conditions must be distinguished from infection; immunocompromised hosts may have concurrent infectious and noninfectious etiologies of lung infiltrates.

### New diagnostic methods for pneumonia in the ICU [^115327qK]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumonia leading to severe sepsis and critical illness including respiratory failure remains a common and therapeutically challenging diagnosis. Current clinical approaches to surveillance, early detection, and conventional culture-based microbiology are inadequate for optimal targeted antibiotic treatment and stewardship. Efforts to enhance diagnosis of community-acquired and health care-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), are the focus of recent studies reviewed here.

Recent Findings

Newer surveillance definitions are sensitive for pneumonia in the ICU including VAP but consistently underdetect patients that are clinically shown to have bacterial VAP based on clinical diagnostic criteria and response to antibiotic treatment. Routinely measured plasma biomarkers, including procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, lack sufficient precision and predictive accuracy to inform diagnosis. Novel rapid microbiological diagnostics, including nucleic-acid amplification, mass spectrometry, and fluorescence microscopy-based technologies are promising approaches for the future. Exhaled breath biomarkers, including measurement of volatile organic compounds, represent a future approach.

Summary

The integration of novel diagnostics for rapid microbial identification, resistance phenotyping, and antibiotic sensitivity testing into usual care practice could significantly transform the care of patients and potentially inform significantly improved targeted antimicrobial selection, de-escalation, and stewardship.

### Atypical pneumonia – time to breathe new life into a useful term? [^115GqbRu]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

The term atypical pneumonia was originally used to describe an unusual presentation of pneumonia. It is now more widely used in reference to either pneumonia caused by a relatively common group of pathogens, or to a distinct clinical syndrome the existence of which is difficult to demonstrate. As such, the use of atypical pneumonia is often inaccurate, potentially confusing, and of dubious scientific merit. We need to return to the original meaning of atypical pneumonia and restrict its use to describe pneumonia that is truly unusual in clinical presentation, epidemiology, or both.

---

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia: what's in a name? [^113heNcV]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Formerly, patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit were considered as having the severe form of the disease. Recently, guidelines have distinguished severe and non-severe community-acquired pneumonia based on clinical definitions. In this review, we describe the different definitions of severe community-acquired pneumonia, and whether a differentiation based on these definitions reflects variation in etiology, risk factors, diagnostic approaches and treatment.

Recent Findings

New definitions do not seem to accurately identify patients with high risks of mortality; patients not admitted to an intensive care unit could also be diagnosed as having severe community-acquired pneumonia. Host-factors, such as genetic factors and underlying diseases, can influence severity of presentation of community-acquired pneumonia. Distribution of pathogens in severe and non-severe disease forms is comparable. Initial antibiotic therapy in patients with severe disease should provide coverage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, as delay is associated with worse outcomes. However, recent studies also suggested an additional benefit of atypical coverage in non-severe disease. As a result, initial therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or an anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolone is recommended for all patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, the value of vaccination against pneumococci to prevent episodes of severe disease is yet unknown.

Summary

As current guidelines do not adequately identify patients with high risk of mortality and intensive care unit admittance, clinical judgment remains important. Based on distribution of pathogens, investigational procedures and therapy recommended in recent guidelines, differentiation between severe and non-severe community-acquired pneumonia does not seem useful. Whether atypical coverage indeed has additional value in non-severe or pneumococcal CAP, however, remains to be determined. In addition, the preventive benefit of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination for development of SCAP awaits further evidence.

### Atypical pneumonia: definition, causes, and imaging features [^111Dk6Ny]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is among the most common causes of death worldwide. The epidemiologic and clinical heterogeneity of pneumonia results in challenges in diagnosis and treatment. There is inconsistency in the definition of the group of microorganisms that cause "atypical pneumonia". Nevertheless, the use of this term in the medical and radiologic literature is common. Among the causes of community-acquired pneumonia, atypical bacteria are responsible for approximately 15% of cases. Zoonotic and nonzoonotic bacteria, as well as viruses, have been considered among the causes of atypical pneumonia in a patient who is immunocompetent and have been associated with major community outbreaks of respiratory infection, with relevant implications in public health policies. Considering the difficulty of isolating atypical microorganisms and the significant overlap in clinical manifestations, a targeted empirical therapy is not possible. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of atypical pneumonia, as in many cases its findings may first suggest the possibility of an atypical infection. Clarifying and unifying the definition of atypical pneumonia among the medical community, including radiologists, are of extreme importance. The prompt diagnosis and prevention of community spread of some atypical microorganisms can have a relevant impact on local, regional, and global health policies. © RSNA, 2021.

### Diagnostic value of signs, symptoms and diagnostic tests for diagnosing pneumonia in ambulant children in developed countries: a systematic review [^115g2Y1v]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Data extraction

One author (M.J.C.S.) extracted the data. Study characteristics (year of publication, study setting, age of study population, percentage of children with pneumonia, and total size of study population) and use of reference test and index tests (definitions, procedures) were noted on predefined forms. All clinical evaluations and all laboratory tests or imaging techniques that are available for point-of-care testing or may be available in ambulant care in the near future were considered as index tests and data on each index test were individually extracted per article. Signs and symptoms with different cutoff values were considered as separate index tests. Combinations of tests and clinical prediction rules were not considered in this review.

Analysis

From the raw data extracted from each study, we constructed two-by-two tables and calculated the relevant measures of diagnostic accuracy, i.e. sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for each individual index test. When extracted data were insufficient to make these calculations, authors from the original studies were contacted and asked to provide more details. Given the aim of our study, results include both NPV and PPV. In a setting of low prevalence of pneumonia such as primary care, ruling out pneumonia is most relevant, making the NPV a more important diagnostic value of a test. In a setting such as an emergency care, both values may be of equal importance, but priority may be on ruling in pneumonia. This makes the PPV of the index test of higher importance.

Because of the wide range of pneumonia prevalence in different settings, diagnostic values of individual index tests are presented separately for studies with low prevalence of pneumonia (≤ 10%) and for studies with a high prevalence of pneumonia (> 10%). With expected high heterogeneity between studies, we planned meta-analysis if at least four studies with comparable inclusion criteria and comparable settings reported on an index test.

### Analysis of diagnostic criteria for ECMO-associated pneumonia [^112G9SmN]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a well-established cause of morbidity and mortality. Current VAP research and National Health Safety Network (NHSN) definitions exclude patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). As use of ECMO grows, we must recognize and prevent pneumonia in this population. A meta-analysis reported ECMO-associated pneumonia occurred in 24.4 cases/1000 ECMO days, and smaller studies report an incidence of 55–74% in ECMO patients. Without an agreed-upon definition, many studies used diagnostic criteria for VAP to approximate pneumonia in ECMO.

Traditional diagnostic criteria for VAP may be unreliable in ECMO patients. First, they ignore important ECMO parameters: flow and sweep. During ECMO, blood is removed from the body, oxygenated and ventilated, then returned to the patient. To improve oxygenation, ECMO flow is increased. To improve ventilation, ECMO sweep is increased. Changes in these are important indicators of oxygenation and ventilation. Additionally, there is movement towards early weaning from mechanical ventilation for patients on ECMO, making diagnostic criteria for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (PVAP), such as FiO₂ and PEEP values, obsolete. Traditional signs of infection may be unreliable, as the extracorporeal circulation can mask fever and confound systemic inflammatory markers. Finally, chest radiography, incorporated in some definitions, may be subjective and limited in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or chest trauma requiring VV ECMO.

We must consider new diagnostic criteria for ECMO-associated pneumonia (EAP) to promote quality, document outcomes, and allow research. In this study, we perform a retrospective analysis to assess current NHSN PVAP definitions as diagnostic criteria for pneumonia in ECMO. We propose new EAP criteria, incorporating inflammatory, microbiologic, and ECMO data. We then test the criteria's ability to diagnose and predict pneumonia in a clinically adjudicated cohort of ECMO patients with pneumonia.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116Kxyq1]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute bronchitis" for acute bronchitis.

The diagnostic criteria for acute bronchitis serve as a clinical tool for identifying patients with this common respiratory condition. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby guiding appropriate treatment and management strategies.

The diagnostic criteria for acute bronchitis are based on four key components. The first component is the presence of symptoms indicative of an acute respiratory infection, predominantly cough, with or without sputum production. The second component is the duration of these symptoms, which should be less than three weeks. The third component involves ruling out pneumonia, both clinically and radiographically, as the cause of the cough. The final component requires the exclusion of other potential causes of the cough, such as the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The diagnosis of acute bronchitis is considered likely if all four components are met. Conversely, if these criteria are not fully met, the diagnosis of acute bronchitis is considered unlikely. This diagnostic tool thus provides a structured approach to the clinical assessment of patients presenting with cough and other symptoms suggestive of a respiratory infection, helping to distinguish acute bronchitis from other respiratory conditions.

The diagnostic criteria for determining the likelihood of acute bronchitis involve assessing four key factors. The diagnostic tool articulates these factors as follows:

- Symptoms of an acute respiratory infection, specifically a cough, with or without sputum production.
- Symptoms persisting for less than 3 weeks.
- Exclusion of pneumonia as the cause of the cough, established through clinical evaluation and radiographic evidence.
- Elimination of other potential causes for the cough, such as the common cold, acute asthma, or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

For evaluating the likelihood of acute bronchitis, the diagnostic process simplifies to checking each of these criteria. If all four criteria are confirmed as true, it suggests that acute bronchitis is likely. Conversely, if any of these criteria are not met, the likelihood of acute bronchitis is considered improbable.

This structured approach aids in distinguishing acute bronchitis from other conditions that might present similar respiratory symptoms, providing a clear pathway for diagnosis based on clinical markers and exclusions.

### Testing strategies in the initial management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^11331Ns8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The initial management of patients suspected of having community-acquired pneumonia is challenging because of the broad range of clinical presentations, potential life-threatening nature of the illness, and associated high costs of care. The initial testing strategies should accurately establish a diagnosis and prognosis in order to determine the optimal treatment strategy. The diagnosis is important in determining the need for antibiotic therapy, and the prognosis is important in determining the site of care. This paper reviews the test characteristics of the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, individually and in combination, in diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia and predicting short-term risk for death from the infection. In addition, we consider the implications of these test characteristics from the perspective of decision thresholds. The history and physical examination cannot provide a high level of certainty in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, but the absence of vital sign abnormalities substantially reduces the probability of the infection. Chest radiography is considered the gold standard for pneumonia diagnosis; however, we do not know its sensitivity and specificity, and we have limited data on the costs of false-positive and false-negative results. In the absence of empirical evidence, the decision to order a chest radiograph needs to rely on expert opinion in seeking strategies to optimize the balance between harms and benefits. Once community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed, a combination of history, physical examination, and laboratory items can help estimate the short-term risk for death and, along with the patient's psychosocial characteristics, determine the appropriate site of treatment.

### Diagnostic value of signs, symptoms and diagnostic tests for diagnosing pneumonia in ambulant children in developed countries: a systematic review [^115DJLvH]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory tract infections in children are very common and one of the most important reasons to consult the general practitioner (GP), pediatrician, or emergency physician in developed countries. – Most children will suffer from a non-serious, self-limiting infection, but it is important to adequately identify a child with pneumonia. Even in high-income countries including the UK and USA, lower respiratory tract infection is estimated to cause around 34 deaths per 100,000 children per year and cost 173,000 disability-adjusted life-years per year in children aged < 5 years. However, correctly identifying an ambulant child with pneumonia warranting prescription of antibiotics is difficult. – Consequently, overprescription of antibiotics is common. – Antibiotics may cause side effects, increase re-consultation rates, and repeated use of antibiotics increases antimicrobial resistance in communities and individuals.

Diagnostic uncertainty plays an important role in overprescription of antibiotics in children. –, Physicians in ambulatory settings still mainly rely on history taking and clinical examination for diagnosis and management decisions. With developing technology, access to additional diagnostic tests in ambulatory settings is increasing, with tests also becoming available as point-of-care tests. For example, point-of-care C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement is increasingly available and recommended by guidelines to aid in diagnosis and management of pneumonia in adults. – Although there is currently no accurate biomarker available to distinguish between a bacterial or viral infection, biomarkers may support correct identification of children at risk of serious infections in ambulatory care. This might help primary care physicians decide which children with suspected pneumonia need to be more closely monitored or who might benefit from antibiotic treatment.

### Diagnostic value of signs, symptoms and diagnostic tests for diagnosing pneumonia in ambulant children in developed countries: a systematic review [^114Fqmp7]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews have reported separately on the diagnostic value of clinical features, and laboratory teststo identify children with serious infections including pneumonia. These reviews identified shortness of breath, increased work of breathing, and hypoxemia as most important to identify the presence of pneumonia. However, a lack of evidence particularly to identify children with serious infections in primary care was identified. Currently available decision rules for pneumonia showed value in ruling out the need for hospitalization in a child with suspected pneumonia. The rate of false positives when applying this decision rule is high. These decision rules do not aid the physician in identifying the ambulatory child in need of antibiotics. To our knowledge, a systematic review integrating information on all signs, symptoms, and additional tests currently available in ambulatory settings to diagnose pneumonia has not been performed.

The aim of this study was to therefore systematically identify and summarize available evidence of the diagnostic value of signs, symptoms, and additional diagnostic tests for confirming pneumonia or safely ruling it out in ambulant children with signs of a respiratory tract infection in developed countries.

### An analysis of clinical predictive values for radiographic pneumonia in children [^115QVXVr]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children 1–59 months of age worldwide. Annually, there are over 800 000 deaths from pneumonia among children worldwide. Such morbidity and mortality from childhood pneumonia disproportionately affects children in low-income and middle-income countries, with nearly 90% of pneumonia-related deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeastern Asia alone. Despite the large global burden of disease of childhood pneumonia, a commonly agreed upon standardised approach to the diagnosis of pneumonia is lacking.

The diagnosis of childhood pneumonia is often established based on clinical findings, as the definitive diagnosis can only be made using invasive testing such as lung biopsies, which are reserved for patients in whom traditional therapeutics have failed. As such, chest radiography is often used in clinical practice for the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia and has been used as a reference standard in previous investigations. In a large, multicountry study in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, chest radiography correlated with clinically diagnosed pneumonia in over half of patients included. Nevertheless, the routine use of chest radiography for the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia in the outpatient setting is not recommended by the Infectious Disease Society of America. Similarly, the World Health Organization's (WHO) integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) chart booklet used in many low-income and middle-income countries, recommends the diagnosis of pneumonia be made clinically, with reliance on tachypnoea or lower chest indrawing in a child with cough or difficulty breathing. However, recent analyses suggest that the sensitivity (54%–62%) and specificity (59%–64%) of tachypnoea and sensitivity (38%–48%) and specificity (72%–80%) of lower chest indrawing is lower than originally estimated. Concerns around the low specificity of the WHO pneumonia signs, and potential excess antibiotic prescribing, prompted further evaluation of these clinical criteria for the diagnosis of pneumonia in children.

### Rethinking the concepts of community-acquired and health-care-associated pneumonia [^116eSY19]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

The increasing numbers of patients who are elderly and severely disabled has led to the introduction of a new category of pneumonia management: health-care-associated pneumonia (HCAP). An analysis of the available evidence in support of this category, however, reveals heterogeneous and misleading definitions of HCAP, reliance on microbiological data of questionable validity, failure to recognise the contribution of aspiration pneumonia, failure to control microbial patterns for functional status, and failure to recognise frequently applied restrictions of treatment escalation as bias in assessing outcomes. As a result, the concept of HCAP contributes to confusion more than it provides a guide to pneumonia management, and it potentially leads to overtreatment. We suggest a reassignment of the criteria for HCAP to reconstruct the triad of community-acquired pneumonia (with a recognised core group of elderly and disabled patients and a subgroup of younger patients), hospital-acquired pneumonia, and pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients.

Recently published guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia are reviewed for recommendations regarding diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy to assess the implications for development of future clinical trials. Despite some differences (mostly related to likely pathogens), there is a general agreement about the recommended approach to management. All of the reviewed guidelines invariably recommend early, appropriate antimicrobial therapy and avoidance of excessive antimicrobials by deescalation of therapy on the basis of microbiological culture results and the clinical response of the patient. Developers of future clinical trials will need to be mindful of these recommendations to maintain best practice care for each investigator.

Procalcitonin (PCT) plus clinical criteria — diagnostic accuracy and panel stance for suspected HAP/VAP indicate high misclassification and no survival benefit from a PCT-guided escalation protocol. The false-negative and false-positive rates of serum PCT testing plus clinical criteria are 33% and 17%, respectively; assuming a prevalence of HAP/VAP of 50%, then for every 1000 patients with suspected HAP/VAP who are evaluated with serum PCT plus clinical criteria, 165 patients (16.5%) would be incorrectly diagnosed as not having HAP/VAP and 85 patients (8.5%) will be incorrectly diagnosed as having HAP/VAP. A recent trial randomized ICU patients to a PCT-guided antibiotic escalation protocol vs standard of care showed that the PCT-guided protocol did not result in survival improvement, but resulted in a higher number of ventilator-days and prolonged ICU stay. The panel agreed that the frequency of such undesirable consequences due to misleading PCT results was unacceptable and, therefore, recommended not using PCT to guide antibiotic initiation.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia — microbiologic testing and invasive evaluation: Diagnosis of ICHP does not require detection of a causative microorganism, and timely identification of an etiology should not delay empiric therapy if prompt treatment is dictated by the clinical situation; however, concerted efforts should be made to identify a specific pathogen through available culture-dependent and -independent methods. This often involves bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and/or transbronchial biopsies to evaluate for typical and opportunistic pathogens as well as alternative noninfectious diagnoses. Identification of an opportunistic organism in the lungs should prompt evaluation for an underlying host immune defect, and detection of an unusual pathogen in an apparently normal host may indicate an underlying immune defect; examples include invasive aspergillosis without apparent risk factors prompting investigation into PID because of inborn errors of immunity.

### The enduring challenge of determining pneumonia etiology in children: considerations for future research priorities [^113A6xvm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Pneumonia kills more children each year worldwide than any other disease. Nonetheless, accurately determining the causes of childhood pneumonia has remained elusive. Over the past century, the focus of pneumonia etiology research has shifted from studies of lung aspirates and postmortem specimens intent on identifying pneumococcal disease to studies of multiple specimen types distant from the lung that are tested for multiple pathogens. Some major challenges facing modern pneumonia etiology studies include the use of nonspecific and variable case definitions, poor access to pathologic lung tissue and to specimens from fatal cases, poor diagnostic accuracy of assays (especially when testing nonpulmonary specimens), and the interpretation of results when multiple pathogens are detected in a given individual. The future of childhood pneumonia etiology research will likely require integrating data from complementary approaches, including applications of advanced molecular diagnostics and vaccine probe studies, as well as a renewed emphasis on lung aspirates from radiologically confirmed pneumonia and postmortem examinations.

### Adding fever to WHO criteria for diagnosing pneumonia enhances the ability to identify pneumonia cases among wheezing children [^111XVs2f]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the ability of the criteria proposed by the WHO to identify pneumonia among cases presenting with wheezing and the extent to which adding fever to the criteria alters their performance.

Design

Prospective classification of 390 children aged 2–59 months with lower respiratory tract disease into five diagnostic categories, including pneumonia. WHO criteria for the identification of pneumonia and a set of such criteria modified by adding fever were compared with radiographically diagnosed pneumonia as the gold standard.

Results

The sensitivity of the WHO criteria was 94% for children aged < 24 months and 62% for those aged ≥ 24 months. The corresponding specificities were 20% and 16%. Adding fever to the WHO criteria improved specificity substantially (to 44% and 50%, respectively). The specificity of the WHO criteria was poor for children with wheezing (12%). Adding fever improved this substantially (to 42%). The addition of fever to the criteria apparently reduced their sensitivity only marginally (to 92% and 57%, respectively, in the two age groups).

Conclusion

The authors' results reaffirm that the current WHO criteria can detect pneumonia with high sensitivity, particularly among younger children. They present evidence that the ability of these criteria to distinguish between children with pneumonia and those with wheezing diseases might be greatly enhanced by the addition of fever.

### Recommendations for pneumonia in hospitalized children with neurologic impairment [^1137RW5c]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Children with neurologic impairment (CNI) are commonly hospitalized with pneumonia but are often excluded from practice guidelines. We sought to develop evidence-based, expert-panel endorsed recommendations for the care of CNI hospitalized with pneumonia.

Methods

We conducted an extensive literature search that formed the basis of drafted candidate recommendations for diagnostic testing, antimicrobial treatment, airway clearance, and discharge criteria. We convened a national panel of individuals with expertise in nursing, pediatric medicine (infectious diseases, pulmonology, hospital medicine, complex care), and family advocacy. Using the RAND/University of California Los Angeles Appropriateness Method, including a moderated panel meeting, panelists rated recommendations for appropriateness in 2 sequential rounds.

Results

The panel assessed 73 drafted recommendations for diagnostic testing, antimicrobial treatment, airway clearance, and discharge criteria for CNI hospitalized with pneumonia. After modifications to 2 of the drafted recommendations, the panel reached agreement on the appropriateness of 72 recommendations. Recommendations include management that minimizes the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Recommendations further emphasize collaboration with respiratory therapists for airway clearance and with families, outpatient managing physicians, and homecare providers for discharge. The recommendations for pneumonia diagnosis and management account for heterogeneity in the patient population, including comorbidities and risk factors (eg, aspiration risk), as well as severity of presenting illness.

Conclusion

Recommendations for appropriate diagnostic testing, antimicrobial treatment, airway clearance, and discharge criteria for CNI hospitalized with pneumonia can be used to inform clinical care. The effect of these recommendations on patient- and family-centered outcomes should be studied.

### Pneumonia [^113JQDfQ]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Pneumonia is a common acute respiratory infection that affects the alveoli and distal airways; it is a major health problem and associated with high morbidity and short-term and long-term mortality in all age groups worldwide. Pneumonia is broadly divided into community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. A large variety of microorganisms can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, respiratory viruses and fungi, and there are great geographical variations in their prevalence. Pneumonia occurs more commonly in susceptible individuals, including children of < 5 years of age and older adults with prior chronic conditions. Development of the disease largely depends on the host immune response, with pathogen characteristics having a less prominent role. Individuals with pneumonia often present with respiratory and systemic symptoms, and diagnosis is based on both clinical presentation and radiological findings. It is crucial to identify the causative pathogens, as delayed and inadequate antimicrobial therapy can lead to poor outcomes. New antibiotic and non-antibiotic therapies, in addition to rapid and accurate diagnostic tests that can detect pathogens and antibiotic resistance will improve the management of pneumonia.

### Diagnostic value of signs, symptoms and diagnostic tests for diagnosing pneumonia in ambulant children in developed countries: a systematic review [^111f2c9p]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Implications for practice and further research

Not a single clinical sign or symptom has sufficient diagnostic value to adequately diagnose pneumonia in children or safely rule it out. Dependent on the setting, the physician needs to combine multiple features to make the diagnosis more or less likely. When assessing the results and applying them in practice, it is important that physicians are aware of the prevalence of pneumonia in their own setting and keep in mind that diagnostic value of tests may be different in their setting. The prevalence of pneumonia in the included studies in this review is stated in different tables in our review, and studies with a lower prevalence of pneumonia (< 10%) are presented separately from the studies with higher prevalence of pneumonia. Primary care physicians may evaluate the results presented for low prevalence settings but should be conscious of the fact that this evidence was derived from trials in secondary ambulatory care settings.

Future research should focus on the combination of clinical features and additional testing as the latter becomes more widely available. This can be done by designing new diagnostic trials but combining the already available evidence using the technique of meta-analysis of individual data may also increase our knowledge. In adults, this method has, for example, increased our knowledge of the added value of newer additional tests in ambulatory care like CRP.

There is a lack of evidence concerning the diagnosis of pneumonia in primary care settings with low prevalence of pneumonia. More research should be conducted in this setting, as many children are evaluated in primary care, and a large proportion of overprescription of antibiotics occurs in this setting. – The role of additional tests such as point-of-care biomarkers or ultrasound should be subject of further evaluation leading to evidence that can help the primary care physician determine which children are in need of antibiotic treatment. In these settings, it is especially important for a physician to rule out pneumonia safely. This means the NPV of an index test is of major importance in this setting.

In conclusion, not a single item from history taking, physical examination, or additional laboratory testing is sufficient to diagnose pneumonia in ambulant children and combining tests will be necessary to increase diagnostic certainty. Very few diagnostic studies are conducted in settings with low prevalence of pneumonia. Future research should focus on increasing evidence for these settings and on synthesizing the evidence currently available. The addition of diagnostic tests seems promising for the future, but further evaluation is needed. Furthermore, clinical implications of additional diagnostic testing, including possibly performing ultrasound evaluation, also need careful evaluation.

### Advances in the diagnosis of pneumonia in children [^115QZqGp]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Pneumonia remains a major cause of childhood mortality and morbidity globally. Accurate diagnosis and attribution of the causes of pneumonia are important for measuring the burden of disease, implementing appropriate preventive or treatment strategies, and developing more effective interventions. This review summarizes recent diagnostic advances in radiological techniques, specimen collection, and laboratory methods. Although chest ultrasound and chest magnetic resonance imaging are promising modalities for radiological diagnosis, their role in clinical management and their impact on outcomes need further study. Rapid, highly sensitive, multiplex laboratory tests performed on upper respiratory tract samples or induced sputum can detect nucleic acid from potential pathogens in most children with pneumonia. However, it may be difficult to attribute causality because it is often impossible to distinguish between organisms colonizing or infecting the upper respiratory tract and those causing pneumonia. Currently available host biomarkers lack accuracy for distinguishing bacterial or mixed bacterial-viral infections from viral infections. New biomarkers derived from host transcriptional profile analysis may be more accurate but require validation. Prospective studies with appropriate control populations, including studies of clinical impact, are needed to improve our understanding of the role of tests. Although progress has been made in radiological techniques and laboratory testing, current methods for diagnosing and attributing the causes of pneumonia are suboptimal.

ABSTRACT

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of mortality in children under 5 years of age globally. To improve the management of CAP, we must distinguish CAP from other common pediatric conditions and develop better diagnostic methods to detect the causative organism, so as to best direct appropriate resources in both industrialized and developing countries. Here, we review the diagnostic modalities available for identifying viruses and bacteria in the upper and lower respiratory tract of children, with a discussion of their utility and limitations in diagnosing CAP in children.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnostic microbiology — sputum testing yield and challenges: The overall poor yield of sputum evaluation for detecting organisms causing CAP limits its impact on management and patient outcomes, and obtaining a valid sputum specimen can be challenging because of patient-related characteristics. Performance characteristics of tests also vary by organism, receipt of prior antibiotics, and setting; for example, in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia who have not received antibiotics, a good-quality sputum sample detects pneumococci in 86% of cases.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) diagnosis guideline — conclusions and framework: A comprehensive synthesis of evidence was performed, diagnostic criteria for IPF were updated, and a multidisciplinary committee formulated recommendations for individual diagnostic tests, while the panel notes it did not evaluate whether these tests had utility for other purposes such as prognosis or treatment response. A new feature is that a different approach is often recommended depending on whether the patient's high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) pattern is usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or something other than UIP (probable UIP, indeterminate for UIP, or alternative diagnosis), and the document states these recommendations should be reconsidered as new evidence becomes available.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to risk prediction rules, ACEP 2021 guidelines recommend to use the 2007 IDSA/ATS minor criteria rather than mortality prediction aids (such as the PSI or CURB-65) in patients not receiving vasopressors or mechanical ventilation to help identify patients most appropriate for ICU admission.

American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline — conclusions for nucleic acid–based testing for noninfluenza viral pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) indicate that, on the basis of GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence was rated as very low, with few studies assessing patient-centered outcomes; for hospitalized patients, the panel believed their use for the routine evaluation of suspected CAP should be considered only for patients with severe disease or those with immunocompromising conditions; and neither of the recommendations is an appropriate target for a performance measure.

The clinical calculator "2007 IDSA/ATS criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia" for community-acquired pneumonia.

The 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia is a clinical tool designed for the identification and stratification of patients with severe manifestations of community-acquired pneumonia. This tool aids in the decision-making process for hospitalization and intensive care unit admission, thereby optimizing patient management and resource allocation.

The criteria consist of two categories: minor and major. The minor criteria include respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute, arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio less than 250, multilobar infiltrates, confusion or disorientation, uremia (blood urea nitrogen greater than 20 mg/dL), leukopenia (white blood cell count less than 4,000/mL due to infection alone), thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 100,000/mL), hypothermia (core temperature less than 36.8 degrees C), and hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation.

The major criteria include septic shock requiring vasopressors and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.

The severity of community-acquired pneumonia is determined by the cumulative score of these criteria. A patient is considered to have severe community-acquired pneumonia if the score is 3 or more. If the score is less than 3, the criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia are not met. This scoring system allows for a standardized approach to the assessment of severity in community-acquired pneumonia, facilitating appropriate treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.

This calculator assesses the severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) by evaluating ten clinical factors, each indicating a potential increase in severity. The presence of these factors and their respective scores are as follows:

- Respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute, or an arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio less than 250: 1 point
- **Presence of multilobar infiltrates**: 1 point
- **Confusion or disorientation**: 1 point
- **Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level greater than 20 mg/dL, indicating uremia**: 1 point
- Leukopenia, characterized by a white blood cell (WBC) count lower than 4,000/mL due to infection: 1 point
- **Thrombocytopenia with platelet counts below 100,000/mL**: 1 point
- Hypothermia indicated by a core temperature below 36.8 degrees Celsius: 1 point
- **Hypotension that requires aggressive fluid resuscitation**: 1 point
- **Septic shock requiring vasopressors to maintain blood pressure**: 3 points
- **Respiratory failure necessitating the use of mechanical ventilation**: 3 points

The total score is the sum of the points assigned to each present condition. The interpretation of this score helps healthcare providers make informed decisions about the treatment and urgency of intervention:

- A total score of 3 or more suggests that the patient meets the criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia, indicating a need for more aggressive management.
- A score below 3 implies that the criteria for severity are not met, suggesting a less urgent condition potentially amenable to routine treatment protocols.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, chest imaging, AAFP 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain a CXR in case of diagnostic uncertainty, hypoxemia, significant respiratory distress, or no clinical improvement within 48–72 hours after initiation of antibiotic therapy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112irMwM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — site-of-care decision support recommends a validated clinical prediction rule for prognosis, preferentially the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) over the CURB-65 (tool based on confusion, urea level, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age ≥ 65) (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence), to determine the need for hospitalization in adults diagnosed with CAP; both the PSI and CURB-65 were developed to predict 30-day mortality, and when compared with CURB-65, PSI identifies larger proportions of patients at low risk and has a higher discriminative power in predicting mortality; two multicenter, cluster-randomized trials demonstrated that use of the PSI safely increases the proportion of patients who can be treated in the outpatient setting, and these trials and one additional randomized controlled trial (RCT) support the safety of using the PSI to guide the initial site of treatment without worsening mortality or other clinically relevant outcomes; when used as a decision aid, the PSI should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment; in comparison to the PSI, there is less evidence that CURB-65 is effective as a decision aid, with one pre–post, controlled before–after study using an electronically calculated version of CURB-65, PaO₂/FiO₂ < 300, absence of pleural effusion, and fewer than three minor ATS severity criteria observing no significant increase in the use of outpatient treatment of adults with CAP; providing a conditional recommendation to use CURB-65 considers its greater simplicity of use relative to the PSI, and the PSI may underestimate illness severity among younger patients because, for example, all systolic blood pressures < 90 mm Hg are considered abnormal regardless of baseline and actual measurement.

### Diagnosis and medical management… [^111zsppy]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Medical Management Tests are available to help diagnose invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia. Guidelines for treatment vary for community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonia. Diagnosis Definitively diagnosing Streptococcus pneumoniae infection generally relies on isolating the organism from blood or other normally sterile body sites. Tests are also available to detect capsular polysaccharide antigen in body fluids. Urinary antigen test A commercially available urinary antigen test can detect the C-polysaccharide antigen of Streptococcus pneumoniae as a cause of community-acquired pneumonia. The test
- Is rapid and simple to use
- Has a reasonable specificity in adults
- Can detect pneumococcal pneumonia after initiation of antibiotic therapy Pneumococcal bacteria are resistant to one or more antibiotics in more than 30% of cases. See CDC's pneumococcal antibiotic resistance data.

### Diagnosis and treatment… [^112vBdYm]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Treatment Early diagnosis and treatment are very important for serious pneumococcal infections. Antibiotics can help treat severe illnesses caused by pneumococcal bacteria. Diagnosis If doctors suspect serious pneumococcal disease, like meningitis or bloodstream infections, they will collect samples of cerebrospinal fluid or blood. Cerebrospinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. View the lumbar puncture illustration to see how a doctor collects this fluid. Doctors then send the samples to a laboratory for testing. Growing the bacteria in a laboratory helps identify the specific type of bacteria causing the infection. Knowing the cause helps doctors choose the right treatment, including which antibiotic will work best. Doctors can use a urine test to help make a diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia in adults.

Doctors usually diagnose ear and sinus infections based on a history and physical exam findings that support pneumococcal infection. Doctors use a lumbar puncture to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment Doctors use antibiotics to treat pneumococcal disease. However, some pneumococcal bacteria have become resistant to certain antibiotics used to treat these infections. Available data show that pneumococcal bacteria are resistant to one or more antibiotics in 3 out of every 10 cases. Antibiotic treatment for serious pneumococcal infections typically includes 'broad-spectrum' antibiotics until results of antibiotic sensitivity testing are available. Antibiotic sensitivity testing shows which antibiotics will be most successful at treating a bacterial infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics work against a wide range of bacteria. Once the sensitivity of the bacteria is known, doctors may choose a more targeted antibiotic.

The number of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal infections has decreased due to the success of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination. In addition to vaccination, appropriate use of antibiotics may also slow or reverse drug-resistant pneumococcal infections. Available data show that pneumococcal bacteria are resistant to one or more antibiotics in 3 out of every 10 cases.

### Diagnosing pneumonia using physical examination… [^114SuRN9]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Although chest radiographs can confirm physical examination findings, little is known about the utility of the physical examination alone in predicting pulmonary disease or in distinguishing among pulmonary conditions. Increasing time constraints on patient visits and the immediate availability of radiography have led physicians to question the need for a detailed lung examination when lower respiratory infection is suspected. Wipf and associates conducted a prospective study to assess the interobserver reliability of physical examination alone in diagnosing pneumonia in patients with suspected lower respiratory infection. Patients who presented to the emergency department with signs of lower respiratory infection, including an acute cough and copious or dark-colored sputum, were eligible for the study. Each patient was examined sequentially by at least two or three board-certified physicians who had no knowledge of the patient's history, vital signs or radiographic findings.

The physicians were not allowed to ask the patient questions. Patients were examined in the sitting and right- and left-lateral decubitus positions. In the sitting position, patients were examined for rales, rhonchi, wheezing, tactile fremitus and other signs consistent with pneumonia. In the left and right lateral decubitus positions, patients were examined for rales. Chest radiographs were obtained for all patients and were considered the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis; physical findings were considered correct if they were present in the same general areas as infiltrates on the chest radiographs. Physical examination of the chest took about 10 minutes. The two most frequent abnormal findings in all patients were rales in the sitting position and bronchial breath sounds. Other chest findings were uncommon. Physician consistency was highest for rales.

Overall, sensitivity and specificity of physical findings varied considerably among physicians, as well as for a given physician in eliciting findings between the right and left lungs. The most consistently helpful maneuvers were auscultating for rales with the patient in the sitting position and performing auscultatory percussion for egophony and rales in the left-lateral decubitus position. The authors conclude that the physical examination had moderate sensitivity and specificity in determining the presence of pneumonia and identifying the affected site. Physical examination alone was not sufficiently accurate to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of pneumonia. Chest radiographs remain the best way to confirm the diagnosis.

### Improving the accuracy of pneumonia diagnosis… [^113ThfNb]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

As evidence continues to show that many episodes of bronchitis are better managed without antibiotics, the ability to accurately differentiate cases of pneumonia from other lower respiratory tract infections becomes increasingly significant. The classic diagnostic criteria derived from hospital studies are of limited applicability in primary care. In addition, family physicians face increasing challenges to accurately diagnose pneumonia with limited time and laboratory resources. Hopstaken and colleagues studied the diagnostic value of various parameters to derive a prediction rule for pneumonia in 15 general practices in the Netherlands. The physicians obtained an extensive standardized medical history and performed a physical examination for each of the 246 patients and developed a diagnosis of pneumonia or "non-pneumonia" for each patient. Blood samples were taken from each patient for erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein determination.

Chest radiographs were obtained on the third day after assessment to ensure that infiltrates would be detectable. Radiographs were interpreted independently by two senior radiologists who were unaware of the clinical diagnosis of each patient. Radiologic evidence of infiltrate was taken as the diagnostic gold standard for pneumonia. During the 16-month study period, pneumonia was diagnosed radiographically in 32 of the 246 patients assessed. The physicians made a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia in 21 cases. As shown in the table on page 682, recent cough and mental confusion were predictive symptoms that occurred in relatively few patients. Conversely, nausea and diarrhea were common complaints that at least doubled the probability of pneumonia. Classic diagnostic characteristics of pneumonia, such as dyspnea, tachypnea, and clinical signs, were not discriminatory for pneumonia.

The physicians had a high index of suspicion for pneumonia, and their clinical impression for severe illness and the diagnosis was associated with increased probability of radiologic diagnosis. In logistic regression analysis, dry cough, diarrhea, and fever had statistically significant odds ratios. When ESR and CRP were added to the diagnostic model, the ability to predict pneumonia was significantly improved. ESR and CRP values alone had higher diagnostic odds ratios than any of the clinical symptoms or signs. The authors calculate that using a CRP value of less than 20 can help differentiate patients with pneumonia from those with other lower respiratory tract infections. In practice, the presence of dry cough, diarrhea, temperature higher than 38°C and elevated ESR and CRP levels can be considered significant factors in the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia and the decision to prescribe antibiotics.
