## Question

Can a thiazide diuretic be used to treat acute prostatitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a thiazide diuretic can be used to treat acute prostatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and guideline-directed therapy for acute bacterial prostatitis. Then, I should verify the approved indications and mechanisms of thiazide diuretics. Next, I will check whether any guideline or trial supports diuretic use in prostatitis. After that, I need to assess potential harms of thiazides in an acutely infected patient. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and briefly note the appropriate evidence-based management path instead of thiazides [^115rbRyc] [^116vSSTN].

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and standard of care. Acute bacterial prostatitis is an infectious process of the prostate, typically due to uropathogens, and guideline-directed therapy centers on prompt systemic antibiotics with good prostatic penetration and supportive care; diuretics are not part of recommended treatment strategies for this entity [^112kJYMo] [^116vSSTN] [^115rbRyc].

> I need to check what thiazide diuretics are actually indicated for and how they work. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics inhibit the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC) in the distal convoluted tubule to lower blood pressure; they are recommended as first-line antihypertensives in major guidelines, but they have no antimicrobial activity or established role in treating infections of the prostate [^114PJMYM] [^117XP6yg] [^114PEbtH] [^1171C6Tb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could a thiazide help symptomatically via some prostate or urinary effect? Wait, let me verify the literature signals. The small pilot combining hydrochlorothiazide with an alpha-blocker targeted nocturia in men with LUTS/BPH, aiming to shift diuresis timing; it did not address prostatitis or infection clearance, and offers no evidence of benefit in acute bacterial prostatitis [^116WiBUn]. Mechanistically, NCC inhibition affects renal sodium handling, not prostate tissue antimicrobial exposure or inflammatory pathways, which makes a causal benefit in prostatitis implausible [^1137nK6T].

> I should confirm across guidelines and reviews that diuretics are absent from prostatitis regimens. Contemporary urology and infectious disease guidance prioritize antibiotics for acute bacterial prostatitis and do not list diuretics for any prostatitis subtype; even in chronic prostatitis/pelvic pain evidence syntheses, recommended pharmacologic classes include antibiotics, alpha-blockers, and anti-inflammatories — not diuretics [^115rbRyc] [^116vSSTN] [^114emGn1] [^112kPoAm].

> Next, I should review safety; I need to ensure we're not introducing avoidable risk in a potentially septic patient. Thiazides can precipitate hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and volume depletion, and may worsen renal function — adverse effects that can complicate hemodynamics and electrolyte management in acute infection scenarios, with case reports and observational data highlighting clinically significant hyponatremia and diuretic-associated electrolyte disorders, and product labeling warning about azotemia in renal disease [^112smTo7] [^1161X3KU] [^114qWngn].

> Let me now examine what should be done instead; I should double-check antibiotic choices with prostate penetration. Standard management of acute bacterial prostatitis involves prompt initiation of systemic antibiotics active against likely uropathogens with adequate prostatic penetration (for example, a fluoroquinolone or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tailored to culture results), plus supportive measures and urologic evaluation if severe or with urinary retention; fluoroquinolone data in prostatitis further supports the antibiotic-first approach, though specific trials often focus on chronic bacterial prostatitis [^112kJYMo] [^116vSSTN] [^114wzmwZ].

> In summary, I should be clear: a thiazide diuretic has no therapeutic role in treating acute prostatitis and could cause harm via electrolyte and volume disturbances; the appropriate course is guideline-directed antibiotic therapy and supportive care, not a diuretic [^115rbRyc] [^116vSSTN] [^112smTo7].

Thiazide diuretics are **not recommended for acute prostatitis** because they do not treat infection, do not improve prostatic symptoms, and may cause electrolyte disturbances that complicate management [^116vSSTN] [^112kJYMo]. The standard of care is prompt, culture-guided antibiotics with supportive measures; thiazides have no role in this setting [^114sv74B].

## Pathophysiology and clinical presentation of acute prostatitis

Acute prostatitis is **typically caused by gram-negative bacteria** (e.g. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus) and less commonly by gram-positive organisms (e.g. Enterococcus, Staphylococcus) [^112kJYMo] [^116vSSTN]. The infection triggers acute inflammation of the prostate, leading to a characteristic clinical picture [^116vSSTN]:

- **Fever and chills**: Systemic inflammatory response.
- **Perineal or suprapubic pain**: Prostatic inflammation.
- **Dysuria, frequency, urgency**: Lower urinary tract irritation.
- **Urinary retention**: Prostatic swelling and obstruction.
- **Tender, boggy prostate**: On digital rectal exam.

---

## Standard treatment guidelines for acute prostatitis

The cornerstone of management is **prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy**, guided by urine culture and sensitivity results [^116vSSTN] [^114sv74B]. Recommended antibiotics include:

- **Fluoroquinolones**: Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin [^117YA8QZ].
- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole**: Alternative option [^112kJYMo].
- **Beta-lactams**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone for severe cases [^116vSSTN].

Supportive measures include **analgesics, antipyretics, hydration, and catheterization** if urinary retention occurs [^116vSSTN]. Hospitalization may be necessary for severe cases or complications [^116vSSTN].

---

## Pharmacological properties and clinical uses of thiazide diuretics

Thiazide diuretics inhibit the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, increasing sodium and water excretion [^114PJMYM]. They are used as first-line or add-on therapy for hypertension [^114PEbtH], to manage edema due to heart failure, liver cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome [^1151Ln3a], and to prevent calcium nephrolithiasis in patients with hypercalciuria [^1168Wioh]. They are **not indicated for infectious or inflammatory conditions such as acute prostatitis** [^116vSSTN].

---

## Evidence regarding thiazide diuretics in acute prostatitis

A comprehensive literature review reveals **no evidence supporting the use of thiazide diuretics** in acute prostatitis; no clinical trials, guidelines, or expert recommendations endorse their use in this context [^116vSSTN] [^112kJYMo]. Thiazides lack antibacterial or anti-inflammatory properties relevant to prostatitis management [^114PJMYM].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of thiazide diuretics in acute prostatitis

Thiazide diuretics carry significant risks that **may complicate acute prostatitis management**:

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia [^112smTo7] [^1161X3KU].
- **Volume depletion**: Hypovolemia, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension [^1165QoQu].
- **Metabolic effects**: Hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia [^117XP6yg].
- **Renal impairment**: Worsening renal function, particularly in dehydrated or critically ill patients [^114qWngn].

These adverse effects can exacerbate patient discomfort, **disrupt fluid and electrolyte management**, and increase the risk of complications [^1161X3KU].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations **explicitly advise against the use of thiazide diuretics in acute prostatitis**. The European Association of Urology (EAU) and other authoritative sources emphasize antibiotic therapy and supportive care as standard, with no role for thiazide diuretics.

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Thiazide diuretics are **not recommended for treating acute prostatitis**. They lack antibacterial or anti-inflammatory properties relevant to prostatitis management and carry significant risks, including electrolyte disturbances, volume depletion, and renal impairment. The standard of care remains prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy with supportive measures [^116vSSTN] [^114sv74B].

### Treatment of bacterial prostatitis [^112kJYMo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Prostatitis is characterized by voiding symptoms and genitourinary pain and is sometimes associated with sexual dysfunction. Up to 25% of men receive a diagnosis of prostatitis in their lifetime, but less than 10% have a proven bacterial infection. The causes and treatment of nonbacterial prostatitis are largely unknown, but bacterial prostatitis is caused by infection with uropathogens, especially gram-negative bacilli, although infection is sometimes due to gram-positive and atypical microorganisms.

Acute bacterial prostatitis is easily diagnosed by abrupt urogenital and often systemic symptoms, along with bacteriuria and is treated by systemic antibiotic therapy. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is characterized by prolonged symptoms and relapsing bacteriuria; diagnosis traditionally requires comparing urinary specimens obtained before with specimens obtained after prostatic massage. Treating chronic bacterial prostatitis requires prolonged therapy with an antibiotic that penetrates the prostate (i.e. one with high lipid solubility, a low degree of ionization, high dissociation constant, low protein binding, and small molecular size).

We review recent pharmacological and clinical data on treating bacterial prostatitis.

### The relationship between metformin and serum prostate-specific antigen levels [^116Ujzu8]. The Prostate (2016). Low credibility.

The interactions with metformin and PSA revealed that the metformin-PSA association was stronger in certain subgroups of men. Specifically, this association was more pronounced in older men (≥ 58 years: -10% [95% CI: -18 to -1%], P = 0.028), in those who were not obese (-9% [95% CI: -16 to -1%], P = 0.025), had diabetes for at least six years (-12% [95% CI: -19 to -4%], P = 0.002), were not using statins (-9% [95% CI: -17 to -1%], P = 0.041), were using thiazolidinedione (-18% [95% CI: -27 to -9%], P = 0.001), and were using two or more antihyperglycemics (-12% [95% CI: -20 to -4%], P = 0.007). This interaction was particularly significant for the duration of diabetes (P-interaction = 0.018).

Figure 3 illustrates the regression-predicted percent differences in serum PSA levels across various metformin doses within covariate subpopulations. Each line in the figure demonstrates the multivariate-adjusted relationship for subpopulations categorized by median diabetes duration, median age, and obesity status (A); statin, ASA, and diuretic use status (B); and sulfonylurea and thiazolidinedione (TZD) use status (C).

### Severe hyponatremia associated with thiazide diuretic use [^112smTo7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Thiazide diuretics are commonly used as first-line antihypertensive agents. Hyponatremia is a reported, though uncommon, complication of thiazide use. Although the exact mechanism of thiazide-induced hyponatremia (TIH) is unclear, it can be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

We report a case involving a 69-year-old man with generalized weakness beginning two weeks after starting hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Evaluation revealed a serum sodium level of 120 mmol/L. The patient was admitted and successfully treated with free water restriction and discontinuation of the HCTZ.

- **Significance for emergency physicians**: Hyponatremia is an uncommon complication of thiazide diuretic use, which frequently presents with nonspecific symptoms. Identification of TIH is crucial to prevent its potentially life-threatening complications.

### Subjects heterozygous for genetic loss of function of the thiazide-sensitive cotransporter have reduced blood pressure [^114VKTnx]. Human Molecular Genetics (2008). Low credibility.

Gitelman's syndrome (GS) is an inherited recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations of the NaCl cotransporter (NCCT) gene, which encodes the kidney-expressed NCCT, the pharmacological target of thiazide diuretics. An observational study estimated the prevalence of GS to be 19 per 1,000,000 in Sweden, suggesting that approximately 1% of the population carries one mutant NCCT allele. Since the phenotype of GS patients, who always carry two mutant alleles, is indistinguishable from that seen in patients treated with high-dose thiazide diuretics, we aimed to investigate whether subjects carrying one mutated NCCT allele have a phenotype resembling that of treatment with low-dose thiazide diuretics.

We screened first-degree relatives of 18 of our patients with an established clinical and genetic diagnosis of GS for NCCT loss-of-function mutations and identified 35 healthy subjects carrying one mutant allele (GS-heterozygotes). Each GS-heterozygote was assigned a healthy control subject matched for age, BMI, and sex. GS-heterozygotes had markedly lower blood pressure (systolic 103.3 ± 16.4 mmHg versus 123.2 ± 19.4 mmHg; diastolic 62.5 ± 10.5 mmHg versus 73.1 ± 9.4 mmHg; P < 0.001) than controls. There was no significant difference between the groups in either plasma concentration or urinary excretion rate of electrolytes; however, GS-heterozygotes had higher fasting plasma glucose concentrations. Similar to patients being treated with low-dose thiazide diuretics, GS-heterozygotes have markedly lower blood pressure and slightly higher fasting plasma glucose levels.

### Levofloxacin [^114wzmwZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

Adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of chronic bacterial prostatitis and microbiological culture results from urine samples collected after prostatic massage (VB3) or expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) specimens obtained via the Meares-Stamey procedure were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study. This study compared oral levofloxacin 500 mg, administered once daily for a total of 28 days, to oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg, administered twice daily for a total of 28 days.

The primary efficacy endpoint was microbiologic efficacy in microbiologically evaluable patients. A total of 136 and 125 microbiologically evaluable patients were enrolled in the levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin groups, respectively. The microbiologic eradication rate by patient infection at 5–18 days after completion of therapy was 75.0% in the levofloxacin group and 76.8% in the ciprofloxacin group (95% CI [-12.58, 8.98] for levofloxacin minus ciprofloxacin).

Eradication rates for S. epidermidis when found with other co-pathogens are consistent with rates seen in pure isolates.

Clinical success rates (cure + improvement with no need for further antibiotic therapy) in the microbiologically evaluable population 5–18 days after completion of therapy were 75.0% for levofloxacin-treated patients and 72.8% for ciprofloxacin-treated patients (95% CI [-8.87, 13.27] for levofloxacin minus ciprofloxacin). Clinical long-term success (24–45 days after completion of therapy) rates were 66.7% for the levofloxacin-treated patients and 76.9% for…

### Sustained 52-week efficacy and safety of triple therapy with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus dual therapy with sitagliptin added to metformin in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes [^112bHuNf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) occurred in 6.5% of patients in the DAPA plus SAXA group and in 3.5% of patients in the SITA group (men: 4.0% vs 1.8%; women: 8.3% vs 5.0%, respectively). Unclassified UTIs were more common in women than in men (DAPA plus SAXA: n = 9 women, n = 1 man; SITA: n = 6 women, n = 1 man). In the DAPA plus SAXA group, one man experienced a fungal UTI, one man experienced prostatitis, one man experienced urethritis, and two women experienced cystitis. In the SITA group, one man experienced cystitis.

- **Adverse events (AEs) of special interest**: Definitions are based on preferred terms in the Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Queries of cardiac failure.
	- In the DAPA plus SAXA group, one patient reported an AE of syncope, one patient experienced adenocarcinoma of the colon, two patients reported an AE of peripheral oedema, and three patients reported an AE of renal impairment/failure (n = 1 acute kidney injury; n = 1 decreased glomerular filtration rate; n = 1 increased blood creatinine). None of these AEs was deemed by the investigator to be related to the study drug.
	- In the SITA group, seven patients experienced at least one cardiac event (n = 4 peripheral swelling; n = 2 peripheral oedema; n = 1 congestive cardiac failure; n = 1 chronic cardiac failure; n = 1 BNP increased). Of these events, only one instance of peripheral swelling was considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug. Additionally, five patients in the SITA group reported AEs potentially related to hypotension, hypovolemia, or dehydration.

### Proscar [^116PFjQL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The MTOPS study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. Additionally, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate due to differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements.

- **Long-term data**:

	- **High-grade prostate cancer**: The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 men aged ≥ 55 years with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA ≤ 3.0 ng/mL. Men received either Proscar (finasteride 5 mg) or a placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or at the end of the study. The incidence of Gleason score 8–10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, Avodart), similar results for Gleason score 8–10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with Proscar.

	- **Breast cancer**: During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3,047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride.

### The effect of thiazide and potassium citrate use on the health related quality of life of patients with urolithiasis [^111wwhWU]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, it is unknown whether the benefits of medical management of urolithiasis outweigh the potential side effects of the medications used, including potassium citrate and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between potassium citrate or thiazides and overall stone-related health-related quality of life.

- **Materials and methods**: Cross-sectional data were obtained on stone-forming enrollees in the North American Stone Quality of Life Consortium. We used the Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life (WISQOL) questionnaire to compare health-related quality of life between patients treated and not treated with potassium citrate or thiazide-type diuretics. Additionally, the likelihood of gastrointestinal complaints was compared between those prescribed and not prescribed potassium citrate. The likelihood of fatigue and sexual complaints was also compared in those prescribed and not prescribed thiazides.

- **Results**: Of the 1,511 subjects, including 787 males and 724 females, 279 were on potassium citrate and 238 were on thiazides at study enrollment. Patients prescribed potassium citrate had higher health-related quality of life in each domain compared to those not prescribed potassium citrate (p < 0.001). Patients prescribed thiazides had higher health-related quality of life in each domain compared to those not prescribed thiazide (all p < 0.01). Those prescribed potassium citrate were less likely than those not prescribed potassium citrate to report nausea, stomach upset, or cramps (OR 0.57, p < 0.001).

### Jalyn [^112jBLvw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The trial supporting the efficacy of Jalyn was a 4-year multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial (CombAT trial) investigating the efficacy of the coadministration of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day and tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg/day (n = 1,610) compared with dutasteride alone (n = 1,623) or tamsulosin alone (n = 1,611). Subjects were aged at least 50 years with a serum PSA ≥ 1.5 ng/mL and < 10 ng/mL and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) diagnosed by medical history and physical examination, including enlarged prostate (≥ 30 cc) and moderate to severe BPH symptoms according to the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Eighty-eight percent of the enrolled trial population was white. Approximately 52% of subjects had previous exposure to 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor or alpha-adrenergic antagonist treatment. Of the 4,844 subjects randomly assigned to receive treatment, 69% of subjects in the coadministration group, 67% in the dutasteride group, and 61% in the tamsulosin group completed 4 years of double-blind treatment.

### Prostatitis: The last frontier [^111B4AQu]. World Journal of Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Prostatitis, the neglected third disease (after benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostate cancer), is the last frontier of prostate disease. Innovative new research and clinical initiatives have revived urologists' interest in this difficult and frustrating disease. New funding initiatives, industry interest, and powerful patient lobby groups have put this long-neglected syndrome back on the urologic agenda.

This article presents an inventory of what is and is not known about prostatitis, based on a review of the literature, undisputed facts, solid hypotheses, and common sense. It also offers a series of personal challenges to the urologic community. As we enter the twenty-first century, a rational management strategy must be developed for patients who present with symptoms of prostatitis.

### Transport and thiazide-inhibition mechanisms of the Na-Cl cotransporter: a structural perspective [^1137nK6T]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

The structures of the human sodium-chloride cotransporter (hNCC) and its complex with thiazide diuretics have been determined recently. This review summarizes key structural insights into NCC's transport and inhibition mechanisms.

Recent studies have revealed the structures of hNCC and its complex with thiazide diuretics, in inward-facing and outward-facing conformations, respectively. The structures of hNCC in two major conformational states provided important insights into the transport and regulatory mechanisms. Thiazide-bound hNCC structures illuminated the molecular mechanisms of thiazide-mediated NCC inhibition and explained the structure-activity relationship of thiazide diuretics.

Structures of hNCC provide mechanistic insights into molecular mechanisms of loss-of-function NCC variants that cause Gitelman syndrome. The thiazide-bound hNCC structures provide a blueprint for further optimizing thiazide diuretics to reduce side effects. The novel interdomain interaction-mediated hNCC regulatory mechanisms revealed by structural studies lay the foundation for developing next-generation NCC modulators and NCC-rescuing therapeutics for treating NCC dysfunction.

### Long-term treatment with finasteride improves clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia in men with an enlarged versus a smaller prostate: data from the MTOPS trial [^116s1eP1]. The Journal of Urology (2011). High credibility.

This post hoc analysis of the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms trial examined the effect of finasteride alone compared to placebo on the clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia in men with a baseline prostate volume less than 30 mL or 30 mL or greater.

- **Materials and methods**: Men were randomized to placebo (737), 4 to 8 mg doxazosin alone (756), 5 mg finasteride alone (768), or doxazosin plus finasteride (786) with an average follow-up of 4.5 years. Approximately 50% of patients had a baseline prostate volume of 30 mL or greater. The present analysis focused on the finasteride alone and placebo arms only and included patients for whom baseline and end-of-study data were available. We examined the effect of treatment on the cumulative percentage of men who did not experience clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia by study end.

- **Results**: In men with a baseline prostate volume of 30 mL or greater, treatment with finasteride produced a significant (p < 0.001) increase relative to placebo in the cumulative percentage of patients who did not experience clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia (finasteride 88.1% vs. placebo 77.8%). There was no significant (p = 0.441) between-group difference in men with a baseline prostate volume of less than 30 mL (91.4% vs. 89.1%, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: Long-term treatment with finasteride led to a significant beneficial effect compared to placebo on the clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms with an enlarged prostate.

### Antioxidative protection in hypertensive patients treated with diuretics [^116PfvRA]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Recently, results of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) showed that a thiazide diuretic was unsurpassed by any other drug class studied in achieving the level of cardiovascular protection, a finding reflected in the recent Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7) recommendations. Oxidative stress has been identified as one of the key players in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that diuretics may favorably affect the oxidative status of plasma, which could account, in part, for the results of recent trials.

- **Methods**: In addition to the routine workup in a series of 39 medically treated hypertensive patients, we analyzed the level of antioxidative protection afforded by the ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), according to the class of drug used.

- **Results**: We found that patients taking diuretics had significantly better antioxidative protection, as expressed by higher levels of FRAP. Although the limited number of patients did not allow us to exclude the influence of other variables in the multiple regression analysis, we did not observe any differences in the level of FRAP when the group was divided according to other drug classes, gender (men versus women), smoking, diabetes mellitus, duration of treatment, concomitant therapy, or level of uric acid.

- **Conclusions**: The use of thiazide diuretics seems to be associated with better antioxidative protection in plasma.

### Proscar [^116ta4nJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effect on prostate volume was studied in PLESS, where prostate volume was assessed yearly by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of patients. In patients treated with Proscar who remained on therapy, prostate volume was reduced compared with both baseline and placebo throughout the 4-year study. Proscar decreased prostate volume by 17.9% (from 55.9 cc at baseline to 45.8 cc at 4 years) compared with an increase of 14.1% (from 51.3 cc to 58.5 cc) in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Results seen in earlier studies were comparable to those seen in PLESS. Mean prostate volume at baseline ranged between 40–50 cc. The reduction in prostate volume was seen during the first year and maintained throughout an additional five years of open extension studies.

- **Prostate volume as a predictor of therapeutic response**: A meta-analysis combining 1-year data from seven double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of similar design, including 4491 patients with symptomatic BPH, demonstrated that, in patients treated with Proscar, the magnitude of symptom response and degree of improvement in maximum urinary flow rate were greater in patients with an enlarged prostate at baseline.

### Proscar [^113hBpWq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study, 3047 men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were randomized to receive Proscar 5 mg/day (n = 768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n = 756), the combination of Proscar 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n = 786), or placebo (n = 737) for 4 to 6 years [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

- **Incidence rates**: The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by ≥ 2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS study are listed in Table 2.

- **Adverse effects**: The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence, and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies.

- **Combination therapy**: Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience.

Four patients in the MTOPS study reported the adverse experience of breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy [see Long-Term Data].

### Molecular mechanisms of thiazide-like diuretics-mediated inhibition of the human Na-Cl cotransporter [^111gJgFL]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Given that practice aims to use low-dose thiazide-type and thiazide-like diuretics to treat hypertension while avoiding metabolic side effects, patients harboring NCC polymorphisms with differential sensitivities to specific thiazide diuretics require properly chosen thiazide diuretics to achieve adequate efficacy while minimizing metabolic side effects. This highlights the importance of NCC polymorphism in the pharmacogenomics of thiazide diuretic therapy. Our structural insights into NCC inhibition by various thiazide diuretics can thus provide a molecular blueprint to facilitate the identification and interpretation of pharmacologically significant polymorphisms.

### Thiazide and the thiazide-like diuretics: Review of hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and indapamide [^117XP6yg]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

The term thiazide is universally understood to refer to diuretics that exert their principal action in the distal tubule. The thiazide class is heterogeneous and can be further subdivided into compounds containing the benzothiadiazine ring structure — the thiazide-type (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide) — and those lacking the benzothiadiazine ring — the thiazide-like (e.g. chlorthalidone and indapamide) drugs. Thiazide-like agents are longer acting and constitute the diuretics used in most of the cardiovascular outcome trials that established benefits of treatment with diuretics, but pragmatic aspects, such as lack of availability in convenient formulations, limit their use.

Regardless of class heterogeneity, thiazides have retained importance in the management of hypertension for over 60 years. They are reliably effective as monotherapy in a majority of hypertensive patients and augment the efficacy of other classes of antihypertensives when used in combination. Importantly, a thiazide-based treatment regimen lowers cardiovascular events, and their sturdy effect reinforces their place among the recommended first-line agents to treat hypertension in major domestic and international hypertension guidelines. There are few head-to-head comparisons within the class, but potential differences have been explored indirectly as well as in non-blood pressure mechanisms and potential pleiotropic properties. Until proven otherwise, the importance of these differences remains speculative, and clinicians should assume that cardiovascular events will be lowered similarly across agents when equivalent.

### Cardura [^114ciZsS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Cardura is an alpha1-adrenergic antagonist indicated for two primary conditions: benign prostatic hyperplasia and hypertension.

- **Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)**: Cardura is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of BPH.

- **Hypertension**: Cardura is indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been observed in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from various pharmacologic classes, including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management. This includes lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake when appropriate. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It can be concluded that blood pressure reduction, rather than other pharmacologic properties of the drugs, is largely responsible for these benefits.

### Pharmacological interventions for treating chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome [^112kPoAm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common disorder characterized by pelvic pain and lower urinary tract symptoms. Various management approaches exist, incorporating pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The National Institute of Health - Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) score is a validated measure frequently used to assess CP/CPPS symptoms. A 25% decrease from the NIH-CPSI baseline score or a six-point reduction is considered the minimal clinically important difference (MCID).

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of pharmacological therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search using CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, trial registries, grey literature, and conference proceedings, with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The latest database search was conducted in July 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials involving men diagnosed with CP/CPPS. All available pharmacological interventions compared to placebo or in head-to-head comparisons were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and evaluated the risks of bias in the included studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence (QoE) using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: 99 unique studies involving 9119 men with CP/CPPS were included, covering assessments of 16 types of pharmacological interventions. Unless stated otherwise, our comparisons…

### Combination therapy with doxazosin and finasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and a baseline total prostate volume of 25 mL or greater [^112jZL65]. The Journal of Urology (2006). High credibility.

We examined data from the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms trial to determine the relationship between baseline total prostate volume (TPV) and the effect of medical therapy in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A total of 3,047 patients with LUTS were randomized to receive placebo, 4 to 8 mg doxazosin, 5 mg finasteride, or a combination of doxazosin and finasteride. The average treatment duration was 4.5 years. The primary outcome was the time to overall clinical progression of BPH, defined as a confirmed 4-point or greater increase in AUA symptom score (SS), acute urinary retention, incontinence, renal insufficiency, or recurrent urinary tract infection. Secondary outcomes included the need for invasive therapy for BPH and changes in AUA SS and maximum urinary flow rate over time. TPV was measured by transrectal ultrasound at baseline and at the study's end.

In patients with a small prostate (baseline TPV less than 25 ml), combination therapy was no more effective than doxazosin alone in reducing the risk of clinical progression of BPH, the need for invasive therapy, and in improving AUA SS and maximum urinary flow rate. However, in patients with moderate-sized (25 to less than 40 ml) or enlarged (40 mL or greater) glands, combination therapy provided clinical benefits superior to doxazosin or finasteride alone.

Combination therapy with doxazosin and finasteride resulted in a greater decrease in the risk of clinical progression of BPH than either drug alone in patients with LUTS who had a baseline TPV of 25 mL or greater.

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115CiLRQ]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

The magnitude of blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects and the decrease in the adverse effects of thiazide diuretics provided by potassium-sparing diuretics remain uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare the BP-lowering efficacy and the incidence of adverse effects of high (T+) and low-dose (T-) thiazide diuretics, alone or combined with high (PS+) or low-dose (PS-) potassium-sparing diuretics in patients with primary hypertension.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and LILACS. Randomized double-blind placebo or active-controlled trials (RCT) with 3 weeks to 1 year of follow-up were included. Sample size, mean, and standard deviation from baseline, follow-up, and change from baseline values were extracted by two independent reviewers. Pairwise random effect models and Bayesian network meta-analysis models were used to compare the effects of treatments. The risk of bias in individual studies was assessed using the Rob 1.0 tool. The primary outcome was the mean difference in office SBP. Secondary outcomes were the mean difference in biochemical parameters and the incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer.

- **Results**: Two hundred and seventy-six double-blind RCTs involving 58,807 participants (mean age: 55 years; 45% women) were included. All treatment groups were more effective than placebo in lowering BP, with mean differences (MDs) of change from baseline ranging from –7.66 mmHg [95% credible interval (95% CrI), –8.53 to –6.79] for T- to –12.77.

### Alpha-blocker plus diuretic combination therapy as second-line treatment for nocturia in men with LUTS: A pilot study [^116WiBUn]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

To determine the efficacy of a diuretic agent, hydrochlorothiazide, as second-line therapy after failed alpha-blocker therapy for men with nocturia, this study was conducted. Seventy-two patients were included, each experiencing nocturia ≥ 2 times per night according to the frequency-volume chart after four weeks of terazosin therapy. They were treated with 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 4 mg of terazosin once daily for four weeks. Of the 72 eligible men, 53 completed the study.

No serious side effects occurred among the treated patients. Using the International Prostate Symptom Score, a reduction of ≥ 50%, 25%-49%, 0%-24%, and an increase in nocturia was observed in 7, 7, 31, and 8 patients, respectively. According to the frequency-volume chart, 17 patients reported a reduction in nocturia by more than half, 5 reported a reduction of 25%-49%, and 31 reported no response to treatment or an increase in nocturia. At baseline, all except one patient had nocturnal polyuria (nocturnal polyuria index > 33%). After the combination therapy, nocturnal polyuria resolved in 6 (11.5%) of the 52 patients with nocturnal polyuria at baseline.

Hydrochlorothiazide combined with terazosin was safe and effective in reducing nocturnal frequency for some men after failed terazosin therapy. Our findings suggest that the use of a diuretic agent, such as hydrochlorothiazide, might be a reasonable approach.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^115R4PGC]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the Department of Defense/Veterans Affairs (DoD/VA) 2025 guidelines recommend considering the addition of a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker (CCB) to reduce blood pressure in patients with CKD and hypertension not controlled on an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).

### A practical approach to hypertension management in diabetes [^1174XBFp]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

- **Antihypertensive drugs**: RAAS blockers, such as ACE inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) and ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers), remain the mainstay in the treatment of hypertension in diabetes patients. They are beneficial not only in the prevention of new-onset diabetes but also for albuminuria. These drugs protect the kidneys by reducing efferent glomerular arteriolar tone and inhibiting mesangial growth factors. ARBs offer equal efficacy with fewer side effects and may be better than ACE inhibitors in stroke prevention in real-world settings. Based on evidence from ALTITUDE and ONTARGET studies, the combined use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs is discouraged. RAAS blockers offer benefits beyond blood pressure lowering, and azilsartan, the newest addition to the sartan family, provides superior BP reduction compared to olmesartan and telmisartan.

Diuretics, such as chlorthalidone and indapamide, are frequently used in trials for hypertension treatment in diabetes. Their role in preventing heart failure in patients in the ALLHAT study makes them an important class for this group. They may be used as first-line or add-on treatment, although monitoring of electrolytes and glucose is required.

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) can be used as first-line treatment for hypertension in elderly patients with diabetes and isolated systolic hypertension. They are also an option for patients intolerant to RAAS blockers and may help in stroke prevention, though they show lower efficacy compared to RAAS blockers.

- **Beta blockers (BB)**: This class of antihypertensives is used in diabetes patients with heart failure.

### Rates of prostate surgery and acute urinary retention for benign prostatic hyperplasia in men treated with dutasteride or finasteride [^112JxBjK]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the risk of BPH-related prostate surgery was lower among men using dutasteride than among men using finasteride. This association was present among men treated with 5-ARI monotherapy as well as men treated with 5-ARI combination therapy. The difference in surgery rates was limited to BPH patients treated in secondary care.

### Risk of congestive heart failure in an elderly population treated with peripheral alpha-1 antagonists [^116dFLzd]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2004). Low credibility.

To compare the risk of congestive heart failure (CHF) in elderly individuals treated with any peripheral alpha-1 antagonist for hypertension with any thiazide, we examined whether the risk persists in subjects without cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline and whether there is a CHF risk in normotensive men with prostatism treated with alpha antagonists.

- **Design**: Prospective cohort study.
- **Setting**: Four U.S. sites: Washington County, Maryland; Allegheny County, Pennsylvania; Sacramento County, California; and Forsyth County, North Carolina.
- **Participants**: A total of 5,888 community-dwelling subjects aged 65 and older.
- **Measurements**: Adjudicated incident CHF.

Results indicated that the 3,105 participants with treated hypertension were at risk for CHF; 22% of men and 8% of women took alpha antagonists during follow-up. The age-adjusted risk of CHF in those receiving monotherapy with alpha antagonists was 1.90 (95% confidence interval = 1.03–3.50) compared with thiazides. In subjects without CVD at baseline receiving monotherapy, women taking an alpha antagonist had a 3.6 times greater age-adjusted risk of CHF, whereas men showed no difference in risk. Adjustment for systolic blood pressure attenuated statistical differences in risk. Regarding the 930 men without hypertension at risk for CHF, 5% used alpha antagonists during follow-up, with no observed increase in CHF risk.

In conclusion, subjects receiving alpha antagonist monotherapy for hypertension had a two to three times greater risk of incident CHF. This was also seen in lower-risk subjects; however, differences in blood pressure control partly explain these findings.

### Effect of dutasteride on clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia in asymptomatic men with enlarged prostate: a post hoc analysis of the REDUCE study [^115GmAf4]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Our study cohort consisted of 1,617 men; 825 were randomized to the placebo group and 792 to the dutasteride group. The baseline patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. The groups were balanced for age, prostate volume, and baseline flow parameters, and there was no significant difference between the groups.

A total of 464 patients (29%) experienced clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia: 297 (36%) in the placebo group and 167 (21%) in the dutasteride group (P < 0.001 for difference). The relative risk reduction was 41% and the absolute risk reduction was 15%, with a number needed to treat of 6.7. Clinical events in each group are summarized in Table 2.

- **Acute urinary retention**: Seventy-six patients (4.7%) experienced acute urinary retention, with 63 taking placebo and 13 taking dutasteride (P < 0.001).

- **Surgery related to benign prostatic hyperplasia**: Of the 46 patients who underwent surgery, 39 were in the placebo group and seven were in the dutasteride group (P < 0.001).

- **Urinary tract infection**: One hundred and forty-one patients had a urinary tract infection; 87 were taking placebo and 54 taking dutasteride (P < 0.001).

Figure 1 shows the absolute and relative risk reductions for each event and the composite endpoint. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, dutasteride was the only factor that significantly reduced clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### The relationship between metformin and serum prostate-specific antigen levels [^1172TPSC]. The Prostate (2016).

- **Participant characteristics**: The analysis included 326 men, with a median PSA of 0.9 ng/ml (IQR: 0.5–1.6 ng/ml) and a median age of 58 years (IQR: 52–64 years). A significant majority (85%) were aged 50 and above. The median BMI was 29 kg/m² (IQR: 26–33 kg/m²), with 40% overweight and 41% obese. The median duration of type 2 diabetes among participants was 6 years (IQR: 3–10 years), and 61% had lived with diabetes for at least 5 years. Most participants managed adequate control over hyperglycemia, with 93% exhibiting HbA1c values between 6% and 8%; however, 57% had inadequately controlled dyslipidemia with LDL-C levels exceeding 2.0 mmol/L. The majority of the cohort were of European (56%) or Indian/South Asian (28%) descent.

- **Medication use**: A total of 89% (n = 289) used metformin either alone or alongside other antihyperglycemics, and 50% were on two or more oral antihyperglycemic medications. Usage rates of other medications were as follows: sulfonylureas (40%), thiazolidinediones (21%), DPP-4 inhibitors (11%), statins (70%), ASA (54%), and thiazide diuretics (15%). The median dose for metformin was 1,500 mg/d (IQR: 1,000–2,000 mg/d), while sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones were typically used at intermediate doses. For atorvastatin-equivalents, the median dose was 20 mg/d (IQR: 10–40 mg/d), and for ASA, it was 81 mg/d (IQR: 81–81 mg/d). On average, men were utilizing a median of 1.5 antihyperglycemic agents daily (IQR: 1–2).

### Interventions for chronic abacterial prostatitis [^114dRFYv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic abacterial prostatitis is a common, disabling, but enigmatic condition characterized by pelvic area pain and lower urinary tract symptoms. The wide range of treatments recommended for this condition highlights how little is known about its causes and appropriate treatments. Consequently, chronic abacterial prostatitis often leads to physician frustration, patient confusion and dissatisfaction, variable thresholds for referral, and potentially inappropriate antibiotic use.

- **Objectives**: Examine the evidence regarding the effectiveness of therapies for chronic abacterial prostatitis.

- **Search strategy**: Studies were identified through a search of MEDLINE (1966–2000), the Cochrane Library, bibliographies of identified articles and reviews, and contact with an expert.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were eligible if they: (1) are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs); (2) involve men with chronic abacterial prostatitis; (3) have a control group receiving placebo, sham intervention, or active pharmacologic or device therapy for chronic abacterial prostatitis; and (4) provide outcomes data. Eligibility was assessed by at least two independent observers.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Study information on patients, interventions, and outcomes was extracted independently by two reviewers. The main outcome measured was the efficacy of treatment for chronic abacterial prostatitis versus control in improving urologic symptom scale scores or global reports of urinary tract symptoms. Secondary outcomes included changes in prostatic symptoms.

### Levofloxacin [^117YA8QZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of prostatitis and microbiological culture results from urine samples collected after prostatic massage (VB3) or expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) specimens obtained via the Meares-Stamey procedure were enrolled in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind study. This study compared oral levofloxacin 500 mg, administered once daily for a total of 28 days, to oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg, administered twice daily for a total of 28 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the microbiologic efficacy in microbiologically evaluable patients. A total of 136 and 125 microbiologically evaluable patients were enrolled in the levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin groups, respectively.

The microbiologic eradication rate by patient infection at 5 to 18 days after the completion of therapy was 75% in the levofloxacin group and 76.8% in the ciprofloxacin group (95% CI [-12.58, 8.98] for levofloxacin minus ciprofloxacin).

- **Bacteriological eradication rates (chronic bacterial prostatitis)**: Eradication rates shown are for patients who had a sole pathogen only; mixed cultures were excluded. Eradication rates for S. epidermidis when found with other co-pathogens are consistent with rates seen in pure isolates.

Clinical success, defined as cure plus improvement with no need for further antibiotic therapy, in the microbiologically evaluable population 5 to 18 days after the completion of therapy was 75% for levofloxacin-treated patients and 72.8% for ciprofloxacin-treated patients.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, particularly in patients with isolated systolic hypertension (HTN), the Hypertension Canada (HC) 2020 guidelines recommend initiating single-agent therapy with a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). If adverse effects occur, switch to another drug from this group. Avoid hypokalemia in patients treated with thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic monotherapy.

### Recent finding and new technologies in nephrolitiasis: a review of the recent literature [^1168Wioh]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

After the initial report by Yendt in 1970, we have over 30 years of clinical experience with thiazides for calcium stone prevention. The aim of thiazide treatment is to reduce calcium excretion in hypercalciuric patients, which constitutes around half of stone formers. This effect is thought to be mediated by increased reabsorption of calcium in the proximal and distal parts of the nephron.

Idiopathic hypercalciuria is a common disorder in children and can present with a range of clinical manifestations, such as hematuria, voiding dysfunction, flank pain, abdominal pain, nephrolithiasis, urinary tract infection, and decreased bone mineral density. Dietary modifications are often sufficient for managing hypercalciuria. If symptoms persist or a rare monogenic disorder is present, consideration should be given to medical treatment with a thiazide diuretic and/or citrate therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide is usually administered at a dosage of 25–50 mg once or twice daily. Supplementation with a potassium salt, such as potassium citrate (3.5–7 mmol twice daily), is needed to counterbalance thiazide-induced potassium loss and the hypocitraturic effect.

Thiazide treatment has considerable metabolic side effects: unmasking normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism, development of diabetes and gout, and erectile dysfunction contribute to limited patient compliance (50–70%) and a high dropout rate.

### Prostatitis [^116yUBYf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Prostatitis is a common condition that accounts for a significant number of visits to both the emergency department and the urologist. The precise pathogenic mechanism of prostatitis is not known. The most prevalent theory is that reflux of urine from the urethra into the intraprostatic ducts promotes ascending infection and leads to chemical or bacterial prostatitis. Treatment is challenging because many antimicrobial agents do not effectively diffuse into prostatic tissue, and many cases of prostatitis are not found to have an infectious etiology.

Prostatitis can be divided into different classifications which range from acute severe infections to chronic indolent infections to chronic pain syndromes. The differentiation and management of these entities can be difficult. This article seeks to clarify the different infections and provide a rational approach to the treatment and disposition of these patients.

### New medical treatments for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia and future perspectives [^116NFyzQ]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

The National Library of Medicine database was searched for relevant articles published between January 2006 and December 2015. A comprehensive search included the combination of the following words: "BPH", "LUTS", "medical", and "new". Although recent articles were prioritized, manuscripts with relevant historical findings were referenced if necessary. Publications in the English language were preferred. However, if necessary, data was extrapolated even from manuscripts in other languages. Evidence was not limited to human data; results from animal and in vitro experiments were also included in the review. Helsinki Declaration principles were respected, and informed consent was obtained. Each article's title, abstract, and text were reviewed for their appropriateness and relevance. The initial list of selected papers was enriched by individual suggestions from the authors of the present review. Overall, 148 articles were reviewed. Of these, 92 were excluded after screening by the authors, leaving 56 articles eligible for review.

### Use of diuretics and outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes: Findings from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^1165QoQu]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

Side effects of LD include activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems, hypokalaemia, calciuria, hypovolaemia, falls, and worsening renal function, which might contribute to an increase in morbidity and mortality. Our analyses demonstrate that patients with T2DM treated with an LD had higher rates of adverse events consistent with volume depletion and decreased renal function, regardless of HF status. However, LD are a pharmaco-epidemiological signature of symptoms and signs of congestion, often due to cardiac dysfunction, and it is the congestion rather than the adverse effects of LD that is driving prognosis.

We did not find an association between the use of thiazide diuretics alone and outcomes in patients with T2DM, which possibly reflects their different indication. Although thiazides might impair glucose metabolism, they are often used to treat hypertension in T2DM and have been shown to reduce CV events in this setting. For example, in the SHEP trial, chlortalidone reduced mortality in older patients with T2DM despite worsening glycaemia compared to placebo. However, patients receiving both LD, which block sodium retention in the loop of Henle, and thiazide diuretics, which act on the distal convoluted tubule (sequential nephron blockade), had similar rates of CV events to patients with HF. This is a powerful diuretic combination that is usually reserved by HF specialists for the treatment of advanced HF. It is unclear whether other physician groups are aware of how potent this combination is and its potential to treat, inadvertently.

### Avodart [^111qzZeh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A prostate volume of at least 30 cc measured by transrectal ultrasound was required for trial entry. The mean prostate volume at trial entry was approximately 54 cc.

Statistically significant differences (Avodart versus placebo) were noted at the earliest post-treatment prostate volume measurement in each trial (Month 1, Month 3, or Month 6) and continued through Month 24. At Month 12, the mean percent change in prostate volume across the three trials pooled was -24.7% for dutasteride and -3.4% for placebo; the mean difference (dutasteride minus placebo) was -21.3% (range: -21.0% to -21.6% in each of the three trials, P < 0.001). At Month 24, the mean percent change in prostate volume across the three trials pooled was -26.7% for dutasteride and -2.2% for placebo with a mean difference of -24.5% (range: -24.0% to -25.1% in each of the three trials, P < 0.001). The reduction in prostate volume seen during the first two years of double-blind treatment was maintained throughout an additional two years of open-label extension trials.

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^1136zRd5]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

Natriuresis and diuresis in acute HF

Several earlier trials have shown that the addition of a thiazide diuretic can increase diuresis and natriuresis in acute HF patients with profound loop diuretic resistance. For instance, the 3T trial that randomized 60 patients with acute HF to metolazone, intravenous chlorothiazide, or tolvaptan found that all strategies augmented urine output and weight loss. The CLOROTIC trial provides new evidence for targeting the distal tubule with thiazide diuretics. Patients with acute HF treated with background intravenous loop diuretics were assigned to either oral hydrochlorothiazide or placebo for 72 hours. Patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide observed larger reductions in body weight, although no difference in the co-primary endpoint of dyspnea was observed. Further, the reductions in body weight did not persist at discharge. Hydrochlorothiazide also augmented urine output and increased natriuresis at 96 hours. No difference in serious adverse event risk was noted, although hypokalemia occurred in 41% and 16% of patients prescribed hydrochlorothiazide and placebo, respectively. In addition, increases in serum creatinine were more common with hydrochlorothiazide, although this may be reflective of achievement of diuretic effect. In summary, the CLOROTIC study provides evidence that thiazide may provide a modest beneficial effect on natriuresis and diuresis in acute HF.

While thiazide diuretics are routinely used as adjunctive diuretics in chronic HF and recommended in clinical guidelines, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials directly supporting their use in acute HF settings.

### Transport and thiazide-inhibition mechanisms of the Na-Cl cotransporter: A structural perspective [^114PJMYM]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

The structures of the human sodium-chloride cotransporter (hNCC) and its complex with thiazide diuretics have been determined recently. This review summarizes key structural insights into the transport and inhibition mechanisms of NCC.

Recent studies revealed the structures of hNCC and its complex with thiazide diuretics, in inward-facing and outward-facing conformations, respectively. The structures of hNCC in two major conformational states provided important insights into the transport and regulatory mechanisms. Thiazide-bound hNCC structures illuminated the molecular mechanisms of thiazide-mediated NCC inhibition and explained the structure-activity relationship of thiazide diuretics.

Structures of hNCC offer mechanistic insights into the molecular mechanisms of loss-of-function NCC variants that cause Gitelman syndrome. The thiazide-bound hNCC structures provide a blueprint for further optimizing thiazide diuretics to reduce side effects. The novel interdomain interaction-mediated hNCC regulatory mechanisms revealed by structural studies lay the foundation for developing next-generation NCC modulators and NCC-rescuing therapeutics for treating NCC dysfunction.

Effect on prostate volume

The mean prostate volume at trial entry was approximately 55 cc. At month 24, the primary time point for this endpoint, the mean percent changes from baseline (± SD) in prostate volume were -26.9% (± 22.57) for coadministration therapy, -28.0% (± 24.88) for dutasteride, and 0% (± 31.14) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between coadministration and dutasteride of 1.1% (P = NS [95% CI: -0.6, 2.8]), and between coadministration and tamsulosin of -26.9% (P < 0.001 [95% CI: -28.9, -24.9]).

Similar changes were seen at month 48: -27.3% (± 24.91) for coadministration therapy, -28.0% (± 25.74) for dutasteride, and +4.6% (± 35.45) for tamsulosin.

### Molecular mechanisms of thiazide-like diuretics-mediated inhibition of the human Na-Cl cotransporter [^111AzHjj]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension, defined as elevated arterial blood pressure, is a widespread and serious medical condition affecting approximately one-third of the global adult population. It causes damage to multiple organs and is a leading risk factor for premature death worldwide. It is well established that pharmacological agents that lower blood pressure are essential for reducing hypertension-related morbidity and mortality. Thiazide-type and thiazide-like diuretics (collectively referred to as thiazide diuretics in this paper) are first-line antihypertensive drugs used to treat 20–40% of hypertensive patients. They have served as a cornerstone for managing hypertension for decades.

Pharmacodynamically, thiazide-type and thiazide-like diuretics cause similar diuretic effects by inhibiting the NCC transporter in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) of the kidney. Thiazide-like diuretics are structurally distinct from thiazide-type diuretics because they lack the benzothiadiazine scaffold shared by thiazide-type diuretics (Supplementary Fig. 1). For example, chlorthalidone (CTN) and indapamide (IDP) are phthalimidine and indoline derivatives of benzenesulfonamide, respectively. Although still under debate, several studies have found that thiazide-like diuretics have better cardioprotective effects than thiazide-type diuretics. This has led to preferential recommendations for thiazide-like diuretics over thiazide-type diuretics in several hypertension guidelines.

A patient's genetic profile can also have a significant impact on their sensitivity and responsiveness to these medications.

### Effect of dutasteride on clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia in asymptomatic men with enlarged prostate: a post hoc analysis of the REDUCE study [^116x1678]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The REDUCE study was designed to assess the efficacy of dutasteride in decreasing the incidence of biopsy-detected prostate cancer over a four-year period in men at increased risk of prostate cancer. Participants were randomized to receive either placebo or dutasteride 0.5 mg daily. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the original publication. This secondary analysis was prompted by the uniqueness of this dataset to answer the relatively common scenario: "How should I manage an asymptomatic man with an enlarged prostate?" This analysis aims to assess the benefit of dutasteride in men with mild or no urinary symptoms and enlarged prostates to prevent clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

The population assessed in this study includes participants randomized to both trial arms who had an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and prostate volumes between 30 and 80 mL (participants with prostate volumes > 80 mL were excluded from the original study). Subjects were excluded if they were taking any prostate-related medications.

- **Study procedures**: IPSS questionnaires were completed at baseline and at six-month intervals during the study. Urinary flow rates were measured at study entry (patients with a flow rate < 5 ml/sec were excluded from the study) and in selected centres during follow-up.

- **Clinical events**: Clinical events — including acute urinary retention, prostate surgery related to benign prostatic hyperplasia, and urinary tract infection — were reported on case report forms every six months, and adverse events were assessed every three months during the study.

### Oral pharmacological treatments for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111zdhkQ]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

The first network meta-analysis (NMA) for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) concluded that α-blockers, antibiotics, and combinations of them appear to achieve the greatest improvement in NIH-CPSI total scores compared with placebo, and anti-inflammatories also have a lesser but measurable benefit on CP/CPPS clinical symptoms.

- **Mechanism of included pharmacological treatments**:
	- α-blockers reduce the autonomic sympathetic tone in the bladder neck and prostate, which may relieve urinary symptoms of CP/CPPS.
	- Antibiotics are empirically used, although no bacterial cause can be identified among patients with CP/CPPS.
	- Anti-inflammatories could decrease inflammatory-mediated pain of CP/CPPS.
	- 5-α-reductase inhibitors reduce the production of dihydrotestosterone and prostate size, which may reduce pain and urinary symptoms.
	- Neuromodulators reduce neural sensitization and consequently relieve the neuropathic pain involving regions outside the prostate or pelvic area.
	- Phytomedicine may have anti-inflammatory effects, reducing pelvic pain and impaired voiding.

The study extends the findings of previous studies that synthesized individual drugs into grouped drugs. Although grouped drugs, such as different α-blockers, have similar mechanisms (e.g. α-blockade), they vary significantly in terms of α-receptor selectivity and side effects. The clinical practice guidelines recommend some grouped drugs, such as antibiotics, α-blockers, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for the treatment of CP/CPPS. However, clinicians require more evidence to make patient-specific choices. In this study, we included the most commonly used oral treatments.

### Managing patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115cwx6k]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Many men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia can be managed safely and effectively by primary care providers. After a basic evaluation to exclude other diseases that may cause lower urinary tract symptoms, quantifying the degree of symptoms and bother, and perhaps making an assessment of prostate size, the primary care provider can determine which men require immediate evaluation by a urologist and which men may choose among various treatment options, including watchful waiting and various single-agent or combination medication strategies. Recent information about risk factors for disease progression has also helped to inform patient decisions on which treatment option is best for the individual patient. The purpose of this review is to provide primary care providers with an approach to the management of men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Finasteride treatment alters tissue specific androgen receptor expression in prostate tissues [^1119ifMJ]. The Prostate (2014). High credibility.

Normal and pathologic growth of the prostate is dependent on the synthesis of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from testosterone by 5α-reductase. Finasteride is a selective inhibitor of 5α-reductase 2, one isozyme of 5α-reductase found in abundance in the human prostate. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of finasteride on androgen receptor expression and tissue morphology in human benign prostatic hyperplasia specimens.

- **Methods**: Patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate and either treated or not treated with finasteride between 2004 and 2010 at the University of Wisconsin-Hospital were retrospectively identified using an institutional database. Prostate specimens from each patient were triple-stained for androgen receptor, prostate-specific antigen, and basal marker cytokeratin 5. Morphometric analysis was performed using multispectral imaging, and results were compared between groups of finasteride-treated and non-treated patients.

- **Results**: Epithelial androgen receptor but not stromal androgen receptor expression was significantly lower in patients treated with finasteride than in non-treated patients. Androgen receptor-regulated prostate-specific antigen was not significantly decreased in finasteride-treated patients. Significant luminal epithelial atrophy and basal cell hyperplasia were prevalent in finasteride-treated patients. Epithelial androgen receptor expression was highly correlated to the level of luminal epithelial atrophy.

### Thiazide diuretic prophylaxis for kidney stones and the risk of diabetes mellitus [^112MbZNW]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Thiazide diuretics used to treat hypertension are associated with a modest risk of diabetes mellitus. It is unknown if there is a similar risk with kidney stone prevention.

- **Materials and methods**: We identified and validated incident stone formers in Olmsted County, Minnesota from 1984 to 2011 with manual review of medical records using the Rochester Epidemiology Project. The risk of diabetes mellitus after thiazide therapy was evaluated with and without multivariate adjustment for hypertension, age, gender, race, family history of stones, body mass index, and number of stone events.

- **Results**: Among 2,350 incident stone formers with a median follow-up of 10 years, 332 (14%) were treated with thiazide diuretics at some point after the first stone event and 84 (3.6%) received the thiazide diuretic only for kidney stone prevention. Stone formers who received thiazide diuretics were more likely to be older, have hypertension, have higher body mass index, and have more stone events. The incidence of diabetes mellitus at 10 years after the first stone event was 9.2% in the group that received thiazide diuretics vs. 4.2% in those who did not (HR 2.91; 95% CI 2.02, 4.20). After multivariate adjustment, the risk of diabetes mellitus was attenuated (HR 1.20; 95% CI 0.78, 1.83). The risk of diabetes mellitus among those receiving thiazide diuretics solely for kidney stones was further attenuated (multivariate adjusted HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.28, 2.23).

- **Conclusions**: Thiazide diuretic use for kidney stone prophylaxis was not associated with a high risk of diabetes mellitus. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Finasteride to prevent prostate cancer: should all men or only a high-risk subgroup be treated [^116jArks]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to examine the use of finasteride in reducing the incidence of prostate cancer. Despite its proven effectiveness, finasteride use remains low, likely due to the risk of adverse effects. This study investigates whether prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels can identify a high-risk subgroup for which the benefits of finasteride treatment outweigh potential harms.

Patients and methods: Using raw data from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, chemopreventive treatment strategies were modeled. These strategies included treating all men, treating no men, or treating a high-risk subgroup based on PSA levels. The benefits (reduction in cancer rate) and harms (treatment rate) of each strategy were evaluated using numbers-needed-to-treat thresholds. This threshold represents the maximum number of men a clinician would treat with finasteride to prevent one cancer.

Results: Out of 9,058 men in the study, 1,957 were diagnosed with prostate cancer over a 7-year period. For all cancer endpoints, including for-cause and end-of-study biopsies, the optimal strategy is to treat all or nearly all men. To reduce the risk of cancers detected through routine care, treating men with PSA levels greater than 1.3 or greater than 2 ng/mL is optimal. For instance, treating only men with a PSA level greater than 2 ng/mL reduced the treatment rate by 83% and resulted in a cancer rate only 1.1% higher than treating all men.

Conclusion: Clinicians who wish to reduce the risk of any biopsy-detectable prostate cancer should recommend finasteride to all men. Those who believe it is unnecessary to prevent all cancers, but find it desirable to prevent those readily detectable by screening, should recommend finasteride to men with elevated PSA levels.

### Impact of diuretic therapy-associated electrolyte disorders present on admission to the emergency department: a cross-sectional analysis [^1161X3KU]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Diuretics are a mainstay of therapy for a wide variety of diseases ranging from hypertension to nephrotic syndrome. Despite this key role, the various substances used as diuretics can have serious side effects, such as volume depletion and ototoxicity, particularly with loop diuretics, and the induction of electrolyte disorders. In an aging population, the number of patients treated with diuretics for different indications is increasing, as is the relevance of their side effects.

Studies investigating diuretic therapy-induced electrolyte disorders have mainly focused on the effects of thiazide diuretics. In a randomized controlled trial in hypertensive patients, serum potassium levels were significantly lower in patients treated with thiazide diuretics. However, only patients who did not receive potassium supplements developed marked hypokalemia, with potassium levels below 3.0 mmol/L. A more recent study on hypertensive patients found an incidence of 30% for hyponatremia in patients treated with thiazide diuretics. The same study did not find an increased risk of hospitalization or death in patients with thiazide-induced hyponatremia.

To the best of our knowledge, the prevalence of diuretic use and associated electrolyte disorders has never been investigated in a large group of patients presenting to a hospital emergency room (ER). Findings from large patient series on the impact of non-thiazide diuretics on electrolyte levels are especially lacking.

Therefore, we investigated the associations between diuretics being taken and the prevalence of electrolyte disorders.

### Oral pharmacological treatments for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114emGn1]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

Pharmacological treatments for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) are empirically used, yet the quantitative comparative effectiveness and safety of multiple pharmacological treatments is lacking. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched from inception to March 22, 2022. Randomized controlled trials comparing two or more oral pharmacological treatments for patients with CP/CPPS were included. Title, abstract, and full-text screening were independently conducted by four reviewers. The primary outcomes were efficacy, measured by the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH — CPSI) total score, pain score, urinary score, and quality of life (QoL) score, and safety, assessed through adverse events. This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020184106.

Out of 25 studies involving 3514 patients, 26 treatments were assessed. Low to very low quality evidence indicated that doxazosin (mean difference [MD], –11.4; 95% credible interval [CrI], –17.5 to –5.1) and the combination of doxazosin, ibuprofen, and thiocolchicoside (MD, –11.6; CrI, –18.1 to –5.3) were significantly more effective than placebo in improving the NIH — CPSI total score. Other NIH — CPSI relative outcomes, including pain, urinary, and QoL scores, showed a similar pattern. Additionally, low to very low quality evidence suggested that the combination treatment of doxazosin, ibuprofen, and thiocolchicoside (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; CrI, 0.5 to 19.3) and the combination of tamsulosin and dapoxetine (OR, 6.0; CrI, 0.7 to 67.3) were associated with more adverse events.
