## Question

Epidemiology, cost and complications of CLABSIs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the epidemiology, cost, and complications of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining CLABSI and distinguishing it from CRBSI. Then, I should quantify the epidemiologic burden across settings and populations. Next, I will examine cost estimates and their variability. After that, I need to detail clinical complications and outcomes. Finally, I should consider risk factors, surveillance limitations, and prevention strategies that influence both apparent rates and true risk, before synthesizing the overall impact and implications for practice and policy.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate surveillance and clinical constructs. CLABSI is a primary bloodstream infection in a patient with a central line present within 48 hours before the positive blood culture, and it is not secondary to infection at another site; this is an NHSN surveillance definition used for benchmarking and public reporting, whereas CRBSI is a clinical diagnosis requiring specific microbiologic criteria that prove the catheter as the source, which is harder to establish at the bedside and therefore less commonly used for surveillance [^117VGvjy] [^112eK6By].

> I need to check the epidemiologic burden across settings. Historically, ICU CLABSIs declined from about 43,000 in 2001 to 18,000 in 2009 in the U.S., but substantial events persisted on inpatient wards and in outpatient hemodialysis, with an estimated 23,000 ward and 37,000 hemodialysis CLABSIs in those years, respectively; this pattern underscores that most CLABSIs occur outside ICUs and in ambulatory settings, not just in critical care units [^112SceYc] [^112T1ykF]. Hold on, I should verify more recent estimates; a 2023 multicenter analysis of 41 hospitals identified 403 NHSN-reportable CLABSIs versus 1,574 non-CLABSI hospital-onset bacteremia/fungemia (HOB) events, suggesting that CLABSIs represent only a fraction of hospital-onset BSIs, and that HOB may better capture the full burden relevant to quality improvement and reimbursement frameworks [^1125TwUT] [^11181sxY].

> Next, I should review cost estimates and be careful about inflation and context. Older U.S. estimates placed attributable costs around $16,550 to $32,000 per CLABSI, but more recent matched analyses show substantially higher figures, with mean excess costs of roughly $25,000–$55,000 per admission depending on ICU status, and total costs often exceeding $40,000–$70,000 in ICU encounters; pediatric data similarly show high attributable costs, around $55,000–$70,000 per event, highlighting the economic burden across ages and settings [^115T7PnV] [^1125TwUT] [^111xhasv] [^117AXxtg]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of national cost implications; CDC's 2009 analysis estimated $414 million in potential excess costs avoided in ICUs that year alone, illustrating the scale of preventable expenditure when CLABSI rates fall [^112SceYc].

> I will now examine clinical complications and outcomes, and I should double-check mortality ranges. CLABSI is associated with increased length of stay by roughly 12–20 days in matched analyses, with adjusted mortality risk approximately 2–3 fold higher than controls, and ICU mortality among CLABSI/HOB patients around 30–35% in contemporary cohorts; these figures align with earlier reports of 12–25% mortality and reinforce the severity of these events [^1125TwUT] [^113ratGz] [^112SceYc] [^1146y2F5]. But wait, what if the comparator is non-CLABSI hospital-onset BSI rather than no BSI; even then, CLABSI tends to carry longer LOS and higher costs, underscoring its particular impact among device-associated infections [^1125TwUT].

> Let me consider special populations and risk modifiers so I don't overgeneralize. In pediatrics, CLABSI rates have plateaued after earlier declines, with NICU/PICU device-associated rates hovering near 1–2 per 1,000 central line days and high associated costs; pediatric oncology patients experience even higher burdens and costs, emphasizing the need for tailored prevention in these groups [^113TXTdr] [^111xiyuS] [^117AXxtg]. In hemodialysis, catheter use confers 2–3 fold higher infection-related hospitalization and mortality versus fistula or graft, making catheter minimization and antimicrobial lock strategies critical [^114KNiAV]. I should also confirm that concurrent CVCs increase risk; large cohort data show an approximately 80% higher CLABSI risk with two CVCs compared with one, a factor not captured by standard NHSN denominators, which can distort inter-facility comparisons and penalties [^115GWDeH] [^112J7FG4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surveillance accuracy. I need to ensure we acknowledge misclassification and underestimation. Systematic reviews and validation studies show that NHSN CLABSI rates are frequently underestimated by 3–5% and that interrater reliability is lower than expected, partly because the CLABSI definition excludes secondary BSIs and relies on variable clinical workups; this gap has motivated interest in HOB as a complementary metric to better reflect hospital BSI burden and fairness in performance assessment [^116eCHe8] [^1163wgQG] [^11181sxY]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought CLABSI might overestimate CRBSI, but the CDC notes the CLABSI surveillance definition may actually overestimate CRBSI relative to the stricter clinical definition, so both directions of bias are possible depending on context and ascertainment practices [^117VGvjy].

> Next, I should review prevention strategies and their economic value, and I need to check that I'm aligning with high-quality guidance. Essential practices include hand hygiene, maximal sterile barrier precautions, chlorhexidine skin antisepsis, subclavian site preference in adults when feasible, ultrasound guidance, and standardized insertion and maintenance bundles; these are consistently associated with 40–60% reductions in CLABSI and are cost-saving at the hospital level, with a systematic review estimating average net savings around $1.85 million per hospital over three years [^112uiGG3] [^114SGwkT] [^112kqhWY]. Let me verify additional approaches for high-risk settings; antiseptic- or antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs and antimicrobial lock therapy for long-term catheters can further reduce risk in selected patients or units with persistently elevated rates despite adherence to essential practices [^112CqucU] [^113623fY].

> I should confirm temporal trends and disruptions so recommendations remain current. National CLABSI rates declined steadily through 2019, but the COVID-19 pandemic reversed progress, with NHSN reporting substantial increases in CLABSI standardized infection ratios during 2020–2021, particularly in ICUs; targeted nursing-led interventions have helped recover rates in some centers, though COVID-19 cohorts remain at elevated risk, likely reflecting acuity, device burden, and staffing strain [^112fbSWz] [^113SYaZd] [^117V9gaV]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude; some systems documented SIR increases exceeding 50–100% during peak pandemic periods, reinforcing the need to hardwire bundles and address device utilization and access practices under stress conditions [^112fbSWz].

> Let me synthesize the overall impact and make sure the math coheres. CLABSIs remain a major, preventable contributor to morbidity, mortality, and cost, with hundreds of thousands of events annually across U.S. healthcare, tens of thousands of attributable deaths, and billions in excess costs; each individual CLABSI adds roughly 12–20 hospital days and tens of thousands of dollars in cost, with mortality risk 2–3 fold higher, and the burden is disproportionately high in pediatrics, hemodialysis, and other vulnerable populations [^notfound]. I should double-check that this aligns with prevention economics; given the strong return on investment from bundles and the persistence of preventable events, continued focus on device stewardship, insertion and maintenance bundles, and equitable surveillance methodologies remains essential to bend the curve again [^112kqhWY] [^117BcBgd].

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are a major healthcare burden, with an incidence of **0.8–2.5 per 1,000 catheter-days** in U.S. ICUs and higher rates globally, especially in LMICs [^notfound]. Each CLABSI increases length of stay by 7–21 days and adds **$25,000–$70,000 in costs**, with total U.S. costs exceeding $2 billion annually [^111xhasv] [^1179zG5Y]. CLABSIs cause significant morbidity — sepsis, endocarditis, and metastatic infections — and **mortality of 12–25%**, with even higher risks in vulnerable populations [^112SceYc] [^114KNiAV]. Prevention via evidence-based bundles and device stewardship reduces incidence and costs, but surveillance challenges and rising rates during COVID-19 underscore the need for sustained, multidisciplinary efforts [^114SGwkT] [^113SYaZd].

---

## Epidemiology

- **Incidence**: 0.8–2.5 per 1,000 catheter-days in U.S. ICUs; higher in LMICs (4.8–12.9 per 1,000 catheter-days) [^112ohL1y].
- **U.S. burden**: ~30,000 cases/year, with 23,000 in non-ICU inpatients and 37,000 in outpatient hemodialysis [^112SceYc].
- **Global burden**: Higher in LMICs due to limited resources and infection control [^112ohL1y].

---

## Cost

- **Per-case cost**: $25,000–$70,000, with ICU cases at the higher end [^1125TwUT] [^117AXxtg].
- **Annual U.S. cost**: > $2 billion [^notfound].
- **Pediatric costs**: $55,000–$70,000 per case, with longer LOS and higher resource use [^111xhasv] [^117AXxtg].

---

## Complications

- **Morbidity**: Sepsis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, thrombophlebitis, and metastatic infections [^notfound].
- **Mortality**: 12–25% overall; higher in ICU, pediatric, and immunocompromised patients [^112SceYc].
- **LOS**: Extended by 7–21 days, increasing costs and resource use [^111xhasv] [^1179zG5Y].

---

## Risk factors

Device-related factors include prolonged dwell time, **multiple lumens**, femoral/jugular sites, and concurrent catheters [^111tEmak] [^115GWDeH]. Patient-related factors include ICU stay, **immunosuppression**, neutropenia, parenteral nutrition, and hemodialysis [^111tEmak] [^114KNiAV]. Environmental factors include low nurse-to-patient ratios, poor adherence to bundles, and **inadequate infection control** [^111tEmak] [^114gHoSZ].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Bundles**: Hand hygiene, maximal sterile barriers, chlorhexidine skin prep, subclavian site preference, and daily line necessity reviews [^112uiGG3].
- **Device stewardship**: Minimize use, prefer PICCs/midlines, and remove unnecessary lines [^115RPDne].
- **Antimicrobial locks**: For long-term catheters, especially in hemodialysis [^113623fY].
- **Education**: Training and competency for insertion and maintenance [^115RPDne].

---

## Impact of COVID-19

During the pandemic, CLABSI rates rose in tandem with increased ICU admissions and device use [^111TvpkF] [^116DTeEh]. Contributing factors included staffing shortages, high patient acuity, and strained infection control [^117Kk5NA].

---

## Surveillance and reporting

CLABSIs are tracked via NHSN, but interrater reliability and misclassification can limit accuracy [^112eK6By] [^116eCHe8]. Public reporting and CMS penalties incentivize prevention but may create unintended consequences [^1159ATum].

---

CLABSIs are common, costly, and deadly; prevention through bundles, device stewardship, and education reduces incidence and costs, but sustained, multidisciplinary efforts are essential to maintain progress.

### Bloodstream infections and central line-associated bloodstream infections [^116p8LHX]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

It is estimated that more than 575,000 individuals develop bloodstream infections (BSI) annually in North America, accounting for nearly 80,000 deaths. Central line-associated BSI (CLABSI) is a major contributor to the cost of health care. Although primary BSI may be seen by the surgeon, a secondary BSI is more likely to be encountered, especially CLABSI. Prompt identification of the source of infection in patients with secondary BSI is paramount. This practice allows early source control and initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, with subsequent improvement in outcomes. An understanding of evidence-based preventative measures and bundles is important.

Section 4: Recommended strategies to prevent CLABSI

Recommendations are categorized as either (1) essential practices that should be adopted by all acute-care hospitals or (2) additional approaches that can be considered in locations and/or populations within hospitals when CLABSIs are not controlled by use of essential practices. Essential practices include recommendations in which the potential to affect CLABSI risk clearly outweighs the potential for undesirable effects. Additional approaches include recommendations in which the intervention is likely to reduce CLABSI risk but there is concern about the risks for undesirable outcomes, recommendations for which the quality of evidence is low, recommendations in which cost-to-benefit ratio may be high, or recommendations in which evidence supports the impact of the intervention in select settings (eg, during outbreaks) or for select patient populations. Hospitals can prioritize their efforts by initially focusing on implementation of the prevention strategies listed as essential practices. If CLABSI surveillance or other risk assessments suggest ongoing opportunities for improvement, hospitals should consider adopting some or all of the prevention approaches listed as additional approaches. These can be implemented in specific locations or patient populations or can be implemented hospital-wide, depending on outcome data, risk assessment, and/or local requirements. Each infection prevention recommendation is given a quality of evidence grade (see Table 2).

Essential practices for preventing CLABSI recommended for all acute-care hospitals

Some of the following measures have been combined into a "prevention bundle" that focuses on catheter insertion. Numerous studies have documented that use of such bundles is effective, sustainable, and cost-effective in both adults and children.– Bundles are most likely to be successful if implemented in a previously established patient safety culture and their success depends on adherence to individual measures. However, data suggests that not all components of bundles may be necessary to achieve an effect on CLABSI rates. After catheter insertion, maintenance bundles have been proposed to ensure optimal catheter care. More data are needed to determine which components of the maintenance bundle are essential in reducing risk.

### Characteristics, costs, and outcomes associated with central-line-associated bloodstream infection and hospital-onset bacteremia and fungemia in US hospitals [^1179zG5Y]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

To compare characteristics and outcomes associated with central-line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and electronic health record–determined hospital-onset bacteremia and fungemia (HOB) cases in hospitalized US adults.

Methods:

We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients in 41 acute-care hospitals. CLABSI cases were defined as those reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). HOB was defined as a positive blood culture with an eligible bloodstream organism collected during the hospital-onset period (ie, on or after day 4). We evaluated patient characteristics, other positive cultures (urine, respiratory, or skin and soft-tissue), and microorganisms in a cross-sectional analysis cohort. We explored adjusted patient outcomes [length of stay (LOS), hospital cost, and mortality] in a 1:5 case-matched cohort.

Results:

The cross-sectional analysis included 403 patients with NHSN-reportable CLABSIs and 1,574 with non-CLABSI HOB. A positive non-bloodstream culture with the same microorganism as in the bloodstream was reported in 9.2% of CLABSI patients and 32.0% of non-CLABSI HOB patients, most commonly urine or respiratory cultures. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Enterobacteriaceae were the most common microorganisms in CLABSI and non-CLABSI HOB cases, respectively. In case-matched analyses, CLABSIs and non-CLABSI HOB, separately or combined, were associated with significantly longer LOS [difference, 12.1–17.4 days depending on intensive care unit (ICU) status], higher costs (by $25,207–$55,001 per admission), and a > 3.5-fold increased risk of mortality in patients with an ICU encounter.

Conclusions:

CLABSI and non-CLABSI HOB cases are associated with significant increases in morbidity, mortality, and cost. Our data may help inform prevention and management of bloodstream infections.

### Central-line-associated bloodstream infections and central-line-associated non-CLABSI complications among pediatric oncology patients [^111xiyuS]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Among pediatric oncology patients, central-line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are an important healthcare-associated complication, responsible for significant cost, morbidity, and mortality. In contrast to inpatient CLABSIs, relatively little effort has been devoted to preventing outpatient CLABSIs or central-line–associated non-CLABSI complications (CLANCs). – A comprehensive analysis of harm associated with CVC use might define risk factors, inform CLABSI and CLANC prevention initiatives, and guide CVC selection.

To define risk factors and rates of CVC-associated harm that occurred over a 10-year period in children and young adults undergoing cancer treatment, we characterized CVC use and identified all CLABSIs and CLANCs, stratifying events by whether they occurred in the inpatient or outpatient setting. A novel aspect of this study was the development of a measure analogous to CLABSI for quantifying central-line–associated non-CLABSI complications.

### Treatment of central line-associated bloodstream infections [^1118xCAP]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Central venous catheters (CVCs) are among the most frequently used medical devices in critically ill patients. Unfortunately, complications are not uncommon despite the many improvements in caregiver behaviour observed over recent decades. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is probably the most feared complication. It is defined as a primary laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection in a patient with a central line at the time of, or within 24-h prior to, the onset of symptoms, in cases where the cultured organism is not related to an infection from another site. The central line should be in place for > 2 calendar days on the date of the event, with the day of device placement being day 1. Tens of thousands of patients continue to experience CLABSIs each year in the US, resulting in thousands of deaths each year and billions of dollars in added costs to the US healthcare system.

Of paramount importance, CLABSI prevention depends on evidence-based measures. The most effective of these are hand hygiene before catheter insertion and maintenance, full-barrier precautions during catheter insertion, 2% alcoholic chlorhexidine use for skin preparation, femoral vein avoidance whenever possible and prompt removal of useless CVCs. The use of care protocols and the training of caregivers must also be considered. Implementation of these bundled measures has been shown in high-quality studies to reduce CLABSI incidence by 50%.

On the other hand, the principles of CLABSI treatment are not as well established and are mainly based on expert opinions and the results of old cohort studies. Source control and intravenous administration of high doses of bactericidal agents are the most commonly cited measures.

Source control consists of prompt removal of the catheter when clinical suspicion is high, at times even before the CLABSI diagnosis is proven. Yet, catheter salvage with antibiotic lock and systemic antibiotic treatment are not recommended for critically ill patients. Salvage therapy is limited to cases where the CVC cannot be removed, in the absence of septic shock, and for a period of at least 4 weeks, with low success rate.

### Is it possible to achieve a target of zero central line associated bloodstream infections? [^116wHYfY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Central venous catheter (CVC)-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) result in poorer patient outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Reduced reimbursement for CLABSI events is now provided for hospitalized patients in the United States. Although a zero target is proposed, the feasibility has not been evaluated. The objective of this review is to identify factors contributing to CLABSI and determine whether current evidence supports attainment of a zero infection rate.

Recent Findings

Limitations of current surveillance methods and reporting of aggregate data impact on achieving target CLABSI rates. Standard prevention practices, including physician and patient preparation (e.g. hand hygiene), are frequently incorporated into bundles of care. CVC dwell time has been identified as means of risk stratification. Additional strategies (e.g. chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings, antimicrobial-coated devices) may be better used in patients with expected long dwell times. Non-ICU populations are increasingly targeted with prevention strategies, but expected rates of infection have not been proposed.

Summary

A zero CLABSI rate should be the target only for ICU populations having CVCs with a dwell time of 1–9 days following aseptic insertion. Additional measures should be reserved for patients with expected longer dwell time. Refinement and validation of surveillance methodology is required before target CLABSI rates can be proposed for non-ICU populations.

Conclusions

CLABSI and non-CLABSI HOB cases are associated with significant increases in morbidity, mortality, and cost. Our data may help inform prevention and management of bloodstream infections.

### Characteristics, costs, and outcomes associated with central-line-associated bloodstream infection and hospital-onset bacteremia and fungemia in US hospitals [^11181sxY]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hospital-onset bloodstream infections (BSIs) can compromise patient health and increase the burden on healthcare systems. Improvement in rates of central-line–associated BSIs (CLABSIs) reportable to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has inspired reporting to move beyond infections with a central line and a positive culture for an eligible BSI pathogen not related to an infection at another site. More importantly, concerns about the reliability of CLABSI designations and recognition that CLABSIs account for only a small proportion of hospital-onset BSIs have led to the proposed hospital-onset bacteremia and fungemia (HOB) quality metric. – This suggestion passed the National Quality Forum (NQF) Patient Safety Committee review in early 2023 and is being considered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as a reportable metric. In addition to providing a more inclusive measure of hospital BSI sources, an HOB metric could be standardized and risk-adjusted using the electronic health record (EHR), thereby eliminating the subjectivity associated with central-line attributions.

Although some studies have explored costs associated with CLABSIs, less is known about the impact of non-CLABSI HOB on hospital outcomes. In this study, we analyzed characteristics, related positive non–blood-culture sites, costs, and patient outcomes associated with CLABSI, non-CLABSI HOB, and all HOB in US hospitals.

### Factors associated with recurrence and mortality in central line-associated bloodstream infections: a retrospective cohort study [^1112pLUS]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hospital-acquired central line-associated bloodstream infections (HA-CLABSIs) contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data from 2014, over 35,000 HA-CLABSIs occur annually, with about half of them in ICUs. CLABSIs have serious clinical and financial ramifications; each individual CLABSI is estimated to cost about $40,000 in the medical ICU and is associated with a doubling of the risk of mortality, even after adjusting for severity of illness. Central line infections have also been associated with increased ICU and hospital lengths of stay.

Treatment for central line infections consists of antimicrobial therapy and, frequently, removal of the infected central line. While some evidence exists to guide antimicrobial treatment duration in patients with bacteremia, evidence in patients with central line infections is limited. Organism-specific treatment guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) exist, but its antimicrobial treatment duration recommendations are based on expert opinion and a few observational studies. The ideal antimicrobial treatment duration to prevent mortality and recurrent infection in patients with HA-CLABSIs remains uncertain. The purpose of this study was to investigate factors related to recurrence and mortality in patients with HA-CLABSIs and to determine if longer antimicrobial treatment duration was associated with improved outcomes. We hypothesized that prolonged duration of antimicrobial treatment would increase time until recurrence or mortality.

Methods

Study design and population

We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients in 41 acute-care hospitals in the BD Insights Research and Database (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ), which contains electronically captured data encompassing pharmacy, laboratory, administrative data, patient demographics, and admission, discharge, and transfer data feeds.– The distribution of hospitals in this database is similar to the hospital distribution in the United States as a whole. Included patients were aged ≥ 18 years and had been admitted between October 2015 and June 2019. The study was approved as involving use of a limited retrospective data set for an epidemiology study, exempted from consent by the New England Institutional Review Board/ Human Subjects Research Committee (Wellesley, MA), and conducted in compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act requirements.

Our study included 2 different analyses: (1) Ecologic cross-sectional comparison of patient characteristics, including other positive cultures and associated microorganisms, for CLABSI and non-CLABSI HOB, and (2) Case-matched analysis of outcomes in patients with CLABSI or non-CLABSI HOB compared with a control population of patients who did not have a BSI. In the case-matched analysis, 3 steps were used to select a comparable control population. (1) Admissions with potential infections (defined as antibiotic duration ≥ 72 hours, EHR alert for potential infection, or infection diagnosis-related group) were excluded from the control group (Supplementary Tableonline). (2) Controls and non-CLABSI HOB cases were limited to the same characteristics as the CLABSI case population: age range, major diagnostic code, and International Classification of Disease Tenth Revision procedure code system (ICD-10-PCS) code (see Supplementary Materialand Tableonline for details). (3) Cases were matched 1:5 to controls based on ICU status and primary ICD-10-PCS code. The same control group was used for both CLABSI and non-CLABSI HOB to allow comparisons to CLABSI, a reportable infection familiar to clinicians, and was based on methods published for analyses of the costs associated with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).

### Intravascular catheter-related bloodstream infections: contemporary issues related to a persistent problem [^112Yv2tL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired infections, including central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), are an ongoing source of cost, morbidity, and mortality worldwide. This article presents a summary of the impact of the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on CLABSI incidence, an overview of current standard-of-care practices for reduction of CLABSI, and a look toward future changes in bacteremia metrics and challenges in prevention.

### Central line-associated bloodstream infections in limited-resource countries: a review of the literature [^116oHGwV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are considered a significant cause of mortality in hospitalized patients; however, the incidence of CLABSIs in limited-resource countries has not been explored analytically. Likewise, the appropriate interventions to prevent, control, and reduce CLABSIs have yet to be analyzed thoroughly. This review demonstrates that the CLABSI rate ranged from 1.6 to 44.6 cases per 1000 central line days in adult and pediatric intensive care units (ICUs) and from 2.6 to 60.0 cases per 1000 central line days in neonatal ICUs and is associated with significant extra mortality, with an odds ratio ranging from 2.8 to 9.5. The results of 6 sequential prospective interventional studies showed that hand hygiene and educational programs were related to a significant reduction in CLABSI rates. CLABSI rates in limited-resource countries are higher than US National Healthcare Safety Network benchmark rates and have a significant impact on mortality. Studies showing successful interventions for a reduction in CLABSIs are few. Subsequently, it can be inferred that additional epidemiological studies need to be conducted to achieve an appreciation of the effects of CLABSIs and to develop more-definitive approaches for CLABSI prevention in the form of practical, low-cost, low-technology measures that are feasible to implement in limited-resource countries.

Section 1: Rationale and statements of concern

Burden of outcomes associated with hospital-acquired CLABSI

Increased length of hospital stay –
Increased cost. The adjusted variable costs for patients with CLABSI were $32,000 (2010 US dollars) higher on average than for patients without CLABSI
Increased morbidity and mortality

Risk factors for CLABSI

Patients at risk for CLABSI in acute-care facilities are those with a CVC in place: Intensive care unit (ICU) population: The risk of CLABSI in ICU patients is high. Reasons for this include the frequent insertion of multiple catheters; the use of specific types of catheters that are almost exclusively inserted in ICU patients and associated with substantial risk (eg, pulmonary artery catheters with catheter introducers); and the fact that catheters are frequently placed in emergency circumstances, repeatedly accessed each day, and often needed for extended periods. Non-ICU population: Although the primary focus of attention over the last 20 years has been the ICU setting, most CLABSIs occur in hospital units outside the ICU or in outpatients. –
Infection prevention and control efforts should include other vulnerable populations such as patients receiving hemodialysis through catheters, intraoperative patients, and oncology patients.
In addition to CVCs, short-term peripheral catheters, peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs), midline catheters, and peripheral arterial catheters also carry a risk of infection.
Independent risk factors for CLABSI (in at least 2 published studies) – Prolonged hospitalization before catheterization Prolonged duration of catheterization Heavy microbial colonization at insertion site Heavy microbial colonization of the catheter hub Multilumen catheters Concurrent catheters Neutropenia Body mass index (BMI) > 40 Prematurity (ie, early gestational age) Reduced nurse-to-patient ratio in the ICU Parenteral nutrition Substandard catheter care (eg, excessive manipulation of the catheter) Transfusion of blood products (in children)

### Central line-associated bloodstream infections in pediatrics: a review [^1128PJYq]. Pediatrics in Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are a common and significant health care-associated infection in hospitalized and nonhospitalized pediatric patients with central venous catheters. Interventions to prevent such infections have evolved over the last 2 decades, resulting in significant reductions in CLABSI rates through the development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines on prevention and management recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Healthcare Safety Network and pediatric infectious diseases and health care epidemiology professional societies. This review provides a detailed synopsis of CLABSIs in children, including the definition, pathogenesis, risk factors, prevention, and treatment principles.

Line-level adjusted event rates

Examining each line independently (Table 5), the adjusted incidence rates per 1,000 line days were 3.8 for all events (95% CI, 2.8–5.2), 1.6 for CLABSIs (95% CI, 1.1–2.3), and 2.3 for CLANCs (95% CI, 1.4–3.7). The incidence rates for CLABSIs were greater in the inpatient setting than the outpatient setting. Incidence rates for CLANCs were also higher in the inpatient setting than the outpatient setting, although the confidence intervals overlapped.

### Characteristics, costs, and outcomes associated with central-line-associated bloodstream infection and hospital-onset bacteremia and fungemia in US hospitals [^1146y2F5]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The designation of CLABSI is predicated on excluding temporal and clinical relationships to another culture site with the same pathogen. It is often difficult to differentiate secondary versus primary infection; this distinction is no longer relevant for HOB. Removal of the requirement for attributing primary and secondary sources of infection may refocus attention on understanding factors driving HOB, which in turn may redirect emphasis to prevention or timely treatment of infections that may be a source of HOB, essentially bringing patient care back as the focus rather than whether the event is reportable or not.

Enterobacteriaceae was the most common bloodstream microorganism for non-CLABSI HOB, whereas CoNS was the most common bloodstream microorganism for CLABSI. Other common microorganisms included S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. These data are consistent with a recent analysis of pathogens associated with BSI in Ontario, which identified Escherichia coli as the most common pathogen. However, other studies have found a larger contribution by S. aureus and CoNS and a diminished role for Enterobacteriaceae. The reasons for the different pathogen distributions among studies may be due to differences in patient populations and in case study parameters. For example, we excluded CDC commensal microorganisms from the HOB definition to be consistent with a recently published paper; however, commensals can be true pathogens depending on the number, proximity, and clinical interpretation of positive blood cultures.

Our data support and update prior reports on the burden of HOB in hospitalized patients. The ∼30% mortality rate of HOB in our study is generally comparable to HOB mortality rates reported in other US hospitals, and in Denmark, and the mortality rate of 35.3% in patients with an ICU encounter is similar to the 36.6% reported in ICU admissions in France. The similarity of these data suggest that challenges in managing these infections transcend individual healthcare systems and case-mix differences; these infections remain a ubiquitous problem in healthcare that warrants a larger spotlight. The HOB LOS and costs reported here provide an important update to earlier US studies encompassing smaller numbers of hospitals, and focused on estimates for CLABSI costs. Significant increases in 30-day readmission rates compared with controls were observed for patients who did not have an ICU encounter, but not those with ICU admissions, perhaps suggesting that the complexity of managing HOB may impact the stability of patients at the time of discharge from a regular hospital ward.

### Prevention of central line-associated bloodstream infections in hemodialysis patients [^114KNiAV]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2012). Low credibility.

An increasing proportion of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are seen in outpatient settings. Many of such infections are due to hemodialysis catheters (HD-CLABSIs). Such infections are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and excess healthcare costs. Patients who receive dialysis through a catheter are 2–3 times more likely to be hospitalized for infection and to die of septic complications than dialysis patients with grafts or fistulas. Prevention measures include minimizing the use of hemodialysis catheters, use of CLABSI prevention bundles for line insertion and maintenance, and application of antimicrobial ointment to the catheter exit site. Instillation into dialysis catheters of antimicrobial solutions that remain in the catheter lumen between dialyses (antimicrobial lock solutions) has been studied, but it is not yet standard practice in some dialysis units. At least 34 studies have evaluated the impact of antimicrobial lock solutions on HD-CLABSI rates. Thirty-two (94%) of the 34 studies demonstrated reductions in HD-CLABSI rates among patients treated with antimicrobial lock solutions. Recent multicenter randomized controlled trials demonstrated that the use of such solutions resulted in significantly lower HD-CLABSI rates, even though such rates were low in control groups. The available evidence supports more routine use of antimicrobial lock solutions as an HD-CLABSI prevention measure in hemodialysis units.

### Attributable cost and length of stay for central line-associated bloodstream infections [^111xhasv]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) are common types of hospital-acquired infections associated with high morbidity. Little is known about the attributable cost and length of stay (LOS) of CLABSI in pediatric inpatient settings. We determined the cost and LOS attributable to pediatric CLABSI from 2008 through 2011.

Methods

A propensity score-matched case-control study was performed. Children < 18 years with inpatient discharges in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample databases from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project from 2008 to 2011 were included. Discharges with CLABSI were matched to those without CLABSI by age, year, and high dimensional propensity score (obtained from a logistic regression of CLABSI status on patient characteristics and the presence or absence of 262 individual clinical classification software diagnoses). Our main outcome measures were estimated costs obtained from cost-to-charge ratios and LOS for pediatric discharges.

Results

The mean attributable cost and LOS between matched CLABSI cases (1339) and non-CLABSI controls (2678) was $55646 (2011 dollars) and 19 days, respectively. Between 2008 and 2011, the rate of pediatric CLABSI declined from 1.08 to 0.60 per 1000 (P < .001). Estimates of mean costs of treating patients with CLABSI declined from $111852 to $98621 (11.8%; P < .001) over this period, but cost of treating matched non-CLABSI patients remained constant at ∼$48000.

Conclusions

Despite significant improvement in rates, CLABSI remains a burden on patients, families, and payers. Continued attention to CLABSI-prevention initiatives and lower-cost CLABSI care management strategies to support high-value pediatric care delivery is warranted.

### Characterizing the relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and assessing the impact of a nursing-focused CLABSI reduction intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112fbSWz]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Central-line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is a common hospital-acquired infection that contributes to patient morbidity, mortality, increased patient length of stay, and hospital cost. CLABSIs are reported by hospitals to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) using standardized criteria that allows for benchmarking. The body of literature directed toward CLABSI prevention is robust; public health and professional societies have published guidance for clinicians and healthcare facilities that include such evidence-based practices as implementation of sterile insertion bundles, chlorhexidine (CHG) bathing, maintenance bundles and guidance for sterile line access. Between 2015 and 2020, there had been a nationwide trend toward reduction in CLABSI in US hospitals, and in 2019 the NHSN recorded a 31% decline in standardized infection ratio (SIR) from the 2015 baseline.

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic marked an end to this positive trend, and a subsequent increase in the incidence of CLABSI (as well as other HAI) has been widely documented in different settings. – Nationwide, the CLABSI SIR as documented by the NHSN increased significantly, beginning in the second quarter of 2020, reversing the steady reduction in prior years. At our institution we experienced a similar trend in CLABSI: between 2019 and 2020, our CLABSI rate more than doubled. Although studies have correlated increased incidence of CLABSI during the pandemic with increases in COVID-19 patient census and hospital size, few data have been published regarding the patient-level risk of CLABSI in patients with COVID-19.

We performed a retrospective cohort analysis to examine the impact of infection with SARS-CoV-2 on CLABSI rate at our hospital, as well as the characteristics of patients admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who developed a CLABSI. We also examined the impact of an institutional quality-improvement initiative aimed at reducing these infections.

### Characteristics, costs, and outcomes associated with central-line-associated bloodstream infection and hospital-onset bacteremia and fungemia in US hospitals [^116yphkf]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this multicenter database encompassing almost 800,000 hospitalized adult patients, there were ∼4 times as many non-CLABSI HOB cases as CLABSI cases (1,574 vs 403) using a conservative EHR-based case definition that only included the first positive blood culture with a CDC-designated BSI pathogen. Compared with matched controls, both CLABSIs and non-CLABSI HOB cases were associated with increases in LOS and significantly higher hospital costs, mortality rates, and 30-day readmission rates. Rock et alreported that among ICU patients, changes in HOB rates are highly associated with changes in CLABSI rates. These data suggest that it is feasible for HOB to serve as a quality metric indicator while including more BSI patients than the current CLABSI-reportable events, and that such a change may be consequential. Thus, we highlight 2 key points: (1) the extra cost of care required for CLABSI and non-CLABSI HOB cases and (2) the hospital stay, mortality burden, and readmission risk related to both. Reducing HOB and/or improving time to definitive therapy through the existing required infrastructures of infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship programs has the potential to improve patient safety.

Overall admission characteristics for CLABSI and non-CLABSI HOB were generally similar, although the CLABSI cohort had a higher rate of ICU encounters (73.4% vs 62.1%). Probably due to criteria used for the CLABSI designation, which exclude cases related to another infection, non-CLABSI HOB cases were more likely to have another positive culture, most commonly urine or respiratory, and to be associated with other reportable HAIs (CAUTI or SSI). Although our study was not designed to definitively evaluate the sources of HOB, we found that 27.4% of all HOB admissions had other positive cultures with the same microorganism found in the blood culture within the specified time frame. Notably, we evaluated urinary, respiratory, and skin and soft-tissue cultures, but we did not include other sources potentially associated with HOB, including the gastrointestinal system, or poorly or nondocumented sources such as peripheral intravenous devices.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^112CqucU]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) prevention — additional approaches for high-rate settings: Use antiseptic- or antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs because the risk of CLABSI is reduced with some currently marketed antiseptic-impregnated and antimicrobial-impregnated catheters, and use them when hospital units or patient populations have a CLABSI rate above institutional goals despite compliance with essential practices, when patients have limited venous access and a history of recurrent CLABSI, or when patients are at heightened risk of severe sepsis from a CLABSI (eg, patients with recently implanted intravascular devices such as a prosthetic heart valve or aortic graft). These additional approaches are recommended for use in locations and/or populations with unacceptably high CLABSI rates and may not be needed if institutional goals have been consistently achieved.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^112d9R7D]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) prevention — device choice at insertion: Do not use peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) as a strategy to reduce the risk of CLABSI. Risk of infection with PICCs in hospitalized patients approaches that of other CVCs, and the majority of CLABSIs due to PICCs occur in non-ICU settings. Midline catheters are increasingly being used as an alternative to CVCs for short-term vascular access, with some observational studies suggesting lower bloodstream infection risk associated with midline catheters versus PICCs and versus CVCs, respectively; randomized controlled trials comparing these devices are needed.

### A comparison of national healthcare safety network surveillance definitions to physician review for central-line-associated bloodstream infections [^1163wgQG]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

A central-line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is a healthcare-associated infection resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. CLABSIs are strictly defined by surveillance rules of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Although the NHSN surveillance definitions have been internally validated in multiple studies, few studies have assessed their external validity. We assessed the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the NHSN definitions against a gold standard of physician review of hospital-onset bloodstream infections (BSIs) with eligible central lines at our institution. We have described the drivers of any discrepancies between the surveillance and clinical designations as well as the implications of these discrepancies on the reporting of quality metrics and opportunities for infection prevention.

### Inpatient costs, mortality and 30-day re-admission in patients with central-line-associated bloodstream infections [^113ratGz]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Previous work has suggested that central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is associated with increased costs and risk of mortality; however, no studies have looked at both total and variable costs, and information on outcomes outside of the intensive-care unit (ICU) is sparse. The aim of this study was to determine the excess in-hospital mortality and costs attributable to CLABSI in ICU and non-ICU patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort and cost-of-illness study from the hospital perspective of 398 patients at a tertiary-care academic medical centre from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010. All CLABSI patients and a simple random sample drawn from a list of all central lines inserted during the study period were included. Generalized linear models with log link and gamma distribution were used to model costs as a function of CLABSI and important covariates. Costs were adjusted to 2010 US dollars by use of the personal consumption expenditures for medical care index. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Among both ICU and non-ICU patients, adjusted variable costs for patients with CLABSI were c. $32 000 (2010 US dollars) higher on average than for patients without CLABSI. After we controlled for severity of illness and other healthcare-associated infections, CLABSI was associated with a 2.27-fold (95% CI 1.15–4.46) increased risk of mortality. Other healthcare-associated infections were also significantly associated with greater costs and mortality. Overall, CLABSI was associated with significantly higher adjusted in-hospital mortality and total and variable costs than those for patients without CLABSI.

### New developments in the prevention of intravascular catheter associated infections [^1155ojTW]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLA-BSI) are one of the leading causes of healthcare-associated infections, resulting in significant morbidity and substantial excess cost. There is a growing recognition that most CLA-BSIs are preventable. Elimination of preventable CLA-BSI is the focus of a recently released CDC Guideline. Universal preventative measures include collaborative performance improvement using checklists and bundles, education of persons who insert and maintain catheters, maximal sterile barrier precautions, and chlorhexidine skin preparation. Technologic innovations including coated catheters, antimicrobial impregnated dressings, and antimicrobial lock solutions should be considered if the rate of CLA-BSI is not acceptable after application of universal precautions.

### Bundle approach used to achieve zero central line-associated bloodstream infections in an adult coronary intensive care unit [^112BkTVy]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Healthcare-associated infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are serious infections that can lead to increases in the length of hospital stays, case costs and mortality and morbidity.CLABSIs are a global healthcare problem despite the availability of guidelines, education and equipment to manage it. Most of these infections are preventable if evidence-based practices (including surveillance), insertion and maintenance guidelines are followed.

CLABSI is defined as a laboratory-confirmed BSI that occurs when an eligible BSI organism is identified and a central line is present when the BSI is laboratory confirmed. The specific definitions related to BSI/CLABSI surveillance are listed in table 1.

Table 1
Operational definitions specific to BSI/CLABSI surveillance

CLABSI causes significant increases in morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Nosocomial BSIs may prolong hospitalisation by an average of 7 days, and the estimated cost per BSI is between US$3700 and US$29 000. There is a considerable amount of literature demonstrating that best practices, protocols, checklists and establishing a culture of patient safety can reduce the incidence of CLABSI, or eliminate it entirely. Moreover, it has been shown that the effective implementation of central line insertion and maintenance bundles can reduce the incidence of CLABSI in intensive care units (ICUs) and in non-ICU settings. Bundle is sets of evidence-based measures that, when implemented together, have been shown to produce better outcomes and have a greater impact than the implementation of individual measures. In addition, the bundles also help to create reliable and consistent care systems in hospital settings, as they are simple (3–5 elements), concise and clear to interpret and implement.

Essential practices for preventing CLABSI recommended for all acute-care hospitals highlight that some measures have been combined into a prevention bundle focusing on catheter insertion, with numerous studies documenting that such bundles are effective, sustainable, and cost-effective in both adults and children; bundles are most likely to succeed when implemented within a previously established patient safety culture and success depends on adherence to individual measures, and data suggests that not all components of bundles may be necessary.

### Comparison of rates of central line-associated bloodstream infections in patients with 1 vs 2 central venous catheters [^111kRhVo]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Although rare compared with other health care–associated infections, central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) remain an important preventable health care–associated infection. These infections remain associated with significant mortality and can adversely affect patient care. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have established goals to try to eliminate CLABSI and promote the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) as the standardized reporting infrastructure to accomplish this. Since January 2012, hospital reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has depended on public reporting of CLABSI rates using NHSN methods. In these programs, CLABSI rates, reported as a standardized infection ratio, are included in the hospital-acquired condition score. Hospitals in the worst-performing quartile receive reductions in their reimbursement from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

Outcomes associated with CLABSI and non-CLABSI HOB in case-matched analyses by ICU status

In adjusted regression analyses, CLABSI and non-CLABSI HOB cases were associated with significantly longer hospital stays compared with the control cohort. The mean differences were 15.6 and 12.1 days, respectively, for admissions with non-ICU encounters; 17.4 and 14.9 days for admissions with an ICU encounter; and 16.8 and 13.8 days for combined ICU/non-ICU admissions. Hospital costs were also higher for CLABSI and non-CLABSI HOB cases compared with controls: mean differences of $32,759 and $25,207 per admission for non-ICU encounters; $55,001 and $42,095, respectively, for ICU encounters and $49,400 and $35,310, respectively, for all admissions (Table 4 and Supplementary Tableonline). The LOS for CLABSI was slightly higher than for non-CLABSI HOB cases. The adjusted means were 19.2 versus 15.9 days, respectively, for admissions with non-ICU encounters and 22.5 vs 19.6 days, respectively, for admissions with ICU encounters. Total hospital costs for CLABSI were also higher than for non-CLABSI HOB: $42,201 versus $34,243, respectively, for non-ICU encounters and $70,407 vs $57,262, respectively, for ICU encounters (Table 4).

### Economic evaluation of quality improvement interventions for bloodstream infections related to central catheters: a systematic review [^112kqhWY]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Although quality improvement (QI) interventions can reduce central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), their economic value is uncertain.

Objective

To systematically review economic evaluations of QI interventions designed to prevent CLABSI and/or CRBSI in acute care hospitals.

Evidence Review

A search of Ovid MEDLINE, Econlit, Centre for Reviews & Dissemination, New York Academy of Medicine's Grey Literature Report, Worldcat, prior systematic reviews (January 2004 to July 2016), and IDWeek conference abstracts (2013–2016), was conducted from 2013 to 2016. We included English-language studies of any design that evaluated organizational or structural changes to prevent CLABSI or CRBSI, and reported program and infection-related costs. Dual reviewers assessed study design, effectiveness, costs, and study quality. For each eligible study, we performed a cost-consequences analysis from the hospital perspective, estimating the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and incremental net savings. Unadjusted weighted regression analyses tested predictors of these measures, weighted by catheter-days per study per year.

Findings

Of 505 articles, 15 unique studies were eligible, together representing data from 113 hospitals. Thirteen studies compared Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality-recommended practices with usual care, including 7 testing insertion checklists. Eleven studies were based on uncontrolled before-after designs, 1 on a randomized controlled trial, 1 on a time-series analysis, and 2 on modeled estimates. Overall, the weighted mean IRR was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.35–0.51) and incremental net savings were $1.85 million (95% CI, $1.30 million to $2.40 million) per hospital over 3 years (2015 US dollars). Each $100 000-increase in program cost was associated with $315 000 greater savings (95% CI, $166 000-$464 000; P < .001). Infections and net costs declined when hospitals already used checklists or had baseline infection rates of 1.7 to 3.7 per 1000 catheter-days. Study quality was not associated with effectiveness or costs.

Conclusions and Relevance

Interventions related to central venous catheters were, on average, associated with 57% fewer bloodstream infections and substantial savings to hospitals. Larger initial investments may be associated with greater savings. Although checklists are now widely used and infections have started to decline, additional improvements and savings can occur at hospitals that have not yet attained very low infection rates.

### Incidence of central line associated bloodstream infection following central venous catheter placement in the emergency department [^112XpGUJ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) are costly and can be lifethreatening. Many efforts have been taken to minimize the rates of infection, including sterile technique, pre-packaged sterile kits, site selection, and replacing infected or potentially infected lines. This study aims to identify the incidence of CLABSI following catheter placement in the ED, and to compare rates of CLABSI among ED and ICU placed catheters.

Methods

This retrospective chart review was conducted at a Level 1 Trauma Center. Eligibility criteria included patients who had CVC placed in the ED or ICU from January 1st, 2018, through July 31st, 2019 who were 18 years or older.

Results

Among 1810 patients with central lines, 1254 met eligibility criteria. There was no significant difference in infection rates when comparing lines placed in the ED (2.5 per 1000 catheter days, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8 to 5.8) compared to those placed in the ICU (4.6 per 1000 catheter days, 95% CI 3.0 to 6.8). The odds of CLABSI was not associated with age, sex, indication, site, location nor which type of health care professional (HCP) placed the line.

Conclusions

In this study, the incidence of infection was no different between lines placed in the ED compared to the ICU.

Introduction

Catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSI)s, estimated by central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) surveillance criteria, are coupled with serious adverse outcomes including excess mortality and healthcare costs. A 2017 U.S. (United States) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) pre-pandemic meta-analysis reported an estimate of 150 excess deaths for every 1000 in-hospital CLABSI events (RR = 2.72). In the same report, the additional cost for these infections was estimated to be $48,108 (95% CI $27,232–$68,983).

The progress achieved in reducing CLABSI by 2019 in the U.S. was dismantled by the unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems during the global COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. acute care hospitals experienced a 7% increase in CLABSIs between the 2020 and 2021 pandemic years with the largest increase (10%) in intensive care units (ICU). By the end of 2022, the average CLABSI standardized infection ratio (SIR) dramatically increased by 60% since 2019.

During 2020, hospitals saw unprecedented increases in critically ill patients as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread across the United States. In response, hospitals were often required to modify their operations, services provided, and patient care practices. Several studies have documented an alarming increase in device utilization and healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in the United States during 2020, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs) –; however, studies evaluating changes in HAI pathogens during the pandemic have been limited to a small number of facilities. To assess changes in the common pathogens reported from central-line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) at the national level between 2019 and 2020, we examined data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) by acute-care hospitals.

Few data exist on the incidence of central line-associated bloodstream infection present on hospital admission (CLABSI-POA), although the practice of patients maintaining central lines outside of hospitals is increasing. We describe patients presenting to an academic medical center with CLABSI-POA over 1 year. Of the 130 admissions, half presented from home infusion (47%), followed by oncology clinic (22%), hemodialysis (14%), and skilled nursing facility (8%). Efforts to reduce CLABSIs should address patients across the entire health care system.

Risk factors for CLABSI emphasize device presence and patient populations: "Patients at risk for CLABSI in acute-care facilities are those with a CVC in place". In the ICU, "The risk of CLABSI in ICU patients is high", with reasons including "the frequent insertion of multiple catheters… the use of specific types of catheters… and the fact that catheters are frequently placed in emergency circumstances, repeatedly accessed each day, and often needed for extended periods". For non-ICU settings, "most CLABSIs occur in hospitalized patients in units outside the ICU or in outpatients". Prevention efforts "should include other vulnerable populations such as patients receiving hemodialysis through catheters, intraoperative patients, and oncology patients". Beyond CVCs, "short-term peripheral catheters, peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs), midline catheters, and peripheral arterial catheters also carry a risk of infection". Independent risk factors "in at least 2 published studies" include "Prolonged hospitalization before catheterization", "Prolonged duration of catheterization", "Heavy microbial colonization at insertion site", "Heavy microbial colonization of the catheter hub", and "Multilumen catheters".

Section 2: Background on detection of CLABSI

Surveillance methods and definitions for CLABSI

Use consistent surveillance methods and definitions to allow comparison to benchmark data.
Refer to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Patient Safety Component Manual for information on the appropriate surveillance methodology, including information about blood specimen collection and surveillance definitions of CLABSIs. The relevant chapter of the manual is "Chapter 4: Bloodstream Infection Event (Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection and Non-Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection)". Recent data suggest that interrater reliability using NHSN definitions is lower than expected. – This may also affect the reliability of public reporting. The NHSN surveillance definition for CLABSI is different than the clinical definition for catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). The latter is subject to various factors (eg, laboratory capabilities, catheter removal, and submitting the catheter tip for culture). The evidence presented here includes studies that used either CLABSI or CRBSI as an outcome measure and the lesser accuracy of CLABSI may impact the validity of the evidence.

### The clinical impacts and risk factors for non-central line-associated bloodstream infection in 5046 intensive care unit patients: an observational study based on electronic medical records [^117QvRxo]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Nosocomial bloodstream infections (NBSIs) are one of the most severe types of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), are a major cause of mortality, and are associated with significantly prolonged length of stay (LOS) in hospital and increased healthcare costs, especially in intensive care units (ICUs). NBSIs are consisted of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and non-central line-associated bloodstream infections (N-CLABSIs) according to the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Most of the previous studies focused on CLABSIs, which have clear preventability. Several evidence-based guidelines have been developed to prevent and reduce CLABSIs. A 46% reduction in CLABSIs has been obtained in hospitals across the United States from 2008 to 2013.

By contrast, N-CLABSI is a forgotten issue that has been poorly studied, especially in the Chinese population. N-CLABSI may be more common in NBSIs along with the reduction of CLABSI. It is still uncertain about whether patients with N-CLABSI have poorer outcomes than those without N-CLABSI or with CLABSI and whether N-CLABSI could be prevented. This study was performed to investigate the clinical impacts and risk factors for N-CLABSI in ICU patients to identify risk factors that could be controlled.

### Comparison of rates of central line-associated bloodstream infections in patients with 1 vs 2 central venous catheters [^1168prre]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Given the financial stakes, attributes of performance metrics related to CLABSI should be evaluated to ensure that facilities are being compared fairly. To be effective, performance metrics should be reliable and objective. A comparative metric should account for differences between facilities regarding patient risk for infection that are host-related and unrelated to actual performance of infection prevention. Although efforts to improve the NHSN CLABSI performance metrics have focused on standardized case ascertainment and adjustment for comorbidities, we contend that current NHSN methods for quantifying the risk period (ie, the denominator as specified by NHSN protocols) is flawed; the denominator currently reflects the sum of person–time at risk for CLABSI as central line–days (CLDs) incompletely.

Current risk adjustment only accounts for the category of patient location (eg, surgical intensive care unit, medical intensive care unit), hospital size (ie, number of licensed beds), and medical school affiliation. The output of this model is then multiplied by the number of CLDs to determine the number of expected CLABSIs. Currently, NHSN defines CLDs as the sum of patients on each day at a specified time with any CVC present; for example, 1 patient with 2 CVCs on 1 day counts as 1 CLD. However, a patient requiring more than 1 CVC at the same time (ie, concurrent CVC use) is likely to be at greater risk of CLABSI than a patient requiring only a single CVC. If concurrent CVC use confers substantial additional risk for CLABSI, NHSN risk adjustment methods could be improved to allow more fair comparisons when calculating a performance metric among facilities caring for patients for whom concurrent CVC use is a medical necessity more often than their peer facilities. To evaluate the increased risk of a patient with more than 1 CVC, we used a multiyear, multihospital data set and 2 statistical approaches to define the risk associated with concurrent CVC use on CLABSI incidence.

Introduction

Neonates admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) are prone to nosocomial infections leading to increased morbidities and complications. Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are one of the most common nosocomial infections in the neonatal ICU (NICU). Although central line catheters are a vital part of management of severe illnesses as they provide venous access to critically ill patients by minimising frequent exposures to painful heel pricks and venipuncture procedures, they can lead to the development of infections in patients in critical care areas. These infections increase the risk of severe motor deficit and neurodevelopment impairment among very low-birth-weight preterm infants. It also extends hospital length of stay, increases medical costs and it is a leading cause of mortality among very preterm infants. Awareness of the burden of these infections has been rising in the last two decades while healthcare workers strive to find a reliable approach that can spare newborns life-threatening complications.

To prevent CLABSIs, broad practice changes and quality improvement (QI) interventions are necessary. The cornerstone of these activities are central line bundles, which are evidence-based practices used together to improve patient outcomes. Implementation of central-line bundles can reduce the incidence of CLABSIs in ICUs worldwide and would decrease cost of care based on the reduction of ICU stay. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of insertion and maintenance bundles in preventing CLABSI revealed significant reduction in CLABSI rates among adult, paediatric and neonatal patients admitted to ICUs. Among the 75 studied NICUs, the average CLABSI rate decreased by 69% from 8.4 to 2.6 per 1000 catheter days. Another NICU-specific systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 eligible studies showed a 60% reduction in CLABSI following the introduction of care bundles.

### Characteristics, costs, and outcomes associated with central-line-associated bloodstream infection and hospital-onset bacteremia and fungemia in US hospitals [^111g3R7k]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study had several limitations. The definition of HOB used by the NHSN may undergo further iteration as more is learned about its use in infection prevention. We evaluated non-CLABSI HOB to provide insights into the additional burden of BSI cases not captured by reportable CLABSI events. However, as noted earlier, only first positive blood cultures were considered eligible for HOB designation, so HOB prevalence may have been underestimated. For our exploration of associated positive cultures, microorganism identification was based on species only. More frequent culturing in ICU patients may have led to increased identification of microorganisms compared with non-ICU patients. In case-matched analyses, controls were matched to CLABSI cases but not to non-CLABSI HOB cases; however, analyses were adjusted to make outcome comparisons more similar. As with any case-matched analyses, we acknowledge that differential outcomes are highly dependent on the control population. However, sensitivity analyses in which ICU status was not considered as a matching criterion resulted in similar differences in outcomes. Finally, sources of HOB were assigned to categories that could be feasibly extracted from EHR. For example, quantification of secondary HOBs associated with peripheral IV lines was beyond the scope of this analysis. Future studies will be needed to delineate a more granular source attribution list for HOB to facilitate infection preventionist efforts to mitigate HOB events.

The findings from this study document the extensive burden associated with non-CLABSI HOB in hospitalized US patients. Expanding reporting metrics to include non-CLABSI HOB will help provide a more comprehensive view of BSI control in hospitals and may allow new approaches to reducing the rate of these consequential infections. As healthcare systems continue to adjust to financial ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstration of the economic and patient burdens of HOB will be important in vetting this outcome as a reportable hospital quality metric. In the process, this information will provide insights into opportunities for improved patient safety and reduced hospital costs beyond those associated with NHSN-reportable CLABSI events.

CLABSI prevention evaluation — process and outcome measurement — states that evaluation involves process and outcome measurement; multidisciplinary teams should set clear goals and identify the key factors to be measured; it is important for providers and the healthcare team to receive feedback on performance; feedback should include periodic (eg, monthly, quarterly) communication of process measurement data with graphs showing cumulative compliance with process measures; differences between age groups should be considered; the standardized utilization ratio (SUR) provides a method for hospital units to compare themselves to others; and CLABSI events are important to discuss with team members to clarify gaps and mitigation strategies.

CLABSI outcome measures — Use NHSN definitions to calculate the central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rate with the following specification: "Numerator: Number of CLABSIs in each unit assessed (using NHSN definitions)" and "Denominator: Total number of catheter days in each unit assessed (using NHSN definitions)", and "Multiply by 1,000 so that the measure is expressed as number of CLABSIs per 1,000 catheter days". For risk adjustment, "Stratify CLABSI rates by type of patient-care unit", "Report comparisons based on historic data and NHSN data, if available", and "Use the NHSN device standardized infection ratio (dSIR)", defined as "Observed CLABSI events divided by predicted CLABSI events based on actual device days". At the patient-population level, a "population SIR (pSIR) accounts for both device SIR and SUR", defined as "Observed CLABSI events divided by predicted CLABSI events based on predicted device days".

Section 3: Background on prevention of CLABSI

Summary of existing guidelines and recommendations

Several governmental, public health, and professional organizations have published evidence-based guidelines and/or implementation aids regarding the prevention of CLABSI including the following: Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Making Health Care Safer American Pediatric Surgical Association, Outcomes and Clinical Trials Committee The Joint Commission APIC, Implementation Guide to Preventing Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections Infusion Nurses Society, Infusion Nursing Standards of Practice
The recommendations in this document focus on CVCs unless noted otherwise. These recommendations: Are not stratified based on the type of catheter (eg, tunneled, implanted, cuffed, non-cuffed catheter, dialysis catheter). May not be applicable in their entirety for prevention of bloodstream infections with other intravascular devices.

Infrastructure requirements

Facilities undertaking CLABSI interventions should have the following elements in place:
An adequately staffed infection prevention and control program responsible for identifying patients who meet the surveillance definition for CLABSI.
Infection prevention staff and, preferably, information technology support to collect and calculate catheter days as a denominator when computing rates of CLABSI and patient days to allow calculation of CVC utilization. Catheter days from information systems should be validated against a manual method, with a margin of error no greater than ± 5%. –
Resources to provide appropriate education and training.
Adequate laboratory support for timely processing of specimens and reporting of results, as specified by the supervisor of the surveillance program.

### A systematic review of central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) diagnostic reliability and error [^116eCHe8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To establish the reliability of the application of National Health and Safety Network (NHSN) central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) criteria within established reporting systems internationally.

Design

Diagnostic-test accuracy systematic review.

Methods

We conducted a search of Medline, SCOPUS, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL (EbscoHost), and PubMed (NCBI). Cohort studies were eligible for inclusion if they compared publicly reported CLABSI rates and were conducted by independent and expertly trained reviewers using NHSN/Centers for Disease Control (or equivalent) criteria. Two independent reviewers screened, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS 2 tool. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values were analyzed.

Results

A systematic search identified 1,259 publications; 9 studies were eligible for inclusion (n = 7,160 central lines). Publicly reported CLABSI rates were more likely to be underestimated (7 studies) than overestimated (2 studies). Specificity ranged from 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.58–0.81) to 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99–1.00) and sensitivity ranged from 0.42 (95% CI, 0.15–0.72) to 0.88 (95% CI, 0.77–0.95). Four studies, which included a consecutive series of patients (whole cohort), reported CLABSI incidence between 9.8% and 20.9%, and absolute CLABSI rates were underestimated by 3.3%-4.4%. The risk of bias was low to moderate in most included studies.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest consistent underestimation of true CLABSI incidence within publicly reported rates, weakening the validity and reliability of surveillance measures. Auditing, education, and adequate resource allocation is necessary to ensure that surveillance data are accurate and suitable for benchmarking and quality improvement measures over time.

Methods

SHEA recruited 3 subject-matter experts in the prevention of CLABSI to lead the panel of members representing the Compendium partnering organizations: SHEA, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), the American Hospital Association (AHA), and The Joint Commission, as well as representation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

SHEA utilized a consultant medical librarian, who worked with each panel to develop a comprehensive search strategy for PubMed and Embase (January 2012–July 2019; updated to August 2021). Articles' abstracts were reviewed by panel members in a double-blind fashion using the abstract management software, Covidence (Melbourne, Australia), and subsequently reviewed as full text. The Compendium Lead Authors group voted to update the literature findings, and the librarian reran the search to update it to August 2021. Panel members reviewed the abstracts of these articles via Covidence and incorporated relevant references.

Recommendations resulting from this literature review process were classified based on the quality of evidence and the balance between desirable and potential for undesirable effects of various interventions (see Table 2). Panel members met via video conference to discuss literature findings; recommendations; quality of evidence for these recommendations; and classification as essential practices, additional approaches, or unresolved issues. Panel members reviewed and approved the document and its recommendations.

### Introduction to… [^115YgwJv]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Since the initial and updated publications of A Compendium of Strategies to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections in Acute Care Hospitals in 2008 and 2014, – substantial progress in HAI prevention has been achieved through the combined efforts of federal, state, and local public health entities and healthcare facilities. These efforts have been supported by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) National Action Plan to Prevent Health Care-Associated Infections (HAIs), in coordination with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) HAI reporting requirements and reimbursement penalties tied to healthcare facilities' HAI performance regarding central-line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), surgical-site infections (SSIs), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections, and Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs). Progress in healthcare epidemiology and implementation science research has led to improvements in our understanding of effective strategies for HAI prevention. Despite these advances, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that each day, ∼1 in 31 patients in US healthcare facilitiescontracts at least 1 infection in association with hospital care, leading to substantial morbidity, mortality, and excess healthcare expenditures.

### Using interprofessional collaboration to reduce reported rates of central-line-associated bloodstream infection in an intensive care setting [^115emdiq]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Central-line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are preventable healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospital stay. Additionally, CLABSIs are the most expensive HAIs, with an estimated cost of $46,000 per case.

Surveillance criteria used to define CLABSIs in an acute-care setting are based on the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definitions. Surveillance consists of review of positive blood cultures from patients with qualifying central lines. To meet criteria for CLABSI, qualifying central lines must be in place for > 2 consecutive calendar days after being accessed. A 7-day infection window period (IWP), which includes the 3 days before and after the first positive diagnostic test, is used to review infection criteria to meet the surveillance definition. For example, if a patient had a positive blood culture on January 4, the IWP would be January 1 through January 7. If no secondary sources are identified as a cause of the bloodstream infection (BSI), it will qualify as a CLABSI. Surveillance definitions are standardized to avoid variations in reporting. However, several factors, including misidentification of NHSN criteria and lack of diagnostic workup to identify secondary sources or documentation, could affect CLABSI reporting.

To understand the occurrence of CLABSIs in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), root-cause analysis data were analyzed. Multiple opportunities that affect unit CLABSI rates were identified, including gaps in clinical assessment, diagnostic testing, blood-culture and central-line utilization, and documentation. Using an interprofessional proactive approach, we sought to reduce the number of CLABSIs by following the institutional blood-culture stewardship guideline, reducing unnecessary blood-culture and central-line utilization and evaluating for secondary sources of BSI.

### Comparison of rates of central line-associated bloodstream infections in patients with 1 vs 2 central venous catheters [^115GWDeH]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

National Healthcare Safety Network methods for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) surveillance do not account for potential additive risk for CLABSI associated with use of 2 central venous catheters (CVCs) at the same time (concurrent CVCs); facilities that serve patients requiring high acuity care with medically indicated concurrent CVC use likely disproportionally incur Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services payment penalties for higher CLABSI rates.

Objective

To quantify the risk for CLABSI associated with concurrent use of a second CVC.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with 2 or more days with a CVC at 4 geographically separated general acute care hospitals in the Atlanta, Georgia, area that varied in size from 110 to 580 beds, from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017. Variables included clinical conditions, central line-days, and concurrent CVC use. Patients were propensity score-matched for likelihood of concurrence (limited to 2 CVCs), and conditional logistic regression modeling was performed to estimate the risk of CLABSI associated with concurrence. Episodes of CVC were categorized as low or high risk and single vs concurrent use to evaluate time to CLABSI with Cox proportional hazards regression models. Data were analyzed from January to June 2019.

Exposures

Two CVCs present at the same time.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Hospitalizations in which a patient developed a CLABSI, allowing estimation of patient risk for CLABSI and daily hazard for a CVC episode ending in CLABSI.

Results

Among a total of 50 254 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 59 [45–69] years; 26 661 [53.1%] women), 64 575 CVCs were used and 647 CLABSIs were recorded. Concurrent CVC use was recorded in 6877 patients (13.7%); the most frequent indications for concurrent CVC use were nutrition (554 patients [14.1%]) or hemodialysis (1706 patients [43.4%]). In the propensity score-matched cohort, 74 of 3932 patients with concurrent CVC use (1.9%) developed CLABSI, compared with 81 of 7864 patients with single CVC use (1.0%). Having 2 CVCs for longer than two-thirds of a patient's CVC use duration was associated with increased likelihood of developing a CLABSI, adjusting for central line-days and comorbidities (adjusted risk ratio, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.10–2.33; p = 0.001). In survival analysis adjusting for sex, receipt of chemotherapy or total parenteral nutrition, and facility, compared with a single CVC, the daily hazard for 2 low-risk CVCs was 1.78 (95% CI, 1.35–2.34; P < .001), while the daily hazard for 1 low-risk and 1 high-risk CVC was 1.80 (95% CI, 1.42–2.28; P < .001), and the daily hazard for 2 high-risk CVCs was 1.78 (95% CI, 1.14–2.77; p = 0.01).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that concurrent CVC use is associated with nearly 2-fold the risk of CLABSI compared with use of a single low-risk CVC. Performance metrics for CLABSI should change to account for variations of this intrinsic patient risk among facilities to reduce biased comparisons and resultant penalties applied to facilities that are caring for more patients with medically indicated concurrent CVC use.

### Effectiveness of insertion and maintenance bundles to prevent central-line-associated bloodstream infections in critically ill patients of all ages: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114SGwkT]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are a major problem in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. We aimed to quantify the effectiveness of central-line bundles (insertion or maintenance or both) to prevent these infections.

Methods

We searched Embase, MEDLINE OvidSP, Web-of-Science, and Cochrane Library to identify studies reporting the implementation of central-line bundles in adult ICU, paediatric ICU (PICU), or neonatal ICU (NICU) patients. We searched for studies published between Jan 1, 1990, and June 30, 2015. For the meta-analysis, crude estimates of infections were pooled by use of a DerSimonian and Laird random effect model. The primary outcome was the number of CLABSIs per 1000 catheter-days before and after implementation. Incidence risk ratios (IRRs) were obtained by use of random-effects models.

Findings

We initially identified 4337 records, and after excluding duplicates and those ineligible, 96 studies met the eligibility criteria, 79 of which contained sufficient information for a meta-analysis. Median CLABSIs incidence were 5.7 per 1000 catheter-days (range 1.2–46.3; IQR 3.1–9.5) on adult ICUs; 5.9 per 1000 catheter-days (range 2.6–31.1; 4.8–9.4) on PICUs; and 8.4 per 1000 catheter-days (range 2.6–24.1; 3.7–16.0) on NICUs. After implementation of central-line bundles the CLABSI incidence ranged from 0 to 19.5 per 1000 catheter-days (median 2.6, IQR 1.2–4.4) in all types of ICUs. In our meta-analysis the incidence of infections decreased significantly from median 6.4 per 1000 catheter-days (IQR 3.8–10.9) to 2.5 per 1000 catheter-days (1.4–4.8) after implementation of bundles (IRR 0.44, 95% CI 0.39–0.50, p < 0.0001; I(2) = 89%).

Interpretation

Implementation of central-line bundles has the potential to reduce the incidence of CLABSIs.

Most of the previous studies focused on central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), while non-central line-associated bloodstream infection (N-CLABSI) was poorly studied. This study was performed to investigate the clinical impacts and risk factors for N-CLABSI in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Methods

An observational study was conducted in an adult general ICU. The electronic medical records from 2013 to 2017 of all patients aged ≥ 18years admitted to the ICU > 2days were analyzed retrospectively. Patients with N-CLABSI and without N-CLABSI or with CLABSI were compared for clinical features and outcomes. Predicted death in ICU included death in ICU and discharging from ICU against medical advice because of critical conditions and the desire to pass away at home. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to ensure that both two groups had similar baseline characteristics. Multivariate regression models were used to confirm whether N-CLABSI was an independent risk factor for each of the outcomes and to analyze the risk factors for N-CLABSI in ICU patients.

Results

Of 5046 patients included, 155 developed 168 ICU-acquired N-CLABSI episodes (2.1 episodes per 1000 patient-days) in the ICU, accounted for the majority of nosocomial bloodstream infections (NBSIs; 71.8%). After PS matching, patients with N-CLABSI had prolonged length of stay (LOS) in ICU (median 15 days, p < 0.001) and LOS in hospital (median 13 days, p < 0.001), excess hospitalization costs (median, $27,668 [in US dollar 2017, 1:6.75], p < 0.001), and increased mortality in ICU (8.8%, p = 0.013) and predicted mortality in ICU (22.7%, p < 0.001), compared with those without N-CLABSI. There were no significant differences in all the outcomes between N-CLABSI and CLABSI. N-CLABSI was an independent risk factor for each of the outcomes. Gastrointestinal bleeding (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.30), trauma (aOR 2.52), pancreatitis (aOR 3.45), surgical operation (aOR 1.82), intravascular catheters (aOR 2.93), sepsis (aOR 1.69), pneumonia (aOR 1.53), intraabdominal infection (IAI, aOR 8.37), or healthcare-associated infections other than NBSI, pneumonia, and IAI (aOR 3.89) were risk factors for N-CLABSI in ICU patients.

Conclusions

N-CLABSI was associated with similar poor outcomes with CLABSI, including prolonged LOS in ICU and in hospital and increased hospitalization costs and predicted mortality in ICU. The risk factors for N-CLABSI identified in this study provide further insight in preventing N-CLABSI.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^116CdmUj]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) prevention — site selection: The subclavian site is preferred to reduce infectious complications when CVCs are placed in the ICU setting (Quality of Evidence: HIGH). In the non-ICU setting, the risk of infection between the different sites remains unclear. In children and infants, femoral vein catheterization may be considered if upper body sites are contraindicated, and tunneled femoral vein catheters, with an exit site outside the diaper area in the mid-thigh, may be safe and provide additional risk reduction. Among patients currently receiving or likely to require hemodialysis, the subclavian site is avoided due to risk of stenosis.

### Comparison of rates of central line-associated bloodstream infections in patients with 1 vs 2 central venous catheters [^112J7FG4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study provides large-scale, robust evidence of a large and significant excess risk for CLABSI associated with use of a second CVC concurrently with an initial CVC. The excess risk is nearly 2-fold that of a single CVC, an increased risk of approximately 80%; this finding adds to other evidence that accounting for total CVC use would produce a more accurate metric of CLABSI prevention efforts than the current NHSN method, which is agnostic to use of 2 CVCs at the same time. The best operational approach to account for concurrent use of medically indicated CVCs should be determined and implemented to improve the value of NHSN CLABSI reporting as a fair and meaningful performance metric.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^1139kZA9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Healthcare-associated infections and patient safety

Improving patient safety in hospitals worldwide presently requires a systematic approach to preventing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The two go together. HAIs are infections that occur while receiving healthcare. Patients with medical devices (central lines, urinary catheters, ventilators) or who undergo surgical procedures are at risk of acquiring HAIs.

The occurrence of HAIs continues to escalate at an alarming rate. These infections result in significant patient illnesses and deaths, prolong the duration of hospital stay, and necessitate additional diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, which generate supplementary costs to those already sustained due to the patient's underlying disease. However, the phenomenon is not yet sufficiently perceived among both healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients, thus resulting in a low level of intervention request and relative inadequate responses. Although HAIs are the most frequent adverse events in healthcare, their true global burden remains unknown because of the difficulty in gathering reliable data: most countries lack surveillance systems for HAIs, and those do have them struggle with the complexity and the lack of uniformity of criteria.

HAIs are considered adverse events, and as many are preventable, they are considered an indicator of the quality of patient care and a patient safety issue. In 2018, a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies between 2005 and 2016 evaluated the results of multifaceted interventions to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), surgical site infections (SSIs), ventilator-associated pneumonia, and hospital-acquired pneumonia not associated with mechanical ventilation in acute care or long-term care settings. Of the 5226 articles identified, 144 studies were included in the final analysis. Published evidence suggested a sustained potential for the significant reduction of HAI rates in the range of 35–55% associated with multifaceted interventions irrespective of a country's income level.

### Are antimicrobial peripherally inserted central catheters associated with reduction in central line-associated bloodstream infection? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112a9sRg]. American Journal of Infection Control (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) may reduce the risk of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). However, data regarding efficacy are limited. We aimed to evaluate whether antimicrobial PICCs are associated with CLABSI reduction.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, and Web of Science were searched from inception to July 2016; conference proceedings were searched to identify additional studies. Study selection and data extraction were performed independently by 2 authors.

Results

Of 597 citations identified, 8 studies involving 12,879 patients met eligibility criteria. Studies included adult and pediatric patients from intensive care, long-term care, and general ward settings. The incidence of CLABSI in patients with antimicrobial PICCs was 0.2% (95% confidence interval, 0.0%-0.5%), and the incidence among nonantimicrobial catheters was 5.3% (95% CI, 2.6%-8.8%). Compared with noncoated PICCs, antimicrobial PICCs were associated with a significant reduction in CLABSI (relative risk [RR],0.29; 95% CI, 0.10–0.78). Statistical heterogeneity (I 2 ,71.6%; T2 = 1.07) was resolved by publication type, with peer-reviewed articles showing greater reduction in CLABSI (RR,0.21; 95% CI, 0.06–0.74). Twenty-six patients (95% CI, 21–75) need to be treated with antimicrobial PICCs to prevent 1 CLABSI. Studies of adults at greater baseline risk of CLABSI experienced greater reduction in CLABSI (RR, 0.20; p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Available evidence suggests that antimicrobial PICCs may reduce CLABSI, especially in high-risk subgroups. Randomized trials are needed to assess efficacy across patient populations.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): the urgent need to refocus on hardwiring prevention efforts [^117Kk5NA]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a considerable impact on US healthcare, straining hospital resources and operations. By early December 2020, COVID-19 hospitalizations accounted for ∼14.5% of occupied inpatient beds. Caring for COVID-19 patients requires more complex processes from diagnostic to safety measures, and it places tremendous pressure on healthcare workers, from staffing challengesto risk of exposure and infection. In addition, the inpatient population has changed, with a precipitous drop in elective surgical casesand an avoidance of patients being admitted for other medical conditions resulting in a higher case mix index (CMI) among our patient populations. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients often required close monitoring and higher levels of care, including ventilatory and critical care support.

Hospital-onset healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are key quality and safety metrics publicly reported in the acute-care space and linked to hospital reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). National efforts have been successfully implemented to reduce central-line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) CLABSI and CAUTI outcomes in 78 hospitals of a large, multistate, healthcare system in the United States. Particularly, we examined changes in device utilization, CLABSI and CAUTI events, the associated microbiology of these infections, and the impact on outcomes reflected by the NHSN standardized infection ratio.

### Vital signs: central line-associated blood stream infections – United States, 2001, 2008, and 2009 [^112SceYc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Health-care-associated infections (HAIs) affect 5% of patients hospitalized in the United States each year. Central line-associated blood stream infections (CLABSIs) are important and deadly HAIs, with reported mortality of 12%-25%. This report provides national estimates of the number of CLABSIs among patients in intensive-care units (ICUs), inpatient wards, and outpatient hemodialysis facilities in 2008 and 2009 and compares ICU estimates with 2001 data.

Methods

To estimate the total number of CLABSIs among patients aged ≥ 1 year in the United States, CDC multiplied central-line utilization and CLABSI rates by estimates of the total number of patient-days in each of three settings: ICUs, inpatient wards, and outpatient hemodialysis facilities. CDC identified total inpatient-days from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample and from the Hospital Cost Report Information System. Central-line utilization and CLABSI rates were obtained from the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System for 2001 estimates (ICUs only) and from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) for 2009 estimates (ICUs and inpatient wards). CDC estimated the total number of outpatient hemodialysis patient-days in 2008 using the single-day number of maintenance hemodialysis patients from the U.S. Renal Data System. Outpatient hemodialysis central-line utilization was obtained from the Fistula First Breakthrough Initiative, and hemodialysis CLABSI rates were estimated from NHSN. Annual pathogen-specific CLABSI rates were calculated for 2001–2009.

Results

In 2001, an estimated 43,000 CLABSIs occurred among patients hospitalized in ICUs in the United States. In 2009, the estimated number of ICU CLABSIs had decreased to 18,000. Reductions in CLABSIs caused by Staphylococcus aureus were more marked than reductions in infections caused by gram-negative rods, Candida spp., and Enterococcus spp. In 2009, an estimated 23,000 CLABSIs occurred among patients in inpatient wards and, in 2008, an estimated 37,000 CLABSIs occurred among patients receiving outpatient hemodialysis.

Conclusions

In 2009 alone, an estimated 25,000 fewer CLABSIs occurred in U.S. ICUs than in 2001, a 58% reduction. This represents up to 6,000 lives saved and $414 million in potential excess health-care costs in 2009 and approximately $1.8 billion in cumulative excess health-care costs since 2001. A substantial number of CLABSIs continue to occur, especially in outpatient hemodialysis centers and inpatient wards.

Implications For Public Health Practice

Major reductions have occurred in the burden of CLABSIs in ICUs. State and federal efforts coordinated and supported by CDC, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and implemented by numerous health-care providers likely have helped drive these reductions. The substantial number of infections occurring in non-ICU settings, especially in outpatient hemodialysis centers, and the smaller decreases in non-S. aureus CLABSIs reveal important areas for expanded prevention efforts. Continued success in CLABSI prevention will require increased adherence to current CLABSI prevention recommendations, development and implementation of additional prevention strategies, and the ongoing collection and analysis of data, including specific microbiologic information. To prevent CLABSIs in hemodialysis patients, efforts to reduce central line use for hemodialysis and improve the maintenance of central lines should be expanded. The model of federal, state, facility, and health-care provider collaboration that has proven so successful in CLABSI prevention should be applied to other HAIs and other health-care-associated conditions.

### Health care-associated infections among critically ill children in the US, 2013–2018 [^113TXTdr]. JAMA Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Central catheter-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) increase morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in pediatric patients.

Objective

To examine changes over time in CLABSI and CAUTI rates between 2013 and 2018 in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) using prospective surveillance data from community hospitals, children's hospitals, and pediatric units within general hospitals.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This time series study included 176 US hospitals reporting pediatric health care-associated infection surveillance data to the National Healthcare Safety Network from January 1, 2013, to June 30, 2018. Patients aged 18 years or younger admitted to PICUs or level III NICUs were included in the analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes were device-associated rates of CLABSI in NICUs and PICUs and CAUTI in PICUs (infections per 1000 device-days). Secondary outcomes included population-based rates (infections per 10 000 patient-days) and device utilization (device-days per patient-days). Regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations to assess yearly changes in CLABSI and CAUTI rates, adjusted for birth weight (≤ 1500 vs > 1500 g) in neonatal models.

Results

Of the 176 hospitals, 132 hospitals with NICUs and 114 hospitals with PICUs contributed data. Of these, NICUs reported 6 064 172 patient-days and 1 363 700 central line-days and PICUs reported 1 999 979 patient-days, 925 956 central catheter-days, and 327 599 indwelling urinary catheter-days. In NICUs, there were no significant changes in yearly trends in device-associated (incidence rate ratio [IRR] per year, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95–1.03) and population-based (IRR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92–1.00) CLABSI rates or central catheter utilization (odds ratio [OR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95–1.00). Results were similar in PICUs, with device-associated (IRR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.99–1.07) and population-based (IRR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.99–1.07) CLABSI rates and central catheter utilization (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01) remaining stable. While device-associated CAUTI rates in PICUs also remained unchanged over time (IRR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.91–1.03), population-based CAUTI rates significantly decreased by 8% per year (IRR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86–0.98) and indwelling urinary catheter utilization significantly decreased by 6% per year (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91–0.96).

Conclusions and Relevance

Recent trends in CLABSI rates noted in this study among critically ill neonates and children in a large cohort of US hospitals indicate that past gains have held, without evidence of further improvements, suggesting novel approaches for CLABSI prevention are needed. Modest improvements in population-based CAUTI rates likely reflect more judicious use of urinary catheters.

### Attributable costs of central line-associated bloodstream infections in a pediatric hematology / oncology population [^117AXxtg]. American Journal of Infection Control (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although several studies have estimated the attributable cost and length of stay (LOS) of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) in the pediatric intensive care unit setting, little is known about the attributable costs and LOS of CLABSIs in the vulnerable pediatric hematology/oncology population.

Methods

We studied a total of 1562 inpatient admissions for 291 pediatric hematology/oncology patients at a single tertiary care children's hospital in the mid-Atlantic region between January 2008 and May 2011. Costs were normalized to year 2011 dollars. Propensity score matching was used to estimate the effect of CLABSIs on total cost and LOS while controlling for other covariates.

Results

Sixty CLABSIs occurred during the 1562 admissions. Compared with the patients without a CLABSI, those who developed a CLABSI tended to be older (9.0 years vs 7.5 years; p = 0.026) and to have a tunneled catheter (46.7% vs 27.0%) and a peripherally inserted central catheter (20.0% vs 11.2%) as opposed to other types of catheters (P < .0001). Propensity score matching yielded matched groups without significant differences in patient characteristics. In the propensity score analysis, the attributable LOS of a CLABSI was 21.2 days (P < .0001), and the attributable cost of a CLABSI was $69,332 (P < .0001).

Conclusions

Among pediatric hematology/oncology patients, CLABSI was associated with an additional LOS of 21 days and increased costs of nearly $70,000. These findings may inform decisions regarding the value of investing in efforts to prevent CLABSIs in this vulnerable population.

### Analysis of catheter utilization, central line associated bloodstream infections, and costs associated with an inpatient critical care-driven vascular access model [^111W34us]. American Journal of Infection Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) carry serious risks for patients and financial consequences for hospitals. Avoiding unnecessary temporary central venous catheters (CVC) can reduce CLABSI. Critical Care Medicine (CCM) is often consulted to insert CVC when alternatives are unavailable. We aim to describe clinical and financial implications of a CCM-driven vascular access model.

Methods

In this retrospective, observational cohort study, all CLABSI and a sample of CCM consults for CVC insertion on adult medical-surgical inpatient units were reviewed in 2019. Assessment of CVC appropriateness and financial analysis of labor, reimbursement, and attributable CLABSI cost was conducted.

Results

Of 554 CCM consult requests, 75 (13.5%) were for CVC and 36 (48.0%) resulted in CVC insertion; 6 (16.7%) CVC were avoidable. Three CLABSI occurred in avoidable CVC with estimated annual attributable cost of $165,099. Estimated annual CCM consultant cost for CVC was $78,094 generating $110,733 in reimbursement. Overall estimated annual loss was $132,460.

Discussion

Reliance on CCM for intravenous access resulted in avoidable CVC, CLABSI, inefficient physician effort, and financial losses; nurse-driven vascular access models offer potential cost savings and risk reduction.

Conclusions

CCM-driven vascular access models may not be cost-effective; alternatives should be considered for utilization reduction, CLABSI prevention, and financial viability.

### NICU-specific bundle for minimizing central line-associated bloodstream infections: comparative health care costs of interventions [^114ovgNW]. American Journal of Infection Control (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSIs) in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) significantly impact patient outcomes and healthcare costs. This study evaluates the effect of NICU-specific bundle designed to prevent CLABSIs.

Method

This retrospective single-center study was conducted at Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine from March 2020 to August 2021. It was designed to compare 2 periods: pre-intervention and post-intervention period.

Result

The implementation of the bundles led to a significant reduction in infection rates, with CLABSIs decreasing from 29 to 4 per 1000 central line days in NICU-1 and from 14.2 to 2.6 per 1000 central line days in NICU-2. This decline was accompanied by an 80% reduction in the average healthcare cost per patient.

Conclusion

The implementation of a NICU-specific CLABSI prevention bundle significantly reduced infection rates and lowered healthcare costs by approximately 80% per patient. These findings highlight the effectiveness of structured, multidisciplinary infection control strategies in improving neonatal outcomes and resource utilization.

### The clinical impacts and risk factors for non-central line-associated bloodstream infection in 5046 intensive care unit patients: an observational study based on electronic medical records [^113sr334]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have identified that both NBSIs (as a whole) and CLABSIs were associated with poor clinical outcomes, including LOS in hospital, healthcare costs, and mortality. The prolonged LOS in ICU of CLABSIs varied from 10 to 20 days, excess costs of CLABSIs from $3700 to $39,000, and the increased mortality of CLABSIs from 4 to 37%. These ranges contained the excess outcomes of N-CLABSIs in this study. However, few studies have estimated the difference in the clinical outcomes between N-CLABSIs and CLABSIs. Our study showed that N-CLABSIs had similar poor outcomes with CLABSIs. N-CLABSI was indeed a significant independent risk factor for each of the outcomes of ICU patients according to this study. Therefore, N-CLABSI should be paid more attention to than previous, especially in ICU patients.

Most previous studies focus on CLABSI with a probable reason that CLABSI has better preventability. However, the preventability of N-CLABSI is still uncertain. The risk factors for N-CLABSI in this study were significantly different from those for CLABSI. These factors provide possibilities to prevent N-CLABSIs. Measures that could prevent pathogens from entering the bloodstream directly from the wounds or could control or prevent the infectious factors could be possible prevention strategies for N-CLABSI. For example, timely hemostasis for gastrointestinal bleeding; aseptic techniques for wound management, operation, and intravascular catheters; treating the primary infections; and preventing HAIs could be effective for preventing N-CLABSI in ICU patients. IAI (including ICU-acquired IAI) with aOR 8.37 and HAIs other than BSI, pneumonia, and IAI with aOR 3.89 were the strongest two independent risk factors for N-CLABSI. This suggests more necessity to prevent HAIs.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^112uiGG3]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) prevention — essential practices before insertion: Provide easy access to an evidence-based list of indications for central venous catheter (CVC) use to minimize unnecessary CVC placement; require education and competency assessment of healthcare personnel (HCP) involved in insertion, care, and maintenance of CVCs about CLABSI prevention; bathe intensive care unit (ICU) patients aged ≥ 2 months with a chlorhexidine preparation on a daily basis; in ICU and non-ICU settings, a facility should have a process in place, such as a checklist, to ensure adherence to infection prevention practices at the time of CVC insertion; use hand hygiene prior to catheter insertion or manipulation; the subclavian site is preferred to reduce infectious complications when the catheter is placed in the ICU setting; use an all-inclusive catheter cart or kit; use ultrasound guidance for catheter insertion; use maximum sterile barrier precautions during CVC insertion; and use an alcoholic chlorhexidine antiseptic for skin preparation.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^1159ATum]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

External reporting and regulatory requirements — Public reporting of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) presents challenges: "Many challenges exist in providing useful information to consumers and other stakeholders and in preventing unintended consequences of public reporting of HAIs". Guidance exists as "Recommendations for public reporting of HAIs have been provided by the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), the Healthcare-Associated Infection Working Group of the Joint Public Policy Committee, and the National Quality Forum". Regulatory obligations include that "Hospitals in states that have mandatory reporting requirements for CLABSI must ensure that they obtain data required by the state, usually through NHSN", and "For information on state and federal requirements, contact your state or local health department". Participation in initiatives requires that "Hospitals that participate in external quality initiatives or state programs must collect and report the data required by the initiative or the program", while recognizing that "Problems with interrater reliability may affect comparisons between different institutions".

### Multinational prospective study of incidence and risk factors for central-line-associated bloodstream infections in 728 intensive care units of 41 Asian, African, Eastern European, latin American, and middle Eastern countries over 24 years [^112ohL1y]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify central-line (CL)-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) incidence and risk factors in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Design

From July 1, 1998, to February 12, 2022, we conducted a multinational multicenter prospective cohort study using online standardized surveillance system and unified forms.

Setting

The study included 728 ICUs of 286 hospitals in 147 cities in 41 African, Asian, Eastern European, Latin American, and Middle Eastern countries.

Patients

In total, 278,241 patients followed during 1,815,043 patient days acquired 3,537 CLABSIs.

Methods

For the CLABSI rate, we used CL days as the denominator and the number of CLABSIs as the numerator. Using multiple logistic regression, outcomes are shown as adjusted odds ratios (aORs).

Results

The pooled CLABSI rate was 4.82 CLABSIs per 1,000 CL days, which is significantly higher than that reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC NHSN). We analyzed 11 variables, and the following variables were independently and significantly associated with CLABSI: length of stay (LOS), risk increasing 3% daily (aOR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.03–1.04; P < .0001), number of CL days, risk increasing 4% per CL day (aOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03–1.04; P < .0001), surgical hospitalization (aOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03–1.21; P < .0001), tracheostomy use (aOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.23–1.88; P < .0001), hospitalization at a publicly owned facility (aOR, 3.04; 95% CI, 2.31–4.01; P < .0001) or at a teaching hospital (aOR, 2.91; 95% CI, 2.22–3.83; P < .0001), hospitalization in a middle-income country (aOR, 2.41; 95% CI, 2.09–2.77; P < .0001). The ICU type with highest risk was adult oncology (aOR, 4.35; 95% CI, 3.11–6.09; P < .0001), followed by pediatric oncology (aOR, 2.51;95% CI, 1.57–3.99; P < .0001), and pediatric (aOR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.81–3.01; P < .0001). The CL type with the highest risk was internal-jugular (aOR, 3.01; 95% CI, 2.71–3.33; P < .0001), followed by femoral (aOR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.96–2.68; P < .0001). Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was the CL with the lowest CLABSI risk (aOR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.02–2.18; p = 0.04).

Conclusions

The following CLABSI risk factors are unlikely to change: country income level, facility ownership, hospitalization type, and ICU type. These findings suggest a focus on reducing LOS, CL days, and tracheostomy; using PICC instead of internal-jugular or femoral CL; and implementing evidence-based CLABSI prevention recommendations.

CLABSI prevention — antimicrobial lock therapy for long-term CVCs: Use antimicrobial lock therapy for long-term CVCs, as such an approach can reduce the risk of CLABSI, and because of concerns about resistance use antimicrobial locks as a preventative strategy for patients with long-term hemodialysis catheters who have a history of recurrent CLABSI, for prophylaxis in patients with limited venous access and a history of recurrent CLABSI, and for patients at heightened risk of severe sepsis from a CLABSI (eg, patients with recently implanted intravascular devices such as a prosthetic heart valve or aortic graft). To minimize systemic toxicity, aspirate rather than flush the antimicrobial lock solution after the dwell time has elapsed, and potential adverse effects associated with ethanol locks should be carefully considered before use.

Outcome measures (See Table 4)

CLABSI rate: Use NHSN definitions. Numerator: Number of CLABSIs in each unit assessed (using NHSN definitions). Denominator: Total number of catheter days in each unit assessed (using NHSN definitions). Multiply by 1,000 so that the measure is expressed as number of CLABSIs per 1,000 catheter days.
Risk adjustment: Stratify CLABSI rates by type of patient-care unit. – Report comparisons based on historic data and NHSN data, if available. Use the NHSN device standardized infection ratio (dSIR) to evaluate hospital and unit CLABSI rates. dSIR: Observed CLABSI events divided by predicted CLABSI events based on actual device days. Consider measures that address device risk at the patient population level. A population SIR (pSIR)accounts for both device SIR and SUR, reflecting both the care of the device, and interventions to reduce utilization. pSIR: Observed CLABSI events divided by predicted CLABSI events based on predicted device days.

External reporting

Many challenges exist in providing useful information to consumers and other stakeholders and in preventing unintended consequences of public reporting of HAIs. Recommendations for public reporting of HAIs have been provided by the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), the Healthcare-Associated Infection Working Group of the Joint Public Policy Committee, and the National Quality Forum.

State and federal requirements

Hospitals in states that have mandatory reporting requirements for CLABSI must collect and report the data required by the state.
For information on state and federal requirements, contact your state or local health department.

External quality initiatives

Hospitals that participate in external quality initiatives or state programs must collect and report the data required by the initiative or the program.
Problems with interrater reliability may affect comparisons between different institutions.

### The association between central line-associated bloodstream infection and central line access [^115UtTV9]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Identifying modifiable risk factors associated with central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) may lead to modifications to central line (CL) management. We hypothesize that the number of CL accesses per day is associated with an increased risk for CLABSI and that a significant fraction of CL access may be substituted with non-CL routes.

Design

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with at least one CL device day from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019. A multivariate mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between the number of CL accesses in a given CL device day and prevalence of CLABSI within the following 3 days.

Setting

A 395-bed pediatric academic medical center.

Patients

Patients with at least one CL device day from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

There were 138,411 eligible CL device days across 6,543 patients, with 639 device days within 3 days of a CLABSI (a total of 217 CLABSIs). The number of per-day CL accesses was independently associated with risk of CLABSI in the next 3 days (adjusted odds ratio, 1.007; 95% CI, 1.003–1.012; p = 0.002). Of medications administered through CLs, 88% were candidates for delivery through a peripheral line. On average, these accesses contributed a 6.3% increase in daily risk for CLABSI.

Conclusions

The number of daily CL accesses is independently associated with risk of CLABSI in the next 3 days. In the pediatric population examined, most medications delivered through CLs could be safely administered peripherally. Efforts to reduce CL access may be an important strategy to include in contemporary CLABSI-prevention bundles.

### Descriptive epidemiology of central line-associated bloodstream infections at an academic medical center in Iowa, 2019–2022 [^1128TJAi]. American Journal of Infection Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) increased nationally during the COVID-19 pandemic. We described CLABSIs at our institution during 2019 to 2022.

Methods

This retrospective observational study examined CLABSIs among adult inpatients at an 866-bed teaching hospital in the Midwest. CLABSI incidence was trended over time and compared to monthly COVID-19 admissions. Manual chart review was performed to obtain patient demographics, catheter-associated variables, pathogens, and clinical outcomes.

Results

We identified 178 CLABSIs. The CLABSI incidence (cases per 1,000 line days) tripled in October 2020 as COVID-19 admissions increased. CLABSIs in 2020 were more frequently caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci and more frequently occurred in the intensive care units 7+ days after central line insertion. The CLABSI incidence normalized in early 2021 and did not increase during subsequent COVID-19 surges. Throughout 2019 to 2022, about half of the nontunneled central venous catheters involved in CLABSI were placed emergently. One-quarter of CLABSIs involved multiple central lines. Chlorhexidine skin treatment adherence was limited by patient refusal.

Conclusions

The increase in CLABSIs in late 2020 during a surge in COVID-19 admissions was likely related to central line maintenance but has resolved. Characterizing CLABSI cases can provide insight into adherence to guideline-recommended prevention practices and identify areas for improvement at individual institutions.

Multivariable Logistic Regression Output for CLABSI

Abbreviations: CLABSI, central line–associated bloodstream infection; CLD, central line–day; CVC, central venous catheter; NA, not applicable; NHSN, National Healthcare Safety Network.

For the CVC survival analysis, 50 254 hospitalizations were divided into 57 642 CVC episodes associated with 526 CLABSIs. There were a total of 31 126 low-risk single CVC episodes, including 205 associated with CLABSIs, and 11 906 high-risk single CVC episodes, including 107 associated with CLABSIs. Among 14 610 concurrent CVC episodes, 4930 concurrent CVCs included 2 low-risk CVCs, including 72 associated with CLABSIs; 7937 concurrent CVCs with 1 low-risk and 1 high-risk CVC, including 120 associated with CLABSIs; and 1743 concurrent CVCs with 2 high-risk CVCs, including 22 associated with CLABSIs. Significant risk factors for CLABSI included male sex (HR for women, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69–0.98]; p = 0.03), receipt of chemotherapy (HR, 2.41 [95% CI, 1.62–3.58]; P < .001), and receipt of TPN (HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.05–1.61]; p = 0.03). Admittance to hospital A was associated with lower risk of CLABSI (HR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.34–0.70]; P < .001). Adjusting for these factors and compared with having a single low-risk CVC, the daily excess risk of CLABSI associated with concurrent CVC use was approximately 80%, regardless of CVC type (2 low-risk CVCs: HR, 1.78 [95% CI, 1.35–2.34]; P < .001; 1 low-risk and 1 high-risk CVC: HR, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.42–2.28]; P < .001; 2 high-risk CVCs: HR, 1.78 [95% CI, 1.14–2.77]; p = 0.01). The HR for a single high-risk CVC was 1.44 (95% CI, 1.13–1.84; p = 0.003). In this model, the hazard of developing CLABSI associated with a concurrent CVC episode was significantly higher than among single CVC episodes, regardless of CVC risk type, starting as soon as day 7 of the concurrent CVC insertion (Figure).

Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) prevention implementation — engage, educate, execute — emphasizes engaging leadership and structured training and competency. It is important to engage both frontline and senior leadership champions and institutionalize the work with stakeholder support to facilitate successful, long-lasting results; healthcare personnel (HCP), patients, and caregivers involved in care of a central venous catheter (CVC) should be trained and competent for appropriate indications prior to insertion, use of full barrier precautions at insertion, and daily evaluation of device necessity; a standardized competency assessment checklist should be used to assess and document competency for CVC insertion and related care, and education of the patient and/or family is required for all CVC care procedures, especially when transfer to an alternative setting is planned.

### Characterizing the relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and assessing the impact of a nursing-focused CLABSI reduction intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114dsM3P]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this patient-level analysis of patients with CLABSI with and without COVID-19, we observed a significantly higher CLABSI rate in patients with COVID-19, particularly in the ICU. Compared to historical controls, the CLABSI rate did not increase in non–COVID-19 patients, which suggests that the increase in CLABSI risk is likely related to factors associated with their COVID-19 diagnosis. A focused, hospital-wide quality improvement initiative significantly reduced CLABSI rates in non–COVID-19 patients, but the impact on CLABSI rates in COVID-19 patients was minimal. Additionally, COVID-19 CLABSI rates appeared to increase during times of high COVID-19 census both before and after the intervention.

Our analysis showed patient-level differences in the COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 CLABSIs that may partially explain this trend. Compared to the non–COVID-19 CLABSI cohort, COVID-19 CLABSI patients had more comorbidities and markers of critical illness: they were older, were more likely to be diabetic, were more likely to have any ICU stay, were more likely to use an arterial line use, and were far more likely to be in the ICU at the time of CLABSI.

To isolate the effect of critical illness, we performed the secondary analysis of pandemic period COVID-19 versus non–COVID-19 ICU CLABSIs, and surprisingly, we detected an even higher rate of COVID-19 CLABSI and a higher relative risk. Additionally, when comparing the patient-level characteristics between the ICU CLABSI cohorts, most of the differences observed in the primary analysis resolved, including line type, organism distribution, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Quite clearly, critical illness and ICU status alone do not fully explain the high COVID-19 ICU CLABSI rate.

Adjunct dressings and antisepsis considerations — evidence summaries for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) prevention note uncertainty and research needs. A meta-analysis reported an association between CLABSI and transparent dressing use; however, the source studies for the meta-analysis reporting this association were of low quality. Widespread use of chlorhexidine-based products may promote reduced chlorhexidine susceptibility; however, testing for chlorhexidine susceptibility is not standardized, and the clinical impact of reduced chlorhexidine susceptibility is unknown. The impact of sutureless securement devices in reducing CLABSI is unknown. One randomized study suggests that antimicrobial-impregnated umbilical catheters appear to be safe and effective in NICU patients. When antiseptic-containing caps are being used, it is unknown whether their application and removal provides the same benefit as manual disinfection, and future research is needed to determine if such caps will obviate the need for manual disinfection before accessing a catheter.

### The impact of infection control cost reimbursement policy on central line-associated bloodstream infections [^115RjWHY]. American Journal of Infection Control (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In September 2016, the Korean National Health Insurance Service began reimbursing infection control (IC) costs on the condition that a certain number of doctors and full-time nurses for IC be allocated to supported hospitals. We analyzed the impact of the IC cost reimbursement policy on central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).

Methods

A before-and-after study that analyzed the CLABSI rate trends between preintervention (January 2016 to February 2017) and intervention (March to December 2017) periods using autoregression time series analysis was performed in intensive care units (ICUs) at a 750-bed, secondary care hospital in Daegu, Republic of Korea. The enhanced IC team visited ICUs daily, monitored the implementation of CLABSI prevention bundles, and educated all personnel involved in catheter insertion and maintenance from March 2017.

Results

Autoregressive analysis revealed that the CLABSI rates per month in the preintervention and intervention periods were -0.256 (95% confidence interval, -0.613 to 0.101; p = 0.15) and -0.602 (95% confidence interval, -0.972 to -0.232; p = 0.008), respectively. The rates of compliance with maximal barrier precautions significantly improved from the preintervention (36.2%) to the intervention (77.9%) period (χ² test, P < .001).

Conclusions

The IC cost reimbursement policy accelerated the decline in CLABSI rates significantly in monitored ICUs. A nationwide study to evaluate the effectiveness of the IC cost reimbursement policy for various health care-associated infections is warranted.

### Comparison of rates of central line-associated bloodstream infections in patients with 1 vs 2 central venous catheters [^112zMZsQ]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Study Population, Data Source, and Design

Using a cohort design, we retrospectively analyzed inpatients admitted from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017, to any of 4 geographically separated acute care hospitals, varying in size from 110 to 580 beds, in Emory Healthcare (Atlanta, Georgia). The Emory Healthcare institutional review board approved the study under expedited review with a waiver of consent under 45 CFR.46.110 and 21 CFR 56.110 because it poses minimal risk and fits the regulatory category F[5] as set forth in the Federal Register. This study is reported following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Using the Emory Healthcare clinical data warehouse, we obtained CVC insertion and removal data and patient encounter data. These data were generated using electronic barcode tracking of insertion details and have been validated. Patients eligible for inclusion were adults aged 18 years or older admitted to inpatient care who had at least 1 CVC inserted for at least 2 days, with a length of stay of 50 days or fewer (95th percentile of patients), and who had 5 or fewer unique CVC insertions (eliminating outliers) during hospitalization. Emory Healthcare surveillance data for CLABSI reported to NHSN were linked to patient encounters. These CLABSI excluded infections categorized as mucosal barrier injury CLABSIs, as defined by NHSN. Encounter data included demographic characteristics and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)discharge codes (allowing calculation of Charlson Comorbidity Index scores), orders for total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and chemotherapy.

### Background information: terminology and estimates of risk… [^117VGvjy]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance Background Information: Terminology and Estimates of Risk from the Guidelines for the Prevention of Intravascular Catheter-Related Infections.
- the type of vessel it occupies;
- its intended life span;
- its site of insertion;.
- its pathway from skin to vessel;
- its physical length; or
- some special characteristic of the catheter. To accurately define a specific type of catheter, all of these aspects should be described.

Likewise the terms used to describe intravascular catheter-related infections can also be confusing because catheter-related bloodstream infection and central line–associated bloodstream infection are often used interchangeably even though the meanings differ. CRBSI is a clinical definition, used when diagnosing and treating patients, that requires specific laboratory testing that more thoroughly identifies the catheter as the source of the BSI. It is not typically used for surveillance purposes. It is often problematic to precisely establish if a BSI is a CRBSI due to the clinical needs of the patient, limited availability of microbiologic methods, and procedural compliance by direct care personnel. Simpler definitions are often used for surveillance purposes.

For example, CLABSI is a term used by CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network. A CLABSI is a primary BSI in a patient that had a central line within the 48-hour period before the development of the BSI and is not bloodstream related to an infection at another site. However, since some BSIs are secondary to other sources other than the central line that may not be easily recognized, the CLABSI surveillance definition may overestimate the true incidence of CRBSI.

### Vital signs: central line – associated blood stream infections-United States, 2001, 2008, and 2009… [^116ThPHW]. CDC (2011). Low credibility.

Abstract Background: Health-care — associated infections affect 5% of patients hospitalized in the United States each year. Central line — associated blood stream infections are important and deadly HAIs, with reported mortality of 12% — 25%. This report provides national estimates of the number of CLABSIs among patients in intensive-care units, inpatient wards, and outpatient hemodialysis facilities in 2008 and 2009 and compares ICU estimates with 2001 data. In 2009, an estimated 23, 000 CLABSIs occurred among patients in inpatient wards and, in 2008, an estimated 37, 000 CLABSIs occurred among patients receiving outpatient hemodialysis. Conclusions: In 2009 alone, an estimated 25, 000 fewer CLABSIs occurred in U. S. ICUs than in 2001, a 58% reduction. This represents up to 6, 000 lives saved and $414 million in potential excess health-care costs in 2009 and approximately $1. 8 billion in cumulative excess health-care costs since
2001.

A substantial number of CLABSIs continue to occur, especially in outpatient hemodialysis centers and inpatient wards. By applying this to ICU central line-days, CDC estimated that approximately 43, 000 CLABSIs occurred in U. S. ICUs in 2001. In 2009, the pooled mean ICU central-line utilization ratio was
0. 50, yielding an estimated 11. 0 million central line-days. 14). Given the reported mortality from CLABSIs, these reductions represent an estimated 3, 000–6, 000 lives saved and estimated excess health-care costs of $414 million in ICUs in 2009 alone. Assuming that each CLABSI carries excess health-care costs of $16, 550 and mortality of up to 25%, and that CLABSI reductions were steady during 2001–2009, the cumulative excess health-care costs of all CLABSIs prevented in ICUs could approach $1. 8 billion, and the number of lives saved could be as high as 27,
000.

The substantial number of estimated CLABSIs among hemodialysis patients emphasizes another important prevention priority because these infections are a major cause of hospital admissions and mortality (.
