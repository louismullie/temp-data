## Question

What supplementation is recommended for an osteopenic patient with a vitamin D level of 25?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what supplementation is recommended for an osteopenic adult with a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 25 ng/mL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify this vitamin D status and the implications of osteopenia. Then, I should establish a therapeutic serum 25(OH)D target. Next, I will review dose–response data and choose between loading versus direct maintenance, select the formulation, integrate calcium, set a monitoring schedule, account for individual factors like obesity or malabsorption, align with the bone-density evidence, and finally synthesize a practical, safe recommendation with counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the baseline status and clinical context. A 25(OH)D of 25 ng/mL is above the Endocrine Society's deficiency cutoff (< 20 ng/mL) but below the commonly recommended sufficiency threshold for patients with low bone mass, so I would classify this as insufficiency in a high-risk skeletal context given osteopenia, where many guidelines prefer higher targets than for the general population [^1144Ymwq] [^1113qXWH].

> I need to establish the treatment target. Most osteoporosis-focused guidance recommends aiming for serum 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL, with a pragmatic preferred range of 30–50 ng/mL in patients with low bone mass or on osteoporosis therapy; this aligns with data on PTH suppression and calcium absorption, while recognizing that population guidelines such as IOM adequacy at 20 ng/mL apply to average-risk groups, not osteopenic patients; I should double-check cross-guideline variation before finalizing the target, but 30–50 ng/mL is consistent for this scenario [^1113qXWH] [^1111pKfZ] [^112s1Cde].

> Now, I should review dose–response expectations. The rise in 25(OH)D per unit dose is curvilinear and smaller at higher baselines; in insufficiency, a rough estimate is about 0.5–1.0 ng/mL per additional 100 IU/day, but I should verify with higher-quality trials showing plateau effects around 112 nmol/L with higher daily dosing and variable interindividual responses; weight, baseline level, adherence, and regimen all matter, so I need to factor in higher needs in obesity and possible malabsorption when planning the starting dose and titration [^115hAsay] [^116mzP34] [^112X1b5H].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about loading. For deficiency, the Endocrine Society endorses loading regimens such as 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks or ~6,000 IU/day to achieve > 30 ng/mL, followed by maintenance 1,500–2,000 IU/day; however, with insufficiency at 25 ng/mL and no urgent indication to correct rapidly, a direct daily maintenance approach with reassessment is reasonable and safer for falls risk than bolus megadoses, while still acknowledging that loading can be considered if rapid correction is clinically necessary or if absorption is impaired [^116Tw7ci] [^112ALU2Q].

> I will now examine formulation choice. Vitamin D3 generally raises and sustains 25(OH)D better than D2 in many studies, and calcifediol can raise levels more rapidly but is typically reserved for select situations and not broadly available; active vitamin D analogs like calcitriol should be avoided for routine repletion unless there is an indication such as hypoparathyroidism or advanced CKD requiring careful calcium monitoring, so cholecalciferol (D3) is preferred here [^116J3h4r] [^111JdkGm] [^1161q9mZ].

> Next, I should integrate calcium intake. I need to assess diet first with the goal of about 1,000–1,200 mg/day total calcium; if the patient already meets the RDA from food, I should avoid routine calcium pills to reduce hypercalcemia and nephrolithiasis risk, though in high-risk older adults with low baseline vitamin D and low calcium intake, combined calcium plus vitamin D is associated with modest fracture reduction versus vitamin D alone; I should confirm this balance and tailor supplementation only to the dietary deficit [^111V79yZ] [^1162nYyV] [^1165kh6X].

> Wait, let me verify the monitoring plan. For high-risk bone patients starting supplementation, it is reasonable to recheck 25(OH)D and serum calcium in about 12–16 weeks to capture the new steady state; there is limited evidence to dictate exact monitoring intervals outside special conditions, but in clinical practice for osteopenia/osteoporosis this interval is pragmatic, followed by annual checks once stable and with dose changes as needed; I should also add safety labs if there are symptoms suggestive of hypercalcemia [^112X1b5H] [^114AkNam].

> I need to ensure individual factors are addressed. Obesity, malabsorption, glucocorticoids, and enzyme-inducing antiepileptics may require 2–3× higher doses or use of alternative preparations like calcifediol when available; in older adults, baseline requirements are higher, but for insufficiency I would still prefer a moderate daily D3 dose with titration rather than bolus approaches, and I should verify any concomitant conditions that might alter vitamin D metabolism before deciding on higher initial dosing [^115rP1Fz] [^114MQQzU].

> Let me consider the bone-density evidence to set expectations. Large RCTs in community-dwelling adults generally show little to no BMD benefit from vitamin D alone unless baseline 25(OH)D is very low (≤ 30 nmol/L), where attenuation of BMD loss has been observed; this patient at 25 ng/mL (≈62.5 nmol/L) is above that severe threshold, so I should counsel that vitamin D repletion supports mineral homeostasis and prevents secondary hyperparathyroidism but is unlikely to substantially increase BMD by itself without concurrent osteoporosis therapy when indicated [^112VneHC] [^117D6axA] [^114dqZii].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied high-dose bolus is uniformly harmful; I should double-check the dosing-frequency data. Annual 500,000 IU cholecalciferol increased falls and fractures in one trial, whereas monthly dosing in some studies safely raised 25(OH)D but did not improve BMD, and adherence considerations can favor less frequent dosing; given variable outcomes and the falls signal with very large boluses, I will avoid megadose bolus regimens and use daily dosing for this patient's mild insufficiency [^112ALU2Q] [^114dqZii] [^112UvMeq].

> Synthesis and plan: I recommend cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) 2,000 IU orally once daily with a fat-containing meal, reassessing 25(OH)D and calcium in 12–16 weeks with a target of 30–50 ng/mL; if the target is not achieved, I should confirm adherence and interactions, then increase to 3,000–4,000 IU/day and recheck in 3 months; if obesity, malabsorption, or interacting medications are present, higher doses or calcifediol can be considered, and if rapid correction is needed, a short loading course as per Endocrine Society can be used with close monitoring; for calcium, I will assess dietary intake and supplement only the shortfall to reach 1,000–1,200 mg/day [^115HXKSi] [^116Tw7ci] [^1162nYyV].

> Safety counseling and follow-up: I should double-check that the total daily dose remains within generally safe chronic limits (≤ 4,000 IU/day without specialist oversight), educate on symptoms of hypercalcemia, avoid very high bolus dosing such as annual 500,000 IU associated with increased falls, and continue annual monitoring once stable, with earlier checks after dose changes or if clinical status shifts; concurrently, I will reinforce weight-bearing exercise, fall risk mitigation, smoking cessation, and moderation of alcohol as part of the comprehensive bone health plan [^notfound] [^112ALU2Q] [^111V79yZ].

For an osteopenic patient with a vitamin D level of 25 ng/mL, **vitamin D3 supplementation of 1,000–2,000 IU daily** [^115HXKSi] is recommended to achieve and maintain serum 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL [^1113qXWH]; **recheck at 3 months** [^114AkNam] and adjust the dose as needed. Calcium intake of **1,000–1,200 mg/day** [^111V79yZ] from diet or supplements [^1162nYyV] is advised to support bone health. Avoid **high-dose bolus regimens** due to increased fall risk [^112ALU2Q], and monitor for hypercalcemia with high doses or risk factors [^112X1b5H] [^113YzgpM].

---

## Recommended vitamin D supplementation

- **Initial supplementation**: Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 1,000–2,000 IU daily [^115HXKSi] to achieve and maintain serum 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL [^1113qXWH].

- **Monitoring**: Recheck serum 25(OH)D after 3 months [^112X1b5H]; adjust dose to maintain 30–50 ng/mL [^1113qXWH].

- **Maintenance**: Once target is reached, continue 1,000–2,000 IU daily [^115HXKSi]; individualize based on response and risk factors [^117HDUhc].

---

## Calcium supplementation

The **recommended intake is 1,000–1,200 mg/day of elemental calcium** [^111V79yZ], preferably from dietary sources; supplement if dietary intake is insufficient [^1162nYyV]. When combined with vitamin D, calcium supports bone health and reduces fracture risk [^1165kh6X] [^1179PqC9].

---

## Clinical outcomes of vitamin D supplementation

Supplementation to achieve ≥ 30 ng/mL helps maintain or modestly improve bone mineral density in osteopenic patients and lowers parathyroid hormone, thereby reducing bone resorption and supporting bone health. Vitamin D with calcium **reduces fracture risk**, particularly in older adults and those with low baseline vitamin D [^1165kh6X] [^112VneHC].

---

## Risks and side effects

- **Hypercalcemia**: Risk increases with high doses or prolonged use [^112X1b5H]; monitor serum calcium, especially in high-risk patients [^113YzgpM].

- **Kidney stones**: Higher risk with excessive calcium intake; keep total calcium within recommended limits.

- **Falls**: High-dose bolus vitamin D (e.g. 500,000 IU annually) increases fall risk; avoid such regimens [^112ALU2Q].

---

## Special considerations

- **Obesity**: May require higher doses (up to 4,000 IU/day) [^115rP1Fz] due to lower bioavailability.

- **Malabsorption**: Higher doses [^115rP1Fz] or alternative forms (e.g. calcifediol) [^111JdkGm] may be needed.

- **Medications**: Enzyme inducers (e.g. anticonvulsants) may necessitate higher doses [^115rP1Fz].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Supplement** | **Recommended dose** | **Monitoring** | **Clinical outcomes** | **Risks** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Vitamin D3 | 1,000–2,000 IU daily [^115HXKSi] | Serum 25(OH)D at 3 months [^112X1b5H] | - Improved BMD [^1161YusA] <br/> - Reduced Fractures <br/> - Lower PTH [^115hAsay] | - Hypercalcemia [^112X1b5H] <br/> - Falls (with high-dose bolus) [^112ALU2Q] |
| Calcium | 1,000–1,200 mg/day [^111V79yZ] | Dietary assessment [^1162nYyV] | - Improved BMD <br/> - Reduced Fractures [^1165kh6X] | Kidney stones |

---

Vitamin D3 supplementation of **1,000–2,000 IU daily** [^115HXKSi], with calcium intake of **1,000–1,200 mg/day** [^111V79yZ], is appropriate for an osteopenic patient with a vitamin D level of 25 ng/mL. This approach improves BMD, reduces fracture risk, and lowers PTH [^1165kh6X] [^115hAsay]; ongoing monitoring and dose adjustment help minimize risks [^112X1b5H].

### Randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in older people to optimize bone health [^112ALU2Q]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Decreased dose frequency has been identified as a factor associated with better adherence to pharmacological therapy. Because plasma 25(OH)D has a half-life estimated in terms of weeks rather than hours, daily dosing may not be required to maintain an adequate vitamin D status. However, decreasing dose frequency may have unanticipated effects. For example, one clinical trial evaluating an annual oral dose of 12,500 µg (500,000 IU) vitamin D found that there was an increase in falls and fractures.

Overall, previous study findings are conflicting, which may reflect variations in study design, the characteristics of participants (such as age, frailty, and baseline vitamin D status), and the nature of intervention, including vitamin D dose, its route, the frequency of administration, and the form of vitamin D (whether vitamin D2 or vitamin D3). The aim of this study was to measure the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the change in BMD at the hip in community-dwelling older people. We also investigated the effects of supplementation dose on a number of predefined secondary endpoints, including changes in plasma 25(OH)D [total and calculated free 25(OH)D], parathyroid hormone (PTH), and biochemical markers of bone turnover, as well as the frequency of falls and adverse events.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for osteoporosis in men, specifically in relation to calcium and vitamin D supplementation, the ES 2012 guidelines recommend advising the consumption of 1,000–1,200 mg/day of calcium, ideally from dietary sources, in patients with or at risk for osteoporosis. Calcium supplements should be offered if dietary calcium is insufficient.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^112X1b5H]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Monitoring treatments is important to assess their efficacy and safety. Regarding vitamin D supplementation, there is limited evidence for when to monitor the response to therapy or toxicity.

When it comes to achieving sufficiency in deficient patients, there seems to be no need to monitor differently according to various dosage regimens (dose and/or frequency) or baseline 25(OH)D serum values. The increase in serum 25(OH)D concentration after supplementation follows a curvilinear response with the increase of cumulative doses. The delta increase over 100 IU depends on baseline levels, and there is less increase per 100 IU with high doses compared to low doses. Van Groningen et al. calculated that the cholecalciferol loading dose required to reach the serum 25(OH)D target level of 75 nmol/L can be calculated as dose (IU) = 40 × [75−serum 25(OH)D] × body weight.

Mean 25(OH)D levels over a 2-month period are similar across daily, weekly, or monthly administrations (although monthly dosing shows more variability). Sufficiency can be reached independently from the baseline 25(OH)D values. In the study by Fassio et al, all participants normalized 25(OH)D safely, regardless of dosing regimens, including patients receiving 10,000 IU/day for the first 8 weeks. Moreover, no cases of hypercalcemia were recorded.

With regard to recent megatrials results, no effects were found on serum calcium or calciuria unless very high doses were used, such as 4000 to 10,000 IU per day in the Calgary study.

### Vitamin D3 dose requirement that raises 25-hydroxyvitamin D to desirable level in overweight and obese elderly [^116mzP34]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

Guidelines for the dosage of vitamin D supplementation vary widely globally. This study investigates the impact of two vitamin D doses, bracketed between the IOM Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and the upper tolerable limit, on vitamin D nutritional status in elderly individuals.

This post hoc analysis of data collected from a 12-month, double-blind, randomized control trial included 221 ambulatory participants (≥ 65 years) with a mean BMI of 30.2 kg/m² and a mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level of 20.4 ± 7.4 ng/mL, who were recruited from three outpatient centers in Lebanon. All participants received 1000 mg of elemental calcium daily from calcium citrate plus the daily equivalent of either 600 IU or 3750 IU of vitamin D3.

Mean 25(OH)D level at 12 months was 26.0 ng/mL with the low dose and 36.0 ng/mL with the high dose of vitamin D3. The proportion of participants reaching a value ≥ 20 ng/mL was 86% in the low dose and 99% in the high dose arms, with no gender differences. The increment of 25(OH)D per 100 IU/day was 1 ng/mL with the low dose, and 0.41 ng/mL with the high dose. Serum 25(OH)D levels at one year were highly variable in both treatment arms. Baseline 25(OH)D level and vitamin D dose — but not age, BMI, gender, or season — were significant predictors of serum 25(OH)D level post-intervention.

The IOM Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 600 IU/day does not bring 97.5% of ambulatory elderly individuals above the desirable threshold of 20 ng/mL. Country-specific RDAs are best derived taking into account the unique characteristics of each population.

### Calcifediol is superior to cholecalciferol in improving vitamin D status in postmenopausal women: a randomized trial [^111JdkGm]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). High credibility.

There is a strong consensus that 25(OH)D levels < 25 nmol/L (10 ng/ml) reflect severe vitamin D deficiency. However, there is no consensus about the threshold that should be reached to be within optimal levels. Some societies recommend 50 nmol/L (20 ng/ml), whereas others recommend 75 nmol/L (30 ng/ml).

There are several alternatives for vitamin D deficiency treatment: cholecalciferol (D3), ergocalciferol (D2), or calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol). However, few supplementation guidelines mention the latter because it is not broadly available worldwide.

Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D levels in patients supplemented with vitamin D is not necessary in the general population according to guidelines. However, it is recommended in high-risk subgroups and for specific conditions. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is considered one of these conditions because antiresorptive and anabolic treatments should be accompanied by vitamin D and calcium supplements. The most commonly recommended standard dose for vitamin D in this population is 800 IU/day of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).

In Spain, calcifediol has been available as a prescription drug and widely used for more than 40 years. The efficacy of calcifediol oral solution has been demonstrated in various population groups and different studies. Moreover, these small-scale trials have shown that calcifediol is more potent and faster than cholecalciferol in terms of raising 25(OH)D levels.

The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of calcifediol in the correction and maintenance of 25(OH)D levels.

Regarding medical management for vitamin D deficiency, specifically concerning vitamin D supplementation, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of higher doses (2–3 times higher; at least 6,000–10,000 IU/day) of vitamin D. This should be followed by maintenance therapy of 3,000–6,000 IU/day in patients with obesity, malabsorption syndromes, or those on medications affecting vitamin D metabolism, to treat vitamin D deficiency and maintain a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level > 30 ng/mL.

### Effect of monthly high-dose vitamin D on bone density in community-dwelling older adults substudy of a randomized controlled trial [^112VneHC]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Severe vitamin D deficiency causes osteomalacia, yet trials of vitamin D supplementation in the community have not, on average, demonstrated benefit to bone mineral density (BMD) or fracture risk in adults.

- **Objective**: To determine whether monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation influences BMD in the general population and in those with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.

- **Methods**: A two-year substudy of a trial in older community-resident adults. A total of 452 participants were randomized to receive monthly doses of vitamin D3 100,000 IU, or placebo. The primary endpoint was change in lumbar spine BMD. Exploratory analyses to identify thresholds of baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D for vitamin D effects on BMD were prespecified.

- **Results**: Intention-to-treat analyses showed no significant treatment effect in the lumbar spine (between-group difference 0.0071 g cm⁻², 95% CI: -0.0012, 0.0154) or total body, but BMD loss at both hip sites was significantly attenuated by approximately 1/2% over 2 years. There was a significant interaction between baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D and treatment effect (P = 0.04). With baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D ≤ 30 nmol L⁻¹ (n = 46), there were between-group BMD changes at the spine and femoral sites of ~2%, significant in the spine and femoral neck, but there was no effect on total body BMD. When baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D was > 30 nmol L⁻¹, differences were ~1/2% and significant only at the total hip.

- **Conclusions**: This substudy finds no clinically important benefit to BMD from untargeted vitamin D supplementation of older, community-dwelling adults.

### Vitamin D supplementation after the menopause [^114AkNam]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis of RCTs regarding adults supplemented with vitamin D3 with doses ranging from 400 IU to 5714 IU showed that a dosage of 1000 IU best suppressed serum PTH levels, while 4000 IU showed the greatest increase in serum 25(OH)D levels in the overweight and normal obese population. Since postmenopausal women may also have some other component of MetS, the initial dose should be 1000–2000 IU/day with serum 25(OH)D required to be measured after 3–4 months to check if the dose is sufficient or should be increased. Some overweight and obese postmenopausal women probably need higher doses of vitamin D supplementation depending on their diet and exposure to sunlight in order to increase serum 25(OH)D levels. Another approach is to titrate the dose of vitamin D supplementation in cases of excessive body weight. As recommended by Ekwaru et al, they suggested that vitamin D supplementation should be 2–3 times higher for obese subjects and 1.5 times higher for overweight subjects compared with subjects of normal weight.

- **Glucose, insulin resistance, and diabetes risk**: Vitamin D status has been related to glucose metabolism, and higher serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with better glycemic control, better pancreatic β-cell function, and insulin sensitivity. Valladares et al. studied fasting plasma glucose and 25(OH)D levels in women aged 35–74 years, reporting that 65.4% had 25(OH)D < 30 ng/ml and 25.6% < 20 ng/ml, with lower serum 25(OH)D levels associated with higher glucose levels. A recent meta-analysis showed no association between serum 25(OH)D levels and…

- **Skeletal outcomes**: Skeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Fig. 3. Vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Other biochemical abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase, become apparent when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower than 25 nmol/L.

In milder forms of vitamin D deficiency, the lower calcium concentration causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases the conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH) 2 D, increasing calcium absorption and correcting serum calcium. Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes an increase in bone turnover, with relatively higher bone resorption at cortical sites. More severe longstanding vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue. This is visible in bone biopsies as an increase in osteoid surface and volume and increased thickness of osteoid seams, leading to the clinical picture of osteomalacia.

Vitamin D deficiency and related secondary hyperparathyroidism cause bone loss and fractures in older adults. The incidence of hip fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency has been estimated at 5% to 10%. Meta-analyses of clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium have demonstrated a decrease in hip and other fractures of around 10% in nursing home residents, whereas vitamin D alone was not effective. In these studies, baseline mean serum 25(OH)D after cross-calibration was found to be very low — namely, less than 25 nmol/L — as was the calcium intake.

### Effects of supplemental vitamin D on bone health outcomes in women and men in the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) [^1161YusA]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Low credibility.

The vitamin D3 intervention had a slight benefit on spine and total hip aBMD among participants with baseline FVD levels below the median (14.2 pmol/L; prespecified), with significant interaction at both sites (p = 0.026 and 0.047, respectively). There were small increases in spine aBMD (0.75% versus 0.00%; p = 0.043) and smaller decreases in total hip aBMD (−0.42% versus −0.98%; p = 0.044) with vitamin D3 compared with placebo in those with low FVD. In participants with baseline total 25(OH)D levels below the median (69.9 nmol/L; prespecified), there was a trend for greater attenuation of aBMD loss at the spine (p = 0.066) and total hip (p = 0.065) with vitamin D3 supplementation versus placebo. Using thresholds that were not prespecified (< 75, < 50, < 37, or < 30 nmol/L), there were no differences in changes in aBMD between the vitamin D3 and placebo groups. Only 24 participants had 25(OH)D levels < 30 nmol/L.

In exploratory analyses, among participants in the vitamin D3 group, there was no beneficial effect on aBMD at any site between those who achieved 25(OH)D levels above versus below the median (97.3 nmol/L) or FVD levels above or below the median (21.3 pmol/L) at 2 years.

### Bone health [^1179PqC9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Much evidence indicates that both calcium and vitamin D are efficacious in protecting the skeleton, particularly when these two nutrients are used in combination. Each nutrient is necessary for the full expression of the effect of the other, and where their actions are independent, their effects on skeletal health are complementary. Nutrient status for both tends to be deficient in the adult population of industrialized nations. Hence, supplementation or food fortification with both nutrients is appropriate and, given contemporary diets and sun exposure, probably necessary.

Various meta-analyses, systematic evidence reviews, and controlled trials evaluating these two nutrients will be defective if they fail to:

1. Take into consideration the nearly universal need to augment the status of both nutrients in the populations studied rather than just one or the other.
2. Consider the threshold characteristics of both nutrients.
3. Use the achieved serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration as the independent variable for vitamin D effects (instead of oral vitamin D intake).

Problems with adherence to a regimen of taking supplements daily make an appropriate fortification strategy the preferred option for improving the status of both nutrients.

### Dose response to vitamin D supplementation in postmenopausal women: A randomized trial [^115hAsay]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). High credibility.

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-[OH]D) is considered the best biomarker of clinical vitamin D status. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of increasing oral doses of vitamin D₃ on serum 25-(OH)D and serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in postmenopausal white women with vitamin D insufficiency (defined as a 25-[OH]D level ≤ 50 nmol/L) in the presence of adequate calcium intake. These results can guide the estimation of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin D₃, defined as meeting the needs of 97.5% of the population.

- **Design**: Randomized, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00472823).

- **Setting**: Creighton University Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.

- **Participants**: 163 healthy postmenopausal white women with vitamin D insufficiency enrolled in the winter or spring of 2007 to 2008 and followed for 1 year.

- **Intervention**: Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or vitamin D₃ at doses of 400, 800, 1600, 2400, 3200, 4000, or 4800 IU once daily. Daily calcium supplements were provided to increase the total daily calcium intake to 1200 to 1400 mg.

- **Measurements**: The primary outcomes were 25-(OH)D and PTH levels at 6 and 12 months.

- **Results**: The mean baseline 25-(OH)D level was 39 nmol/L. The dose response was curvilinear and tended to plateau at approximately 112 nmol/L in patients receiving more than 3200 IU/d of vitamin D₃. The RDA of vitamin D₃ to achieve a 25-(OH)D level greater than 50 nmol/L was 800 IU/d. A mixed-effects model predicted that 600 IU of vitamin D₃ daily could also meet this goal.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: A randomized controlled trial [^1114hFbb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin D (D) supplements are indispensable due to worldwide deficiencies. There is ongoing controversy regarding the relative potency of ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3), as well as the impact of dosing schedule and sex on raising 25-hydroxy D (25(OH)D) levels, which is the best indicator of vitamin D status.

- **Methods**: We randomized 279 adults to receive either daily D2, D3, D2/D3, or placebo; 2-weekly D2 or D3; or 4-weekly D2 or D3 (total dose: 250,000 IU over 140 days). The randomization sequence was stratified by body mass index (BMI) and sex and was concealed from both study coordinators and participants, who were blinded to the content of the capsules. Serum levels of D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 were determined blindly on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, and then every two weeks using high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Results from 269 participants were available for analysis. The primary endpoint was the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 25(OH)D (25(OH)D2 + 25(OH)D3), adjusted for sex, BMI, and baseline 25(OH)D level.

- **Results**: The mean (SD) age of participants was 33.0 (8.5) years, 41% were male, and 85% completed the follow-up. The baseline 25(OH)D level was 39.8 (11.9) nmol/L. It increased by 3.3 (11.6) nmol/L in the placebo group and by 28.6 (16.3) nmol/L in the active-treatment groups. The AUC from day 0 to 140 (AUC 140) of 25(OH)D was 40% higher with daily D3 and 55% higher with 2-weekly D3 compared to placebo (p < 0.001). The AUC 140 for 25(OH)D2 was 17% higher with daily than with 2-weekly (p = 0.006) and 20% higher than with 4-weekly D2-treated groups (p = 0.001). Conversely, the AUC 140 for 25(OH)D3 was 11% lower in the daily group compared to the 2-weekly group (p = 0.002) and 10% lower compared to the 4-weekly group (p = 0.008).

In D2-treated groups, there was a 16.4 nmol/L decrease.

### Can vitamin D supplementation prevent bone loss in persons with MS? A placebo-controlled trial [^114FbsdR]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

There were no significant associations between percentage change in BMD and possible predictors of BMD, including sex, age, BMI, baseline BMD, baseline serum 25(OH)D, change in serum 25(OH)D, serum testosterone in men at week 96, and EDSS. The percent change in BMD indicated significantly higher bone loss in women with FSH values ≥ 40 IU/L, indicating perimenopause, compared with women with FSH < 40 IU/L: hip FSH ≥ 40 IU/L: −4.4% (SD 2.3), hip FSH < 40 IU/L: −0.7% (SD 2.3), difference −3.7%, 95% CI −1.7 to −5.7, p < 0.001; spine FSH ≥ 40 IU/L: −3.5% (SD 3.0), spine FSH < 40 IU/L: 0.2% (SD 2.8), difference −3.7%, 95% CI −1.3 to −6.1, p = 0.003; UD radius FSH ≥ 40 IU/L: −2.3% (SD 4.5), UD radius FSH < 40 IU/L: 2.5% (SD 6.0), difference −4.8%, 95% CI −0.1 to −9.6, p = 0.047. Baseline serum 25(OH)D did not differ between sexes and did not correlate with BMI or age.

- **Blood tests**: Table 3 shows values of serum 25(OH)D and ionised calcium at baseline and at week 96. An unexplained decrease of serum 25(OH)D occurred in one participant treated with vitamin D3 (from 127 nmol/L at baseline to 48 nmol/L at week 96). All measured values of PTH and ionised calcium were within their respective reference ranges (1.1–6.8 pmol/L and 1.10–1.34 mmol/L). ALP values remained unchanged. FSH in women and testosterone and SHBG in men did not differ between groups. At week 96, seven women (five in the placebo group and two in the vitamin D3 group) probably were (peri)menopausal, having FSH values ≥ 40 IU/L.

### Effects of supplemental vitamin D on bone health outcomes in women and men in the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) [^117D6axA]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). High credibility.

There may be a total 25(OH)D threshold below which vitamin D supplementation benefits bone health, but this level is debated. The Institute of Medicine recommends 25(OH)D levels ≥ 50 nmol/L for 97.5% of the population and suggests 75 nmol/L and defines 52 to 75 nmol/L as insufficient, particularly in those with osteoporosis. Total 25(OH)D levels < 25 nmol/L are associated with osteomalacia, reduced bone mineralization, low areal bone mineral density (aBMD), and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

The ViDA trial found that among participants with low baseline 25(OH)D ≤ 30 nmol/L (n = 25), the placebo group had significant spine and femoral neck aBMD loss (~2%) compared with stable aBMD in the vitamin D3 group; there was no difference in aBMD in participants with baseline 25(OH)D ≥ 30 nmol/L. Post hoc analyses of a UK trial showed that in those with baseline total 25(OH)D levels ≤ 30 nmol/L, vitamin D supplements had a small treatment effect on spine and hip aBMD (0.6%).

In contrast to the studies in New Zealand and the UK, in our VITAL ancillary study, we were unable to identify a vitamin D threshold for bone health using baseline total 25(OH)D levels of < 30, < 50, or < 75 nmol/L. It is possible that our participants may have already reached the vitamin D level needed for bone health. The mean baseline 25(OH)D level of participants in this VITAL ancillary study was 69.1 nmol/L, 18.0% had 25(OH)D levels < 50 nmol/L, and 3.1% < 30 nmol/L (n = 25). This is consistent with recent U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data.

### Randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in older people to optimize bone health [^114dqZii]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

Vitamin D insufficiency is common in older people and may lead to increased bone resorption, bone loss, and increased falls and fractures. However, clinical trials assessing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) have yielded conflicting results.

- **Objectives**: This study examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on BMD at the hip using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.

- **Methods**: A total of 379 adults aged ≥ 70 years (48% women; mean age: 75 years) from the northeast of England were randomly allocated to one of three doses of vitamin D3 [12,000 international units (IU), 24,000 IU, or 48,000 IU] given once a month. The primary outcome was change in BMD (ΔBMD) at the hip. Secondary endpoints comprised the dose effects on femoral neck BMD, falls, circulating calciotropic hormones, bone turnover markers, and adverse events.

- **Results**: The mean ± SD baseline plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration was 40.0 ± 20.1 nmol/L, which increased after 12 months to a mean 25(OH)D of 55.9, 64.6, or 79.0 nmol/L for participants receiving a monthly dose of 12,000, 24,000, or 48,000 IU, respectively (P < 0.01 for difference). There was no between-group difference in ΔBMD. However, parathyroid hormone concentrations decreased in all three groups, with a significantly greater decrease in the 48,000-IU group compared with the 12,000-IU group (P < 0.01). There were no differences in any adverse events between groups, with 3 cases of hypercalcemia, none of nephrolithiasis, and 249 falls observed.

- **Conclusions**: There was no difference in change in BMD over 12 months.

### Prevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency in child and adolescent patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation compared to a healthy population [^1132zXad]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) are at risk for low bone mineral density, which may be due, in part, to low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.

- **Procedure**: We compared the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status of 22 pediatric HCT patients with 100 healthy pediatric controls and determined the prevalence of and risk factors for 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency and deficiency.

- **Results**: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were lower in the pediatric HCT patients at the time of transplant than in healthy pediatric controls (median 19.5 ng/ml vs. 31.0 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Of the HCT patients, 27% were 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficient (< 15 ng/dl) and 68% insufficient (15–29 ng/dl), compared with 4% and 40%, respectively, of healthy pediatric controls (P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, treatment with HCT, decreased ambient ultraviolet light exposure, non-Caucasian race, and older age were associated with decreased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. No association was found between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and gender, body mass index, dietary vitamin D intake, or patient-reported vitamin D supplementation. Few patients in either group reported sunscreen use, vitamin D supplementation, or recommended dietary vitamin D intake.

- **Conclusions**: At the time of transplant, pediatric HCT patients frequently have 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency/deficiency, and this occurs more commonly than in the healthy pediatric population. HCT patients rarely follow recommended guidelines to take supplemental vitamin D or consume the Recommended Daily Allowance for vitamin D.

### Effects of high-dose vitamin D2 versus D3 on total and free 25-hydroxyvitamin D and markers of calcium balance [^116J3h4r]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Controversy persists over how best to restore low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels: vitamin D2 (D2) versus vitamin D3 (D3); how best to define vitamin D status: total (protein-bound + free) versus free 25D; and how best to assess the bioactivity of free 25D.

- **Objective**: To assess the effects of D2 versus D3 on serum total and free 25D, and whether change in intact PTH (iPTH) is more strongly associated with change in total versus free 25D.

- **Design**: Participants previously enrolled in a D2 versus D3 trial were matched for age, body mass index, and race/ethnicity. Each group received 50,000 IU of D2 or D3 twice weekly for 5 weeks, followed by a 5-week equilibration period. Biochemical assessment was performed at baseline and at 10 weeks.

- **Setting and participants**: Thirty-eight adults (19 D2 and 19 D3), aged 18 years or older with baseline 25D levels less than 30 ng/mL, were recruited from an academic ambulatory osteoporosis clinic.

- **Outcome measures**: Serum measures included total 25D, free 25D (directly measured), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, calcium, and iPTH. The urine measure was the fasting calcium:creatinine ratio.

- **Results**: Baseline total (22.2 ± 3.3 versus 23.3 ± 7.2 ng/mL; p = 0.5) and free (5.4 ± 0.8 versus 5.3 ± 1.7 pg/mL; p = 0.8) 25D levels were similar between D2 and D3 groups. Increases in total (+27.6 versus +12.2 ng/mL; p = 0.001) and free (+3.6 versus +6.2 pg/mL; p = 0.02) 25D levels were greater with D3 than D2. Percentage change in iPTH was significantly associated with change in free (but not total) 25D, without and with adjustment for the supplementation regimen and change in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

### Relation between circulating levels of 25(OH) vitamin D and parathyroid hormone in chronic kidney disease: Quest for a threshold [^114CaiFG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Guidelines recommend treatment strategies in these patients similar to those for the general population, but the vitamin D nutritional status sufficient to prevent parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels from increasing in CKD is unknown.

- **Objective, main outcome measure**: Our aim was to study the relation between circulating PTH and 25(OH)D levels and to search for a 25(OH)D threshold associated with a significant PTH increase.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: In the hospital-referred NephroTest cohort study, we measured 25(OH)D, PTH, and glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) by ⁵¹Cr-EDTA renal clearance in 929 adult patients with nondialysis CKD stages 1 to 5 and no vitamin D supplementation. Patients' mean age was 60.1 ± 14.7 years; 71% were men, and 9% were black. Their median mGFR was 37.8 mL/min/1.73 m².

- **Results**: We found a 25(OH)D threshold of 8 ng/mL with an upper limit of 20 ng/mL (95% confidence interval) by linear piecewise regression modeling of log-PTH for 25(OH)D adjusted for mGFR, age, race, and ionized calcium level. The smoothed curve confirmed that PTH concentration rose steeply when circulating 25(OH)D levels fell to less than 20 ng/mL.

- **Conclusions**: Spontaneous 25(OH)D levels greater than 20 ng/mL seem sufficient to control serum PTH in CKD patients. This result reinforces guidelines to supplement vitamin D only if levels are less than 30 ng/mL.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1144Ymwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency:

- **Definition**: Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 20 ng/mL (< 50 nmol/L).

- **Risk factors**: Individuals living at high latitudes (above 33° north or south), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity are at higher risk.

### Appropriate goal level for 25-hydroxyvitamin D in cystic fibrosis [^115nRxb7]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and guidelines recommend 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels of ≥ 30 ng/mL. This threshold was selected because serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) rises in healthy individuals when the 25OHD level falls below 30 ng/mL. PTH levels > 50 pg/mL are associated with an increased risk of bone loss. However, the relationship between 25OHD and PTH has not been studied in CF. The study aims to determine the appropriate goal 25OHD level in patients with CF by identifying the level below which the risk of PTH > 50 pg/mL begins to increase.

- **Methods**: Levels of 25OHD and PTH in 216 individuals with CF were collected prospectively. Individuals with a 25OHD level below 30 ng/mL were further analyzed to assess the risk of PTH exceeding 50 pg/mL.

### Calcitriol [^1161q9mZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The optimal daily dose of calcitriol oral solution must be carefully determined for each patient. Calcitriol oral solution is administered orally as an oral solution (1 mcg/mL). Calcitriol therapy should always be started at the lowest possible dose and should not be increased without careful monitoring of serum calcium.

The effectiveness of calcitriol therapy is predicated on the assumption that each patient is receiving an adequate but not excessive daily intake of calcium. Patients are advised to have a dietary intake of calcium at a minimum of 600 mg daily. The U.S. RDA for calcium in adults is 800 mg to 1200 mg. To ensure that each patient receives an adequate daily intake of calcium, the physician should either prescribe a calcium supplement or instruct the patient in proper dietary measures.

Because of improved calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, some patients on calcitriol oral solution may be maintained on a lower calcium intake. Patients who tend to develop hypercalcemia may require only low doses of calcium or no supplementation at all.

During the titration period of treatment with calcitriol, serum calcium levels should be checked at least twice weekly. When the optimal dosage of calcitriol has been determined, serum calcium levels should be checked every month. Samples for serum calcium estimation should be taken without a tourniquet.

- **Dialysis patients**: The recommended initial dose of calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day.

### Effect of increasing doses of vitamin D on bone mineral density and serum N-terminal telopeptide in elderly women: a randomized controlled trial [^115sEGYe]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2018). High credibility.

There are few controlled studies on the effect of different doses of vitamin D3 on bone mineral density (BMD).

- **Objectives**: We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial with increasing doses of vitamin D3 in 163 Caucasian and 31 African American women whose serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels were ≤ 50 nmol/L. This study is an analysis of the secondary outcome BMD to investigate the association between the percent change in BMD and the dose of vitamin D3.

- **Methods**: Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or vitamin D3 at doses of 400, 800, 1600, 2400, 3200, 4000, or 4800 IU/day. Calcium supplements, averaging 600 mg, were administered to ensure a total calcium intake of 1200 mg/d. The primary outcome was the 12-month serum 25OHD level, and the analysis methods included ANOVA and Pearson correlations.

- **Results**: The mean percent increase (± SD) in BMD at 12 months for all women was minor: total body, 0.62% (± 2.72), femoral neck 0.59% (± 3.58), and spine 0.43% (± 2.80). There was no notable difference in BMD or serum N-telopeptide in response to vitamin D by dose or race. The observed increase in total body, spine, and hip BMD in elderly women given vitamin D doses between 400 and 4800 IU daily, alongside calcium supplementation, was small and unrelated to the dose or 12-month serum 25OHD, free 25OHD, or 1,25(OH)2D levels. There was no evidence of a threshold change in BMD with increasing serum 25OHD or free 25OHD in this population.

- **Conclusions**: We found no significant effect of daily vitamin D doses ranging from 400 to 4800 IU/day on BMD or serum N-terminal telopeptides in elderly women with initially low serum 25OHD levels.

### Can vitamin D supplementation prevent bone loss in persons with MS? A placebo-controlled trial [^111CqUa1]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS), a neuroinflammatory disease, is a possible cause of secondary osteoporosis. In persons with MS, low bone mineral density (BMD) is more prevalent when compared with controls and reference databases.

In individuals, BMD is primarily determined by genetic and hormonal factors, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and intake of calcium and vitamin D. Peak bone mass is attained in the third decade of life. Age-related bone loss starts around the age of 40 in both men and women, accelerating around menopause in women. Low bone mass may result from inadequate peak bone mass acquisition, bone loss, or a combination of these factors.

In persons with MS, several studies have shown that BMD decreases as disability increasingly limits physical activity. Baseline data from this study showed that one out of four participants had lower than expected BMD for sex and age.

The optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] value for bone health is not known, but many scientists and clinicians recommend maintaining 25(OH)D levels of at least 75 nmol/L. This is also the level of optimal intestinal absorption of calcium and the level at which serum parathyroid hormone levels are not further suppressed by increasing vitamin D intake.

Most studies in persons with MS have reported mean serum levels of vitamin D between 50 and 65 nmol/L. Low vitamin D levels may contribute to poor bone health, even before disability limits physical activity. If it proves true that vitamin D has a role in MS aetiology and pathogenesis, a shared pathway in the pathogenesis of MS and osteoporosis may be elucidated.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mass in infants with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L: A prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114TCiRr]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Vitamin D status at birth reflects maternal-fetal transfer of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). The recommended dietary allowance for vitamin D during pregnancy and lactation is set at 600 IU per day. When the expecting mother has 25(OH)D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L (i.e. 20 ng/mL), infants are born with an elevated risk of vitamin D insufficiency (25[OH]D less than 50 nmol/L) or deficiency (25[OH]D less than 30 nmol/L). Human milk does not provide vitamin D in amounts consistent with the adequate intake for infants (400 IU per day). Therefore, public health policies in North America recommend that all breastfed infants begin vitamin D supplementation (400 IU per day) shortly after birth.

The recommended amount of vitamin D for infants is set in accordance with intakes that maintain serum 25(OH)D concentration, the best marker of vitamin D status, in the range of 40 to 50 nmol/L to support bone health. In Canada, based on studies from different provinces, the proportion of infants with insufficient vitamin D status ranges from 24.4% in Quebec City (cord serum 25[OH]D concentration less than 50 nmol/L) to 28% in Calgary and Edmonton (cord serum 25[OH]D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L) and 36% in Winnipeg (cord serum 25[OH]D concentrations less than 27.5 nmol/L).

### Vitamin D supplementation after the menopause [^113dYKVu]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

There are several prevalent conditions in postmenopausal women associated with low serum 25(OH)D; hence, normalization of 25(OH)D levels may improve those conditions. Despite this, an excessive increase of 25(OH)D levels is not associated with better clinical results. In postmenopausal women, low vitamin D levels are associated with hypersecretion of PTH, and vitamin D supplementation reduces serum PTH and increases 25(OH)D levels. Increased PTH is associated with increased cortical bone porosity. Women who are not vitamin D deficient would not benefit from vitamin D supplementation. However, elderly women who do not receive active bone-forming treatments and have osteoporosis and low serum vitamin D should receive vitamin D supplementation as an anti-fracture agent. Meta-analysis of RCTs indicates that vitamin D and calcium supplementation produce a significant reduction of fracture risk (any and hip).

Insufficient and deficient 25(OH)D levels are associated with an increased risk of MetS in postmenopausal women, and vitamin D supplementation significantly reduces triglyceride, insulin, and HOMA-IR values. BMI is a good predictor of low 25(OH)D status in women, and the vitamin D supplementation dose should be adjusted according to BMI. In addition, concomitant vitamin D and calcium supplementation may reduce central fat deposits. Obese women may need higher vitamin D supplementation doses to normalize their circulating levels. In women with prediabetes and low 25(OH)D levels, vitamin D supplementation may improve insulin sensitivity.

### Serum concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in response to vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 supplementation [^1152otDi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 [1,25(OH)2D2] in healthy adults consuming 1000 IU of either vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 per day for 11 weeks.

- **Subjects and design**: Blood samples from 34 healthy male and female adults, aged 18 to 79 years, were analyzed. These subjects were part of a placebo-controlled, double-blind study and received either a placebo, 1000 IU of vitamin D3, or 1000 IU of vitamin D2 daily for 11 weeks at the end of winter. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25(OH)2D2, and 1,25(OH)2D3 were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

- **Results**: At the start of the study, 82% of participants were vitamin D insufficient, with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels less than 30 ng/mL. The administration of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 resulted in similar increases in total 25(OH)D, as well as in 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, respectively. Compared with the placebo group and after adjusting for baseline levels, 1000 IU daily of vitamin D2 was associated with a mean increase of 7.4 pg/mL (95% confidence interval, 4.4–10.3) in 1,25(OH)2D2. This increase was accompanied by a mean decrease of 9.9 pg/mL (-15.8 to -4.0) in 1,25(OH)2D3. No such differences were observed with the administration of 1000 IU daily of vitamin D3.

- **Conclusion**: Both vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 were effective in raising and maintaining total serum concentrations of 25(OH)D. Notably, ingestion of vitamin D2 resulted in an increase in serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D2, which was accompanied by a comparable decrease in serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3.

Vitamin D insufficiency is common in older people and may lead to increased bone resorption, bone loss, impairment of muscle function, and an increased risk of falls and fractures. The results of clinical trials assessing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD), bone loss, falls, and fractures have yielded conflicting results. Although a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials reported a possible relation between vitamin D supplementation and higher BMD at the neck of the femur, it suggested that supplementation with vitamin D benefits bone health only in those at risk of vitamin D deficiency.

Internationally, guidelines differ in their recommendations for vitamin D status for musculoskeletal health, as reflected by circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations. In the United Kingdom, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) recommends a concentration of ≥ 25 nmol/L. In North America, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends a concentration of 50 nmol/L, whereas the Endocrine Society's clinical guideline recommends a target concentration of 75 nmol/L for the maintenance of bone health and other nonskeletal benefits.

The UK dietary reference nutrient intake is 10 μg [400 international units (IU)]/d, whereas in North America, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for those aged > 70 years is 20 μg (800 IU)/d. However, in this age group in the United Kingdom, the mean daily vitamin D intake from dietary sources (including nutritional supplements) is approximately 5.2 μg (208 IU)/d.

### Randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in older people to optimize bone health [^112UvMeq]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

We conclude that there was no difference in ΔBMD between the three dosages of vitamin D, which suggests no effect of the intervention or that all doses may have attenuated the anticipated decrease in BMD over 12 months. Monthly dosing with oral vitamin D3 is a safe and effective strategy to increase plasma 25(OH)D > 25 nmol/L. This is achieved with all three doses in the majority of people and aligns with the recommendation by the SACN. The lack of a dose effect on adverse outcomes is reassuring.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116sT4h1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

- **Objective**: To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes). The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that (a) e

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on the calcium-phosphate balance in renal transplant patients [^117BFXBQ]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Low serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D frequently occur after renal transplantation, but few studies have evaluated the effects of normalizing this on serum parathyroid hormone and calcium levels or urinary calcium excretion. To determine this, we compared the outcomes of 94 renal transplant patients with low 25-hydroxy vitamin D and normal serum calcium levels who were either treated or not with cholecalciferol every 2 weeks for 2 months (intensive phase) followed by an every-other-month maintenance phase. The biological characteristics of the two equally divided patient groups did not differ before treatment.

After the intensive phase, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were normalized in all but three patients, and the serum parathyroid hormone decreased and calcium levels increased with no severe adverse effects. During the maintenance phase, the serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level decreased but remained significantly higher than in controls. In the control group, the serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentration increased slightly but became normal in only three patients. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were significantly higher, and parathyroid hormone levels were lower in treated patients compared to controls one year following the transplant. Hence, cholecalciferol treatment significantly increased serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D and decreased parathyroid hormone levels with no adverse effects in 25-hydroxy vitamin D-deficient renal transplant patients.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111X74a6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

In addressing specific circumstances of vitamin D deficiency, particularly concerning pediatric patients, the Endocrine Society's 2011 guidelines recommend initiating treatment with 2,000 IU/day of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 for at least six weeks. Alternatively, a regimen of 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 once weekly for a minimum of six weeks is advised. This should be followed by maintenance therapy of 600–1,000 IU/day in pediatric patients aged 1–18 years, with the goal of achieving a blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D greater than 30 ng/mL.

### Existing and potentially novel functional markers of vitamin D status: a systematic review [^112s1Cde]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Although serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is the currently accepted vitamin D status marker of choice, the use of other biomarkers or functional endpoints has been suggested.

- **Objective**: The objective was to systematically review the effectiveness of 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone turnover markers, bone mineral density (BMD), and calcium absorption as biomarkers of vitamin D status.

- **Design**: Methods included a structured search on Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE (Ovid), and Cochrane CENTRAL; rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria; data extraction; quality assessment; meta-analysis; and meta-regression.

- **Results**: Thirty-six vitamin D supplementation randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and four before-after studies were included. Vitamin D supplementation significantly raised circulating 25(OH)D in all but one RCT, but the response was highly heterogeneous [weighted mean difference (WMD): 34.1 nmol/L; 95% CI: 28.9, 39.2; 32 RCTs; I² = 97%]. Vitamin D supplementation (without calcium) significantly lowered circulating PTH (WMD: -0.29 pmol/L; 95% CI: -0.56, -0.02; 11 RCTs; I² = 29%), but this was not apparent in the presence of calcium supplementation. There was a suggestion that whole-body or lumbar spine BMD may be a useful biomarker in older people but not in adolescents. Bone turnover markers were not useful biomarkers of vitamin D status, but four before-after studies suggested that intestinal calcium absorption may respond to vitamin D status.

- **Conclusions**: This systematic review confirmed that circulating 25(OH)D is a robust and reliable marker of vitamin D status.

### A 2-year randomized controlled trial with low-dose B-vitamin supplementation shows benefits on bone mineral density in adults with lower B12 status [^1146dLP9]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

A decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) with age is well documented, with osteoporosis developing when negative bone balance exists. This imbalance is distinguishable by a disparity in the coupling of bone formation and resorption by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively. Regardless of treatment allocation, BMD at all three sites declined by approximately 1% (ranging from −0.7% to −1.4%) over the 2-year intervention. Our observations align with rates of BMD decline observed in other studies.

Through the use of an active placebo, with vitamin D administered to both treatment arms, all participants likely benefited from the intervention. Vitamin D, combined with calcium, has a well-documented role in bone health, with evidence suggesting that higher serum 25(OH)D is associated with greater BMD in older adults. Given that both groups received vitamin D, it can be assumed that any effect of B-vitamin intervention on BMD decline was independent of vitamin D.

### Differences in vitamin D3 dosing regimens in a geriatric community-dwelling population [^114fPQiS]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The adequate dose of vitamin D supplementation for community-dwelling elderly people has not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to determine the efficacy of a low-dose and a higher dose of vitamin D3 in maintaining 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels at or above 30 ng/mL.

- **Objective**: This was a single site, double-blind, randomized exploratory clinical trial that enrolled adults 65 years of age and older. Within strata of baseline 25(OH)D levels (< 30 versus ≥ 30 ng/mL), subjects were randomized in a 1:2 ratio to receive either 400 or 2,000 IU vitamin D3 daily for 6 months. The main outcome measures were changes in serum 25(OH)D levels according to baseline 25(OH)D levels and dose of vitamin D3.

- **Results**: At baseline, 41 of 105 participants (39%) had low 25(OH)D levels (< 30 ng/mL). After 6 months of vitamin D3 supplementation, 21 of 32 participants (66%) receiving 400 IU and 14 of 59 participants (24%) receiving 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 still had low 25(OH)D levels. The largest increases in serum 25(OH)D levels were observed in subjects with baseline levels < 30 ng/mL who received 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily.

- **Conclusion**: Regardless of baseline 25(OH)D level, in persons 65 years of age and older, 6-month vitamin D3 supplementation with 400 IU daily resulted in low 25(OH)D in most individuals, while 2,000 IU daily maintained 25(OH)D levels within an acceptable range in most people on this regimen.

### Vitamin D3 dose requirement that raises 25-hydroxyvitamin D to desirable level in overweight and obese elderly [^113fhsTo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is a steroid hormone known for its critical role in bone metabolism and musculoskeletal health. Ample evidence also demonstrates its extraskeletal physiologic actions. Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide health problem that affects all populations and is particularly common in the Middle East, despite the region's abundant sunlight. Vitamin D supplementation is a universally accepted therapeutic approach; however, guidelines vary widely globally. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends a daily vitamin D3 dose of 600 IU as adequate to bring 97.5% of the population to a prespecified desirable 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level of 20 ng/mL. The 2011 Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline suggests a daily dietary intake of 1000 to 2000 IU to reach a target level above 30 ng/mL. This lack of consensus may be attributed to factors such as the scarcity of clinical trials-based evidence, different target populations, varied desirable 25(OH)D levels, and discordant approaches to the vitamin D dose-response relationship.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) clearly demonstrate substantial variability in reported levels achieved for comparable doses, within and between ethnic groups. This raises questions regarding the applicability of the IOM recommended daily allowance (RDA) to non-US populations. Furthermore, there has been a rising trend of hypervitaminosis D due to over-supplementation in both developing and developed countries.

In this study, we capitalize on data available from a completed vitamin D trial to investigate the impact of two doses of vitamin D.

### Vitamin D3 dose requirement to raise 25-hydroxyvitamin D to desirable levels in adolescents: Results from a randomized controlled trial [^1138amkS]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). High credibility.

Several organizations have issued recommendations on desirable serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and doses of vitamin D needed to achieve them. Trials to formulate evidence-based recommendations in adolescents are scarce. We investigated the ability of two doses of vitamin D3 in achieving recommended vitamin D levels in this age group. Post hoc analyses were conducted on data from a 1-year double-blind trial that randomized 336 Lebanese adolescents, aged 13 ± 2 years, to receive a placebo, vitamin D3 at 200 IU/day (low dose), or 2000 IU/day (high dose). Serum 25(OH)D levels and proportions of children achieving levels ≥ 20 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL were assessed.

At baseline, the mean 25(OH)D level was 15 ± 7 ng/mL overall, with boys at 16.4 ± 7 ng/mL and girls at 14 ± 8 ng/mL (p = 0.003). Initially, 18% of subjects had a level ≥ 20 ng/mL, and 5% had a level ≥ 30 ng/mL. After 1 year, the mean 25(OH)D levels were 18.6 ± 6.6 ng/mL in the low-dose group, with 17.1 ± 6 ng/mL in girls and 20.2 ± 7 ng/mL in boys (p = 0.01). In the high-dose group, the mean level was 36.3 ± 22.3 ng/mL, with no significant sex differences.

The proportion of children whose 25(OH)D levels increased to ≥ 20 ng/mL was 34% in the low-dose group and 96% in the high-dose group, with higher levels observed in boys only in the low-dose group. Levels remained ≥ 30 ng/mL in 4% of children in the low-dose group but increased to 64% in the high-dose group. Baseline 25(OH)D levels, body mass index (BMI), and the assigned vitamin D dose were the most significant predictors for reaching a 25(OH)D level ≥ 20 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL. A daily dose of 2000 IU raised the 25(OH)D level to ≥ 20 ng/mL in 96% of adolescents (98% of boys versus 93% of girls). Dose-response studies are needed to further determine optimal requirements.

Interindividual Variability in Serum 25(OH)D Levels Achieved at 1 Year

Scrutiny of the individual serum 25(OH)D values at one year, and the difference in 25(OH)D levels between 12 months and baseline, reveal high variability in the magnitude and direction of response to both doses. To evaluate the impact of baseline serum 25(OH)D levels and dose on the response to therapy, we performed regression analyses of the change (delta) in serum 25(OH)D level with changing baseline 25(OH)D levels for each dose. As the baseline 25(OH)D levels increased, the change in serum 25(OH)D levels at one year decreased, with both doses. However, for any baseline serum 25(OH)D level, there could be substantial variance and overlap in the delta vitamin D achieved, within and between treatment groups. The mean increment with the low dose was 6 ng/mL, with a wide range from −13 to 26 ng/mL, and 15 ng/mL with the high dose, ranging between −13 and 41 ng/mL.

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on bone density in healthy children: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113BRaJr]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

The number of studies contributing substantial data to the meta-analysis was small. We, therefore, could not fully assess the effects of important clinical factors that might influence outcomes of supplementation. For example, we could not examine the interplay between compliance, dose of cholecalciferol, and baseline vitamin D levels; this interplay might have been able to explain the lack of any difference in effect by dose, should the data have allowed this to be examined.

We could not adequately investigate sex differences, and data were too few to assess effects after supplementation ceased. The cut-off of 35 nmol/L to define low serum vitamin D concentration in subgroup analyses was arbitrarily chosen based on the distribution of data to enable subgroup analyses. The main study contributing data to the subgroup with low baseline vitamin D level, however, included around 20% of participants with concentrations above 50 nmol/L. The effect sizes we found may therefore underestimate the benefits of supplementation in deficient children and adolescents.

Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the maximum benefit obtainable by supplementing vitamin D deficient children and adolescents. This includes whether benefits accrue with increasing duration of supplementation, below what serum vitamin D level benefits of supplementation can be seen, and whether benefits persist after supplementation ceases. The effects in children and adolescents overall at any site were not statistically significant. The observed effect sizes were also consistent.

### Comparative analysis of nutritional guidelines for vitamin D [^114m7n7G]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is essential for calcium and bone homeostasis. Humans are largely dependent on UVB-radiation-induced photosynthesis of vitamin D, as few foods contain this vitamin. However, the same radiation that produces vitamin D is also carcinogenic, albeit with a long lag time, and causes DNA damage. In view of the increasing life expectancy, avoiding excessive sun exposure is prudent. Several groups of people have a shortfall between their requirements for vitamin D and their combined endogenous synthesis and intake from natural foods, and therefore need vitamin D supplementation.

Governments and scientific societies are regularly updating their recommendations for vitamin D intake, especially for groups that should (infants) or prefer to (especially elderly individuals) avoid direct sunlight. An overview of such guidelines is presented in this review. There is a consensus that all infants should receive 400 international units (IU) (10 μg) daily during their first year of life. Elderly individuals should have access to vitamin D supplementation, with recommended dosages varying from 400 IU to 800 IU daily in most governmental guidelines but at higher dosages in other guidelines.

All guidelines unanimously agree that serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) less than 25 nmol/l (10 ng/ml) should be avoided at all ages. Children and adults who have limited sun exposure should receive vitamin D supplementation, although the recommended doses vary widely from 200 IU to 2,000 IU daily, reflecting disagreement regarding the minimal desirable serum concentration of 25OHD.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mass in infants with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L: A prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^113cPBDG]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

In conclusion, in infants with 25(OH)D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L at birth, both 400 and 1000 IU per day of vitamin D supplementation normalized and maintained 25(OH)D concentrations that align with skeletal health. The 1000 IU per day dosage of vitamin D supplementation did not lead to measurable improvements in bone health outcomes. Evidence from this Montreal-based study suggests that the standard of care of 400 IU per day is enough to support the bone health of breastfed infants born with serum 25(OH)D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L.

### Vitamin D-binding protein levels do not influence the effect of vitamin D repletion on serum PTH and calcium: Data from a randomized, controlled trial [^116pJbHF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency, defined by the total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level, is common and more prevalent among Blacks than Whites. Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) levels vary with race and may modulate "bioavailable" levels of 25(OH)D.

- **Objective**: To determine the effect of DBP levels on the functional response to vitamin D.

- **Setting and design**: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D repletion for 2 months, conducted at an outpatient research unit. Participants included 150 vitamin D-deficient (25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL) adults. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo weekly for 8 weeks. This is a post-hoc analysis using DBP, 25(OH)D, PTH, and calcium levels.

- **Results**: Blacks had lower total 25(OH)D (12 vs. 15 ng/mL, P < .001) and DBP levels (119 vs. 234 μg/mL, P < .001) than non-Blacks. DBP levels were similar before and after vitamin D3 or placebo treatment (r = 0.98, P < .001). Baseline total 25(OH)D levels were a significant determinant of baseline PTH levels (P < .001). The change in total 25(OH)D was associated with the change in PTH (P < .001) and calcium levels (P < .05). In contrast, DBP levels were not a determinant of baseline PTH (P = 0.57) nor significantly related to changes in either PTH (P = 0.53) or calcium levels (P = 0.88).

- **Conclusions**: DBP levels are stable in Blacks and non-Blacks and do not change with correction of vitamin D deficiency. Even for individuals with total 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/mL, Blacks have significantly lower DBP levels than non-Blacks.

### Supplemental vitamin D increases serum cytokines in those with initially low 25-hydroxyvitamin D: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^11783dN5]. Cytokine (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine if vitamin D status before supplementation influences the cytokine response after supplemental vitamin D. Forty-six reportedly healthy adults (mean ± SD: age, 32 ± 7 years; body mass index, 25.3 ± 4.5 kg/m²; serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), 34.8 ± 12.2 ng/mL) were randomly assigned, in a double-blind manner, to one of three groups: (1) placebo (n = 15), or supplemental vitamin D (cholecalciferol) at (2) 4000 IU (n = 14) or (3) 8000 IU (n = 17). Supplements were taken daily for 35 days.

Fasting blood samples were obtained before (baseline, Bsl) and 35 days after supplementation. Serum 25(OH)D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D), cytokines, and intact parathyroid hormone with calcium were measured in each blood sample. Supplemental vitamin D increased serum 25(OH)D (4000 IU, ≈29%; 8000 IU, ≈57%) and 1,25(OH)D (4000 IU, ≈12%; 8000 IU, ≈38%) without altering intact parathyroid hormone or calcium.

The increase in vitamin D metabolites in the supplemental vitamin D groups (n = 31) depended on initial levels, as serum 25(OH)D (r = -0.63, p < 0.05) and 1,25(OH)D (r = -0.45, p < 0.05) at baseline correlated with their increases after supplementation. Supplemental vitamin D increased interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-10 in subjects that were vitamin D insufficient (serum 25(OH)D < 29 ng/mL) compared to those who were sufficient (serum 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL) at baseline.

We conclude that supplemental vitamin D increases both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in individuals with initially low serum 25(OH)D.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mass in infants with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L: A prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1162LrbY]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

- **Key points**:

	- **Question**: Does a dosage of 1000 IU per day compared with 400 IU per day of supplemental vitamin D in infants born with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L (i.e. 20 ng/mL) present advantages to bone outcomes throughout infancy?

	- **Findings**: In this prespecified secondary analysis of a double-blinded randomized clinical trial including 139 healthy term infants, whole-body bone mineral content, lumbar spine bone mineral content and density, and bone biomarkers were not different among dosage groups from age 1 to 12 months.

	- **Meaning**: This study supports a standard daily supplemental dose of 400 IU of vitamin D in breastfed infants in Montreal, even if born with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L.

### National osteoporosis society vitamin D guideline summary [^113zRN7e]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) published its document, "Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline for Patient Management", in 2013 as a practical clinical guideline on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease. There has been no clear consensus in the UK on vitamin D deficiency, its assessment, and treatment, leading to inconsistent clinical practice. This guideline is aimed at clinicians, including doctors, nurses, and dieticians.

It recommends the measurement of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D (25OHD) to estimate vitamin D status in the following clinical scenarios: bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment; bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate; and musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency. The guideline also states that routine vitamin D testing is unnecessary where vitamin D supplementation with an oral antiresorptive treatment is already planned, and it sets the following serum 25OHD thresholds: 50 nmol/l is sufficient for almost the whole population.

For treatment, oral vitamin D3 is recommended, with fixed loading doses of oral vitamin D3 followed by regular maintenance therapy when rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is required. However, loading doses are not necessary where correction of deficiency is less urgent or when co-prescribing with an oral antiresorptive agent. For monitoring, serum calcium (adjusted for albumin) should be checked regularly.

### Vitamin D intake to attain a desired serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration [^114rPqzk]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). High credibility.

Indirect evidence suggests that optimal vitamin D status is achieved with a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration greater than 75 nmol/L.

- **Objective**: We aimed to determine the intake of vitamin D(3) needed to raise serum 25(OH)D to over 75 nmol/L.

- **Design**: The study was a 6-month prospective, randomized, double-blinded, double-dummy, placebo-controlled investigation of vitamin D(3) supplementation. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by radioimmunoassay. Vitamin D(3) intake was adjusted every 2 months using an algorithm based on serum 25(OH)D concentration.

- **Results**: A total of 138 subjects entered the study. After two dose adjustments, almost all active subjects attained concentrations of 25(OH)D greater than 75 nmol/L, and no subjects exceeded 220 nmol/L. The mean (± SD) slope at 9 weeks [defined as 25(OH)D change/baseline dose] was 0.66 ± 0.35 (nmol/L)/(µg/d), and it did not differ statistically between Blacks and Whites. The mean daily dose was 86 µg (3440 IU). The use of computer simulations to maximize the number of participants within the range of 75–220 nmol/L predicted an optimal daily dose of 115 µg/d (4600 IU). No hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria was observed.

- **Conclusions**: Determination of the intake required to attain serum 25(OH)D concentrations greater than 75 nmol/L must consider the wide variability in the dose-response curve and basal 25(OH)D concentrations. Projection of the dose-response curves observed in this convenience sample onto the population of the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey suggests a dose of 95 µg/d (3800 IU) for those above a 25(OH)D threshold.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of osteoporosis and fracture prevention in Canada: 2023 update [^114MQQzU]. CMAJ (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements, particularly vitamin D and calcium, the 2023 OC guidelines recommend advising daily vitamin D supplementation of 400 IU in adults over 50 years of age. This is in addition to consuming vitamin D-rich foods to achieve the recommended dietary allowance — 600 IU per day for individuals 51–70 years old and 800 IU per day for those over 70 years old — given the difficulty of obtaining sufficient vitamin D from food alone since few foods contain it.

### Vitamin D status in gastrointestinal and liver disease [^114HyB1U]. Current opinion in gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to report on the vitamin D status and its relationship with bone health in individuals with gastrointestinal and liver disorders. In addition, recommendations regarding replacement and maintenance of optimal vitamin D stores, as well as the state of knowledge regarding its effect on the disease through its actions on the immune system, are reviewed.

Recent findings from the scientific community suggest a revision upwards of the serum levels of vitamin D considered optimal. Doses of vitamin D much larger than those currently recommended may be necessary to maintain these levels, particularly in individuals with gastrointestinal and liver disorders. The relationship between vitamin D and bone health in this population is controversial. Furthermore, the role of vitamin D in the regulation of the immune system continues to be elucidated.

Hypovitaminosis D is prevalent among individuals with gastrointestinal and liver disease. Although replacement and supplementation guidelines have yet to be well defined, practitioners should aim for a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 32 ng/ml. The contribution of vitamin D to the bone health of these individuals and its role in altering disease course through its actions on the immune system remain to be elucidated.
