## Question

high PTH, Hypomagnesemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between high parathyroid hormone (PTH) and hypomagnesemia, including mechanisms, clinical contexts, diagnostic implications, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the bidirectional relationship between magnesium and PTH. Then, I should verify the mechanisms by which hypomagnesemia affects PTH secretion and action. Next, I will examine clinical scenarios where high PTH and low magnesium coexist, followed by diagnostic pitfalls and how to interpret labs. Finally, I will outline management principles and special considerations, and close with a concise synthesis that ties mechanism to bedside practice.

> Let me first confirm the bidirectional relationship. Magnesium and PTH regulate each other: magnesium influences PTH secretion and target-organ responsiveness, while PTH modulates renal magnesium handling, so changes in one can alter the other in a feedback loop that is clinically relevant in several settings [^5f146917] [^177b009e].

> I will now examine the effect of hypomagnesemia on PTH. Wait, let me verify the directionality because it is easy to misstate. Moderate hypomagnesemia tends to stimulate PTH secretion, whereas severe hypomagnesemia paradoxically suppresses PTH release and induces PTH resistance at target tissues, producing functional hypoparathyroidism and refractory hypocalcemia that does not correct with calcium alone until magnesium is repleted [^5f146917] [^0af890dc] [^1952e26c].

> Hold on, I should verify the mechanism. Severe magnesium deficiency disrupts stimulus–secretion coupling in parathyroid cells and can activate CaSR-like signaling pathways that inhibit PTH release; it also impairs adenylate cyclase and downstream cAMP signaling, causing both impaired secretion and end-organ resistance, which explains why hypocalcemia persists despite low or inappropriately normal PTH in severe hypomagnesemia [^0af890dc] [^5f146917].

> Next, I should review the effect of PTH on magnesium. PTH increases renal magnesium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule, so sustained hyperparathyroidism can theoretically raise serum magnesium, but in primary hyperparathyroidism the dominant effect of hypercalcemia often increases renal magnesium wasting, yielding normal or mildly low magnesium despite higher PTH, which complicates the picture and can mask magnesium deficits [^5f146917] [^177b009e].

> Let me consider clinical contexts where high PTH and hypomagnesemia coexist. In primary hyperparathyroidism, about a quarter of patients have hypomagnesemia, and those with hypomagnesemia tend to have more severe hypercalcemia and more pronounced clinical manifestations, suggesting magnesium status tracks disease severity in PHPT cohorts [^77d7dfdc] [^6272377a]. In secondary hyperparathyroidism due to CKD, hypomagnesemia is less common and hypermagnesemia is more typical, but when hypomagnesemia does occur, it can suppress PTH and blunt the expected secondary hyperparathyroid response, creating a mixed biochemical picture [^bd5096af] [^eb627ee3]. In Gitelman syndrome, chronic hypomagnesemia is associated with a high prevalence of hypoparathyroidism, likely via CaSR-dependent mechanisms and impaired PTH secretion, illustrating a direct link between low magnesium and low or inappropriately normal PTH in that population [^91701143] [^b60e5030].

> But wait, what if the PTH is high and magnesium is low in a different context? I need to check for confounders. Vitamin D deficiency, metabolic syndrome, and obesity can elevate PTH, and concurrent medications or renal tubular defects can lower magnesium, so coexistence does not always imply causality; careful phenotyping and medication review are essential to avoid misattribution [^a92ffe33] [^5e223410] [^d850c485].

> Next, I should review diagnostic implications. In hypocalcemia, I should confirm magnesium before assuming hypoparathyroidism or PTH resistance, because hypomagnesemia can produce inappropriately low or normal PTH and refractory hypocalcemia that only responds once magnesium is corrected; conversely, in PHPT, recognizing hypomagnesemia may flag more severe disease and guide closer monitoring and perioperative planning [^1952e26c] [^77d7dfdc] [^5f6a48a2].

> I will now examine management principles. For severe or symptomatic hypomagnesemia with hypocalcemia, I should prioritize IV magnesium repletion to restore PTH secretion and action, then add calcium and active vitamin D as needed; in chronic hypomagnesemia, oral magnesium with attention to gastrointestinal tolerance and cause-directed therapy is appropriate, and in PHPT, parathyroidectomy remains definitive while magnesium should be optimized perioperatively to mitigate postoperative hypomagnesemia and facilitate calcium recovery [^1952e26c] [^5f6a48a2] [^183e9df4].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios. After parathyroidectomy for PHPT, magnesium often drops and nearly a third develop hypomagnesemia, so checking magnesium postoperatively is reasonable, especially if calcium recovery is sluggish or symptomatic; in dialysis patients, magnesium-containing binders can lower PTH, but I need to balance this against the risk of hypermagnesemia and individualize the prescription [^5f6a48a2] [^9f325959].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis to ensure internal consistency. High PTH and low magnesium can coexist via two main pathways: hypomagnesemia driving secondary hyperparathyroidism when moderate, or severe hypomagnesemia suppressing PTH and causing functional hypoparathyroidism; conversely, hyperparathyroid states can increase renal magnesium wasting and uncover or worsen hypomagnesemia, so the relationship is bidirectional and context-dependent, demanding that I interpret labs alongside clinical phenotype, medications, and renal function [^5f146917] [^177b009e] [^0af890dc].

High PTH with hypomagnesemia reflects **impaired PTH secretion and end-organ resistance** due to magnesium deficiency [^0af890dc]. Magnesium is required for PTH synthesis, release, and receptor signaling; low magnesium suppresses PTH and causes PTH resistance, leading to hypocalcemia that does not correct with calcium alone [^0af890dc]. Common causes include **PPIs, diuretics, malabsorption, and renal losses** [^280da153] [^d850c485]. Management requires **prompt magnesium repletion** (oral or IV) to restore PTH function and correct hypocalcemia; monitor for recurrence and address the underlying cause to prevent relapse [^1952e26c] [^632016e3].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking high PTH and hypomagnesemia

Magnesium is a **critical cofactor** in the parathyroid gland for PTH synthesis, secretion, and receptor signaling; magnesium deficiency disrupts these processes via several mechanisms:

- **Impaired PTH secretion**: Low magnesium impairs stimulus–secretion coupling in parathyroid cells, reducing PTH release despite hypocalcemia [^0af890dc].

- **End-organ resistance**: Magnesium deficiency induces PTH resistance at target tissues (bone, kidney), blunting calcemic and phosphaturic responses [^0af890dc].

- **Paradoxical suppression**: Severe hypomagnesemia can paradoxically suppress PTH, causing functional hypoparathyroidism and refractory hypocalcemia [^0af890dc].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with high PTH and hypomagnesemia

Several clinical scenarios present with **coexisting high PTH and hypomagnesemia**:

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use | PPI-induced hypomagnesemia impairs PTH secretion and causes PTH resistance [^77f61a7a] [^0af890dc] |
| Diuretic therapy (loop, thiazides) | Increased renal magnesium wasting and secondary hyperparathyroidism [^d850c485] [^6a6f61ec] |
| Malabsorption syndromes (e.g. celiac, IBD) | Reduced intestinal magnesium absorption and secondary hyperparathyroidism [^280da153] |
| Renal magnesium wasting (e.g. Gitelman syndrome) | Renal magnesium losses with secondary hyperparathyroidism [^91701143] |
| Critical illness, sepsis | Magnesium shifts, increased losses, and impaired PTH secretion [^d850c485] [^6c33bbc3] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When evaluating a patient with high PTH and hypomagnesemia, a **structured approach** is essential:

- **Confirm hypomagnesemia**: Serum magnesium < 0.7 mmol/L (1.7 mg/dL) [^280da153].

- **Assess PTH dynamics**: Evaluate PTH response to hypocalcemia; inappropriately low or normal PTH suggests magnesium-related impairment [^0af890dc].

- **Identify underlying causes**: Review medications (PPIs, diuretics), gastrointestinal history, renal function, and family history [^d850c485].

- **Additional tests**: Consider 24-hour urinary magnesium, vitamin D status, and renal imaging if indicated [^6272377a].

---

## Clinical implications and complications

Persistent high PTH with hypomagnesemia can cause **significant morbidity**:

- **Refractory hypocalcemia**: Hypocalcemia that does not respond to calcium alone until magnesium is corrected [^1952e26c].

- **Neuromuscular symptoms**: Tetany, seizures, and arrhythmias due to hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia [^4160f805].

- **Bone disease**: Chronic secondary hyperparathyroidism can cause osteomalacia and osteoporosis [^notfound].

- **Renal complications**: Hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, and nephrocalcinosis from prolonged hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism [^1b768f70].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management centers on **correcting magnesium deficiency** and addressing the cause:

- **Magnesium repletion**: Oral magnesium (e.g. magnesium oxide, magnesium gluconate) for mild deficiency; IV magnesium sulfate for severe deficiency or symptomatic patients [^notfound].

- **Monitor and titrate**: Recheck magnesium and calcium frequently during repletion; hypocalcemia typically corrects after magnesium normalization [^notfound].

- **Address underlying causes**: Discontinue offending drugs (e.g. PPIs, diuretics), treat malabsorption, or manage renal losses [^notfound].

- **Long-term surveillance**: Periodic monitoring of magnesium, calcium, and PTH to detect recurrence or persistent hyperparathyroidism [^9b61ecda].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause** and adherence to therapy. Recurrence is common if the cause is not addressed (e.g. ongoing PPI use, renal wasting), whereas correcting magnesium and the precipitating factor usually leads to durable remission of secondary hyperparathyroidism and hypocalcemia [^notfound].

---

High PTH with hypomagnesemia reflects **magnesium-dependent impairment of PTH secretion and action**; **prompt magnesium repletion** restores PTH function and corrects hypocalcemia, but durable control requires identifying and treating the underlying cause.

### Magnesium and the parathyroid [^5f146917]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

The serum levels of parathyroid hormone and magnesium depend on each other in a complex manner. The secretion of parathyroid hormone by the parathyroid is physiologically controlled by the serum calcium level, but magnesium can exert similar effects. While low levels of magnesium stimulate parathyroid hormone secretion, very low serum concentrations induce a paradoxical block. This block leads to clinically relevant hypocalcemia in severely hypomagnesiemic patients. The mechanism of this effect has recently been traced to an activation of the alpha-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins. This activation mimicks activation of the calcium sensing receptor and thus causes inhibition of parathyroid hormone secretion. In addition to the effects of magnesium on parathyroid hormone secretion, parathyroid hormone in turn regulates magnesium homeostasis by modulating renal magnesium reabsorption. The distal convoluted tubule is of crucial importance for parathyroid hormone-regulated magnesium homeostasis.

Introduction

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a generalized endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcemia and high or inappropriately normal concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Patients with PHPT may experience an array of symptoms, including nephrolithiasis, bone pain/fractures, gastrointestinal symptoms, thirst, and polyuria. Parathyroid hormone activates the parathyroid hormone receptor, increasing bone and distal tubular calcium resorption. Parathyroid hormone also plays a role in vitamin D metabolism; it activates vitamin D 1-alpha hydroxylase, which increases the renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D to enhance dietary calcium absorption. Levels of PTH may be regulated by serum magnesium. Hypermagnesemia may cause hypocalcemia, through activation of calcium-sensing receptors in the parathyroid glands, thereby suppressing PTH secretion. Magnesium deficiency may lead to the production of defective cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the parathyroid glands and in PTH target organs. This may be the principal mechanism underlying both impaired PTH secretion and end-organ resistance to PTH, which together contribute to the development of hypocalcemia.

Magnesium is the second most common intracellular cation. Its abundance facilitates its multiple functions in common, essential intracellular processes. It is a co-factor in multiple enzymatic reactions, including those related to energy metabolism and DNA and protein synthesis, and it participates in the regulation of ion channels. Magnesium is essential for the regulation of muscular contraction, blood pressure, insulin metabolism, cardiac excitability, vasomotor tone, nerve transmission, and neuromuscular conduction. Although PTH stimulates an increase in tubular magnesium reabsorption in patients with PHPT, the direct effect of hypercalcemia on tubular magnesium reabsorption is the opposite. As a result, the serum magnesium levels in patients with PHPT are usually normal or only slightly reduced. However, the occurrence of hypomagnesemia in PHPT has been noted previously, and patients with more severe PHPT, manifested by high serum calcium, tend to have low serum magnesium. These findings suggest that hypomagnesemia has a potential in predicting the severity of hypercalcemia in patients with PHPT.

To the end, the occurrence of hypomagnesemia in patients with PHPT has been noted previously; however, the association of hypomagnesemia and severity of primary hyperparathyroidism remains unknown. In the present study, using a retrospective review of 307 consecutive PHPT patients who were continuously hospitalized, we investigated the association of hypomagnesemia with biochemical and clinical manifestations in patients with PHPT.

### Hypomagnesaemia [^280da153]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Magnesium plays an important role in the body as a cofactor for DNA and protein synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, neuromuscular excitability, enzyme activity and regulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion.1 The regulation of plasma magnesium concentration is balanced by intestinal absorption and renal excretion. Hypomagnesaemia (variously defined but taken here as plasma magnesium < 0.7 mmol/L) may result from inadequate magnesium intake, increased gastrointestinal or renal loss or redistribution from extracellular to intracellular space. In addition, hypomagnesaemia has been associated with the use of a number of drugs and, in 2012, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) drew attention to the risk associated with prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).2 Here we review the causes and management of hypomagnesaemia.

### Association between hypomagnesemia and severity of primary hyperparathyroidism: a retrospective study [^6272377a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The prevalence of hypomagnesemia was 25.1% in the total study population, 32.4% in males, and 21.5% in females. The occurrence of hypomagnesemia in PHPT has been noted previously and was confirmed in this study; a significant negative correlation was found between serum calcium and magnesium in patients with PHPT. These results are consistent with those of a previous study that included 73 hospitalized patients with PHPT. Our results indicate that the higher prevalence of hypercalcemic crisis persisted after adjusting for eGFR and PTH levels in patients with hypomagnesemia. Magnesium levels are maintained within a normal range by a dynamic interplay among intestinal absorption, exchange with bone, and renal excretion, and disruption of these processes may cause hypomagnesemia. Magnesium is chiefly eliminated through renal excretion; thus, increased renal excretion leads to hypomagnesemia. Although PTH stimulates an increase in tubular magnesium reabsorption in patients with PHPT, hypercalcemia has the opposite effect. Hypercalcemia can cause hypomagnesemia owing to increased filtered calcium load in the loop of Henle, resulting in decreased reabsorption of magnesium. In the present study, the mean 24 h urinary magnesium levels in the hypomagnesemia group were higher than those in the normal magnesium group in both males and females, but the difference was not statistically significant. This finding may be explained by the fact that we did not measure urinary creatinine and were unable to calculate the renal fractional excretion of magnesium. The renal fractional excretion of magnesium is more effective in evaluating renal magnesium excretion.

### Serum magnesium measurements after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism: should It be routine? [^5f6a48a2]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Following surgery, significant changes in bone and mineral metabolism may follow, but routine magnesium monitoring is not standard practice. The occurrence of significant clinical events linked to hypomagnesaemia in 3 patients after parathyroidectomy led to our evaluation of magnesium levels after surgery for PHPT.

Methods

Serum magnesium levels before and after parathyroidectomy for PHPT were prospectively evaluated in a single centre over a year. The incidence and severity of hypomagnesaemia and its correlation with other biochemical variables were assessed.

Results

A total of 138 patients underwent parathyroidectomy for PHPT. Pre-operative and day 1 post-operative serum magnesium levels were available in 57/138 (41.3%) and 99/138 (71.7%) patients, respectively. Serum magnesium decreased significantly after surgery (mean ± SD of 0.85 ± 0.08 and 0.75 ± 0.11 mmol/L, respectively, p < 0.001). On the day after parathyroidectomy, 31/99 (31.3%) patients had hypomagnesaemia (< 0.70 mmol/L); in 3 of whom it was severe (< 0.50 mmol/L). Patients with hypomagnesaemia had lower pre-operative magnesium (mean ± SD of 0.78 ± 0.06 and 0.87 ± 0.07 mmol/L, p < 0.001), higher pre-operative calcium [median (IQR) of 2.83 (2.71–2.99) and 2.71 (2.63–2.80) mmol/L, p = 0.001] and higher post-operative calcium [median (IQR) of 2.41 (2.30–2.51) and 2.35 (2.28–2.43) mmol/L, p = 0.046] compared to those with normomagnesaemia. In addition, these patients demonstrated higher drop in calcium levels after surgery (0.44 ± 0.20 and 0.35 ± 0.18 mmol/L, p = 0.033). Magnesium levels after surgery correlated positively with pre-operative magnesium (r = 0.561, p < 0.001) and post-operative PTH (r = 0.210, p = 0.037) and negatively with pre-operative adjusted calcium (r = -0.389, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Serum magnesium decreased significantly following parathyroidectomy for PHPT and nearly a third of patients developed post-operative, mostly mild hypomagnesaemia. Whilst routine serum magnesium measurements could facilitate prompt recognition and treatment of this electrolyte disturbance, further research needs to establish the clinical importance of mild hypomagnesaemia in these clinical settings and, if indicated, to devise optimal treatment strategies.

### Association between hypomagnesemia and severity of primary hyperparathyroidism: a retrospective study [^77d7dfdc]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The occurrence of hypomagnesemia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) has been noted previously; however, the association of hypomagnesemia and severity of primary hyperparathyroidism remains unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate the association of hypomagnesemia with biochemical and clinical manifestations in patients with PHPT.

Methods

This was a retrospective study conducted at a tertiary hospital. We obtained data from 307 patients with PHPT from January 2010 through August 2020. Data on demographics, history, laboratory findings, bone densitometry findings, and clinical presentation and complications were collected and were compared in normal magnesium group vs hypomagnesemia group.

Results

Among the 307 patients with PHPT included in our study, 77 patients (33/102 [32.4%] males and 44/205 [21.5%] females) had hypomagnesemia. Mean hemoglobin levels in the hypomagnesemia group were significantly lower than those in the normal magnesium group in both males and females. In contrast, patients with hypomagnesemia had a higher mean serum calcium and parathyroid hormone than individuals with normal magnesium. The typical symptoms of PHPT, such as nephrolithiasis, bone pain/fractures, polyuria, or polydipsia, were more common in the hypomagnesemia group. In addition, patients with hypomagnesemia had a higher prevalence of osteoporosis, anemia, and hypercalcemic crisis. Even after adjusting for potential confounders, including age, sex, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and parathyroid hormone levels, these associations remained essentially unchanged.

Conclusion

Biochemical and clinical evidence indicates that patients with PHPT with hypomagnesemia have more severe hyperparathyroidism than those without hypomagnesemia. In addition, PHPT patients with hypomagnesemia had a higher prevalence of osteoporosis, anemia, and hypercalcemic crisis.

### Parathyroid hormone, but not vitamin D, is associated with the metabolic syndrome in morbidly obese women and men: a cross-sectional study [^dd280080]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The metabolic syndrome (MS) is a clustering of risk factors including abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycemia, and elevated blood pressure. MS leads to increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A number of studies indicate that there is a relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D), calcium, insulin resistance and MS. However, in few of these reports the findings are adjusted for confounding variables with putative associations to MS. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and magnesium are of particular interest in this context, as elevated levels of PTH and hypomagnesemia have been reported together with MS. Low serum magnesium levels have also been linked to insulin resistance and increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

Although it is well known that the synthesis and secretion of PTH is tightly regulated by serum levels of calcium and phosphate, serum concentrations of vitamin D and magnesium do also influence PTH levels. However, less is known about the possible clustered affiliation of these parameters with MS. Postmenopausal women with normal serum calcium and creatinine but inappropriately high PTH, had higher serum glucose, triglycerides and BMI, but lower HDL-cholesterol concentrations than controls. Increasing PTH levels seem to be associated with MS in older men, but not in women and younger men. In contrast, no significant relationship between PTH, vitamin D and MS has been shown in morbidly obese subjects.

The objective of the present study was to explore whether MS is associated with abnormal serum levels of PTH, vitamin D and magnesium in a large cohort of morbidly obese patients.

### Magnesium modulates parathyroid hormone secretion and upregulates parathyroid receptor expression at moderately low calcium concentration [^c10ec402]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

The relative potencies of Ca and Mg in inhibiting PTH secretion were previously addressed by Habener and Potts and Brown's group, who reported that Ca was about three times more potent than Mg in reducing PTH secretion in vitro. Our results allow the following conclusion: at a Mg concentration of 0.5 mM an increase in Ca from 1 to 1.5 mM (delta of 0.5 mM) reduces PTH by 57%; on the other hand, if Ca is maintained at 1 mM and the Mg concentration is increased by 0.5 mM (from 0.5 to 1 mM), the PTH secretion decreases by 14%. The ratio 57/14% is 4.0, indicating that Ca is four times more potent than Mg in suppressing PTH. However, the ability of Mg to decrease PTH is constant at all calcium concentrations. At 1 mM Ca, an increase in Mg concentration from 0.5 to 2.0 mM (delta of 1.5 mM) reduces PTH by 38%. An equal 38% decrease in PTH secretion is obtained with only a small increase in Ca from 1.0 to 1.2 mM (see Figure 1). Thus, the relative potency of Ca and Mg in reducing PTH secretion varies according to the basal serum Ca concentration and the degree of change in both Mg and Ca. Still, the potency of Ca in suppressing PTH is at least four times greater than that of Mg, which is close to what has been published before.

It is known that, like Ca, Mg is able to activate the CaR; though binding sites for Ca and Mg seem to be different. However, differences between Ca and Mg-elicited actions may be further related to mechanisms other than how Mg interacts with the CaR. Mg and Ca may activate different intracellular signalling pathways. The paradoxical decrease in PTH secretion observed at any given Ca concentration under Mg deficiency in vivo, in vitro and in patients with severe hypomagnesaemia was explained by a mechanism involving an intracellular increase in the activity of G alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins. Besides, as deduced from a study by the group of Fitzpatrick et al. addition of extracellular Mg to single isolated bovine parathyroid cells was able to affect PTH secretion through changes in intracellular Ca concentrations via two different CaR-independent mechanisms.

Magnesium supplementation and monitoring — No randomized controlled study has evaluated the effect of magnesium intake on fracture risk or BMD, most people have adequate dietary intake, and individuals who are at risk for hypomagnesemia (e.g., those with GI malabsorption, chronic liver disease [including alcoholics], or renal tubular disorders; those who are taking diuretics, aminoglycoside antibiotics, calcineurin inhibitors, proton pump inhibitors, or other medications; and older adults) may benefit from evaluation of serum magnesium levels.

### Magnesium modulates parathyroid hormone secretion and upregulates parathyroid receptor expression at moderately low calcium concentration [^b596307c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

The capacity of Mg to modulate the expression of the CaR and, subsequently, of the VDR and the FGFR1/Klotho at long term suggests that this cation could be considered as a wide-range inhibitor of the whole parathyroid function. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of Mg on parathyroid function, mainly when Ca is moderately low, could help to control secondary hyperparathyroidism. Interestingly, Mg also would favour the efficiency of therapeutic molecules targeting the parathyroid CaR, VDR or FGF23/Klotho. On the other hand, it is also important to emphasize that the decrease in PTH secretion did not result in an oversuppression of PTH at moderately elevated Mg concentrations. Our data certainly suggest that hypomagnesaemia should be avoided. In those cases of suppression of PTH by high Ca, the increased levels of Mg had limited additional suppressive effect on PTH. In the present study, performed with parathyroid glands from rats with normal renal function, we observed that Mg induced up-regulation of CaR, VDR and FGFR/Klotho. However, since the effect of Mg is through the activation of the CaR, and this receptor is usually down-regulated in CKD, results could be different in hyperplastic parathyroid glands from uraemic rats. Although this surely deserves to be evaluated in future studies, it could be assumed that higher levels of Mg should be needed to maintain comparable levels of CaR activity as well as the corresponding upregulation of the other receptors. Thus, avoiding hypomagnesaemia (and hypocalcaemia) in CKD prevents downregulation of key parathyroid receptors (CaR, VDR, Klotho FGFR1).

In conclusion, the results of this study show that parathyroid glands are sensitive to an inhibitory effect of Mg only when a moderate low calcium concentration is present. Mg also modulates the function of parathyroid glands through upregulation of the key cellular receptors CaR, VDR and the FGF23/Klotho system.

### Hypomagnesemia during teriparatide treatment in osteoporosis: incidence and determinants [^e1d74953]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). Low credibility.

In our clinical experience, we have encountered patients who developed hypomagnesemia after the introduction of teriparatide. Some trials have reported hypomagnesemia as an adverse event during teriparatide treatment, but this issue had never been studied specifically. Our objective was twofold: 1) determine the incidence of hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium < 0.7mmol/L) associated with teriparatide in a retrospective cohort and 2) identify the predisposing factors to hypomagnesemia in this cohort. We reviewed the files of 53 patients treated for severe osteoporosis with teriparatide for 6 to 24 months between May 2008 and January 2016. Serum magnesium levels were measured at 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. In the full cohort, we observed an average decrease of serum magnesium of 0.075mmol/L, 0.069mmol/L, 0.085mmol/L, 0.086mmol/L (p < 0.001) at 3, 6, 12 months, and at the end of the treatment, respectively. The cumulative incidence of hypomagnesemia during treatment with teriparatide was 35.9% (19 patients). Patients' older age (71.1 versus 65.1 years; p = 0.05) and lower baseline level of magnesium before teriparatide treatment (0.81mmol/L versus 0.85mmol/L; p = 0.03) were significant risk factors for teriparatide-induced hypomagnesemia. The average decrease of serum magnesium was greater in the patients who developed hypomagnesemia compared with normomagnesemic patients at 3 months (0.110mmol/L versus 0.054mmol/L; p = 0.02), 6 months (0.139mmol/L versus 0.036mmol/L; p < 0.001), and 12 months (0.156mmol/L versus 0.048mmol/L; p < 0.001). Serum calcium, creatinine, and parathyroid hormone remained normal throughout the treatment period. We observed a statistically significant decrease in the serum magnesium levels in patients treated with teriparatide for severe osteoporosis. Older age and lower baseline magnesium were significant determinants of hypomagnesemia. Closer monitoring of serum magnesium level should be considered in these patients. © 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### The role of magnesium in post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia [^506af228]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of hypomagnesemia in patients undergoing thyroidectomy and evaluate the relationship of hypomagnesemia with transient and severe hypocalcemia.

Materials and Methods

This was a prospective observational study of 50 patients undergoing thyroidectomy. Blood samples were collected pre- and postoperatively for calcium, albumin, magnesium, phosphorous and parathormone (PTH). Signs, symptoms of hypocalcemia and volume of intravenous fluids used perioperatively were documented. The statistical analysis was performed using STATA I/C 10.1.

Results

Preoperatively, twelve patients (24%) had hypomagnesemia and one (2%) hypocalcemia. On the first postoperative day, hypomagnesemia was seen in 70% and hypocalcemia in 30%. A similar trend was observed in the fall and rise of postoperative calcium and magnesium values (p = 0.41). Severe hypocalcemia was present in three patients (6%). All three patients had a very low postoperative PTH (< 2 pg/ml). Among them, two patients (66%) had hypomagnesemia and their hypocalcemia responded to intravenous magnesium correction. Significant risk factors for postoperative hypocalcemia include a higher volume of fluid used perioperatively and low postoperative PTH (< 8 pg/ml) (p = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively).

Conclusion

Preoperative hypomagnesemia (24%) was prevalent in this cohort of patients. Postoperative hypomagnesemia is a common event (70%) following total thyroidectomy, and magnesium levels tend to mimic the calcium levels postoperatively. The cause of hypocalcemia post-thyroidectomy in this study is mainly a factor of parathyroid function and fluid status. Severe hypocalcemia is a rare event, and hypomagnesemia is associated in the majority of these patients. The role of magnesium correction to alleviate severe hypocalcemia needs to be further studied.

### Etiology and pathophysiology of hypoparathyroidism: a narrative review [^fc4e620b]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is essential for calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) homeostasis through its direct actions on bone resorption, kidney transport of Ca and P, and indirect actions to increase intestinal Ca absorption through enhanced 1,25 (OH) 2 vitamin D [1,25(OH) 2 D] production. A rare disorder of impaired or inadequate PTH secretion, hypoparathyroidism, leads to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and the clinical consequences described herein. These consequences result from the lack of PTH and the resulting mineral disturbances on multiple tissues.

The estimated prevalence of hypoparathyroidism is ~23 to 37 cases per 100,000 person-years. Approximately 25% of cases arise from genetic or metabolic disorders, autoimmune destruction, or infiltration of the glands (Table 1). Transient hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia can also occur with magnesium (Mg) depletion or excess. Many cases remain idiopathic. Most commonly, however, ~75% of cases of hypoparathyroidism are iatrogenic following neck surgery.

### Hypomagnesemia in type 2 diabetic nephropathy: a novel predictor of end-stage renal disease [^10af8ca7]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Another potential confounder is Ca and P because Mg homeostasis is closely linked to these minerals. In general, hypomagnesemia causes hypocalcemia via peripheral parathyroid hormone (PTH) resistance, inhibition of PTH secretion, and impaired conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. However, we found no significant correlation between serum Mg and Ca levels. One possible explanation for this is that PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D are more strongly influenced by reduced renal function in patients with CKD, thereby attenuating the relationship between Mg and Ca. The relationship between Mg and P is not fully understood, but P depletion reduced Mg ion reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule in an in vitro study. We also observed a significant positive correlation between serum Mg and P levels. Schwarz et al. reported that high serum P levels were significantly associated with CKD progression. They also showed that low serum Ca tended to be associated with increased risk of CKD progression. We showed that the significant association between hypomagnesemia and poor renal outcome in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy was independent of serum Ca and P levels. This result suggests that serum Mg level should be considered when evaluating the influence of CKD mineral and bone disease on renal outcome, especially in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy.

Finally, renal function is the major regulator of the serum Mg level. Dewitte et al. reported a significant negative correlation between CCr and serum total and ionized Mg levels in patients without diabetes but no significant correlation in those with diabetes, which is in agreement with our findings. Although the reason for this difference is uncertain, insulin enhances Mg reabsorption at the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, where ∼55% of the filtered Mg is reabsorbed. Therefore, in patients with diabetes, insulin resistance or deficiency can promote Mg loss at the thick ascending limb, which might compensate for the reduced glomerular filtration. Given the lack of a significant correlation between CCr and serum Mg level in type 2 diabetic nephropathy, CCr may not be a potent confounder of hypomagnesemia for poor renal outcome in this population.

### Significance of serum magnesium as an independent correlative factor on the parathyroid hormone level in uremic patients [^40f801c2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

PTH is a critical factor in mineral homeostasis, and chronic kidney disease mineral and bone metabolism disorder is a very important problem in patients with renal failure. Abnormal levels of PTH, serum phosphate, and calcium influence chronic kidney disease mineral and bone metabolism disorder, but there is little information about the influence of magnesium (Mg) on PTH.

Objective

The aim of this study was to elucidate the correlation between magnesium and PTH levels in uremic patients just prior to beginning hemodialysis (HD) for the first time.

Patients

We enrolled 1231 patients in nine Japanese facilities who had begun HD for end-stage renal disease. We investigated their serum Mg levels and the correlation between intact PTH (iPTH) and the serum Mg levels and other clinical parameters and medications.

Results

The mean serum Mg was 2.2 ± 0.5 mg/dL, and hypermagnesemia was found in 663 patients (53.9%). Divided into two groups according to median iPTH level, the serum Mg levels were significantly higher in patients with low iPTH (2.3 ± 0.5 vs 2.1 ± 0.5, P < .01). Furthermore, divided into two groups according to the Mg level, iPTH levels were lower in patients with high Mg than in patients with normal serum Mg levels (277.9 ± 195.9 pg/mL vs 321.9 ± 203.7 pg/mL, P < .01). In the multiple regression analysis according to the effect of iPTH level, the serum Mg level was an independent variable after adjustment for other factors.

Conclusions

A high serum level of Mg is frequent in uremic patients with end-stage renal disease just prior to beginning HD. In the present set of patients, there was a significant correlation between the serum Mg and iPTH levels. Furthermore, the serum Mg level was an independent factor apart from the other factors regulating iPTH. These results suggest that serum Mg may be one of the factors regulating the serum PTH level in uremic patients.

### Etiology and pathophysiology of hypoparathyroidism: a narrative review [^0af890dc]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic disorders

Children with severe burns can develop hypocalcemia within days after burn injury, irrespective of parenteral Ca supplementation, and urinary Ca excretion is typically elevated. Serum concentrations of PTH are inappropriately low for the blood Ca levels, indicating that children with burns have not only hypocalcemia and hypercalciuria but also hypoparathyroidism. Although these children have severe magnesium (Mg) depletion, replacement with supplemental Mg does not reverse the parathyroid defect, which has been attributed to upregulation of the CASR through an as yet unknown mechanism. An increase in circulating levels of IL-1β and IL-6 have been proposed, as in vitro studies have shown that these cytokines are capable of upregulating the parathyroid gland CASR.

Hypoparathyroidism can also be caused by either hypermagnesemia or hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia is associated with impaired release of PTH from the parathyroid cell, likely through a disturbance in the stimulus-secretion coupling mechanism. Because both Mg and Ca activate the CaSR and reduce PTH synthesis and secretion, albeit with different potencies, elevated levels of extracellular Mg can lead to functional hypoparathyroidism. Hypomagnesemia can also cause PTH resistance and functional hypoparathyroidism. (,–)

Maternal hypercalcemia

Infants exposed in utero to maternal hypercalcemia (eg, in the context of maternal primary hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D disorders, or maternal familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia with a nonaffected fetus) are at risk of suppression of parathyroid function and postnatal hypocalcemia. Additional risks to the developing fetus include intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, and intrauterine fetal death if the hyperparathyroidism in the mother remains untreated.

Idiopathic

Hypoparathyroidism is considered to be idiopathic when extensive evaluation of all potential causes of hypoparathyroidism fail to disclose an etiology. It is conceivable that many patients with early-onset or congenital hypoparathyroidism will have underlying genetic etiologies that may require the application of unbiased molecular genetic technologies, such as whole-exome sequencing or whole-genome sequencing, to diagnose. In contrast, individuals with late-onset hypoparathyroidism may have an underlying autoimmune etiology. In the absence of a clear etiology for hypoparathyroidism, these subjects should be monitored closely for the development of additional disorders.

### Case report: extreme coronary calcifications and hypomagnesemia in a patient with a 17q12 deletion involving HNF1B [^772bfdbd]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Coronary calcification as a possible physiologic sequela of HNF1B deletion

With a coronary arterial calcium (CAC) score of 12,427, the extent of this patient's coronary calcification is unprecedented. While this patient has several cardiovascular risk factors (history of unstable angina, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia), one study found that among individuals in the United States with five or more risk factors for coronary artery disease (obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, or family history), the mean CAC score was 271.5. In another study, the mean CAC score among 92 patients with a history of myocardial infarction was 427.0 ± 516.2. Despite the considerable variability in CAC scores across studies and populations, this patient's CAC score is 1–2 orders of magnitude outside the typical CAC score distribution for both low and high CAD-risk groups. We review three overlapping mechanisms that may link this patient's HNF1B deletion to his extensive vascular calcifications:
Bone-vascular axis dysregulation. The relationship between skeletal and vascular mineralization is known as the bone-vascular axis. A major mechanistic underpinning of the bone-vascular axis is the fact that calcification of bone and vasculature share common regulators, most notably parathyroid hormone (PTH). HNF1B is required for repression of PTH transcription, and HNF1B haploinsufficiency leads to primary hyperparathyroidism. Also, while severe hypomagnesemia potently blocks PTH secretion, moderate hypomagnesemia is a stimulator of PTH. With the exception of his initial presentation of severe magnesium deficiency and subsequent hypocalcemia, this patient's parathyroid physiology while on magnesium supplementation may be best described as primary hyperparathyroidism due to HNF1B deletion, exacerbated by moderate hypomagnesemia. This patient's hyperparathyroidism, osteopenia, and vascular calcifications constitute a clinical triad similar to chronic kidney disease–mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD). CKD-MBD entails a complex pathophysiological model, in which hyperphosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidized lipids all contribute to vascular calcification. Although renal insufficiency is essential to CKD-MBD, the independent contribution of hyperparathyroidism to bone-vascular axis dysregulation is relevant to this case. In animal models, PTH induces bone turnover and arterial calcification, even in the absence of hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, or renal insufficiency. Finally, epidemiologic studies confirm that bone density is inversely correlated with vascular calcification, independent of age, in patients both with and without chronic kidney disease.
Hypomagnesemia and increased calcium crystal precipitation. The association between hypomagnesemia and vascular calcification is well-studied. Magnesium directly inhibits calcium-phosphate crystal formation in vitro, while magnesium supplementation in an animal model for a heritable disorder of vascular calcification prevented mineralization. Large population studies show that magnesium intake in people free of cardiovascular disease was inversely associated with coronary artery calcification, whereas serum magnesium concentrations are inversely associated with CAC both in a general healthy population, as well as in patients with chronic kidney disease. Low magnesium levels may decrease expression of endogenous inhibitors of calcification, notably matrix Gla-protein (MGP) and fetuin-A, which sequester calcium and phosphate ions, act as chaperones for calcium-phosphate complexes, and inhibit crystal nucleation at the extracellular matrix.
Cell-mediated osteogenic activity. Hypomagnesemia and hyperparathyroidism modulate osteogenic activity in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), a major mechanism of arterial calcification, especially in atherosclerosis. In endothelial cells, low magnesium levels increase atherosclerotic signaling: ROS production, NF-kB activation, and cytokine release. Magnesium deficiency also promotes endothelial permeability allowing for invasion of LDL particles, macrophages, and VSMCs, a key initiating step in atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. In VSMCs, magnesium suppresses transcription of potent osteogenic genes, including BMP2, RUNX2, and osteocalcin. Similarly, elevated PTH levels stimulate osteogenic signaling in endothelial cells, including NF-kB-dependent upregulation of BMP2. In VSMCs, hyperparathyroidism ultimately promotes calcification, even though the direct effect of PTH and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) on VSMCs appears to be one of inhibited calcification. It is thought that longstanding hyperparathyroidism causes receptor internalization and antagonism via excess PTH fragments, paradoxically reducing the protective effects of PTH signaling at VSMCs. Furthermore, fetuin-A and MGP, in addition to directly inhibiting calcium crystal formation as discussed above, regulate VSMCs; both hypomagnesemia and hyperparathyroidism decrease fetuin-A and MGP levels, which in turn promote the osteogenic phenotype of VSMCs. Finally, HNF1B may be a transcription factor for SPP1, also known as osteopontin. Osteopontin is a secreted protein with multiple functions, including regulating soft tissue mineralization. Particularly in VSMCs, osteopontin inhibits hydroxyapatite crystal deposition and calcification. Decreased expression of osteopontin due to haploinsufficiency of HNF1B may be another mechanism promoting vascular calcification.

### Hypomagnesemia is associated with new-onset diabetes mellitus following heart transplantation [^acbc8b3e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association between hypomagnesemia and NODAT are complex and have not yet been fully elucidated. It has been suggested that a number of mechanisms may provide the molecular and functional basis for the involvement of magnesium in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, as follows: (1) Magnesium is a co-factor necessary for glucose metabolism in several pathways, including transport between membranes, glucose oxidation, and insulin-mediated tyrosine kinase pathways, and it may therefore be involved in insulin secretion or insulin signaling. Magnesium deficiency has been shown to promote insulin resistance, and magnesium supplementation has been reported to improve both glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in animal and clinical studies in non-transplant patients with diabetes mellitus. In addition, it should be pinpointed that after administration of SGLT2 inhibitors, a raise in serum magnesium concentrations (not coupled with a reduced urinary excretion) is associated with a significant improvement in endothelial function, arterial stiffness and renal resistive index. (2) Common genetic variations in the magnesium-regulating genes TRPM6, SLC41A2, CLDN19, CNNM2, and FXYD2 have been shown to significantly modify the risk of diabetes through s-Mg levels. (3) It is also possible that mitochondrial dysfunction could underlie the association between low s-Mg and NODAT, as both hypomagnesemia and diabetes can result from mitochondrial dysfunction, as found in large pedigree with hypomagnesemia and metabolic syndrome. This association is further enforced by the findings in kidney transplant recipients that tacrolimus can cause secondary mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction.

Before concluding the Discussion, we touch on two findings that are relevant not only to HT patients but also to the general population at large — stroke and calcium metabolism. Prospective studies in large populations have indicated a dose-dependent inverse association between dietary magnesium and stroke incidence, with a recent meta-analysis reporting a 22% lower risk of stroke in people in the highest vs the lowest categories of dietary magnesium intake. Consistent with these findings, we report here a significantly higher rate of cerebrovascular events in patients with low s-Mg. Magnesium depletion has also been associated with multiple biochemical abnormalities, among them bone and calcium metabolism. There is evidence for a suppressive effect of hypomagnesemia on parathyroid hormone secretion and resistance, further supporting the importance and potential clinical implications of managing low-Mg state in HT patients known to suffer frequently from osteoporosis, partially due to prolonged steroid treatment.

### Medical hypoparathyroidism [^bfe9b1f6]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is a metabolic disorder characterized by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and inadequate levels of or function of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The authors review the nonsurgical or medical causes of hypoparathyroidism. The most common of the nonsurgical causes is autoimmune destruction of the parathyroid. Magnesium deficiency or excess can cause a functional hypoparathyroidism. Genetic conditions result in hypoparathyroidism as part of a syndrome or in isolation. Pseudohypoparathyroidism reflects a resistance to PTH. Infiltrative, metastatic, radiation destruction, mineral deposition, or idiopathic are uncommon causes of hypoparathyroidism. This article reviews the causes of hypoparathyroidism and an approach to the evaluation of this condition.

### Magnesium modulates parathyroid hormone secretion and upregulates parathyroid receptor expression at moderately low calcium concentration [^5a701e97]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The present study evaluates the combined effect of changes in Ca and Mg on parathyroid gland function. The work was performed by incubating whole parathyroid glands in Ca concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 mM; the experiments were repeated at different Mg concentrations. Our results show that Mg reduces PTH secretion mainly if serum Ca is somewhat below normal. In addition, Mg upregulates pivotal parathyroid CaR, VDR and FGFRI/Klotho at mRNA and protein levels.

In vivo animal and clinical studies have shown that high Mg concentrations inhibit PTH secretion. Clinical studies on patients on haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis showed that serum Mg was inversely and independently associated with PTH concentrations, even after adjusting for Ca and phosphorus levels. In an attempt to isolate the specific effect of Mg on PTH secretion, in vitro studies were also performed many years ago. However, these were carried out in isolated parathyroid cells that rapidly lose CaR. Thus, it appeared worthy to evaluate this effect in an in vitro model of intact parathyroid glands as this allows the elucidation of a direct effect of phosphorus on PTH secretion, which had been elusive in isolated parathyroid cells.

Materials and Methods

Patients and study design

Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria have been reported by Mannstadt et al. and Clarke et al. Briefly, the study enrolled patients between 18 and 85 years old with chronic hypoparathyroidism based on hypocalcemia and documented serum PTH levels below the lower limit of the normal range. Patients with known or suspected mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor gene were excluded. The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki, the protocol was approved by the institutional review boards, and all study participants provided written informed consent.

After enrollment, patients underwent an optimization period lasting 2 to 16 weeks, during which active vitamin D (calcitriol or alfacalcidol) and calcium doses were adjusted to achieve albumin-corrected serum calcium levels between 7.5 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L) and the upper limit of normal, but ideally within a target range of 8.0 to 9.0 mg/dL (2.0 to 2.2 mmol/L). Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were optimized to be between 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and 100 ng/mL (250 nmol/L), and magnesium deficiency [defined as values < 1.3 mEq/L (0.7 mmol/L)] was corrected.

A 57-year-old man presenting with profound visual hallucinations was found to have severe hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia with a normal level of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Magnesium is essential to the release of PTH so the suspected pathophysiology was thought to be: low Mg → inappropriately low PTH → low Ca. He commenced supplementation and his symptoms resolved. Causes of hypomagnesaemia are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is essential for calcium (Ca) homeostasis and the maintenance of normal mineral metabolism. Parathyroid cells have cell-surface calcium-sensing receptors (CaRs), which enable them to respond to changes in extracellular Ca; thus, even small changes in extracellular Ca induce rapid changes in PTH secretion. Calcitriol and FGF23 also decrease parathyroid function through their specific parathyroid cell receptors: the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the FGFR-Klotho receptor system, respectively. In vivo and in vitro studies have also shown a direct effect of phosphate on PTH synthesis and secretion, although a specific cell sensor for phosphate has not been identified, yet.

The activation of the CaR results in Gq/11-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol-speciﬁc phospholipase C, cytosolic Ca increase, protein kinase C (PKC) activation and triggering of the PLA 2 -AA-MAPKase pathway that regulates PTH synthesis and other essential proteins such as CaR, VDR, Klotho and FGFR1.

Although Ca is the main CaR agonist, other divalent and trivalent cations are also able to activate the CaR. For example, an increase in extracellular magnesium (Mg) inhibits PTH secretion and reduces agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation from parathyroid cells. In dialysis patients, high serum Mg concentrations have been associated with low serum PTH levels. This inverse relationship between extracellular levels of Mg and PTH led to the notion of an inhibitory effect of Mg on PTH secretion in these patients. However, the PTH secretory response to changes in extracellular Mg concentration has not been formally evaluated in patients.

The interest on Mg has grown since clinical studies have shown the efficacy of Mg-containing phosphate binders, and some concern has arisen related to the potential effect of a moderate increase in serum Mg on PTH secretion. In patients with normal serum Ca concentration and controlled PTH levels, it is not clear whether an increase in Mg may elicit an over suppression of PTH. Therefore, one specific question that should be addressed is whether changes in serum Mg have the same impact on PTH secretion when parathyroid cells are exposed to low, normal or high serum Ca concentrations.

The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the direct effect of Mg on the regulation of the parathyroid function using intact rat parathyroid glands. Specifically, the present work investigates the effect of Mg at different Ca concentrations on PTH secretion and on the expression of the parathyroid cell receptors CaR, VDR and FGFR1/Klotho.

Hypoparathyroidism

HypoPTH is a rare disorder characterized by deficient production or biological activity of PTH that results in hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. The prevalence of HypoPTH is estimated to be 37/100 000 habitants per year in the United States. HypoPTH may be an acquired or inherited condition, with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism being the most common form. Neck surgery is responsible for about 75% of HypoPTH cases. The next most frequent cause is immunity dysregulation, either affecting only parathyroid glands or multiple endocrine glands (autoimmune polyglandular syndromes). Other causes include infiltrative diseases and rare genetic disorders. However, it is important to exclude magnesium disorders early in our differential diagnosis process, as both hypo- and hypermagnesemia can lead to functional HypoPTH. The diagnosis is based on the finding of low ionized or corrected for albumin calcium levels, accompanied by undetectable, low, or inappropriately normal PTH levels. Under normal circumstances, low calcium levels trigger the production and excretion of PTH from parathyroid glands, via activation of CaSRs. PTH deficiency inhibits mobilization of calcium from bone, reabsorption of calcium from kidneys, and absorption of calcium from gastrointestinal tract through 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis. As a result, hypocalcemia is established, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is decreased because PTH can't stimulate 1-a hydroxylase, phosphate levels rise because of the lack of phosphaturic action of PTH, and the fraction of filtered calcium at the glomerulus is inappropriately increased.

Clinical presentation of HypoPTH usually includes neuromuscular signs and symptoms resulting from hypocalcemia, ranging from mild perioral numbness, paresthesias in the extremities, muscle cramps, and QT interval prolongation, to severe manifestations of arrhythmias, heart failure, seizures, and laryngospasm. However, some patients, especially those with genetic forms of HypoPTH, may be asymptomatic, thus they may be diagnosed due to routine biochemical screening or due to concomitant findings. Typical facial features, chronic candidiasis, or other autoimmune endocrinopathies may direct the diagnosis to DiGeorge or APECED (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy and candidiasis with ectodermal dystrophy syndrome), respectively. Absent or low levels of PTH result in reduced bone turnover and subsequent rise of BMD at both cortical and trabecular sites. However, bone disease derives from increased bone mineralization and altered skeletal microarchitecture. Whether these alterations relate to an increased fracture risk remains to be clarified.

### Possible role for rare TRPM7 variants in patients with hypomagnesaemia with secondary hypocalcaemia [^ef869d08]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hypomagnesaemia with secondary hypocalcaemia [HSH, (Mendelian Inheritance in Man #602014)] is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a very low serum magnesium (Mg 2+) concentration (< 0.3 mmol/L). Hypocalcaemia is a secondary effect of hypomagnesaemia as a consequence of parathyroid failure or parathyroid hormone (PTH) resistance. Patients often present during the newborn period with severe seizures, which can result in severe neurological damage if left untreated.

In 2002, variants in TRPM6 were identified to be causative for HSH. TRPM6 encodes a non-selective divalent cation channel, transient receptor potential melastatin type 6 (TRPM6), with high permeability for Mg 2+. A recent study shows that TRPM6 functions in tetramers with its close homologue TRPM7 and that this interaction is essential for TRPM6 activity. Both channels are sensitive to intracellular Mg 2+ and Mg-ATP levels and have differential concentration-dependent channel inhibition. The activity of TRPM6/TRPM7 tetramers is, therefore, regulated by the relative expression of TRPM6 and TRPM7 subunits. TRPM6 decreases the Mg-adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-induced inhibition of TRPM7 and thereby increases Mg 2+ transport activity.

Whereas TRPM7 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, TRPM6 is exclusively located in epithelia, with the highest expression in the colon and kidney. Within the kidney, TRPM6/TRPM7 tetramers locate in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) segment of the nephron, where they are believed to function as tetramers on the apical membrane. Urinary Mg 2+ excretion is ultimately determined in the DCT since no Mg 2+ reabsorption takes place beyond this segment. As a consequence, impaired Mg 2+ transport via TRPM6/TRPM7 in the DCT inevitably results in renal Mg 2+ wasting and hypomagnesaemia.

The pathophysiology of HSH comprises a primary defect in intestinal Mg 2+ uptake and additional renal Mg 2+ wasting. During phases of severe hypomagnesaemia, the renal wasting is not detectable. It can, however, be evidenced after normalization of plasmatic levels (Mg 2+ loading test). Here we report HSH in two families: one with an autosomal inheritance pattern and one de novo. Using whole exome sequencing (WES), we identified rare variants in TRPM7 that were functionally evaluated using patch clamp electrophysiology and biochemical analyses.

### PTH (1–84) replacement therapy in hypoparathyroidism: a randomized controlled trial on pharmacokinetic and dynamic effects after 6 months of treatment [^3a0f4994]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2013). Low credibility.

Untreated, hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) is a state of hypocalcemia with inappropriately low plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and hyperphosphatemia. PTH administration normalizes plasma calcium and phosphate levels and reduces the doses of calcium and active vitamin D analogues needed. To develop an evidence-based clinical algorithm to monitor hypoPT patients treated with recombinant human PTH (rhPTH[1–84]) injected subcutaneously in the thigh, we performed a 24-hour monitoring study of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects in a group of 38 patients who had completed a 6-month randomized study on effects of treatment with a fixed rhPTH(1–84) dose of 100µg/d or similar placebo as an add-on to conventional treatment. PTH levels rose immediately, reaching a median peak level of 26.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 20.1–42.5) pmol/L 15 minutes following injection. Thereafter, levels gradually decreased until reaching predosing levels after 16 hours, with a plasma half-life of 2.2 (1.7–2.5) hours. rhPTH(1–84) changed the diurnal rhythms of ionized calcium levels and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2 D) levels, with rising levels following injection. Ionized calcium peaked after 7.0 (5.0–10.0) hours. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia was present in 71% of the rhPTH(1–84)-treated patients. Compared with placebo, 24-hour urinary calcium, phosphate, and magnesium did not change, although the diurnal variation in renal excretion rates changed significantly in response to treatment. In conclusion, as a safety precaution, we recommend occasionally measuring calcium levels at approximately 7 hours after administration in order to reveal episodes of hypercalcemia. A 100-µg daily dose of rhPTH(1–84) appears to be too high in some patients, suggesting a need for a device allowing for individual dose adjustments.

### Biochemical markers of bone fragility in patients with diabetes. A narrative review by the IOF and the ECTS [^9999daab]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Calciotropic hormones

Alterations in the calcium-sensing-vitamin-D–PTH axis have been reported both in T1DM and T2DM. Osmotic diuresis due to glycosuria may induce a state of enhanced excretion of calcium and magnesium through the tight coupling of calcium and magnesium handling at the medullary thick ascending loop, resulting in a negative calcium and magnesium balance. It has been suggested that impaired calcium-sensing, possibly due to hypomagnesemia, may cause a state of functional hypoparathyroidism, potentially contributing to low bone remodeling.

In patients with T1DM, serum mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level, an index of vitamin D nutritional status, was lower, and mean PTH level higher, or similar, compared to controls. In a study of 250 patients with T1DM and 250 age- and sex-matched controls, PTH levels were higher in patients than controls, and there was a significant negative correlation between serum 25(OH)D and HbA 1c levels. Some evidence suggests that hyperparathyroidism has an adverse effect on glucose metabolism. Conversely, there was no difference in mean serum 25(OH)D and PTH levels between tertiles of HbA 1c in 94 adult patients with long-standing T1DM. The aforementioned studies did not provide serum creatinine levels as a potential cofounder of high PTH, although individuals with CKD were excluded.

### Parathyroid hormone is a plausible mediator for the metabolic syndrome in the morbidly obese: a cross-sectional study [^f9ad39e1]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The metabolic syndrome (MS) is a clustering of risk factors including abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and elevated blood pressure, and it has an increased incidence among the obese part of the population; a proportion which is steadily growing. Having the MS is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. A better understanding the possible biological mechanisms related to the occurrence of MS is therefore of major interest.

Age and diabetes are well-known to be associated with MS. A number of studies indicate that MS is also related to various biomarkers such as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (vit D), magnesium and calcium. Elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) have been reported together with MS. In studies focusing on other variables, it has been debated whether these variables should be adjusted for PTH in the analyses. Indeed, the reported effects of PTH are contradictory. A recent publication on morbidly obese subjects found a relationship between MS and PTH, which is in contrast with a previous study.

Establishing the role of PTH in relation to MS is complicated by the fact that several of the proposed predictors of MS are also known to be associated with PTH. The synthesis and secretion of PTH is tightly regulated by serum levels of calcium and phosphate, but also serum concentrations of vit D and magnesium influence PTH levels, and a statistically significant negative correlation between vit D and PTH has been reported. Studies further indicate that gender differences should be taken into account; increasing PTH levels have been reported to be associated with MS in older men, but not in women and younger men.

The mechanisms explaining the association between MS and various biomarkers are not well understood, and focusing solely on direct effects might overlook clinically interesting indirect effects. The above references indicate that PTH might be a mediator for MS, highlighting the need for analytical approaches that include both direct and indirect effects.

The aim of this study was to explore whether PTH might have a mediating role in the association between MS and a series of possible explanatory variables in morbidly obese patients. Dependencies between MS and a series of variables suggested in the literature were depicted in a path diagram. Effect sizes were estimated by path analysis, a regression technique where several multiple regression models are combined, allowing variables to be both an outcome and an explanatory variable in the same model.

Parathyroid Dysfunction

Hypoparathyroidism is not a common finding across many PMDs (Table 5); however, it is consistently reported in Kearns-Sayre syndrome resulting from SLSMDs and can even be the presenting feature, with reports of tetanic hypocalcemia. Hypomagnesemia, a common accompanying and possible driving feature of hypoparathyroidism, is present in some children but not others and can be related to Gitelman-type renal tubular dysfunction with inappropriate magnesuria. It has also been postulated that hypomagnesemia may drive the hypoparathyroidism through parathyroid hormone suppression; however, magnesium supplementation does not reverse the biochemical picture. Moreover, serum phosphate is often noted to be elevated, rather than the low-normal picture seen in magnesium deficiency–induced hypoparathyroidism. The hypothesis that atrophy of parathyroid glands may underpin hypoparathyroidism is supported in autopsy reports of absent parathyroid glands but is harder to explain in autopsies where even one histologically normal parathyroid gland remains. Case reports reflect an increased incidence of other endocrine abnormalities in Kearns-Sayre syndrome when hypoparathyroidism is present; however, the bias of historically more robust endocrine investigations in those with hypoparathyroidism is difficult to account for, as acknowledged in a 1992 case review and literature survey. Despite this, several reports link hypoparathyroidism in Kearns-Sayre syndrome to diabetes mellitus and other multisystem disease, suggesting a propensity to be associated with a more severe clinical picture. The pathogenic reasons behind this are unclear, with a high parathyroid heteroplasmic threshold being a possible cause. Autoimmune etiology has not been proven.

Mitochondrial hypoparathyroidism and associated gene defects

Thyroid Dysfunction

While there have been occasional case reports documenting hypothyroidism in patients with PMD, particularly in those with SLSMDs, for example in patients with Kearns-Sayre syndrome, there is insufficient evidence to support a causal association. A 2020 study concluded that the prevalence of hypothyroidism was no higher than the population average in a North American PMD cohort. Another obvious confounding factor is the possibility of the presence of undetected subclinical or mild clinical hypothyroidism, leading to under-reporting. Conversely, screening for thyroid dysfunction in patients with known molecular diagnoses of PMD could lead to artificially inflating the frequency of hypothyroidism, compared to an unscreened general population.

### Proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis after gastric bypass does not cause hypomagnesemia [^1ed4646d]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In this retrospective study of 931 patients on prophylactic PPI after RYGB, we found no case of hypomagnesemia that was evidently related to the PPI use. This might be explained by the absence of other risk factors. Bariatric patients are relatively young, experience significant improvement in diabetes mellitus after surgery, and often discontinue the use of diuretics because of normalized blood pressure. Furthermore, the mean serum magnesium level is known to increase after RYGB, possibly due to improved insulin sensitivity or increased parathyroid hormone levels.

We conclude that the risk of hypomagnesemia during 1 year of prophylactic PPI use after RYGB is minimal and laboratory screening is probably not necessary.

### Magnesium modulates parathyroid hormone secretion and upregulates parathyroid receptor expression at moderately low calcium concentration [^6142f175]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

In the present study, we found that Mg reduced PTH secretion in an in vitro model of intact rat parathyroid glands. This is in accordance with previous studies in dispersed human and bovine parathyroid cells. However, we found that high Mg was able to reduce PTH only when parathyroid glands were exposed to moderately low Ca concentrations. The PTH–Ca curves obtained with progressively increasing Mg concentrations (from 0.5 to 5 mM) were consistently shifted to the left; thus, there was a decrease in the set point of Ca for PTH secretion. With normal to high Ca concentrations, only an extremely high Mg concentration of 5.0 mM was able to decrease PTH secretion; the effect of lower Mg concentrations was minor or absent. However, at 1 mM Ca (8 mg/dL total Ca), a serum concentration at the lower end in dialysis patients, the inhibitory effect of a Mg concentration of 2.0 mM was clearly evidenced. Interestingly, at 0.8 mM Ca the inhibitory effect of Mg was not observed anymore. It appears that in the setting of marked low calcium concentration, the parathyroid glands are strongly stimulated, so that only very high doses of Mg are able to decrease PTH secretion. In the general dialysis population, low Ca concentration is not the major concern; rather high Ca concentrations have been described to be associated with negative outcomes. But at high Ca concentrations, high Mg concentrations do not seem to pose a problem according to our experiments.

### Magnesium modulates parathyroid hormone secretion and upregulates parathyroid receptor expression at moderately low calcium concentration [^e0626ac3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

The addition of Mg to the medium reduced PTH secretion, but the degree of inhibition varied according to the Ca concentration. This is shown in Figure 1 C, which depicts the data in a different way so that differences become more clearly visible. At the lowest Ca concentration (0.8 mM) with normal 0.5 mM Mg, maximal PTH secretion was observed; PTH increased to more than twice as with normal 1.25 mM Ca and 0.5 mM Mg. Mg concentrations of 1.0 and 2.0 mM had no significant effect on PTH secretion. Only an extremely high Mg concentration of 5.0 mM produced a significant 62% decrease in PTH secretion to values slightly lower than the PTH observed with normal Ca and Mg of 0.5 mM. At a Ca concentration of 1.0 mM with 0.5 mM Mg, PTH secretion was almost twice as high as with normal Ca. Here, the addition of both Mg 2.0 and 5.0 mM significantly decreased PTH secretion by 38 and 68%, respectively, to reach levels that were 120 and 60% of the PTH observed with normal Ca and Mg of 0.5 mM (Figure 1 C); Mg 1.0 mM did not significantly reduce PTH secretion in this setting. At a normal 1.2 mM Ca concentration, Mg concentrations of 1.0 mM and 2.0 mM did not reduce PTH secretion significantly. Only an extremely high Mg concentration (5.0 mM) produced a significant 54% reduction in PTH secretion to levels that were 56% of that with normal Ca and Mg of 0.5 mM. Finally, when parathyroid glands were incubated with high Ca (1.5 mM), only the concentration of 5.0 mM Mg was able to decrease PTH secretion (by 37%) to levels that were 43% of normal Ca and 0.5 mM Mg, while no effect was detected with Mg 1.0 and 2.0 mM (Figure 1 C).

### Pathophysiology of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium dysregulation in chronic kidney disease [^bd5096af]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

Calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium homeostasis is altered in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypermagnesemia are not seen until advanced CKD because adaptations develop. Increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion maintains serum calcium normal by increasing calcium efflux from bone, renal calcium reabsorption, and phosphate excretion. Similarly, renal phosphate excretion in CKD is maintained by increased secretion of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and PTH. However, the phosphaturic effect of FGF23 is reduced by downregulation of its cofactor Klotho necessary for binding FGF23 to FGF receptors. Intestinal phosphate absorption is diminished in CKD due in part to reduced levels of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D. Unlike calcium and phosphorus, magnesium is not regulated by a hormone, but fractional excretion of magnesium increases as CKD progresses. As 60–70% of magnesium is reabsorbed in the thick ascending limb of Henle, activation of the calcium-sensing receptor by magnesium may facilitate magnesium excretion in CKD. Modification of the TRPM6 channel in the distal tubule may also have a role. Besides abnormal bone morphology and vascular calcification, abnormalities in mineral homeostasis are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, increased mortality and progression of CKD.

### Efficacy and safety of parathyroid hormone replacement with transCon PTH in hypoparathyroidism: 26-week results from the phase 3 paTHway trial [^91ec35f7]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Participants

Eligible participants included men and nonpregnant women (≥ 18 years of age) with chronic hypoparathyroidism of postsurgical, autoimmune, genetic, or idiopathic etiologies for a duration of at least 26 weeks. Participants must have been treated with calcitriol ≥ 0.5 μg/d or alfacalcidol ≥ 1.0 μg/d in addition to elemental calcium ≥ 800 mg/d for at least 12 weeks before screening. Stable doses of conventional therapy (ie, active vitamin D and calcium) were required for at least 5 weeks before screening, not precluding occasional (≤ 2/week) pro re nata (PRN, as needed) doses of calcium and/or active vitamin D. To ensure safety for those who might be randomized to the placebo arm, participants were required to achieve an albumin‐adjusted or ionized serum calcium within the normal range or slightly below the normal range (albumin‐adjusted serum calcium 7.8–10.6 mg/dL [1.95–2.64 mmol/L] or ionized serum calcium 4.40–5.29 mg/dL [1.10–1.32 mmol/L]), 25(OH) vitamin D levels 20–80 ng/mL (49–200 nmol/L), and magnesium levels ≥ 1.3 mg/dL (0.53 mmol/L), as is currently the goal of conventional treatment. Urinary calcium excretion ≥ 125 mg/24 h and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 was required for enrollment. The diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism was confirmed by the presence of persistent hypocalcemia in the setting of inappropriately low serum PTH levels. Low PTH levels were defined as at or below the median value of the reference range at the performing laboratory. Individuals with impaired responsiveness to PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism) or any disease that might affect calcium metabolism, calcium × phosphate homeostasis, or PTH levels other than hypoparathyroidism were excluded. Thiazide diuretic use was not allowed within 4 weeks before the 24‐hour urine collection before visit 1, and the use of PTH analogs was not allowed within 4 weeks of screening. Eligible participants could not have used other drugs known to influence calcium and bone metabolism (except for active vitamin D analogs and elemental calcium) within 12 weeks before screening or osteoporosis therapies known to influence calcium and bone metabolism (ie, bisphosphonate) within 2 years before screening. The use of loop diuretics, phosphate binders, digoxin, lithium, methotrexate, biotin > 30 μg/d, and systemic corticosteroids (other than as replacement therapy) were not permitted during the trial. All participants provided signed informed consent before treatment initiation.

### Parathyroid hormone is a plausible mediator for the metabolic syndrome in the morbidly obese: a cross-sectional study [^e829ca16]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The results of our study, combining current biological concepts and empirical data, suggest that PTH is a plausible mediator in the association between MS and various demographic variables and biomarkers, including vit D, phosphate and magnesium, in morbidly obese individuals. Due to significant gender differences, in our data this mediating role was only significant for women. Mechanisms like metabolic pathways are complex, and graphical models like the current can be useful tools.

### Hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, management and emerging therapies [^5b27264e]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion or action and results in hypocalcaemia, and can lead to hyperphosphataemia and hypercalciuria. Most cases of hypoparathyroidism occur as a complication of surgery, with the remainder due to causes including autoimmune disease, genetic causes, infiltrative diseases, mineral deposition or due to abnormalities in serum levels of magnesium. Hypoparathyroidism can cause multisystem disease, with long-term complications resulting from ectopic calcification as well as renal complications with nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and renal impairment in addition to respiratory, cardiac or neurological manifestations. Conventional therapy consists of oral calcium salts and active vitamin D but it has limitations, including fluctuations in serum levels of calcium and a high pill burden, and can increase the risk of long-term complications. By contrast, PTH replacement therapy can effectively achieve normal serum levels of calcium, and lower serum levels of phosphate. The long-acting PTH analogue, palopegteriparatide, has been shown to normalize urine levels of calcium. In addition, PTH replacement therapy reduces the pill burden. Palopegteriparatide is also associated with improved quality of life in comparison to conventional therapy. This Review summarizes current recommendations regarding the pathophysiology, evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and also references the 2022 international hypoparathyroidism guidelines. Palopegteriparatide has now been approved as PTH replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism. Emerging therapies will also be presented in this Review.

### Parathyroid disorders… [^00d0db16]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

The parathyroid glands typically lie adjacent to the thyroid gland, although they are occasionally located in the superior mediastinum. 2 Conversely, high calcium levels drive PTH suppression, with hypermagnesemia and 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D also inhibiting the production and release of PTH. Parathyroid disorders can be primary or secondary. 1, 2, 4–6 Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, a paraneoplastic syndrome mediated by PTH-related peptide, should be considered in patients with low PTH levels, rapid onset of symptoms, and other signs and symptoms of malignancy. It is most often associated with squamous cell carcinoma and solid tumors of the lung, breast, esophagus, skin, cervix, and kidney. 4 Vitamin D deficiency is the most common cause of hypocalcemia.
5. Hyperparathyroidism PRIMARY Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common condition and the most common cause of hyperparathyroidism and mild hypercalcemia.

1, 13 In primary hyperparathyroidism, calcium levels are usually elevated without appropriate suppression of PTH levels, which can be normal or high. 13 However, in normocalcemic cases, calcium levels can be normal with elevated PTH levels, which may be encountered incidentally when screening for bone and renal disorders. In nations with readily accessible laboratory services, primary hyperparathyroidism is most often identified in asymptomatic individuals as an incidental finding of hypercalcemia on routine laboratory testing. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder that presents with abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood, low urinary calcium excretion, and normal or slightly elevated PTH levels. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia generally does not require treatment, including surgery.

All patients should be encouraged to maintain adequate hydration to reduce the risk of nephrolithiasis, maintain adequate physical activity to minimize bone resorption, and avoid medications that increase hypercalcemia. Maintaining adequate dietary calcium intake and vitamin D intake to keep 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at 20 or 30 ng per mL or higher helps avoid further increases in PTH level.

### Magnesium supplementation: a consideration in dialysis patients [^a564de3b]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Even though disorders of magnesium (Mg) balance are common in dialyzed patients, this cation is often neglected. Many factors interfere with serum magnesium including diet, medications (eg, antacids or phosphate binders), and the dialysis prescription. Mg supplementation may help reduce serum phosphate concentration, PTH, and interfere with vascular calcification and bone mineralization. It could also decrease the all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities, although the results of current studies are conflicting. As with many other variables that influence hard endpoints in nephrology, additional research directly targeting the role of Mg supplementation in dialyzed patients are required. Nevertheless, a current risk/benefit assessment suggests that supplementation of Mg targeting high normal serum levels may represent a plausible option to improve the outcome of dialysis patients.

### A case series of proton pump inhibitor-induced hypomagnesemia [^77f61a7a]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-induced hypomagnesemia has been recognized since 2006. Our aim was to further characterize the clinical consequences and possible mechanisms of this electrolyte disorder using 4 cases. Two men (aged 63 and 81 years) and 2 women (aged 73 and 62 years) had been using a PPI (esomeprazole, pantoprazole, omeprazole, and rabeprazole, 20–40 mg) for 1–13 years. They developed severe hypomagnesemia (magnesium, 0.30 ± 0.28 mEq/L; reference, 1.40–2.10 mEq/L) with hypocalcemia (calcium, 6.4 ± 1.8 mg/dL), relative hypoparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone, 43 ± 6 pg/mL), and extremely low urinary calcium and magnesium excretion. One patient was admitted with postanoxic encephalopathy after a collapse likely caused by arrhythmia. The others had electrocardiogram abnormalities (prolonged QT interval, ST depression, and U waves). Concomitant hypokalemia (potassium, 2.8 ± 0.1 mEq/L) was considered the trigger for these arrhythmias. Hypomagnesemia-induced kaliuresis (potassium excretion, 65 ± 24 mEq/L) was identified as the cause of hypokalemia. This series of PPI-induced hypomagnesemia shows that this is a generic effect. It also indicates that hypomagnesemia may occur within 1 year of PPI therapy initiation and can have serious clinical consequences, likely triggered by the associated hypokalemia. A high index of suspicion is required in PPI users for unexplained hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, or associated symptoms.

### Association between hypomagnesemia and coagulopathy in sepsis: a retrospective observational study [^6c33bbc3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Magnesium deficiency has been implicated in electrolyte disturbances such as hypocalcemia. Ionized calcium (factor IV) anchors the side chains of coagulation factors to the phospholipids of the platelet membrane and plays an important role in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Decreased ionized calcium is common in sepsis. It is hypothesized that sepsis causes the impaired secretion of parathyroid hormone, increases the organ resistance to parathyroid hormone or promotes influx from the blood to tissues. However, it is not known whether hypocalcemia impairs coagulation function or sepsis-induced coagulopathy causes hypocalcemia as the result of serum calcium consumption. Although the exact mechanism of magnesium-calcium interaction is unknown, hypomagnesemia generally impairs the secretion of parathyroid hormone or increases resistance to parathyroid hormone, leading to hypocalcemia. Additionally, we investigated the association between serum ionized calcium and coagulation. Our study showed that patients with hypomagnesemia had low ionized calcium concentrations (Table 1) and 574 patients (76.2%) had hypocalcemia (normal range: 1.12 to 1.32 mmol/L) and low ionized calcium concentrations that tended to be associated with abnormal coagulation function (Additional file 11). Thus, the effects of magnesium on coagulopathy may be mediated partly through calcium, as well as through inflammation. Additionally, a previous study reported that serum zinc level was associated with sepsis-induced coagulopathy. Magnesium and zinc might have deep crosstalk. Further research is required to clarify the mechanism of magnesium on coagulation function with a particular focus on the interaction between magnesium, calcium, and between magnesium and trace element.

### Magnesium modulates parathyroid hormone secretion and upregulates parathyroid receptor expression at moderately low calcium concentration [^87e23320]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The interest on magnesium (Mg) has grown since clinical studies have shown the efficacy of Mg-containing phosphate binders. However, some concern has arisen for the potential effect of increased serum Mg on parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. Our objective was to evaluate the direct effect of Mg in the regulation of the parathyroid function; specifically, PTH secretion and the expression of parathyroid cell receptors: CaR, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and FGFR1/Klotho.

Methods

The work was performed in vitro by incubating intact rat parathyroid glands in different calcium (Ca) and Mg concentrations.

Results

Increasing Mg concentrations from 0.5 to 2 mM produced a left shift of PTH–Ca curves. With Mg 5 mM, the secretory response was practically abolished. Mg was able to reduce PTH only if parathyroid glands were exposed to moderately low Ca concentrations; with normal–high Ca concentrations, the effect of Mg on PTH inhibition was minor or absent. After 6-h incubation at a Ca concentration of 1.0 mM, the expression of parathyroid CaR, VDR, FGFR1 and Klotho (at mRNA and protein levels) was increased with a Mg concentration of 2.0 when compared with 0.5 mM.

Conclusions

Mg reduces PTH secretion mainly when a moderate low calcium concentration is present; Mg also modulates parathyroid glands function through upregulation of the key cellular receptors CaR, VDR and FGF23/Klotho system.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism [^632016e3]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a rare disorder characterized by hypocalcemia in the presence of a low or inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone level. HypoPT is most commonly seen after neck surgery, which accounts for approximately 75% of cases, whereas approximately 25% have HypoPT due to nonsurgical causes. In both groups of patients, conventional therapy includes calcium and active vitamin D analogue therapy aiming to maintain serum calcium concentration in the low normal or just below the normal reference range and normalize serum phosphorus, magnesium concentrations, and urine calcium levels. The limitations of conventional therapy include wide fluctuations in serum calcium, high pill burden, poor quality of life, and renal complications. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) replacement therapy may improve the biochemical profile in those in whom conventional therapy proves unsatisfactory. Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature, the panel made a graded recommendation suggesting conventional therapy as first line therapy rather than administration of PTH (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). When conventional therapy is deemed unsatisfactory, the panel considers use of PTH. Because pregnancy and lactation are associated with changes in calcium homeostasis, close monitoring is required during these periods with appropriate adjustment of calcium and active vitamin D analogue therapy to ensure that serum calcium remains in the mid to low normal reference range in order to avoid maternal and fetal complications. Emerging therapies include molecules with prolonged PTH action as well as different mechanisms of action that may significantly enhance drug efficacy and safety. © 2022 The Authors.

### The EANM practice guidelines for parathyroid imaging [^183e9df4]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary hyperparathyroidism is an endocrine disorder caused by one or more hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands. The suspicion of pHPT is typically raised by the detection of hypercalcemia and/or its associated symptoms. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) serum concentration is elevated, or within normal limits but inappropriate considering the presence of hypercalcemia. A rare type of pHPT is normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism presenting with normal serum calcium levels but an elevated PTH concentration.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrine disease, affecting women 2–3 times more often than men. It is caused by the hyperfunction of one or more parathyroid glands, which are overproducing PTH. Hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands are solitary adenomas in the majority of cases. Approximately 15–20% of cases are caused by multiglandular disease (MGD), i.e. multiple adenomas or hyperplasia, while parathyroid carcinoma accounts for less than 1% of cases. The majority of pHPT cases (95%) occur sporadically, but approximately 5% are part of hereditary syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1, 2, and 4 (MEN-1, MEN-2, and MEN-4) and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, or as part of non-syndromic familial pHPT.

Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, a potential differential diagnosis to pHPT, has to be recognized as it usually does not require surgery.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder characterized by increased serum PTH levels due to parathyroid gland hyperplasia, triggered by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, or decreased serum vitamin D concentration. The most common causes of sHPT are vitamin D deficiency and chronic renal disease. Sometimes pHPT and vitamin D deficiency occur simultaneously, which results in decreased or normal serum calcium levels. Rarer causes are long-term treatment with lithium or magnesium, intestinal malabsorption or malnutrition, or sunitinib treatment.

The therapy of sHPT depends on the primary cause. In the case of renal HPT, therapy mainly consists of a restriction of dietary intake together with medical treatment with calcimimetics, vitamin D analogues, and phosphorus binders. Still, parathyroidectomy is required in patients with renal sHPT refractory to medical treatment, i.e. in approximately 15% of patients after 10 years and 38% of patients after 20 years of renal dialysis therapy.

Resistance to PTH

In patients with PHP1A, resistance to PTH is usually absent at birth and evolves over life (from 0.2 years to 22 years), while the clinical manifestations typically occur later. These data suggest that PTH resistance begins in early childhood, and the resultant changes in serum levels of calcium and phosphorus develop gradually, at some point during adulthood. The first biochemical abnormalities to become apparent are elevated serum levels of PTH and elevated serum levels of phosphorus, followed by hypocalcaemia. When hypocalcaemia is present, urine levels of calcium are low, whereas calcitriol levels might be either low or normal. An interval of up to 4.5 years usually occurs between the start of the elevation in levels of PTH and phosphorus and onset of hypocalcaemia.

Patients with PHP1B might show variable degrees of PTH-resistant hypocalcaemia or normocalcaemia, despite identical epigenetic changes involving transcription start site (TSS)–differentially methylated region (DMR) at exon A/B of GNAS (GNAS A/B :TSS-DMR). Long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism with chronic hypocalcaemia and calcitriol deficiency has been associated with tertiary hyperparathyroidism in these patients. Chronically elevated levels of PTH might also lead to bone resorption and demineralization that resemble the bone changes seen in rickets in children with irregular and widened metaphyses, Madelung-like deformity or primary hyperparathyroidism, including brown tumours (a bone lesion that can occur when osteoclast activity due to hyperparathyroidism is excessive).

Resistance to PTH is also present in patients with mutations in PRKAR1A; however, hypocalcaemia has not been documented in these patients yet. Patients with PDE4D mutations usually display normal levels of PTH, except in the context of calcifediol deficiency.

Recommendations

1.7. The definition of PTH resistance is as follows:
The association of hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia and elevated serum levels of PTH in the absence of vitamin D deficiency and when magnesium levels and renal function are normal.
PTH resistance in the context of PHP and related disorders should be suspected when PTH is at, or above, the upper limit of normal, in the presence of normal calcifediol levels and elevated serum levels of phosphorus, even in the absence of overt hypocalcaemia.

PTH resistance and consequent changes in serum levels of calcium, phosphorus and PTH can be variable, and repeated testing might be required (A+++).

### Parathyroid hormone is a plausible mediator for the metabolic syndrome in the morbidly obese: a cross-sectional study [^9b658adb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The biological mechanisms in the association between the metabolic syndrome (MS) and various biomarkers, such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D (vit D) and magnesium, are not fully understood. Several of the proposed predictors of MS are also possible predictors of parathyroid hormone (PTH). We aimed to explore whether PTH is a possible mediator between MS and various possible explanatory variables in morbidly obese patients.

Methods

Fasting serum levels of PTH, vit D and magnesium were assessed in a cross-sectional study of 1,017 consecutive morbidly obese patients (68% women). Dependencies between MS and a total of seven possible explanatory variables as suggested in the literature, including PTH, vit D and magnesium, were specified in a path diagram, including both direct and indirect effects. Possible gender differences were also included. Effects were estimated using Bayesian path analysis, a multivariable regression technique, and expressed using standardized regression coefficients.

Results

Sixty-eight percent of the patients had MS. In addition to type 2 diabetes and age, both PTH and serum phosphate had significant direct effects on MS; 0.36 (95% Credibility Interval (CrI) [0.15, 0.57]) and 0.28 (95% CrI [0.10,0.47]), respectively. However, due to significant gender differences, an increase in either PTH or phosphate corresponded to an increased OR for MS in women only. All proposed predictors of MS had significant direct effects on PTH, with vit D and phosphate the strongest; -0.27 (95% CrI [-0.33,-0.21]) and -0.26 (95% CrI [-0.32,-0.20]), respectively. Though neither vit D nor magnesium had significant direct effects on MS, for women they both affected MS indirectly, due to the strong direct effect of PTH on MS. For phosphate, the indirect effect on MS, mediated through serum calcium and PTH, had opposite sign than the direct effect, resulting in the total effect on MS being somewhat attenuated compared to the direct effect only.

Conclusion

Our results indicate that for women PTH is a plausible mediator in the association between MS and a range of explanatory variables, including vit D, magnesium and phosphate.

RESULTS

The effect of magnesium on PTH secretion in vitro

Results from in vitro testing of PTH secretory response to changes in Ca and Mg are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1 A shows the PTH results in pg/mL. Furthermore, in order to standardize the change in PTH and avoid small differences in PTH values attributable to minimal differences in the total amount of parathyroid tissue in the 10 glands of each well, the results are also presented as percent versus basal calcium in Figure 1 B. Incubation of parathyroid glands with increasing Ca concentrations produced a concentration-dependent decrease in PTH values. Increasing Mg concentrations from 0.5 to 1 and 2 mM produced a left shift of the PTH-Ca curves. Thus, the set points of the PTH curves were 1.12; 1.02 and 0.91 mM Ca for Mg concentrations of 0.5; 1 and 2, respectively. With the extreme Mg concentration of 5 mM, the secretory response was practically abolished at all Ca concentrations.

FIGURE 1:
Effect of calcium on PTH secretion at different magnesium concentrations in vitro. Intact, normal rat parathyroid glands were incubated at basal 1.25 mM Ca, and then, they were incubated for 1 h consecutive periods at Ca concentrations of 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.5 mM. The same experiment was repeated with each of the following Mg concentrations: 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 mM. PTH results are shown in pg/mL (A) and as % versus basal calcium (B) to standardize the change in PTH, avoiding differences in the total amount of parathyroid tissue. Values are expressed as means ± SEM (n = 9 in each group: three different experiments with three repetitions). (B) Data of PTH secretion at each different levels of calcium.

Path model

Based on previous research the following seven explanatory variables were included in a statistical model for the occurrence of MS; age, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), PTH, vit D, calcium, phosphate and magnesium. The relations between the variables, as suggested in the literature, are summarized in a path model (Figure 1). The effects of the explanatory variables are decomposed into a direct effect on MS and various possible indirect effects, mediated by among others PTH. The proposed path model is based on the following.

The indirect pathways between the included explanatory variables and MS were hypothesized to be mediated by PTH. Arrows represent dependencies between variables. Absence of an arrow between two variables indicates that the variables are considered to be statistically independent in the model.

It is well known that age is associated with an increased odds of MS and T2DM, while T2DM is associated with increased risk of MS. Low serum magnesium has been shown to be a predictor of both MS and T2DM while low phosphate and increased levels of albumin-corrected calcium is related to increased incidence of MS. Vit D is also associated with MS.

PTH has been shown to be associated with increased odds for MS, even after adjustment for vit D. The synthesis and secretion of PTH is regulated by serum levels of calcium and phosphate, while obesity, older age and reduced levels of calcium and vit D are all associated with higher levels of PTH. Studies have shown that serum concentrations of vit D and magnesium influence PTH levels, while low serum magnesium has been shown to inhibit PTH secretion. Finally, both vit D and phosphate are associated with calcium.

Arrows in a path diagram represent suggested dependencies between variables, and absence of an arrow between two variables indicates that these variables are considered statistically independent in the model. All hypothesized direct and indirect relations among measured variables can be read off the path diagram.

### A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled first-in-human phase 1 trial of transCon PTH in healthy adults [^fd69ab45]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Standard‐of‐care (SoC) for chronic HP — specifically active vitamin D and calcium — only corrects hypocalcemia, targeting a serum calcium (sCa) just below or in the lower level of normal range to avoid worsening hypercalciuria, and is frequently associated with a sCa nadir prior to the next morning dose. SoC also does not restore PTH‐dependent renal calcium reabsorption, phosphate excretion, or normal bone turnover. In fact, long‐term active vitamin D and calcium may produce adverse effects beyond the original problems associated with HP, including an increase in calcium × phosphate product and urinary calcium (uCa) that together may lead to nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and renal insufficiency as well as ectopic calcifications.

Until recently, HP was the last remaining classic endocrine deficiency disorder for which the missing hormone was not available as a therapy. In 1996, Winer and colleaguesestablished the experimental basis for using PTH(1‐34) to treat HP, showing that daily PTH(1‐34) injections are superior to SoC in treating adults and children with HP, allowing complete withdrawal of SoC while better controlling urinary calcium excretion. Follow‐up studies demonstrated that twice daily PTH(1‐34) injections are superior to SoC or once‐daily injections. Importantly, continuous subcutaneous (s.c.) PTH(1‐34) infusion via an insulin pump at a 62% to 65% lower daily dose, which produces physiological PTH levels over 24 hours, was superior to twice daily PTH(1‐34), resulting in more stable sCa levels, normal serum phosphate (sP), and serum magnesium (sMg) levels, normal uCa excretion, and a normalized rate of bone turnover in adults and children with HP while allowing complete withdrawal of SoC. These studies demonstrated that renal tubules need more frequent PTH dosing than twice per day to optimally control uCa. Despite currently available therapies, some patients still experience acute symptoms that can be severe and debilitating, negatively affecting activities of daily living and quality of life. Further, the long‐term consequences of hypercalciuria with subsequent renal failure is a major cause of morbidity among HP‐treated patients. Thus, a PTH replacement therapy that fully controls the disease, including episodes of hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia as well as hypercalciuria, remains an unmet need.

### Parathyroid hormone, but not vitamin D, is associated with the metabolic syndrome in morbidly obese women and men: a cross-sectional study [^5e223410]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism is high among morbidly obese subjects. Further, low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D) and magnesium have been associated with increased risk of the metabolic syndrome (MS), and recently, a possible link between PTH and MS has been reported. Although it is well known that the synthesis and secretion of PTH is regulated by serum levels of calcium, phosphate, magnesium and 25(OH)D, less is known about the possible clustered affiliation of these parameters with MS. We aimed to explore whether MS is associated with abnormal serum levels of PTH, 25(OH)D and magnesium in a population of morbidly obese patients.

Methods

Fasting serum levels of 25(OH)D, PTH and magnesium were assessed in a cross-sectional cohort study of 1,017 consecutive morbidly obese patients (68% women). Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to assess the independent effect of PTH, 25(OH)D and magnesium on the odds for MS (National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP]) after adjustment for confounding factors.

Results

Sixty-eight percent of the patients had MS. Patients with MS had lower mean serum magnesium (P < 0.001) and higher mean PTH (P = 0.067) than patients without MS, whereas mean 25(OH)D did not differ significantly. Patients with PTH levels in the second to fourth quartiles had higher odds of prevalent MS (odds ratio 1.47 [95% CI 0.92–2.35], 2.33 [95% CI 1.40–3.87] and 2.09 [95% CI 1.23–3.56], respectively), after adjustment for 25(OH)D, magnesium, calcium, phosphate, creatinine, age, gender, season of serum sampling, BMI, current smoking, albuminuria, CRP, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Further, PTH was significantly correlated with systolic and diastolic pressure (both P < 0.001), but not with the other components of MS. The levels of 25(OH)D and magnesium were not associated with MS in the multivariate model.

Conclusion

The PTH level, but not the vitamin D level, is an independent predictor of MS in treatment seeking morbidly obese Caucasian women and men. Randomized controlled clinical trials, including different therapeutic strategies to lower PTH, e.g. calcium/vitamin D supplementation and weight reduction, are necessary to explore any cause-and-effect relationship.

### Safety and efficacy of 5 years of treatment with recombinant human parathyroid hormone in adults with hypoparathyroidism [^1b768f70]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

PTH plays a central role in mineral homeostasis by stimulating renal reabsorption of calcium, promoting renal phosphate excretion, and stimulating conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH] 2 D), the fully active form of vitamin D. Moreover, 1,25[OH] 2 D enhances absorption of calcium and phosphate from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, PTH is a potent regulator of bone turnover (i.e. the coupled process of bone resorption and bone formation); deficiency of PTH results in decreased bone turnover. Conventional therapy for hypoparathyroidism includes oral calcium and active vitamin D (e.g. calcitriol), as well as thiazide diuretics and magnesium supplementation as needed. Although this approach can correct the hypocalcemia associated with hypoparathyroidism, it does not replace other functions of PTH and can lead to or worsen hypercalciuria. Other concerns with conventional therapy include unpredictable episodes of hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia; increased serum calcium-phosphorus (Ca × P) product; and complications such as extraskeletal calcifications, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and decreased kidney function (,–). Reduced quality of life and symptoms of hypocalcemia are consistent findings among patients with hypoparathyroidism receiving conventional treatment.

### A novel SLC12A3 homozygous c2039delG mutation in gitelman syndrome with hypocalcemia [^3ad79f89]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Hypocalcemia was rarely reported in GS cases, because calcium excretion through urine is very little. Some explanation to hypocalcemia is that hypomagnesaemia causes defective cyclic AMP generation in the parathyroid glands and in the PTH target organs, leading to impaired secretion of PTH as well as end-organ resistance to PTH. Furthermore PTH could increase serum magnesium by increasing its gastrointestinal absorption and bone resorption. This may explain why our patient had hypocalcemia and transiently decreased PTH. The patient regained normal calcium and PTH status soon. It also reminded us that her tetany was mainly due to hypomagnesemia because it recurred at a normal plasma calcium level.

Treatment of GS is usually managed by a liberal salt (NaCl) intake, together with oral magnesium and potassium supplements. The recommended target for potassium is 3.0 mmol/l and magnesium 0.6 mmol/l. We treated this patient with chloride (KCl), potassium magnesium aspartate. Considering her refractory hypokalemia and recurrent tetany, we added spironolactone and indomethacin, a nonselective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX). Indomethacin is rarely used in GS, because plasma prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in GS are usually normal. But studies found that significantly higher PGE2 and PGE2 metabolites (PGEM) levels in GS patients' urine and PGEM in their plasma. Also, higher urinary PGEM levels indicated more severe clinical manifestations and NCC dysfunction. There was study compared the efficacy and safety of 75 mg indomethacin, 150 mg eplerenone, or 20 mg amiloride added to constant potassium and magnesium supplementation in GS patients, and the result showed each drug increased plasma potassium level by approximately 0.3 mmol/l. But for long-term treatment, the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular side effects and nephrotoxicity should be considered. After two years follow-up, the patient had a reasonable potassium level of 3.1–3.5 mmol/l, and her symptoms were alleviated, while the plasma magnesium level was still unstable, between 0.4 and 0.8 mmol/l. It is more difficult to supplement magnesium as magnesium salts frequently cause diarrhoea. Among organic magnesium salts, MgCl 2 is preferred, which also compensates the urinary loss of chloride. However, it is unavailable in many places therefore a more readily available therapy should be researched.

### Parathyroid hormone, but not vitamin D, is associated with the metabolic syndrome in morbidly obese women and men: a cross-sectional study [^eda68757]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

What explains the possible link between PTH and MS?

The recently published link between PTH and MS in older men, was explained by insulin resistance, high blood pressure, hyperglycemia and low HDL-cholesterol. The hypothesis that PTH may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension is also supported by a prospective population based cohort study. We confirm a positive correlation between serum PTH and blood pressure, but we could not verify any correlations between PTH and insulin resistance, blood glucose or blood lipids.

Obesity, older age, and reduced daily intakes of calcium and vitamin D are associated with higher levels of PTH. Accordingly, weight reduction and higher intakes of calcium and vitamin D have been associated with decreases in PTH levels. However, whether lowering of serum PTH translates into beneficial effects on MS or its components remains unclear.

Strengths and limitations

The validity of our findings is strengthened by the prospective collection and registration of data from a homogenous large population of morbidly obese individuals. In addition, the relationship between PTH and MS was robust after adjustment for possible confounders including age, gender, BMI, serum calcium, phosphate, magnesium, vitamin D levels, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

Our study also had limitations. First, the cross-sectional design makes it difficult to establish a cause-effect relationship. Second, our results may not be valid in non-white populations. Third, the internal validity of the study is restricted by the biochemical analyses performed at a routine basis, thus increasing the risk of type 2 errors. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that referral of patients to a tertiary care center might have introduced a selection bias.

### Efficacy and safety of parathyroid hormone replacement with transCon PTH in hypoparathyroidism: 26-week results from the phase 3 paTHway trial [^71a06347]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypoparathyroidism is an endocrine disease caused by insufficient or absent production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) with multiorgan involvement. Under normal physiological conditions, PTH and its downstream hormone calcitriol are the primary regulators of calcium and phosphate and act on the bone, kidney, and intestine. Hypoparathyroidism can lead to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. As a result, individuals with hypoparathyroidism may experience a range of severe and potentially life‐threatening short‐term and long‐term complications, including neuromuscular irritability, renal complications, and vascular calcifications. Cognitive impairment, perhaps independent of abnormalities in calcium levels, is also common. All of these are associated with reduced health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). The negative impact of these hypoparathyroidism symptoms on daily life and work productivity is substantial and underrecognized, despite published studies highlighting them.

Current consensus guidelines for the long‐term management of chronic hypoparathyroidism have identified six therapeutic goals: (i) prevent signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia; (ii) maintain the serum calcium concentration within or slightly below the normal range; (iii) maintain the calcium × phosphate product below 55 mg²/dL² (4.4 mmol²/L²); (iv) avoid hypercalciuria; (v) avoid hypercalcemia; and (vi) avoid renal (nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis) and other extraskeletal calcifications. Conventional therapy for hypoparathyroidism consists of active vitamin D (e.g. calcitriol or its analog alfacalcidol) and large quantities of calcium, and is associated with a substantial pill burden. Although conventional therapy targets hypocalcemia and its acute symptoms, it fails to restore the normal physiological effects of PTH. Additionally, long‐term conventional therapy may increase the filtered load of calcium and further elevate serum phosphorus thereby increasing the risk of nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and chronic kidney disease. Conventional therapy also does not improve HRQoL or the functional and mental health status of individuals with hypoparathyroidism.

### Parathyroid hormone, but not vitamin D, is associated with the metabolic syndrome in morbidly obese women and men: a cross-sectional study [^9a494752]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

The major and novel finding of this study is that the serum level of PTH was an independent predictor of MS in a series of 1,017 consecutive morbidly obese women and men. In addition, our data show that morbidly obese patients with both MS and type 2 diabetes were characterized by lower serum magnesium levels as compared to patients without MS.

Although vitamin D status, as assessed by 25(OH)D, was inversely correlated with PTH, we did not find any significant association between serum levels of 25(OH)D and MS.

PTH, vitamin D and MS

Although several lines of evidence indicate that serum PTH may be associated with metabolic disturbances, to our knowledge, only three recently published studies have addressed the combined effect of serum PTH and vitamin D on MS. These reports, however, diverge in their conclusions. Our finding of a close relationship between MS and PTH level is in contrast with the negative results of a previous study of severely obese subjects, but extend the results from a study of older mainly non-obese men to be valid in adult Caucasian treatment seeking morbidly obese women and men. Further, although we found a significant inverse correlation between 25(OH)D and PTH, we could not confirm any association between 25(OH)D and MS as shown by others.

Magnesium, PTH, MS and diabetes

Low serum magnesium has been shown to predict type 2 diabetes and MS. Our study partly supports these observations, as increasing serum magnesium was associated with lower odds for MS (model 1 and 2). In addition, we document that patients with both type 2 diabetes and MS had lower magnesium levels than patients without MS. However, after the final adjustment for diabetes (model 3), serum magnesium was not significantly associated with MS. The apparent paradoxically low mean serum PTH concentration in patients with both MS and type 2 diabetes could be partly explained by the concomitant low magnesium level, as low serum magnesium is known to inhibit PTH secretion.

### The genetic spectrum of gitelman (-like) syndromes [^b60e5030]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

SLC12A3 – CLASSIC GITELMAN

In 1996, Simon et al. described homozygous and compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SLC12A3 as cause of Gitelman syndrome. Since then, 133 pathogenic variants have been described (ClinVar, February 2022), including deletions, splice site variants and intronic variants. In most recent screenings, approximately 75% of patients with a Gitelman syndrome presentation are diagnosed with a biallelic mutation in SLC12A3. Of them, 20–25% have a homozygous pathogenic variant, 60–70% are compound heterozygous and ± 10% have genomic rearrangements (deletion/duplication), which can be picked up by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Homozygous mutations have been associated with an earlier age of onset and more severe hypocalciuria in a Chinese cohort. In contrast, no phenotypic differences were reported for genomic rearrangements.

In-depth phenotyping of Gitelman patients with SLC12A3 mutations has resulted in the identification of subclinical phenotypes. In a large European cohort, 20% of patients with Gitelman syndrome had hypoparathyroidism. As the parathyroid harmone (PTH) and magnesium concentrations were correlated in this cohort, it has been hypothesized that the hypoparathyroidism is explained by Mg 2+ -dependent regulation of the calcium-sensing receptor. Alternatively, a positive Ca 2+ balance may contribute to hypoparathyroidism in Gitelman syndrome. Several studies reported increased fasting glucose levels and insulin resistance in Gitelman patients. In a large cohort of 77 patients, the insulin response was almost doubled upon glucose loading, which was associated with a significant increase of the insulin resistance index. Indeed, diabetes mellitus has been reported in one-third of the patients in a Chinese cohort study. Again, hypomagnesemia may (partially) explain the insulin resistance in Gitelman syndrome, as Mg 2+ is essential for the insulin signalling pathway.

### Relationship between serum parathyroid hormone levels, vitamin D sufficiency, and calcium intake… [^a92ffe33]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

At the low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, calcium intake of less than 800 mg/d vs more than 1200 mg/d was significantly associated with higher serum PTH; and at a calcium intake of more than 1200 mg/d, there was a significant difference between the lowest and highest vitamin D groups. An inverse relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum parathyroid hormone is well established, up to a certain level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, in which little further decrease in serum PTH is observed. In this group, serum PTH levels were highest in the low calcium group. Thus, Figure 2 and the overall statistical model indicated a strong association between vitamin D status and serum PTH, whereas the effect of calcium intake may be most important in the low vitamin D status group. At the low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, there was a significant difference in serum PTH according to calcium intake.

Serum PTH was significantly higher when the calcium intake level was less than 800 mg/d compared with more than 1200 mg/d, whereas the serum PTH levels of those individuals with a calcium intake of between 800 and 1200 mg/d were not significantly different from those individuals with a level of more than 1200 mg/d. The significance of our study was demonstrated by the strong negative association between sufficient serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and PTH, with calcium intake varying from less than 800 mg/d to more than 1200 mg/d. Our results suggest that vitamin D sufficiency can ensure ideal serum PTH values even when the calcium intake level is less than 800 mg/d, while high calcium intake is not sufficient to maintain ideal serum PTH, as long as vitamin D status is insufficient.

In conclusion, our study suggests that vitamin D sufficiency may be more important than high calcium intake in maintaining desired values of serum PTH. Vitamin D may have a calcium-sparing effect and as long as vitamin D status is ensured, calcium intake levels of more than 800 mg/d may be unnecessary for maintaining calcium metabolism. Vitamin D supplements are necessary to ensure adequate vitamin D status for most of the year in northern climates.

### Effect of magnesium supplementation on chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder in hemodialysis patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^9f325959]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Research about the effects of magnesium (Mg) supplementation on chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) among hemodialysis (HD) patients is controversial. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine Mg supplementation's effects on CKD-MBD in patients requiring dialysis.

Methods

The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for English language studies up to September 2020. The main indicators of our study were changes in serum Mg, calcium (Ca), phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and C-reactive protein levels, and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) after Mg supplementation. Mg efficacy was evaluated by weighted mean difference (WMD) and confidence intervals (CIs), and subgroup analyses of intervention type and intervention duration were also performed.

Results

Eight eligible studies comprising 309 HD patients were included in our meta-analysis. Mg supplementation alone produced a negative effect on serum PTH levels (WMD = -236.56; 95% CI -349.71 to -123.41) and CIMT (WMD = -0.18; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.01). A subgroup analysis based on intervention type showed a significant improvement in serum Mg (WMD = 1.08; 95% CI 0.51–1.64) and Ca (WMD = -0.50; 95% CI -0.77 to -0.23) levels when Mg was administered via dialysate and oral medication, respectively. Different intervention durations had no effect on serum Mg levels. Mg supplementation had no significant effect on serum phosphate (WMD = -0.25; 95% CI -0.64 to 0.14) and C-reactive protein levels (WMD = -0.02; 95% CI -2.80 to 2,76).

Conclusions

Our results showed that Mg supplementation alone could improve CKD-MBD by regulating serum Ca and PTH metabolism and decreasing CIMT among HD patients.

### Magnesium modulates parathyroid hormone secretion and upregulates parathyroid receptor expression at moderately low calcium concentration [^4a592f23]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Ca also regulates parathyroid function by modulating the expression of key inhibitory receptors such as the CaR, VDR and FGFR/Klotho. In the present study we addressed whether Mg is also able to regulate the CaR expression. We did this by incubating parathyroid glands at a Ca concentration of 1.0 mM and Mg concentrations of 0.5 or 2.0 mM, which are inside the physiologically possible range. The expression of CaR, measured both at mRNA and protein levels, was upregulated by high Mg concentration. Thus, this distinct effect of Mg on the CaR expression represents an additional contribution of this cation to reduce PTH secretion. From previous own experiments, we know that the minimal incubation period required for seeing a response in gene expression is 6 h. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of Mg on PTH secretion observed in our in vitro experiments cannot be attributed to changes in parathyroid CaR expression because the PTH secretion was evaluated after a 1 h of incubation, which is not enough time to allow for changes in CaR expression.

The effect of Mg on the expression of the parathyroid VDR, another key receptor in the regulation of PTH secretion, was also evaluated. The expression of VDR is upregulated by Ca and calcimimetics. Here, we show that Mg upregulates the VDR expression at mRNA and protein levels. This effect of Mg would favour the inhibition of PTH secretion by vitamin D.

Recent studies have shown that FGF23 regulates parathyroid function. FGF23 exerts an inhibitory effect on PTH secretion and parathyroid cell proliferation by binding to the receptor FGFR1 in the presence of its co-receptor Klotho. Klotho and FGFR are abundantly expressed in normal parathyroid cells, but in hyperplastic parathyroid glands the expression of FGFR1 and Klotho is markedly reduced, which likely makes the tissue resistant to the action of FGF23. Both FGFR1 and Klotho gene expression are upregulated by Ca. Thus, we assessed whether Mg is also able to modulate the expression of these receptors. The results of this study show higher levels of both receptors in the parathyroid glands incubated with high (2.0 mM) Mg concentration when compared with those observed with normal (0.5 mM) Mg concentration. Therefore, the increased levels of expression of FGFR1 and Klotho may be considered as an additional mechanism underlying the downregulation of PTH secretion by Mg.

### A patient with speechlessness and rhabdomyolysis: a rare presentation of severe hypocalcaemia [^8a27de89]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Second, hypomagnesaemia was present, which could have contributed to the severeness of his hypocalcaemia. Hypomagnesaemia can induce PTH resistance and diminish its secretion, impairing PTH release in response to hypocalcaemia even more. However, low PTH can also induce hypomagnesemia in return. Nevertheless, symptoms like laryngospasm will present more likely when both cations are low. Therefore, the substitution of magnesium besides calcium aids in both calcium and magnesium concentrations, resulting in quicker resolution of symptoms.

Third, we expected a high 25-OH-vitamin D3 concentration due to the lack of parathyroid activity, since PTH assists in the hydroxylation of 25-OH-vitamin D3 to its active form, 1,25-(OH)2 D3. Therefore, a buildup of 25-OH-vitamin D3 was expected. However, this was not the case. His vitamin D deficiency was probably the result of a shortage of daily sunlight, being seated behind the glass of his taxi, combined with a pigmented skin. Vitamin D was supplemented during hospitalisation and after discharge. Combining alphacalcidol and cholecalciferol long term can induce vitamin D toxicity. Therefore, close monitoring of his vitamin D levels during follow-up is essential.

Finally, his urine was routinely checked since calcium can be lost in the urine due to low PTH levels, causing hypercalciuria and possibly resulting in nephrolithiasis. Therefore, the assessment of urine during follow-up is necessary.

This case reports the unusual first presentation of hypocalcaemia via speechlessness, hoarseness and vomiting. It shows the importance of bearing an electrolyte disorder in mind when a patient presents with these symptoms since identifying an atypical presentation of hypocalcaemia can be lifesaving.

Patient's perspective

At first, I was stunned by everything that happened. When I came to the hospital for my minor complaints, I never suspected I had a serious illness. I always thought of myself to be a healthy person. I was still working daily and was even working out for four or even five times a week, both without any trouble. However, immediate treatment was necessary and I had to stay in the hospital. At this moment I finally understood something was really wrong. They explained everything perfectly to me, which made me feel more at ease.

### Clinical and genetic analysis of pseudohypoparathyroidism complicated by hypokalemia: a case report and review of the literature [^501176df]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

PHP is typically classified as type 1 or type 2. Type 1 is distinguished from type 2 by the abnormal cAMP response in urine by exogenous PTH stimulation. Type 1 PHP can be further subtyped into PHP-1a, PHP-1b and PHP-1c according to the presence or absence of AHO, together with the measurement of Gsα protein activity in peripheral erythrocyte membranes in vitro. PHP-1b, in most case lack the evidence for AHO, is caused by epigenetic changes at one or several DMR within GNAS. In terms of the decreased Gsα activity, PTH-1a and PHP-1b can overlap in clinical findings. PHP-1a can sometimes present as a mild phenotype of AHO. Zazo et al. reported methylation defects in patients with AHO (ex. mild brachydactyly and partial resistance to TSH), indicating a complex connection between genetic or epigenetic changes and AHO. Thus, to ensure accurate diagnosis and subtyping of PHP, genetic analysis of mutations in GNAS exons, as well as epigenetic modifications, should also be considered. PHP is often complicated by an imbalance of electrolytes. Takatani et al. reported significantly reduced magnesium levels in PHP-1b patients. However, PHP-1b accompanied by persistent hypokalemia without hypomagnesemia has rarely been reported. The present study provides novel insight into PHP-1b.

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^91701143]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Another noteworthy finding in our cohort was that 20% of patients with Gitelman syndrome had hypoparathyroidism. The calcium-sensing receptor signalling is known to be dependent on extracellular magnesium levels. Unlike calcium, PTH secretion is inhibited by supraphysiologically high magnesium levels via stimulation of the calcium-sensing receptor, but also by low magnesium concentrations. This latter response is suggested to result from intracellular disinhibition of G-protein signalling downstream from the calcium-sensing receptor, precluding PTH release. Accordingly, decreased PTH secretion and decreased responsiveness of PTH to ionized calcium have been suggested in small cohorts of patients with Gitelman syndrome. In agreement with these data, we observed a significant correlation between PTH and serum magnesium in patients with Gitelman syndrome, suggesting that low serum magnesium might be, at least in part, responsible for hypoparathyroidism.

Hypophosphatemia was common in all disease subgroups, in particular in Bartter syndrome type III with a prevalence of 32%. The prevalence of hypophosphatemia in Bartter syndrome type III patients decreased in adulthood to 5%. In Gitelman syndrome, the prevalence of hypophosphatemia was not age-dependent. Low serum phosphate levels were associated with lower TmP/GFR in all subgroups, indicating that hypophosphatemia was most likely related to renal phosphate wasting. However, renal hypophosphatemia did not appear to be driven by hyperparathyroidism, since PTH did not correlate with phosphate-SDS or TmP/GFR-SDS. Furthermore, patients with Gitelman syndrome did not have high PTH levels, while they often had hypophosphatemia and renal phosphate wasting. The exact mechanism(s) of hypophosphatemia in these patients remains unclear. Notably, low serum phosphate levels have already been observed in anecdotal reports on Gitelman syndrome, including a possible link with lower renal tubular phosphate reabsorption. Interestingly, it has been hypothesized that chronic hypokalaemia can cause proximal tubular cell injury, resulting in a phosphate leak. However, serum potassium and serum phosphate were not correlated in our cohort. Furthermore, FGF23 could play a role. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that in the NCC knockout mouse model for Gitelman syndrome, FGF23 levels were increased. In contrast to our Gitelman cohort, these mice also showed increased PTH levels which, however, did not alter fractional phosphate excretion or serum phosphate levels.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^1efd065d]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Preventing signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia, maintaining serum calcium levels in the low normal range or slightly below normal, preventing hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia, keeping the calcium-phosphate product below 55 mg²/dL², and preventing renal (nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis) and other extraskeletal calcifications are the main objectives of treatment. Conventional therapy of HypoPTH includes not only the emergency management of acute and severe hypocalcemia with IV administration of calcium gluconate, but also the management of chronic hypocalcemia with calcium, calcitriol, as well as magnesium supplements, whenever required. The normalization of serum calcium levels through traditional treatment involving calcium and active vitamin D fails to fully restore normal calcium homeostasis physiology. Instead, it leads to hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia because it lacks renal calcium reabsorption and phosphaturia typically stimulated by PTH. Consequently, this standard approach heightens the risk of extraskeletal calcifications and long-term kidney complications. Moreover, the absence of PTH results in abnormal bone remodeling and contributes to reduced quality of life for many hypoparathyroidism patients despite adhering to conventional therapy. These challenges have prompted scientific exploration into alternative therapeutic avenues. Since the mid-1990s, synthetic PTH (1–34) has been proposed for the management of refractory HypoPTH, with promising results. rhPTH (1–84) has been approved for the treatment of adults with HypoPTH refractory to conventional therapy, with the exception of patients who have autosomal dominant hypocalcemia.

### Hypoparathyroidism [^97ef2e0a]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is a disease characterized by inadequately low circulating concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) resulting in low calcium levels and increased phosphate levels in the blood. Symptoms of the disease result from increased neuromuscular irritability caused by hypocalcaemia and include tingling, muscle cramps and seizures. The most common cause of the disease is inadvertent removal of, or injury to, the parathyroid glands during neck surgery, followed by genetic, idiopathic and autoimmune aetiologies. Conventional treatment includes activated vitamin D and/or calcium supplements, but this treatment does not fully replace the functions of PTH and can lead to short-term problems (such as hypocalcaemia, hypercalcaemia and increased urinary calcium excretion) and long-term complications (which include nephrocalcinosis, kidney stones and brain calcifications). PTH replacement has emerged as a new treatment option. Clinical trials using human PTH(1–34) and PTH(1–84) showed that this treatment was safe and effective in studies lasting up to 6 years. Recombinant human PTH(1–84) has been approved in the United States and Europe for the management of hypoparathyroidism; however, its effect on long-term complications is still being evaluated. Clinical practice guidelines, which describe the consensus of experts in the field, have been published and recognize the need for more research to optimize care. In this Primer, we summarize current knowledge of the prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of hypoparathyroidism.

### Magnesium, vitamin D status and mortality: results from US national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) 2001 to 2006 and NHANES III [^eeae836a]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The critical roles of magnesium in the synthesis of VDBP, PTH, 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2 D may partially explain why the inverse associations between serum 25(OH)D and risk of total mortality and mortality due to colorectal cancer and CVD primarily existed among those with magnesium intake above the median. High magnesium may increase the availability of 1,25 (OH)2D through activating the synthesis of 25(OH)D and 1,25 (OH)2D and increasing the transfer to target tissues by elevating vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) (Figure 1). This explanation is also supported by the observation in previous clinical studies that magnesium supplementation substantially reversed the resistance to vitamin D treatment among magnesium-deficient patients.

Previous studies found PTH level was elevated when serum 25(OH)D was under 20 ng/ml. In the current study, we found magnesium intake was associated with a reduced risk of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency only among those in the highest or the lowest tertile of PTH. This finding is possible because magnesium plays an important role in PTH regulation. This finding is also supported by observations made in a study of 30 women with osteoporosis that were investigated for magnesium deficiency using a magnesium tolerance test. The subjects were divided into three groups: ten with vitamin D insufficiency (low vitamin D and raised PTH); ten with functional hypoparathyroidism (low vitamin D and low/low normal PTH); and ten who were vitamin D replete (normal vitamin D and normal PTH). All ten subjects with functional hypoparathyroidism were found to be magnesium deficient; five magnesium-deficient and five magnesium-insufficient patients were found in the subjects with vitamin D insufficiency, and only one magnesium-deficient and four magnesium-insufficient patients were found in the vitamin D replete group. Furthermore, intravenous magnesium infusion led to a significant rise in PTH in the group with functional hypoparathyroidism and a reduction in PTH in the subjects with vitamin D insufficiency.

### Parathyroid hormone and phosphate homeostasis in patients with bartter and gitelman syndrome: an international cross-sectional study [^3a824017]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

While Bartter and Gitelman syndromes share similarities, including hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism and low/normal blood pressure, differences in the tubular segments where NaCl reabsorption is compromised produce different clinical pictures. Patients with Gitelman syndrome usually present in late childhood or early adulthood. Typically, patients with Gitelman syndrome have hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. Conversely, type I and II Bartter syndrome patients usually present antenatally with polyhydramnios and postnatally with severe polyuria, hypercalciuria and early onset nephrocalcinosis. Patients with type III Bartter syndrome have variable phenotypes that, in some cases, are difficult to distinguish from Gitelman syndrome. The large phenotypic spectrum of Bartter III patients is most likely explained by variable expression of the pathogenic gene product in the TAL and DCT and by the possibility of partial compensation by other chloride channels, in particular, ClC-Ka in the TAL.

In recent years, several investigators have observed abnormal levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and serum phosphate in patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndrome. Patients with Bartter syndrome tend to have a high PTH. However, the prevalence and pathophysiology of hyperparathyroidism in these Bartter patients are unclear. Furthermore, data have been in part contradictory since a tendency towards both hyper- and hypophosphatemia has been described in Bartter syndrome. In patients with Gitelman syndrome, high PTH levels have only been described in patients that had parathyroid adenoma, while hypophosphatemia has been reported in several small studies and has been attributed to renal phosphate wasting.

To verify whether these observations from case reports and small series are prevalent in Bartter and Gitelman syndromes or just incidental findings, we analysed PTH and phosphate levels in a very large cross-sectional cohort of patients with Bartter and Gitelman syndrome collected across Europe, including both paediatric and adult subjects.

### Parathyroid hormone, but not vitamin D, is associated with the metabolic syndrome in morbidly obese women and men: a cross-sectional study [^61ae4b1f]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

PTH, vitamin D, magnesium and odds for having MS

Increasing PTH levels were associated with significantly higher odds for having MS in all three multiple logistic regression models (table 3). Higher magnesium levels were significantly associated with lower odds of MS in model 1 and 2, but not after the final adjustment for diabetes (model 3). No statistically significant interaction was observed between gender and PTH (Model 3; P = 0.104). 25(OH)D was not significantly associated with MS in the analyses. To explore a potential non-linear relationship between MS and PTH, quartiles of PTH were implemented in an additional analysis (model 3). This analysis confirmed an independent effect of PTH on the occurrence of MS, showing that patients with PTH levels in the second to fourth quartiles had a 1.5- to 2-fold increased odds of MS (1 st quartile reference, P for trend 0.008) (figure 1). The latter findings were consistent after the exclusion of patients using thiazides, loop diuretics, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, and vitamin D supplements (data not shown).

### Bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide (bisoprolol fumarate hydrochlorothiazide) [^6a6f61ec]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

General

Electrolyte and Fluid Balance Status

Although the probability of developing hypokalemia is reduced with bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide because of the very low dose of HCTZ employed, periodic determination of serum electrolytes should be performed, and patients should be observed for signs of fluid or electrolyte disturbances, ie, hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis when severe cirrhosis is present, during concomitant use of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or after prolonged therapy. Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia can provoke ventricular arrhythmias or sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis. Hypokalemia may be avoided or treated by potassium supplementation or increased intake of potassium-rich foods.

Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than salt administration, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Parathyroid Disease

Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides, and pathologic changes in the parathyroid glands, with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia, have been observed in a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy.

Hyperuricemia

Hyperuricemia or acute gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide diuretics. Bisoprolol, alone or in combination with HCTZ, has been associated with increases in uric acid. However, in U.S. clinical trials, the incidence of treatment-related increases in uric acid was higher during therapy with HCTZ 25 mg (25%) than with B/H 6.25 mg (10%). Because of the very low dose of HCTZ employed, hyperuricemia may be less likely with bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide.

### Calcium homeostasis during magnesium treatment in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^8aa01dba]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Magnesium treatment in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can result in hypocalcemia; this hypocalcemia increases the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and poor outcome. We assessed whether low serum levels of total calcium in patients with SAH treated with magnesium is mediated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) or calcitriol, and whether increased PTH or low serum levels of ionized calcium are associated with an increased risk of DCI and poor outcome.

Patients and Methods

We studied 167 patients included in a randomized, placebo controlled trial on magnesium in SAH. Mean serum magnesium during treatment was related to mean serum levels of ionized calcium, PTH and calcitriol with linear regression. Hypocalcemia (Ca(2+)) and high serum PTH were related to the occurrence of DCI by means of the Cox proportional hazards model and to poor outcome by logistic regression.

Results

Serum magnesium was inversely related to ionized calcium (B = -0.1; 95% CI -0.12 to -0.06), but not to PTH or calcitriol. Neither hypocalcemia nor high serum PTH was related to DCI. Hypocalcemia did not increased the risk for poor outcome (OR 1.2; 95% CI 0.6–2.3). In the subgroup of patients with known PTH (n = 67), high serum PTH increased the risk for poor outcome (OR 5.4; 1.6–18.9).

Conclusions

Magnesium treatment in patients with SAH leads to hypocalcemia without effect on outcome. PTH is related to poor outcome, but this is independent of magnesium therapy.

### Citrate dose for continuous hemofiltration: effect on calcium and magnesium balance, parathormone and vitamin D status, a randomized controlled trial [^51506c5f]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

For Mg loss differences between the 2 groups were not constant over time (group by time interaction p < 0.0001). However, after correction for multiple testing, the differences between the 2 groups at individual time points were not significant.

For Mg compensation (via the CRRT fluids) the difference between the high and low citrate group was not constant over the intervention period (group by time interaction p < 0.0001). Mean difference in Mg compensation between the high and the low groups equaled 0.38 mmol/h (se = 0.032, p < 0.0001) with more Mg compensation in the low group. Mg compensation decreased by 0.029 mmol/h between T2-T6 in both groups and then stabilized at 0.54 (se 0.025) mmol/h for the high citrate group and 0.90 (se 0.024) mmol/h for the low citrate group.

The 24-h Mg balance was − 25.99 (2.10) mmol/d in the high group vs. -17.63 (se 2.10) in the low group, both significantly different from zero (p < 0.001) and different from each other (p = 0.0081) (see Table 3). When accounting for extra supplementation the difference remained significant (p = 0.0433) (see Table 3). No statistical difference in amount of extra Mg supplementation could be demonstrated. Almost all Mg supplementation was given at 24 h and was accounted for in the balances revised for extra supplementation.

iPTH, oxidized and non-oxidized PTH

Baseline iPTH, median 222 (140–384) pg/ml, decreased to 162 (11–265) at 24 h (p = 0.002). There were no significant differences between citrate groups both at baseline or at 24 h. The decrease in iPTH was significant in both the high citrate group and the low citrate group (see Table 4). OxPTH decreased from a median of 192 (124–353) pg/ml to 154 (86–231) (p = 0.002), while overall noxPTH at 24 h was not significantly different (see Table 4) compared to baseline (p = 0.339). Findings were similar for both high and low groups.

### Effects of once versus twice-daily parathyroid hormone 1–34 therapy in children with hypoparathyroidism [^b98512d5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Hypoparathyroidism is among the few hormonal insufficiency states not treated with replacement of the missing hormone. Long-term conventional therapy with vitamin D and analogs may lead to nephrocalcinosis and renal insufficiency.

Objective

Our objective was to compare the response of once-daily vs. twice-daily PTH 1–34 treatment in children with hypoparathyroidism.

Setting

The study was conducted at a clinical research center.

Subjects

Fourteen children ages 4–17 yr with chronic hypoparathyroidism were studied.

Study Design

This was a randomized cross-over trial, lasting 28 wk, which compared two dose regimens, once-daily vs. twice-daily PTH1-34. Each 14-wk study arm was divided into a 2-wk inpatient dose-adjustment phase and a 12-wk outpatient phase.

Results

Mean predose serum calcium was maintained at levels just below the normal range. Repeated serum measures over a 24-h period showed that twice-daily PTH 1–34 increased serum calcium and magnesium levels more effectively than a once-daily dose. This was especially evident during the second half of the day (12–24 h). PTH 1–34 normalized mean 24-h urine calcium excretion on both treatment schedules. This was achieved with half the PTH 1–34 dose during the twice-daily regimen compared with the once-daily regimen (twice-daily, 25 ± 15 microg/d vs. once-daily, 58 ± 28 microg/d; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

We conclude that a twice-daily PTH 1–34 regimen provides a more effective treatment of hypoparathyroidism compared with once-daily treatment because it reduces the variation in serum calcium levels and accomplishes this at a lower total daily PTH 1–34 dose. The results showed, as in the previous study of adult patients with hypoparathyroidism, that a twice-daily regimen produced significantly improved metabolic control compared with once-daily PTH 1–34.

### Health supervision for children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: clinical report [^9b61ecda]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Endocrinologic care in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) — hypocalcemia and supplementation — Vitamin D supplementation and a calcium-rich diet based on recommended daily intake for age should be emphasized from infancy to adulthood; for those with transient or persistent hypoparathyroidism, maintenance therapy is calcitriol, with or without calcium supplementation. Hypomagnesemia may also contribute to the problem; thus, magnesium supplementation is indicated for those with hypomagnesemia. For patients requiring supplementation, it is important to monitor for hypercalciuria with spot urinary calcium and calcium/creatinine ratio when measuring blood calcium every 3 to 4 months and to consider intermittent renal ultrasonography; obtain baseline renal ultrasonogram and consider intermittent renal ultrasonography if receiving calcium supplementation. Any symptomatic presentation of hypocalcemia should prompt an urgent evaluation for hypoparathyroidism including measurements of total calcium, ionized calcium, PTH, phosphate, 25-OH-D, and magnesium. Check total calcium concentrations every 3 to 6 months during infancy, then every 1 to 2 years thereafter, and check total calcium concentrations preoperatively, postoperatively, and during severe illness. Symptomatic hypocalcemia is managed acutely via intravenous infusion of calcium along with standard oral replacement of calcium and calcitriol. For patients with structural renal anomalies, such as renal agenesis or dysplastic kidney, lower calcium doses may be needed; referral to a pediatric endocrinologist and/or pediatric nephrologist should be arranged at the time of diagnosis if there is any concern about hypo- or hypercalcemia and for subsequent management. Long-term management of hypocalcemia has the goal of maintaining a low-normal calcium concentration to avoid complications of hypercalciuria.

### Mechanisms and causes of hypomagnesemia [^d850c485]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, hypomagnesemia can be caused by alcohol use disorder, acute kidney injury, burn injury, hypercalcemia, acute diarrhea, complications of blood transfusion, gastric fistula, VIPoma, hypoparathyroidism, thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis, hyperaldosteronism, diabetic ketoacidosis, kwashiorkor, primary hypomagnesemia, interstitial nephritis, hyperparathyroidism, fistula of intestine, oxalate blood sample, EDTA blood sample, citrated blood sample, acute pancreatitis and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretions. In addition, hypomagnesemia can be caused by medications such as voriconazole, tacrolimus, rabeprazole DR, pazopanib, pantoprazole DR, panitumumab, pamidronate, omeprazole DR, necitumumab, lansoprazole DR, hydrochlorothiazide, gentamicin, foscarnet, esomeprazole magnesium DR, dinutuximab, dexlansoprazole DR, cyclosporine, conivaptan, cisplatin, cetuximab, bumetanide, nadolol / bendroflumethiazide, arsenic trioxide, amphotericin B liposomal, amikacin, furosemide, esomeprazole sodium, patiromer and tacrolimus ER.

### Low magnesium diet aggravates phosphate-induced kidney injury [^58a1555a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Magnesium is known to protect against phosphate-induced tubular cell injuries in vitro. We investigated in vivo effects of magnesium on kidney injuries and phosphate metabolism in mice exposed to a high phosphate diet.

Methods

Heminephrectomized mice were maintained on a high phosphate/normal magnesium diet or a high phosphate/low magnesium diet for 6weeks. We compared renal histology, phosphaturic hormones and renal α-Klotho expression between the two diet groups.

Results

High phosphate diet-induced tubular injuries and interstitial fibrosis were remarkably aggravated by the low-magnesium diet. At 1week after high phosphate feeding when serum creatinine levels were similar between the two groups, the low magnesium diet suppressed not only fecal phosphate excretion but also urinary phosphate excretion, resulting in increased serum phosphate levels. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were not appropriately elevated in the low magnesium diet group despite lower 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and serum calcium levels compared with the normal magnesium diet group. Although fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels were lower in the low magnesium diet group, calcitriol-induced upregulation of FGF23 could not restore the impaired urinary phosphate excretion. The low magnesium diet markedly downregulated α-Klotho expression in the kidney. This downregulation of α-Klotho occurred even when mice were fed the low phosphate diet.

Conclusions

A low magnesium diet aggravated high phosphate diet-induced kidney injuries. Impaired PTH secretion and downregulation of renal α-Klotho were likely to be involved in the blunted urinary phosphate excretion by the low magnesium diet. Increasing dietary magnesium may be useful to attenuate phosphate-induced kidney injury.

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: a meta-analysis of prospective trials [^d6b16f8c]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our meta‐analysis of the largest available number of treated patients demonstrates that PTH replacement therapy is well‐tolerated, safe, and effective in the management of hypoparathyroidism. Unlike conventional supplementation, it has beneficial effects on serum phosphate, calcium‐phosphate product, and urinary calcium excretion, which are currently the unmet needs in chronic hypoparathyroidism. Basing on available data, no significant differences between PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84 have been demonstrated in most outcomes, except for a beneficial effect of PTH 1−84 only in reducing calcium‐phosphate product. It also improves several extrarenal outcomes, such as QoL and bone turnover. In addition to its current indication as second‐line treatment in patients with refractory hypocalcaemia, our results support the use of PTH replacement therapy in patients in whom hyperphosphatemia and increased urinary calcium excretion are a clinical concern.

### Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide [^ad6e6423]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The opposite effects of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium will approximately balance each other in many patients, so that no net effect upon serum potassium will be seen. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Initial and periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

Chloride deficits are generally mild and require specific treatment only under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides. In a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy, pathological changes in the parathyroid gland have been observed, with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. More serious complications of hyperparathyroidism (renal lithiasis, bone resorption, and peptic ulceration) have not been seen.

Thiazides increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, and hypomagnesemia may result.

Other Metabolic Disturbances

Thiazide diuretics tend to reduce glucose tolerance and to raise serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and uric acid. These effects are usually minor, but frank gout or overt diabetes may be precipitated in susceptible patients.

Cough

Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.

Surgery/Anesthesia

In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.

### Risedronate sodium (atelvia) [^bfcc0ba7]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Test Findings:

Parathyroid hormone: The effect of Atelvia 35 mg once-a-week and risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg daily on parathyroid hormone was evaluated in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. At week 52, in subjects with normal levels at baseline, PTH levels greater than 65 pg/mL (upper limit of normal) were noted in 9% of subjects receiving Atelvia 35 mg once-a-week and 8% of subjects receiving risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg daily. In subjects with normal levels at baseline, PTH levels greater than 97 pg/mL (1.5 times the upper limit of normal) were seen in 2% of subjects receiving Atelvia 35 mg once-a-week and no subjects receiving risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg daily. There were no clinically significant differences between treatment groups for levels of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium.

Daily Dosing with risedronate sodium immediate - release 5 mg tablets

The safety of risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg once daily in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multinational trials of 3232 women aged 38 to 85 years with postmenopausal osteoporosis. The duration of the trials was up to three years, with 1619 patients exposed to placebo and 1613 patients exposed to risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg daily. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and H2antagonists were included in these clinical trials. All women received 1000 mg of elemental calcium plus vitamin D supplementation up to 500 international units per day if their 25-hydroxyvitamin D3level was below normal at baseline.

### Global guidance for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of tumor-induced osteomalacia [^a42530cf]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Patient follow‐up and monitoring in collaboration with specialists

Complete resection

Following successful surgery, biochemical abnormalities rapidly reverse: Intact FGF23 levels typically return to normal levels within 24 h, whereas C‐terminal FGF23 levels may take several days to normalize. Patients may experience hungry bone syndrome (HBS) as bones are being remineralized, characterized by secondary hyperparathyroidism, with or without hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and/or hypomagnesemia. The recommended treatment for HBS includes calcium and vitamin D supplementation. There is a rapid, marked, but transient increase in serum 1,25(OH) 2 D following successful resection. Serum phosphate normalization is usually observed within 5 days post‐surgery. Osteomalacia and ALP levels may take ≤ 1 year to recover, although certain skeletal deformities will be irreversible. Serum phosphate should be measured frequently until normalization and then annually (Fig. 2).

Unresectable, persistent, or recurrent tumors

Tumor recurrence has been reported ≤ 20 years after initial resection. In a recent Italian study, all patients undergoing lesion biopsy before surgery had tumor recurrence. Another Italian case series identified 16 patients who experienced persistent/recurrent TIO or were diagnosed with TIO in the absence of tumor localization, which was 54.2% (± 36.2%) of all identified patients with TIO in the study. In persistent and/or recurrent TIO, the diagnostic approach — including the biochemical evaluation, and functional and anatomical imaging — should be repeated to detect metastasis or multiple foci and to exclude other diseases (Fig. 2). Recurrent and multifocal tumors should be localized and resected if possible.

Some patients have persistent hypophosphatemia and elevated FGF23 levels after resection and need to be monitored. If 1,25(OH) 2 D does not rebound quickly, this could indicate residual disease. The need for ongoing treatment and/or continued monitoring highlights the importance of collaboration between referring clinicians and specialists.

### Mineral metabolism and vitamin D in chronic kidney disease – more questions than answers [^5c0b3e76]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of total and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The underlying pathophysiology of this association remains largely unexplained and there is currently no clear interventional pathway. Emphasis has been placed on measuring serum levels of calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH) to monitor disease progression, driven by the assumption that achieving values within the 'normal' range will translate into improved outcomes. Retrospective studies have provided a body of evidence that abnormal levels of mineral biomarkers, and phosphate in particular, are associated with clinical events. Disturbances in vitamin D metabolism are also likely to contribute to the pathophysiology of CKD. Designing studies that yield useful information has proved to be difficult, partly owing to conceptual and financial limitations, but also because of the tight interdependency of calcium, phosphate and PTH, and the potential impact of vitamin D on these mineral metabolites. An intervention that perturbs any one of these factors is likely to exert effects on the others, making isolation of the individual variables almost impossible. However, some therapies in current use have the potential to act as probes to answer questions relating to the association between mineral biomarkers and outcomes in CKD.

### Phosphorus supplementation mitigates perivascular adipose inflammation-induced cardiovascular consequences in early metabolic impairment [^6884049d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

As for the triglyceride levels, although increased serum levels could be tied to increased calorie intake, adipose tissue inflammation was shown to contribute to increased triglyceride levels by a variety of mechanisms including increased insulin resistance. As such, it might be plausible that Pi supplementation could normalize serum triglyceride levels through the amelioration of PVAT inflammation and normalization of insulin levels. A lowering effect on serum lipids was observed for Pi supplementation before. However, a potential caveat for this explanation would be the relatively limited impact of a small adipose depot like PVAT on systemic levels of triglycerides. As such, it might be necessary to invoke additional explanations including the overall improvement of metabolism and energy expenditure previously reported for Pi supplementation.

Interestingly, the observed changes occurred in the absence of a detectable alteration of serum phosphate levels. Nevertheless, most authors agree that intracellular phosphate concentration is 3 orders of magnitude higher than that in the extracellular fluid, and particularly, intracellular free phosphate concentration is believed to be 10‐fold higher; thus, changes in serum concentration might not be the best reflection of the effect on intracellular targets. However, the results of the in vivo treatment experiments are insufficient to support a direct effect of Pi on PVAT inflammation, particularly that Pi interferes with the function of many pathways with impact on endocrine function and inflammation. In this context, increased Pi intake was found to impact calcium homeostasis and decrease serum calcium by affecting parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels; however, this has been reported when high Pi intake levels were coupled with reduced calcium intake. Similarly, serum Pi alterations could affect magnesium levels either through renal excretion or via PTH activation. Not only had PTH been implicated in a cross‐talk with IL‐1β for bone resorption and metabolism, PTH was shown to induce inflammatory IL‐6 (interleukin‐6) expression in osteoblastic cells. However, in the present study, we did not detect changes in serum calcium or magnesium levels. Furthermore, in a recent study we observed no effect for the range of dietary phosphate supplementation used here on rat serum PTH. As such, the full spectrum of mediators facilitating the effect of phosphate supplementation in vivo remains elusive.

### Hypomagnesemia… [^eb627ee3]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Chronic renal failure is accompanied by secondary hyperparathyroidism. Inhibition of parathyroid hormone secretion has been reported to be induced by hypomagnesemia in conditions other than chronic renal failure, since severe hypomagnesemia is rare in chronic renal failure. In the case reported here, the patient had chronic renal failure and malabsorption-induced hypomagnesemia; she exhibited hypoparathyroidism while hypomagnesemic, and hyperparathyroidism after magnesium was replaced. Hypomagnesemia induced parathyroid hormone suppression in this patient with chronic renal failure, despite the presence of chronic hyperfunctioning parathyroid cells.

### Acute effect of high-calcium milk with or without additional magnesium, or calcium phosphate on parathyroid hormone and biochemical markers of bone resorption [^1dc81660]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether there are any differences in the postprandial physiological responses to apple drink (control), calcium phosphate (tricalcium phosphate, TCP) and high-calcium skim milk (HCSM) with or without additional magnesium in postmenopausal women.

Design

Randomized, controlled, cross-over. Measurements after overnight fast before each drink, and subsequently every hour for 8 h postprandially.

Setting

Human Nutrition Studies Laboratory, Milk and Health Research Centre, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

Subjects

Twenty-one healthy postmenopausal women.

Intervention

Four drinks, each 400 ml. (1) Apple drink (25% fruit juice). (2) TCP dispersed in water containing 1200 mg Ca. (3) HCSM containing 1200 mg Ca and 65.5 mg Mg. (4) HCSM containing 1200 mg Ca and 172 mg Mg.

Results

There was no difference in baseline serum calcium, PTH or C-telopeptide levels between drinks. There were no overall differences in serum calcium after apple or after either milk, but after TCP serum calcium increased from a baseline value of 2.12 ± 0.08 to a mean peak of 2.21 ± 0.12 mmol/l (s.d.) (P = 0.0001) after 2 h. There were no significant differences in serum PTH after either apple or HCSM+Mg. In contrast, after TCP, serum PTH decreased from 2.76 ± 0.69 to a mean nadir of 2.23 ± 0.65 pmol/l (P = 0.0001) after 1 h, and after HCSM, it decreased from 2.71 ± 0.78 to a mean nadir of 2.51 ± 0.87 pmol/l (P = 0.007) after 2 h. Serum C-telopeptides decreased after each drink, reaching nadirs after 5 h. At this time the serum values for each of the high calcium drinks were not different from each other, but were significantly less than for apple (P = 0.001 for each), being 0.22 ± 0.09 ng/ml for apple, 0.15 ± 0.08 for TCP, 0.14 ± 0.07 for HCSM and 0.16 ± 0.07 for HCSM+Mg.

Conclusion

Despite differences in serum calcium and PTH responses to the three high-calcium drinks that we tested, there was no distinguishable difference in serum C-telopeptides between high calcium drinks.

### Safety and efficacy of oral human parathyroid hormone (1–34) in hypoparathyroidism: an open-label study [^a33353e0]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) is a rare mineral metabolism disorder, with a prevalence of 22 per 100,000 individuals (1) and is biochemically characterized by low serum calcium and low or undetectable parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The leading cause of hypoPT in adults is iatrogenic, typically secondary to excision or injury incurred during anterior neck surgery. (2) Less common etiologies include autoimmune disease, congenital absence, and genetic disorders resulting in defective biosynthesis or secretion of the hormone. (3) The characteristic hypocalcemia in hypoPT is due to PTH levels insufficient to adequately mobilize calcium from bone, reabsorb filtered calcium from the distal nephron, or increase intestinal calcium absorption by stimulating renal 25‐hydroxyvitamin D 1α‐hydroxylase activity and subsequent 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D) synthesis. Hyperphosphatemia develops due to the loss of the phosphaturic effect of PTH. (4)

### Familial hypomagnesaemia with secondary hypocalcaemia [^4160f805]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular cation and plays an essential role in neuronal, skeletal and cardiac tissue. Hypomagnesaemia can cause hypocalcaemia by inhibiting parathyroid hormone release and inducing resistance at its receptor sites. Untreated hypomagnesaemia can lead to tetany, recurrent seizures, status epilepticus and life-threatening arrhythmias. Primary hypomagnesaemia with secondary hypocalcaemia (HSH) is a rare metabolic disorder of intestinal magnesium absorption. The condition typically presents in the neonatal period with neuromuscular excitability and seizures refractory to antiepileptic therapy. Early diagnosis and prompt magnesium replacement are essential to prevent death or long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae. Fewer than a hundred cases are reported in the literature. Recent advances have added significantly to our understanding of the genetic basis of HSH. We report the presentation and long-term follow-up of an affected female who was found to have a mutation in the transient receptor potential melastatin 6 (TRPM6) gene, encoding a transient receptor potential cation channel.

### Synthetic human parathyroid hormone 1–34 replacement therapy: a randomized crossover trial comparing pump versus injections in the treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism [^d52353d4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Vitamin D therapy for hypoparathyroidism does not restore PTH-dependent renal calcium reabsorption, which can lead to renal damage. An alternative approach, PTH 1–34 administered twice daily, provides acceptable long-term treatment but is associated with nonphysiological serum calcium fluctuation.

Objective

Our objective was to compare continuous PTH 1–34 delivery, by insulin pump, with twice-daily delivery.

Research Design and Methods

In a 6-month, open-label, randomized, crossover trial, PTH 1–34 was delivered by pump or twice-daily sc injection. After each 3-month study period, serum and 24-h urine mineral levels and bone turnover markers were measured daily for 3 d, and 24-h biochemical profiles were determined for serum minerals and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and for urine minerals and cAMP. STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Eight patients with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism (mean ± sd age 46 ± 5.6 yr) participated at a tertiary care referral center.

Results

Pump vs. twice-daily delivery of PTH 1–34 produced less fluctuation in serum calcium, a more than 50% reduction in urine calcium (P = 0.002), and a 65% reduction in the PTH dose to maintain eucalcemia (P < 0.001). Pump delivery also produced higher serum magnesium level (P = 0.02), normal urine magnesium, and reduced need for magnesium supplements. Finally, pump delivery normalized bone turnover markers and significantly lowered urinary cross-linked N-telopeptide of type 1 collagen and pyridinium crosslinks compared with twice-daily injections (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Pump delivery of PTH 1–34 provides the closest approach to date to physiological replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^3748f23b]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — monitoring therapy includes scheduled labs and imaging. It is important to obtain calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels 1 month after initiating therapy, and with stoss therapy a biochemical response occurs in 1 or 2 weeks with an early increase in phosphate; ALP may actually increase in the short term, there is usually an initial increase in 1,25(OH)2-D, then ALP and 1,25(OH)2-D decrease to normal while 25(OH)-D increases to within the reference range. Complete radiologic healing may take months, but changes are evident in 1 week. In 3 months, it is important to obtain calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, ALP, 25(OH)-D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and one may consider obtaining a urine sample to determine the calcium/creatinine ratio. A radiograph should be repeated at 3 months, and subsequently 25(OH)-D levels should be monitored yearly.

### Elevated PTH with normal serum calcium level: a structured approach [^0f0a2910]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism is a common biochemical finding, usually identified during an assessment of bone or renal health. Hypercalcaemia must be considered by calculation of adjusted calcium, and a careful history taken to assess dietary calcium intake and for the possibility of a malabsorption syndrome. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) should be measured and replaced if indicated. The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and PTH were measured. In this brief review we describe the assessment of a patient with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.
