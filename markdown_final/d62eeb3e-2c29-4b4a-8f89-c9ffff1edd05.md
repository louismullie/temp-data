## Question

8 month old fever of 103

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage an 8-month-old infant with a fever of 103°F. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the age group and what 103°F means in Celsius. Then, I should review the post-vaccine era risks of serious bacterial infection and which sources are most likely at 8 months. Next, I will prioritize diagnostic testing with a focus on urine, consider when to obtain blood tests and cultures, decide about chest radiography and lumbar puncture, determine disposition, outline antibiotic considerations with careful verification of applicability by age, and finish with caregiver education and follow-up planning while double-checking that each step is supported by guidelines and data.

> Let me first convert and frame the scenario accurately and verify the epidemiology implications. A temperature of 103°F is 39.4°C, which is a high fever but below the hyperpyrexia thresholds often studied at ≥ 40 to 40.5°C, and at 8 months the child falls into the 3–36 month group where evaluation is more selective than in ≤ 60–90 day infants, especially in the modern immunization era that has markedly reduced occult bacteremia from pneumococcus and Hib, shifting our attention toward UTI and pneumonia as the most relevant serious bacterial sources in this age range [^111h9nV5] [^113YZzEv].

> Hold on, I should verify absolute risk to avoid over-testing. In well-appearing children 3–36 months with fever without source, the rate of bacteremia is generally under 1% in the post-conjugate vaccine era, although hyperpyrexia cohorts at ≥ 40.5°C show higher SBI prevalence largely driven by pneumonia and UTI with bacteremia remaining uncommon; since 39.4°C is below those hyperpyrexic thresholds, the overall invasive bacteremia risk here remains low while UTI and pneumonia are still the key concerns to exclude [^111h9nV5] [^113t38M2] [^113YZzEv].

> Next, I should prioritize urine testing because I need to ensure we do not miss the most common SBI in this age group. Wait, let me verify guideline scope for 2–24 months: consensus recommends urinalysis and urine culture for febrile infants 2–24 months without a clear source, with catheterization or SPA for specimen collection and a low threshold to culture even with a negative dip if pretest probability is elevated by sex, uncircumcised status, fever height, or absence of another source, given UTI prevalence in this group and the clinical stakes of a missed diagnosis [^112R1AoS] [^111WEfiG] [^117CSav9] [^115nR3T3].

> I need to check my impulse to order broad blood work in all cases. CBC and inflammatory markers such as CRP may correlate with SBI but have limited standalone diagnostic performance in older infants, and routine blood cultures in well-appearing 3–36 month children with fever without source have very low yield and are generally discouraged; I should reserve blood tests and culture for toxic appearance, immunocompromise, persistently high fever with concerning clinical features, or markedly abnormal biomarkers when obtained [^111h9nV5] [^113VjgM9] [^113YZzEv].

> Hmm, wait a minute, do I need a chest x-ray just because the fever is high. Let me verify: chest radiography is symptom-driven beyond 28 days and should be considered when there is cough, hypoxia, rales, tachypnea, or fever lasting more than 48 hours, but avoided when wheezing suggests bronchiolitis or asthma; so, without respiratory signs or persistent fever, I should not obtain a CXR routinely in this well-appearing 8-month-old [^11616cz7] [^1163uiaW] [^115vtCCS].

> I should confirm whether a lumbar puncture has any role here. For well-appearing infants older than 28 days, LP is generally not indicated unless there are signs of central nervous system involvement, toxic appearance, or other high-risk features; moreover, in those with clear viral diagnoses LP may be deferred and antibiotics withheld, and these principles argue strongly against LP in a well-appearing 8-month-old with isolated fever and no neurologic signs [^116bzNDw] [^1123n1bf].

> Let me now examine the clinical appearance and disposition decisions and double-check I am not underestimating risk. If the child is well-appearing and can be reliably followed, outpatient management with targeted testing is appropriate, given the low rate of occult bacteremia and the central role of urine testing; conversely, toxic appearance, poor perfusion, respiratory distress, or concerning clinical change should prompt a full sepsis evaluation and admission with parenteral antibiotics pending cultures [^1163uiaW] [^111h9nV5].

> I will now reconsider how fever height modifies risk, because I don't want to miss a signal. Some studies in infants ≤ 90 days show that higher temperatures are associated with increased odds of SBI, but the effect sizes are modest and not sufficient alone for decision-making; in older infants like this 8-month-old, height of fever should be interpreted alongside clinical appearance and focused testing rather than driving invasive workups by itself [^114CKUWU] [^111hGhmf] [^116vd3f5].

> Next, I should review antibiotic management, but hold on, I need to ensure age-appropriate guidance. Initially, I thought to apply the AAP 2021 8–60 day algorithms with ampicillin plus cefotaxime for suspected bacteremia or meningitis, but that regimen is not designed for an 8-month-old; I should correct this and state that, for this age, empiric antibiotics are not indicated unless a bacterial source is identified or strongly suspected, in which case therapy should be targeted to the source, for example oral therapy for UTI when stable as supported by pediatric guidance, whereas parenteral therapy and admission are reserved for toxicity or invasive infection per local protocols and pediatric infectious disease input [^1126jhDE] [^1163uiaW].

> Let me think about UTI treatment and culture follow-up in the outpatient pathway and make sure the steps are coherent. If urinalysis is positive, I should obtain a urine culture and begin appropriate oral antibiotics with close follow-up, adjusting therapy based on culture and sensitivity, and discontinuing or de-escalating if cultures are negative or the clinical course shows no bacterial source; if all cultures remain negative at 24–36 hours and the child is clinically well, antibiotics should be stopped and supportive care continued [^1126jhDE] [^1163uiaW].

> I should double-check caregiver education and safety-netting. Antipyretic dosing with acetaminophen or ibuprofen in age-appropriate schedules, hydration, and clear return precautions for persistent fever beyond 48 hours, breathing difficulty, poor intake, lethargy, new rash, or clinical deterioration are essential, with planned re-evaluation if fever persists without an identified source, recognizing that a reliable follow-up plan is a prerequisite for outpatient care in this age group [^1163uiaW] [^11616cz7].

> To summarize and ensure internal consistency before concluding: in an 8-month-old with 39.4°C fever, I will focus on clinical appearance, prioritize urinalysis with culture to rule out UTI, reserve blood tests and cultures for concerning presentations, obtain CXR only with respiratory indications or prolonged fever, avoid LP in a well-appearing child without neurologic signs, manage as outpatient if reliable follow-up is assured, and use targeted antibiotics only when a bacterial source is identified, all within the context of low post-vaccine era occult bacteremia risk but continued vigilance for UTI and pneumonia as the leading concerns [^111h9nV5] [^112R1AoS] [^1163uiaW] [^11616cz7] [^113YZzEv].

A fever of 103°F (39.4°C) in an 8-month-old is common and usually viral [^116F9CYx], but **UTI is the most common SBI** [^113VjgM9] and must be excluded [^114ECfC2] [^115v7KNE]. Immediate evaluation is required if the infant is **ill-appearing, lethargic, or inconsolable**, or has **poor feeding, dehydration, respiratory distress, or a seizure**. For well-appearing infants, **obtain a urinalysis and urine culture** [^117CSav9]; consider CBC [^113VjgM9], blood culture, and chest X-ray if respiratory symptoms are present [^1163uiaW] [^11616cz7]. Treat with acetaminophen or ibuprofen [^116F9CYx], ensure hydration, and arrange close follow-up within 24–48 hours. Hospitalize if the infant appears toxic; has persistent vomiting or dehydration; or if a serious bacterial infection is suspected.

## Common causes of fever in 8-month-old infants

Fever in this age group is usually viral [^116F9CYx], but bacterial infections — especially UTIs, the **most common SBI** — must be considered [^113VjgM9] [^115v7KNE] [^114ECfC2].

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Viral infections | - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) <br/> - Influenza [^113VjgM9] <br/> - Parainfluenza <br/> - Adenovirus <br/> - Enterovirus <br/> - Human herpesvirus 6 (roseola) <br/> - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [^111Hhk9x] |
| Bacterial infections | - Urinary tract infection (UTI) [^113VjgM9] <br/> - Otitis media <br/> - Pneumonia <br/> - Streptococcal pharyngitis <br/> - Meningitis (less common but serious) [^114ECfC2] |
| Other causes | - Teething (controversial, usually mild fever) <br/> - Immunization reactions (typically within 48 hours post-vaccination) [^112Nyave] |

## Clinical significance of a fever of 103°F (39.4°C)

A 103°F fever is significant but not uncommon in this age group. The height of fever alone **does not reliably predict SBI** [^113VjgM9], but higher temperatures are associated with increased risk and warrant careful evaluation [^114ECfC2] [^113YZzEv].

---

## Recommended clinical evaluation and diagnostic tests

Evaluation of an 8-month-old with fever should include a **thorough history, physical examination, and targeted diagnostic testing** based on clinical findings [^116F9CYx].

---

### History and physical examination

Assess the **duration and pattern of fever** by documenting onset, course, and associated symptoms such as cough, rhinorrhea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, irritability, and lethargy. Confirm immunization status and ensure the infant is up to date on vaccinations. Review exposure history, including recent sick contacts, travel, and daycare attendance. On examination, evaluate for signs of serious illness, dehydration, respiratory distress, rash, and focal infections (e.g. otitis media or pneumonia).

---

### Diagnostic tests

- **Urinalysis and urine culture**: Essential to rule out UTI, the most common SBI in this age group [^113VjgM9] [^117CSav9].
- **Complete blood count (CBC) and inflammatory markers (CRP, procalcitonin)**: Consider if the infant appears ill or if there is suspicion of bacterial infection [^113VjgM9] [^116F9CYx].
- **Blood culture**: Consider if the infant appears ill or if there is suspicion of bacteremia [^111h9nV5].
- **Chest X-ray**: Indicated if respiratory symptoms (cough, tachypnea, hypoxia) are present [^1163uiaW] [^11616cz7].
- **Lumbar puncture**: Generally not indicated in well-appearing infants older than 3 months unless there are signs of meningitis or severe illness [^1123n1bf].

---

## Indications for immediate medical attention or hospitalization

Immediate **medical attention or hospitalization** is indicated if the infant has any of the following:

- **Ill appearance**: Lethargy, inconsolability, poor perfusion, or signs of sepsis.
- **Respiratory distress**: Tachypnea, retractions, nasal flaring, grunting, or hypoxia.
- **Dehydration**: Persistent vomiting, poor oral intake, decreased urine output, or signs of dehydration [^116F9CYx].
- **Seizure**: Febrile seizure or any seizure activity [^111uqA6R].
- **Persistent high fever**: Fever ≥ 104°F (40°C) or fever lasting > 5 days without a clear source.
- **Underlying medical conditions**: Immunocompromised state, chronic illness, or recent hospitalization.

---

## Management strategies for fever in 8-month-old infants

Management of fever in this age group focuses on **symptomatic relief, hydration, and close monitoring** [^116F9CYx].

---

### Antipyretic medications

For **acetaminophen**, give 10–15 mg/kg every 4–6 hours as needed. For **ibuprofen**, give 5–10 mg/kg every 6–8 hours as needed (approved for infants ≥ 6 months) [^116F9CYx].

---

### Hydration and supportive care

Encourage **fluid intake** with breast milk, formula, or oral rehydration solutions. Monitor for dehydration by assessing for decreased urine output, dry mucous membranes, or a sunken fontanelle. Provide comfort measures such as lightweight clothing, a comfortable room temperature, and gentle cooling if needed.

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Arrange **close follow-up**, with re-evaluation within 24–48 hours if the fever persists or the infant's condition worsens. Provide **parental education** on warning signs and when to seek immediate medical attention [^116F9CYx].

---

## Potential complications of untreated or improperly managed fever

Untreated or improperly managed fever in infants can lead to **serious complications**, including:

- **Serious bacterial infections**: UTI, pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis [^114ECfC2] [^115v7KNE] [^113VjgM9].
- **Febrile seizures**: Common in infants and young children [^114vxEjf] [^111uqA6R].
- **Dehydration**: Due to increased fluid loss and decreased intake [^116F9CYx].
- **Delayed diagnosis**: Missed underlying serious illness or infection [^1163uiaW].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

The prognosis for an 8-month-old with a 103°F fever is **generally favorable**, particularly if the infant is well-appearing and receives appropriate evaluation and management. Most febrile illnesses in this age group are self-limited viral infections, but careful evaluation is necessary to identify and treat any underlying bacterial infections or other serious illnesses [^111P7CTN].

---

A 103°F fever in an 8-month-old is common and usually viral, but bacterial infections — especially UTIs — must be considered [^117CSav9]. Immediate medical attention is required if the infant appears **ill** or has **respiratory distress, dehydration, or seizures**. Management includes antipyretics, hydration, and close monitoring, and the prognosis is generally favorable with appropriate care [^116F9CYx].

### Incidence and predictors of serious bacterial infections among 57- to 180-day-old infants [^113VjgM9]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Numerous researchers have investigated fever in infants under 2 months of age. However, the etiology of fever and the usefulness of screening tests in older infants, aged 2 to 6 months, is not well studied.

This was a prospective study of febrile infants aged 57 to 180 days. Evaluations included blood and urine tests and direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing of nasal swabs for respiratory viruses. Additional studies were performed at the discretion of managing clinicians.

Serious bacterial illness (SBI) was diagnosed in 44 (10.3%) of 429 infants: 41 with bacteriuria and 4 with bacteremia. One infant had concurrent Escherichia coli bacteriuria and bacteremia. Lumbar puncture, performed in 58 (13.5%) infants, revealed no cases of bacterial meningitis. DFAs were positive in 163 (38.0%) infants, with the majority indicating respiratory syncytial virus or influenza A. SBI was noted in 4.9% of infants with positive DFA results. Age and height of fever were not significant predictors of SBI. White blood cell count (17.1 K/mm³ vs. 12.4 K/mm³) and CRP (2.6 mg/dL vs. 0.9 mg/dL) were elevated in infants with SBI, as was the Yale Observation Score (9.4 vs. 8.0).

A substantial proportion (10.3%) of older febrile infants have SBI. In the post-pneumococcal vaccine era, only one infant had pneumococcal disease; bacteremia was noted in 0.9%. Bacteriuria is commonly associated with fever in this age range. Infants older than 8 weeks remain at risk for bacteremia and bacteriuria, regardless of positive DFA or other apparent sources of fever. CRP is a better indicator than white blood cell count.

### Management of fever in infants and young children [^1163uiaW]. American Family Physician (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for febrile infants, specifically with respect to chest X-ray (CXR), the AAFP 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining a CXR in febrile children over 28 days of age based on clinical presentation and laboratory examinations. It is advised to avoid obtaining radiography for wheezing suggestive of bronchiolitis or asthma.

### Pyrexia in a young infant - is height of fever associated with serious bacterial infection [^114ECfC2]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Of the infants with an SBI, 181 (87.4%) were diagnosed with a UTI. Escherichia coli (E. coli) (n = 105, 57.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 13, 7.1%) were the most likely bacterial pathogens. This was followed by 21 infants (9.2%) who were diagnosed with bacteraemia, of which E. coli (n = 9, 42.8%) and S. agalactiae (n = 6, 28.6%) were the most common. There were 16 patients diagnosed with bacterial meningitis (9.2%), among whom 3 patients had E. coli, and 2 had S. agalactiae meningitis. The other cases were treated as bacterial meningitis based on abnormal CSF fluid analysis. Of those diagnosed with an SBI, 12 (5.8%) had more than one positive culture, the most frequent being a UTI with concurrent bacteraemia (n = 6, 50.0%), followed by bacterial meningitis with bacteraemia (n = 4, 33.3%). In patients with a UTI, 149 (82.3%) were older than 28 days of age.

- **Characteristics of patients**:
	- Fluid resuscitation was required in 22 (10.6%), inotropic support in 3 (1.4%), and 6 (2.9%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). UTI was the most common SBI (n = 3, 50%) among those admitted to the ICU. The median length of stay in ICU was 2.0 days (IQR 1.0–9.3) for infants with an SBI compared to 3.0 days (IQR 1.0–8.5) for infants without an SBI (p = 0.842). One patient death was documented secondary to bacteraemia complicated by fulminant liver failure. This patient had underlying trisomy 21 with pulmonary hypertension.

### Evaluation of child with fever without source: Review of literature and update [^114Bm6GG]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Fever is one of the most common reasons for a visit to the primary care provider or the emergency department. Traditionally, clinicians have used various risk-stratification strategies to identify serious bacterial infections (SBI) without an obvious source in febrile children because missed bacterial infections in such children can result in meningitis, sepsis, and death; therefore, early and accurate identification of SBIs is critical. Infants aged less than 60 to 90 days are at the greatest risk of SBI. The epidemiology of SBI continues to evolve, especially after the successful introduction of conjugate vaccines against *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Haemophilus influenzae*.

### Pyrexia in a young infant - is height of fever associated with serious bacterial infection [^111hGhmf]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

As shown in Table 3, the univariate analysis indicated that temperature (p = 0.017) and gender (p < 0.001) were statistically significant for serious bacterial infection (SBI). In the multivariable analysis, a temperature of ≥ 39 °C was associated with an increased risk of SBI (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–2.56, p = 0.040), after accounting for gender, age, and SIS. When analyzed as a continuous variable, we found that the height of the temperature was consistently associated with SBI after adjusting for age, gender, and SIS (aOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.33 — 2.33, p < 0.001).

- **Univariate and categorical multivariate analysis of temperature trend and risk for SBI**: Of note, 370/1057 (35.0%) of infants in our study population did not undergo a lumbar puncture. However, infants who did not undergo a lumbar puncture and in whom no source of fever was found were monitored until at least 24 hours afebrile prior to discharge to ensure that an SBI would not be missed.

### Risk-stratification in febrile infants 29 to 60 days old: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^116qmiHP]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Fever is one of the most common chief complaints in the emergency department (ED), comprising 10–20% of all pediatric ED visits. Among infants ≤ 60 days old, the prevalence of serious bacterial infections (SBI), including bacterial meningitis, bacteremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI), in the setting of fever ranges from 8 to 13%. Such infections pose potential risks of morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed.

The evaluation and management of young febrile infants involve extensive diagnostic testing, frequently followed by hospitalization and antibiotic therapy. Balancing the costs of medical evaluation and treatment, particularly unnecessary hospitalization, with the risks of misdiagnosis poses a clinical challenge. Over the last 40 years, multiple clinical prediction rules have been published to identify a cohort of infants at low risk of SBI.

Older prediction rules require routine lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. More recent prediction rules do not require CSF testing for risk stratification and offer improved diagnostic accuracy. These rules carry the potential to improve clinical outcomes, decrease variation in care, and reduce the high costs associated with the evaluation and management of febrile infants.

The cost-effectiveness of published clinical prediction rules in this population is unknown. The decision to adopt a clinical prediction rule to evaluate febrile infants must be weighed against the cost and effectiveness of established risk-stratification strategies.

In this investigation, we use decision modeling techniques to evaluate…

### Fever in the pediatric patient [^116rDVDj]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Fever is the most common reason that children and infants are brought to emergency departments. Emergency physicians face the challenge of quickly distinguishing benign from life-threatening conditions. The management of fever in children is guided by the patient's age, immunization status, immune status, as well as the results of a careful physical examination, appropriate laboratory tests, and radiographic views. In this article, the evaluation and treatment of children with fevers of known and unknown origin are described. Causes of common and dangerous conditions that include fever in their manifestation are also discussed.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^116beZNb]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management of febrile infants, specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy (parenteral), the AAP 2021 guidelines recommend administering parenteral antibiotics if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis suggests bacterial meningitis in well-appearing febrile infants aged 29–60 days.

### Perception and management of fever in infants up to six months of age: A survey of US pediatricians [^111tP813]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

In general, the intensity of treatment or management recommendations provided by respondents increased with higher levels of fever and was inversely related to infant age. Whittler et al. conducted a survey in 1998 to examine pediatricians' recommendations for infants with a body temperature of 40.3°C. In their study, 96% of the responders recommended hospital admission for 3-week-old febrile infants, and 62% recommended hospital admission for 7-week-old febrile infants. In our study, 86.0% of respondents recommended immediate ER visit or hospital admission for infants 0–2 months of age with a body temperature greater than 40.0°C. Whittler et al. found that 6% of respondents recommended hospital admission for 4-month-old infants with a fever of 40.3°C, while 31.1% of the respondents in our study recommended hospital admission for the same scenario. The difference in these results may be due to the different designs of the questionnaires for the two surveys. In our survey, all recommendations were based on a scenario of parents' calls, while in Whittler's study, the participating pediatricians were provided a scenario of a clinic visit. We found that physician respondents were more inclined to recommend an ER visit in response to infant fever after office hours rather than during office hours. Results indicate that a significant portion of recommendations for ER visits would have been recommendations for a same-day office visit had the fever occurred during office hours. These results may have practical implications for the organization of emergency departments during off-hours.

### Incidence of bacteremia and serious bacterial infections in hyperpyrexic infants offered universal pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13 and Haemophilus influenzae B immunization [^113YZzEv]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Low credibility.

High fevers, especially in young children, often alarm clinicians and prompt extensive evaluation based on perceptions of increased risk of serious bacterial infection (SBI), and even brain damage or seizure disorders.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of SBI in infants aged 3 to 36 months with fever ≥ 40.5°C in a population of infants offered universal pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13 and Haemophilus influenzae B immunization.

- **Methods**: This study is a retrospective review of all infants aged 3 to 36 months with temperature ≥ 40.5°C presenting to a tertiary care pediatric emergency department over a 30-month period in an era of universal pneumococcal conjugate 13 and H. influenzae B immunization.

- **Results**: SBI was recorded in 54 (21.8%) of 247 study infants, most commonly pneumonia in 30 patients (12.1%) and urinary tract infection in 16 patients (6.5%). Two patients had positive blood cultures, yielding a bacteremia rate of 0.8%. Patients with SBI had a significantly higher WBC count (P < 0.0001) and C-reactive protein levels (P < 0.0001), and were significantly more likely to be hospitalized (P < 0.0001).

- **Discussion**: Although SBI was common (21.8%) in our cohort of hyperpyrexic infants universally offered vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate 13 and H. influenzae B vaccines, bacteremia was a rare finding (0.8%).

### Reappraisal of criteria used to predict serious bacterial illness in febrile infants less than 8 weeks of age [^111YnBXF]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to re-evaluate the Philadelphia protocol and the Rochester criteria for identifying infants at low risk for serious bacterial illness (SBI) in a new population.

- **Methods**: The authors prospectively enrolled infants 56 days of age or younger with rectal temperatures greater than 100.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Physicians assigned an overall impression of sepsis and objectively scored each infant using the Infant Observation Score. Following a history and physical examination, a complete sepsis evaluation was performed. Infants were considered to have SBI if their blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, or stool cultures grew pathogenic bacteria. Infants were assigned to high- and low-risk groups for SBI according to the Philadelphia protocol and the Rochester criteria by a single investigator blinded to the final culture results. The test performance parameters of the Philadelphia protocol and the Rochester criteria in this population were compared with those reported from previous validation studies.

- **Results**: One hundred eighty-one infants were assigned to risk groups using the Philadelphia protocol, and 259 infants using the Rochester criteria. In this population, the negative predictive value (NPV) of the Philadelphia protocol was 97.1% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 85.1% to 99.8%) compared with 99.7% in the original report, and the NPV of the Rochester criteria was 97.3% (95% CI = 90.5% to 99.2%) compared with a prior report of 98.9%.

- **Conclusions**: The Philadelphia protocol and the Rochester criteria maintained their previously reported NPVs when applied to a new population.

### A 3-month-old infant with atypical Kawasaki disease [^11549KVM]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Since diagnosing Kawasaki disease (KD) in infants younger than 6 months is difficult, any febrile infants who have had a fever for 7 days or more without other explanations, even without any clinical clues of KD, should receive a blood analysis of systemic vascular response. If the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) is elevated, echocardiography should be performed. However, there are many limitations of echocardiography in the diagnosis of KD:

- **Operator dependency**: Echocardiography is an operator-dependent imaging technique.
- **Patient cooperation**: It requires cooperation from the patient.
- **Growth challenges**: The growth of children and the increasing body size cause difficulties in visualizing the coronary arteries.

These issues could be diagnostic limitations as the sensitivity and specificity of echocardiography to determine coronary artery stenosis are uncertain.

There are many studies concentrating on the early diagnostic criteria of infantile KD. Kang et al. reviewed medical records of 64 KD patients from January 2010 to October 2014. Twenty of the analyzed KD patients were infants less than 1 year of age. They discovered that infants had higher rates of inflammation at the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) inoculation site (P < 0.001), but a lower incidence of changes in the extremities (P = 0.029) and cervical lymphadenopathy (P = 0.006). They stated that BCGitis is an initial sign that could lead to the diagnosis of incomplete infantile KD. Yoon et al. reviewed medical histories of 239 KD patients from January 2013 until June 2015, of which 26 were less than 6 months old. They recognized that infants less than 6 months with KD rarely express cervical lymphadenopathy (P = 0.005) or non-exudative conjunctival injection.

### Evaluating fever of unidentifiable source in young children [^115J4bzk]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Most children will have been evaluated for a febrile illness by 36 months of age. Although the majority will have a self-limited viral illness, studies performed before the implementation of Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines indicated that approximately 10 percent of children younger than 36 months without evident sources of fever had occult bacteremia and serious bacterial infections. More recent studies have found lower rates of bacterial infection, ranging from 1.6 to 1.8 percent.

Any infant younger than 29 days and any child that appears toxic should undergo a complete sepsis work-up. However, nontoxic-appearing children aged one to 36 months, who present with a fever of no apparent source and have received the appropriate vaccinations, could undergo screening laboratory analysis and be sent home with close follow-up. Empiric intramuscular antibiotics are suggested for some children; however, cerebrospinal fluid studies should be obtained first.

Because immunizations have recently decreased infection rates for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type b, the recommendations for evaluating and treating febrile children are evolving and could involve fewer tests and less presumptive treatment in the future. A cautious approach should still be taken based on the potential for adverse consequences of unrecognized and untreated serious bacterial infections.

### Association between dehydration and fever during the first week of life [^114Zdycx]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Trying to differentiate serious bacterial infection (SBI) from a self-limiting illness in febrile infants seen in the pediatric emergency department (PED) is a significant challenge. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of dehydration and its relationship to SBI in febrile full-term newborns under 1 week of age seen in a PED.

- **Methods**: A retrospective observational study was carried out on all children younger than 8 days of age with fever who presented to a single, tertiary care PED from January 2009 to April 2014. Dehydration was defined as plasma sodium > 150 mmol/L or > 10% loss of birth weight. SBI was defined by the presence of a positive culture in the blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid; osteoarticular infection; bacterial enteritis; or pneumonia. The primary analysis was the proportion of children with dehydration. A secondary analysis compared the proportion of infection according to hydration status.

- **Results**: Of the 895 children under 8 days of age who visited the PED, 69 consulted for fever. Seven patients were excluded because they were transferred from another hospital. Sixty-two eligible patients were included in the final analysis. Of these, 17 (27%) were dehydrated according to our definition. Only 2 patients had an SBI while 2 others had a final diagnosis of viral myocarditis and encephalitis, respectively. None of the 4 children with serious infection fulfilled our definition of dehydration, and all had a plasma sodium level lower than 145 mmol/L.

- **Conclusions**: Dehydration is frequently associated with fever in infants younger than 8 days.

### Should blood cultures be obtained in all infants 3 to 36 months presenting with significant fever [^111h9nV5]. Hospital Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Fever without source (FWS) in children aged 3–36 months is a common presenting complaint. Due to changes in immunization practices and their effects on rates of bacteremia, older guidelines may no longer be applicable. We reviewed the literature regarding the necessity of obtaining a blood culture in non-toxic children in this age group with FWS.

- **Data sources**: We conducted a MEDLINE search on the topic of bacteremia in febrile children aged 3–36 months from 2004 to the present.

- **Results**: Eight studies were included. Although the studies varied in terms of approach and analysis, all suggested a rate of bacteremia in a non-toxic, febrile child aged 3–36 months to be less than 1%.

- **Conclusions**: Strong consideration should be given to foregoing blood culture in a non-toxic child aged 3–36 months with FWS.

### Is 15 days an appropriate cut-off age for considering serious bacterial infection in the management of febrile infants [^1161sEnA]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Febrile infants under 3 months of age are at a greater risk for serious bacterial infection (SBI), with the risk being inversely correlated with age. Most protocols recommend hospital admission for all febrile infants under 28 days. However, as the prevalence of SBI is not uniform in this age group, some authors have considered decreasing this cut-off age to allow for ambulatory management of selected patients meeting low-risk criteria.

The objective of this study was to determine whether 15 days is a suitable cut-off age for different approaches to managing infants with fever. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study of infants under 3 months of age with fever without a source, seen between September 1, 2003, and August 30, 2010, in the pediatric emergency department of a tertiary teaching hospital. All infants with a fever without a source (≤ 38 °C) were included. The data collected included age, sex, temperature, diagnosis, management in the pediatric emergency department, and outcome.

Data were collected for 1575 infants, among whom 311 (19.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.7–21.7) were found to have an SBI. The rate of SBI in patients aged 15 to 21 days was 33.3% (95% CI: 23.7%-42.9%), similar to that among infants aged 7 to 14 days (31.9%, 95% CI: 21.1%-42.7%), and higher than the rate among those older than 21 days (18.3%, 95% CI: 16.3–20.3%).

In conclusion, febrile infants aged 15 to 21 days have an SBI rate similar to younger infants and higher than older infants. It is not appropriate to establish the approach…

### A 2-year-old with 4 weeks of daily fever [^113X6UB3]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old female presents for evaluation of 4 weeks of daily fevers. When the fevers began, she had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, which quickly resolved. The fevers persisted, however, with a maximum of 40°C. The child's review of symptoms was significant for a 1-kg weight loss over the past month. Ten months before presentation, she had moved from Saudi Arabia with her family. One week before the onset of symptoms, she had visited a petting zoo. During episodes of fever, the patient was ill-appearing and had an elevated heart rate and respiratory rate.

On examination, she was found to be thin, febrile, tachycardic, and with scattered lymphadenopathy. Results of laboratory tests were remarkable for an elevated white blood cell count of 16,100 cells per uL with a neutrophilic predominance. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated at 99 mm/h and 27 mg/dL, respectively. A chest radiograph indicated a small amount of fluid in the interlobar fissures. Our expert panel examines her case, offers a definition of fever of unknown origin, and makes diagnostic considerations.

### Evaluation and management of the febrile young infant (< 90 days old) in the absence of universally accepted criteria for the risk of serious bacterial infection (SBI) [^111M6e4J]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2021). Low credibility.

Fever (≥ 38°C) in young infants (< 90 days of age) represents a common clinical challenge for pediatricians in both outpatient and inpatient settings. While the majority of febrile infants will ultimately be determined to have no serious infection, serious infections, when present, can cause significant morbidity and mortality in affected patients. The evaluation and empiric treatment of presumptive serious infection carry associated risks, such as medication side effects, stress and disruption of hospitalization, and nosocomial infection, as well as substantial costs. Therefore, attempts have been made to clearly define an accurate method that enables clinicians to correctly stratify which infants are at relatively low risk for serious bacterial infection (SBI) and may, therefore, be safely managed less aggressively.

Although this topic has been extensively studied and discussed, no single protocol has been universally adopted, and clinical practices continue to vary. This paper discusses multiple distinct protocols currently in use, as well as the evidence upon which they are based, and the points on which the evidence is not yet definitive.

### Evaluation and management of febrile infants in the emergency department [^112YW25h]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Managing fever in pediatric patients has always been a high-risk aspect of emergency medicine, and this is especially true of infants. The task of correctly discerning "well" versus "ill" can be difficult for these patients because they cannot describe their symptoms and have not developed normal social behaviors. Recent studies, however, have greatly enhanced physicians' understanding of how best to manage these young patients. With this research comes an array of new recommendations for diagnosing and treating febrile infants, which can be incorporated into the practice of every emergency physician who cares for pediatric patients.

### Management of fever in infants and children [^115ViT6G]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

There is no question that fever is a source of great consternation for both parents and physicians; however, it is impossible to predict with certainty the outcome of every febrile illness. Inherent in the words "diagnostic impression" is a degree of uncertainty. The only question remaining is how much uncertainty is in the best interest of the child. Physicians strive to use the existing scientific data to best determine the prevalence of disease and outcome. At the same time, they must recognize the limitations of both the data and their ability to be generalized to every population. Everything clinicians do carries risks and costs, which they must balance against the incidence of complications and the benefits of testing. To take away clinical judgment is to reduce physicians to technicians, not clinicians.

- **Urine culture is positive**: This is essential for confirming the presence of a urinary tract infection.

- **All other bacterial cultures are negative at 24–36 hours**: Ensures that there is no other ongoing bacterial infection.

- **The infant is clinically well or improving**: Indicators include improvements such as reduced fever and enhanced feeding.

### Management of febrile children in the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine era [^112N6P4x]. Clinical Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate physician attitudes toward the management of young febrile children since the introduction of the conjugate heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV 7). Seven thousand five hundred pediatricians and 7,500 emergency department (ED) physicians were surveyed regarding their management of a febrile 7-month-old child and 20-month-old child without an apparent fever focus. Specifically, physicians were asked how they would manage a febrile child who had and who had not been vaccinated with PCV 7.

When evaluating a febrile 7-month-old child, pediatricians would order 5% fewer complete blood cell (CBC) counts and 6% fewer blood cultures (p < 0.0001) if a child was vaccinated. ED physicians would order 13% fewer CBCs and 15% fewer blood cultures (p < 0.0001). ED physicians and pediatricians ordered fewer chest radiographs, with an 8% and 3% decrease, respectively (p < 0.0001).

For the PCV 7 immunized 20-month-old child, pediatricians ordered 6% fewer CBC counts and 8% fewer blood cultures (p < 0.0001). ED physicians would perform 12% fewer CBC counts and cultures (p < 0.0001). Four percent fewer pediatricians and 10% fewer ED physicians would order chest radiographs (p < 0.0001). When treating the vaccinated 7-month-old child, pediatricians would use 11% less ceftriaxone, and ED physicians 20% less (p < 0.0001). Twelve percent fewer pediatricians and 19% fewer ED physicians would administer ceftriaxone (p < 0.0001) for the 20-month-old vaccinated child.

Our survey suggests that pediatricians and ED physicians would order fewer CBC counts and blood cultures when managing febrile children who have been vaccinated with PCV 7.

### Perception and management of fever in infants up to six months of age: a survey of US pediatricians [^116ayG7Z]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Pediatricians' categorization of fever indicates varying perceptions of seriousness based on infant age group. On average, across three age groups (0–2 months, 2–4 months, and 4–6 months), temperatures were categorized as follows: 37.8–38.1°C as mild, 38.3–38.7°C as moderate, 38.8–39.5°C as serious, and 39.5–40.3°C as extremely serious. The perceived seriousness of fevers increased with infant age. For instance, a fever of 39.5 ± 0.9°C (mean ± S.D.) was deemed extremely serious for infants aged 0–2 months, whereas 40.3 ± 0.6°C (mean ± S.D.) was considered extremely serious for infants aged 4–6 months. Regardless of fever category, respondents identified a lower mean temperature for younger age ranges, though differences were not statistically significant.

### Serious bacterial infections in hospitalized febrile infants in the first and second months of life [^115v7KNE]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate protocols assessing the risk of serious bacterial infections (SBI) in febrile infants, distinguishing between neonates < 30 days and those aged 30–60 days. The study aimed to compare SBI rates among these groups.

This was a retrospective, population-based cohort study that included all febrile infants ≤ 60 days of age hospitalized in southern Israel from January 2013 through May 2014. The assessment included medical history, physical examination, blood count, and dipstick urine analysis.

Overall, 623 infants were identified: 142 high-risk (HR) infants < 30 days, 95 low-risk (LR) infants < 30 days, 232 HR infants 30–60 days, and 154 LR infants 30–60 days. Urinary tract infection comprised 84.7% (133/157) of all SBIs. Among HR infants, SBI rates were higher in those < 30 days compared to 30–60 days (45.0% vs. 29.3%; P = 0.003), while rates were similar among LR infants (8.4% vs. 11.0%; P = 0.66). In HR infants aged 0–14 days versus 15–60 days, SBI rates were 45.3% versus 33.6% (P = 0.12), and among LR infants, 19.2% versus 8.9% (P = 0.15). Among HR infants, SBI rates were influenced by temperature: 52.8% and 39.5% in infants < 30 days with temperature ≥ 39°C and < 39°C, respectively, and 31.2% and 26.7% in infants ≥ 30 days (P = 0.005, comparing the four groups). Among LR infants, temperature did not affect the rates. Thrombocytopenia was associated with higher SBI rates in HR infants but not in LR infants.

In conclusion, the study indicated variances in SBI rates among infant age groups and risk categories, highlighting the significance of differentiating between infants < 30 days and those aged 30–60 days in risk assessments.

### Factors associated with severe bacterial infection in infants between 91- and 120-days old admitted to the pediatric emergency department [^116GrzjS]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Fever in young infants often raises significant concerns among families. This worry, often fueled by fear, typically leads to visits to the emergency department (ED). In the pediatric emergency department (PED), vital signs and blood tests are rapid parameters that help doctors determine whether to rule in or rule out severe bacterial infection (SBI). In our study conducted in the PED, we found that clinical and laboratory factors, such as male sex, elevated body temperature (BT), increased white blood cell (WBC) counts, higher neutrophil percentages, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, may serve as significant predictors of SBI in febrile infants aged 91–120 days. These findings provide valuable insights for clinicians, enabling them to identify high-risk infants more effectively and ensure that appropriate treatment is initiated without delay, thereby minimizing the risk of complications.

### Perception and management of fever in infants up to six months of age: A survey of US pediatricians [^112Nyave]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine U.S. pediatricians' perceptions and management of fever in infants from birth to six months of age. Pediatricians providing primary care were recruited to participate in the study. Participating pediatricians were asked to complete a survey that contained questions regarding the management and perception of fever in infants, with special emphasis on fever following vaccination.

In general, respondents seemed to be less concerned when fever follows a vaccination, compared to fever of a general nature, and expressed consensus regarding the temperatures they considered to represent mild to extremely serious fevers for different infant age groups.

On average, pediatricians in our sample were less likely to recommend an ER visit or hospital admission to parents of infants with fever occurring within 48 hours after immunization compared to those with fever not occurring post-immunization. Data collected from routine childhood vaccines have shown that fever typically occurs in 1%-10% of infants after vaccination; however, the rate can increase to as high as 30% to about 50% among those who received multiple vaccines. As a benign symptom, fever following immunization generally resolves without long-term sequelae, which may explain why pediatrician respondents were less concerned about fever after immunization.

### Management of fever without source in infants and children [^115nR3T3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Twenty percent of febrile children have fever without an apparent source of infection after history and physical examination. Of these, a small proportion may have an occult bacterial infection, including bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), occult pneumonia, or, rarely, early bacterial meningitis. Febrile infants and young children have, by tradition, been arbitrarily assigned to different management strategies by age group: neonates (birth to 28 days), young infants (29 to 90 days), and older infants and young children (3 to 36 months). Infants younger than 3 months are often managed by using low-risk criteria, such as the Rochester Criteria or Philadelphia Criteria. The purpose of these criteria is to reduce the number of infants hospitalized unnecessarily and to identify infants who may be managed as outpatients by using clinical and laboratory criteria.

In children with fever without source (FWS), occult UTIs occur in 3% to 4% of boys younger than 1 year and 8% to 9% of girls younger than 2 years of age. Most UTIs in boys occur in those who are uncircumcised. Occult pneumococcal bacteremia occurs in approximately 3% of children younger than 3 years with FWS with a temperature of 39.0 degrees C (102.2 degrees F) or greater and in approximately 10% of children with FWS with a temperature of 39.5 degrees C (103.1 degrees F) or greater and a WBC count of 15,000/mm³ or greater. The risk of a child with occult pneumococcal bacteremia later having meningitis is approximately 3%. The new conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (7 serogroups) has an efficacy of 90% for reducing risk.

### Pyrexia in a young infant - is height of fever associated with serious bacterial infection [^116vd3f5]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Our study has revealed some implications when assessing febrile infants in the emergency department (ED). We found that a higher temperature may confer a greater risk for serious bacterial infections (SBIs). However, the height of the fever should be interpreted in conjunction with other risk factors to identify infants at risk for SBIs. Repeated monitoring and clinical assessment are necessary.

### Perception and management of fever in infants up to six months of age: A survey of US pediatricians [^113hEeEt]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Our results indicate that US pediatricians are more concerned about general fever than fever following vaccination. Management and definitions of fever severity by pediatricians in our sample depend on infant age. Recommendations for managing fever were dependent on the fever level, infant age, timing in relation to vaccination, and the time of day fever was reported. These results may be valuable when developing fever management guidelines and when estimating the burden of managing fever in the US.

### Pyrexia in a young infant - is height of fever associated with serious bacterial infection [^114CKUWU]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Febrile infants aged ≤ 90 days constitute a significant proportion of patients seeking care in the emergency department (ED). These infants are vulnerable to serious bacterial infections (SBIs), necessitating early identification to initiate timely investigations and interventions. We aimed to assess whether the height of an infant's temperature upon presentation to the ED is associated with SBI.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review of febrile infants aged ≤ 90 days who presented to our ED between March 31, 2015, and February 28, 2016. We compared the triage temperature of febrile infants with and without SBIs. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) of fever thresholds at triage were presented. A multivariable regression analysis was performed to study the association between the height of temperature and the presence of SBI, presenting the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Results**: Among the 1057 febrile infants analyzed, 207 (19.6%) had an SBI. The mean temperature of infants with an SBI was significantly higher than those without (mean 38.5 °C, standard deviation, SD 0.6 vs. 38.3 °C, SD 0.5, p < 0.005). For temperatures ≥ 39 °C, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for SBI were 15.5% (95%CI 10.8–21.1%), 90.4% (95%CI 88.2–92.3%), 28.1% (95%CI 21.1–36.3%), and 81.4% (95%CI 80.5–82.4%), respectively. The height of fever was consistently associated with SBI after adjusting for age, gender, and SIS (aOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.32–2.33, p < 0.001). However, 32 (15.5%) infants with SBIs had an initial triage temperature ≤ 38 °C.

### Scoping review of clinical decision aids in the assessment and management of febrile infants under 90 days of age [^111n4EV1]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

A database search identified 1550 publications from January 2010 to February 2025. After reviewing titles and abstracts, 53 studies underwent a full-text review. Of these, 32 met the inclusion criteria for this scoping review. The majority (n = 18) of studies were performed in North America, followed by Europe (n = 9) and Asia (n = 5). Funding sources were reported in 14 (45%) studies. Of the 32 studies, 14 were retrospective, 9 were prospective, and 9 were secondary analyses of an available dataset. Infants with fever with a source (FWAS) were excluded from 5 studies. The number of sites per study ranged from 1 to 37, and the sample sizes ranged from 181 to 4411. Most studies focused on a population aged 0 to 90 days (n = 14) or 0 to 60 days (n = 8), while 9 studies excluded infants less than a week old.

- **Invasive bacterial infection (IBI) and serious bacterial infection (SBI)**: Seventeen studies had IBI as their main outcome compared to 11 studies focusing on SBI and 4 studies on both SBI and IBI, respectively. The incidence of IBI, obtained from 28 studies, ranged from 1.6% to 5.9%. The incidence of SBI ranged from 7% to 39% in 21 studies. The authors' definition of IBI was consistent across studies compared to that of SBI, which showed marked variation.

### Cost analysis of emergency department criteria for evaluation of febrile infants ages 29 to 90 days [^114cvZLx]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

To compare the medical costs associated with risk stratification criteria used to evaluate febrile infants 29–90 days of age, a cost analysis study was conducted. The study evaluated the Boston, Rochester, Philadelphia, Step-by-Step, and PECARN criteria. The percentage of infants considered low risk and rates of missed infections were obtained from published literature. Emergency department costs were estimated from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The Health Care Cost and Utilization Project databases were used to estimate the number of infants ages 29–90 days presenting with fever annually, as well as costs for admissions related to missed infections.

A probabilistic Markov model with a Dirichlet prior was used to estimate the transition probability distributions for each outcome, and a gamma distribution was used to model costs. A Markov simulation estimated the distribution of expected annual costs per infant and total annual costs.

For low-risk infants, the mean cost per infant for the criteria were as follows: Rochester: $1050 (IQR $1004-$1092), Philadelphia: $1416 (IQR $1365-$1465), Boston: $1460 (IQR $1411-$1506), Step-by-Step: $942 (IQR $899-$981), and PECARN: $1004 (IQR $956-$1050). An estimated 18,522 febrile 1- to 3-month-old infants present annually, and the estimated total mean costs for their care by criteria were: Rochester, $127.3 million (IQR $126.1-$128.5); Philadelphia, $129.9 million (IQR $128.7-$131.1); Boston, $128.7 million (IQR $127.5-$129.9); Step-by-Step, $126.6 million (IQR $125.4-$127.8); and PECARN, $125.8 million.

### Pyrexia in a young infant - is height of fever associated with serious bacterial infection [^113eMv63]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Febrile infants younger than 90 days old form a significant proportion of patients seeking care in the emergency department (ED). A cross-sectional study estimated 2 million febrile infants ≤ 90 days old presented to EDs in the United States over the recent decade (2007–2017). Among young febrile infants, up to 10–15% have a serious bacterial infection (SBI), defined as bacteremia, meningitis, or urinary tract infection (UTI). Young infants are at risk of SBIs due to an immature immune system, vaccination naivety against common infections, and potential perinatal exposure to certain pathogens. They may develop complications including cognitive deficits, hearing loss, and potential mortality.

Currently, guidelines recommend febrile infants ≤ 28 days old undergo evaluation for SBIs, including a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures, urine cultures, and blood cultures. In specific cases, cultures from stool, fluid, or tissue samples are also recommended, followed by prompt administration of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. For older infants between 28–90 days old, those without clinical or analytical risk factors may not require such extensive evaluation to avoid invasive procedures and unnecessary anxiety. However, as clinical symptoms differentiating minor febrile illnesses from SBI are often absent in young infants, many are still subjected to hospitalization and invasive procedures.

Published literature has provided criteria to identify patients at low risk of SBIs, including the Rochester criteria (RC), Philadelphia criteria (PC), and Boston criteria (BC).

### Can diagnostic and imaging recommendations from the 2011 AAP UTI guidelines be applied to infants < 2 months of age [^113BKhUR]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2022). Low credibility.

In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published guidelines regarding the diagnosis and management of children aged 2 to 24 months with initial febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI). Available data were insufficient to determine whether evidence from studies of 2- to 24-month-olds applies to those < 2 months old, so they were excluded.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to compare demographic, clinical, imaging, and outcome differences between patients < 2 months old and those 2 to 24 months old hospitalized with fUTI. Additionally, it assessed whether diagnostic and imaging recommendations of the AAP 2011 guidelines apply to those < 2 months old.

- **Study design**: A cohort study of patients ≤ 24 months old hospitalized at a children's hospital with fUTI from 2016 to 2018 was conducted. Data were collected via a prospectively generated electronic medical record note template, supplemented with retrospective chart review. Primary outcomes included differences in demographics, clinical presentation, urine culture results, and imaging utilization/results by age group. Secondary outcomes included surgical procedures, UTI recurrence, and 90-day all-cause readmissions and emergency department (ED) revisits. Univariate and bivariate statistics were utilized to compare age groups.

- **Results**: Overall, 137 patients were included (median age 70 days, 55.5% male [92.1% uncircumcised], 53.3% Hispanic/Latino, 89.8% first fUTI). There were no demographic differences between groups, except children < 2 months old were more frequently male (71.2% vs. 43.6%, p = 0.002).

The extracted data were collected and are represented in tables, graphs, and figures. Clinical decision aids (CDAs) were grouped into those using low-risk criteria and prediction models without low-risk criteria. Where a CDA had been validated in more than one study, the data were aggregated, and the diagnostic performance was reported as a range. The derivation methods of the CDAs were compared and analyzed based on themes.

### Management and outcomes of previously healthy, full-term, febrile infants ages 7 to 90 days [^114bDgTn]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

There is considerable variation in the approach to infants presenting to the emergency department and outpatient clinics with fever without a source. We set out to describe the clinical practice regarding culture acquisition on febrile young infants and review the outcomes of infants with and without cultures obtained.

- **Methods**: This study analyzed Kaiser Permanente Northern California's electronic medical record to identify all febrile, full-term, previously healthy infants born between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2013, presenting for care between 7 and 90 days of age.

- **Results**: During this 3-year study, 96,156 full-term infants were born at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. A total of 1,380 infants presented for care with a fever, with an incidence rate of 14.4 (95% confidence interval: 13.6–15.1) per 1,000 full-term births. Fifty-nine percent of infants 7 to 28 days old had a full evaluation compared to 25% of infants 29 to 60 days old and 5% of infants 61 to 90 days old. Older infants with lower febrile temperatures, presenting to an office setting, were less likely to have a culture. In the 30 days after fevers, 1% of infants returned with a urinary tract infection. No infants returned with bacteremia or meningitis.

- **Conclusions**: Fever in a medical setting occurred in 1.4% of infants in this large cohort. Forty-one percent of febrile infants did not have any cultures, including 24% less than 28 days. One percent returned in the following month with a urinary tract infection. There was no delayed identification of bacteremia or meningitis.

### Beyond the usual suspects: Neonatal fever and desaturation [^113QMYxb]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

A 1-month-old infant presenting with fever, dyspnea, and desaturation poses a significant diagnostic challenge. The patient in question is notably fragile, with underdeveloped immune functions and the potential for developmental defects that have not yet been detected. The diagnostic challenge is further intensified in cases where the child is an immigrant, born as a result of an unmonitored pregnancy, born prematurely, and with low birth weight. The attending physician must act quickly while carefully untangling the complicated web of different possible diagnoses.

### Pyrexia in a young infant - is height of fever associated with serious bacterial infection [^1169X9nf]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Among 2093 infants screened, 1546 (73.9%) were hospitalized and 1057 (50.5%) were included in the analysis. In this cohort, 82 (7.8%) were triaged as Priority 1 and 826 (78.1%) as Priority 2+ in the emergency department. Demographics and initial presentation of our study population are presented in Table 1. There were 207 (19.6%) with serious bacterial infections (SBIs) and 33 (3.1%) with invasive bacterial infections (IBIs). There was no significant difference in the median age of infants with SBIs and those without (median 1.2 months, interquartile range 1.2–2.4, p = 0.434). There were a total of 247 (23.4%) infants ≤ 28 days, and among them, 42 (17.0%) were diagnosed with an SBI. Of the included patients, 42 (4.0%) infants had significant cardiac lesions, genitourinary anomalies, and other congenital or genetic abnormalities, of which 9 (21.4%) were diagnosed to have an SBI on admission.

### Prevalence of occult bacteremia in infants with very high fever without a source [^113t38M2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

We carried out a prospective registry-based cohort study at the emergency department on 363 previously healthy, well-appearing infants aged 3–24 months with fever without a source ≥ 40.5°C, based on local protocol. Four infants were diagnosed with occult bacteremia (1.1%; 95% confidence interval: 0–2.2). Recommendations against screening for occult bacteremia in these children may need reconsideration when fever is ≥ 40.5°C. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results.

### Management of the febrile young infant: Update for the 21st century [^111AW9EU]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Infants aged 90 days or younger with fever are frequently evaluated in the pediatric emergency department. Physical examination findings and individual laboratory investigations are unreliable in differentiating benign viral infections from serious bacterial infections in these patients. Clinical prediction models developed over 25 years ago have demonstrated high sensitivity but relatively low specificity in identifying bacterial infections.

Newer laboratory investigations, such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, exhibit favorable test characteristics compared to traditional laboratory studies like the white blood cell count. Despite this, these novel biomarkers have not achieved widespread acceptance due to a lack of robust, prospectively collected data, varying positivity thresholds, and differing inclusion criteria across studies.

- **Step-by-step approach**: C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, when combined with other patient characteristics, offer high sensitivity for detecting serious bacterial infections.

The RNA biosignatures represent an innovative biomarker currently under investigation for identifying bacterial infections in febrile infants.

**Maternal fever higher than 101°F (38.3°C)**: A total of N = 4 infants had a mother who experienced high fever (N = 2 HR, N = 2 LR); mothers of N = 50 did not experience high fever during pregnancy (N = 23 HR, N = 27 LR). The status for this variable is known for N = 54 out of 55 infants with infant medical history; the status is unknown for 1. With regard to fever occurrence by trimester, the mothers of both HR infants reported having fever during the 1st trimester only. The mother of N = 1 LR infant reported two instances of fever: during the 1st and during the 3rd trimester; the mother of N = 1 LR infant reported having fever during the 2nd trimester only. The mothers of the four infants who experienced high fever did not report taking antipyretic medications to reduce fever symptoms.

Regarding medical management for febrile infants, specifically concerning the setting of care, the AAP 2021 guidelines recommend considering managing well-appearing febrile infants aged 22–28 days at home if all of the following conditions are met:

- **Normal urinalysis**: The infant's urinalysis is normal.
- **Inflammatory markers**: All obtained inflammatory markers are normal.
- **CSF analysis**: The CSF analysis is normal or enterovirus-positive.
- **Teaching and instructions**: Verbal teaching and written instructions are provided for monitoring throughout the period of time at home.
- **Follow-up plans**: Follow-up plans for reevaluation in 24 hours are developed and in place.
- **Change in clinical status plans**: Plans are developed and in place in case of change in clinical status, including means of communication between family and providers and access to emergency medical care.

### Approach to the febrile infant (< 3 months) [^115aTAZK]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). High credibility.

Evaluation and management of the febrile infant has long been an area of variability. Recent guidelines were released by the American Academy of Pediatrics in August 2021 to help provide evidence-based clinical guidelines to decrease variability and improve outcomes. These guidelines largely focus on management and treatment guidelines for three age groups: 8 to 21 days, 22 to 28 days, and 29 to 60 days. The inclusion criteria for these guidelines are previously healthy, term infants born at 37 weeks gestation or later, with a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher.

The most significant changes to historical practice are in the 22- to 28-day and 29- to 60-day age groups. If initial laboratory work is reassuring, patients may not need cerebrospinal fluid studies, and patients may be monitored at home or at the hospital using shared decision-making with the family.

### Pyrexia in a young infant - is height of fever associated with serious bacterial infection [^116EiM5y]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Febrile infants ≤ 90 days old constitute a significant proportion of patients seeking care in the emergency department (ED). These infants are vulnerable to serious bacterial infections (SBIs), and early identification is required to initiate timely investigations and interventions. We aimed to study if the height of an infant's temperature on presentation to the ED is associated with SBI.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective chart review of febrile infants ≤ 90 days old presenting to our ED between March 31, 2015, and February 28, 2016. We compared the triage temperature of febrile infants with and without SBIs. We presented sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) of fever thresholds at triage. A multivariable regression was performed to study the association between the height of temperature and the presence of SBI, presenting the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Results**: Among 1057 febrile infants analyzed, 207 (19.6%) had an SBI. The mean temperature of infants with an SBI was significantly higher than those without (mean 38.5 °C, standard deviation, SD 0.6, vs. 38.3 °C, SD 0.5, p < 0.005). For temperature ≥ 39 °C, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for SBI were 15.5% (95%CI 10.8 — 21.1%), 90.4% (95%CI 88.2 — 92.3%), 28.1% (95%CI 21.1 — 36.3%), and 81.4% (95%CI 80.5 — 82.4%), respectively. The height of fever was consistently associated with SBI after adjusting for age, gender, and SIS (aOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.32 — 2.33, p < 0.001). However, 32 (15.5%) infants with SBIs had an initial triage temperature ≤

### Pyrexia in a young infant - is height of fever associated with serious bacterial infection [^113b65Qi]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

In this single-centre study, we described the relationship between the height of fever at ED triage and the risk of serious bacterial infection (SBI) among infants ≤ 3 months of age. High temperature as a continuous variable, as well as a temperature threshold of ≥ 39 °C, were independently associated with an increased risk of SBI after accounting for gender, age, and SIS.

The presence of pyrexia is important in the early recognition of serious infections in young infants. In diagnostic algorithms, the height of temperature is not consistently specified. For the past few decades, conflicting reports on the association between high temperature and SBIs have emerged. In older age groups, height of fever alone is unreliable in predicting SBI. A prospective cohort study in paediatric patients aged 0–5 by Williams et al. suggested that whilst higher temperatures were associated with an SBI, a third risked being overlooked if they did not reach a temperature threshold of 38 °C. Other studies also suggested that pyrexia ≥ 39–40 °C may be associated with SBI, particularly in young infants.

After adjusting for age, gender, and SIS, we similarly demonstrated that a temperature ≥ 39 °C was an independent predictor for SBI. However, we recognize that temperature is a dynamic vital sign, and the height of fever should be interpreted in conjunction with other risk factors.

The prevalence of SBI varies widely across international literature. Our study cohort (n = 228, 21.5%) reported a relatively high prevalence of SBI. From a health services perspective, this may be because we are the larger of only…

### Roseville protocol for the management of febrile infants 7–60 days [^113iRPuU]. Hospital Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

The Roseville Protocol modifies the Rochester Protocol by adding a high-risk temperature criterion of > 38.5°C for infants aged 7 to 28 days. It allows febrile infants aged 29 to 60 days with abnormal urinalysis but reassuring complete blood cell counts to be discharged home on oral antibiotics without receiving a lumbar puncture (LP). This study defines the test characteristics of the Roseville Protocol to detect invasive bacterial infection (IBI) and retrospectively compares its performance to that of the Rochester, Philadelphia, and Boston protocols.

In this retrospective study, we examine all cases of fever in infants aged 7 to 60 days presenting to a large health maintenance organization from 2007 to 2016 and having requisite laboratory tests for protocol analysis. The four protocols were retrospectively applied to this cohort to calculate each protocol's sensitivity and specificity to detect IBI. The protocols were compared regarding recommended LPs, admissions, and parenteral antibiotics.

In 627 infants aged 7 to 28 days, the Roseville Protocol had a sensitivity of 96.7% and a negative predictive value of 99.5%. It identified 2 IBIs missed by the Rochester Protocol but recommended an absolute increase of 19% in LPs and admissions. In 1176 infants aged 29 to 60 days, the Roseville Protocol had a sensitivity of 91.4% and a negative predictive value of 99.6%. There was an absolute reduction in LPs by 18% to 44% compared to the Rochester Protocol and by 74% to 100% compared to the Philadelphia and Boston protocols.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^114aTYCM]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

This guideline addresses the evaluation and management of well-appearing, term infants aged 8 to 60 days with a fever of ≥ 38.0°C. Exclusions are noted. After a commissioned evidence-based review by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and an ongoing review of the literature, supplemented by data from published, peer-reviewed studies provided by active investigators, 21 key action statements were derived.

For each key action statement, the quality of evidence and the benefit-harm relationship were assessed and graded to determine the strength of the recommendations. When appropriate, parents' values and preferences should be incorporated as part of shared decision-making.

For diagnostic testing, the committee has attempted to develop numbers needed to test. Regarding antimicrobial administration, the committee provided numbers needed to treat. Three algorithms summarize the recommendations for infants aged 8 to 21 days, 22 to 28 days, and 29 to 60 days.

The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of medical care. Variations, taking into account individual circumstances, may be appropriate.

### Analysis of emergency department prediction tools in evaluating febrile young infants at risk for serious infections [^114hZzeJ]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Febrile infants ≤ 3 months old constitute a vulnerable group at risk of serious infections (SI). This study aimed to (1) evaluate the test performance of two clinical assessment tools — the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Traffic Light System and Severity Index Score (SIS) — in predicting SI among all febrile young infants, and (2) assess the performance of three low-risk criteria — the Rochester Criteria (RC), Philadelphia Criteria (PC), and Boston Criteria (BC) — in well-looking febrile infants.

A retrospective validation study was conducted, focusing on serious illnesses, including both bacterial infections and serious viral illnesses such as meningitis and encephalitis. The study included febrile infants ≤ 3 months old who presented to a paediatric emergency department in Singapore between March 2015 and February 2016. Infants were categorized into high-risk and low-risk groups for SI according to each of the five assessment tools. The study compared the performance of the NICE guideline and SIS at initial clinical assessment for all infants, as well as the performance of the low-risk criteria — RC, PC, and BC — among well-looking infants. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratios.

In the results, out of 1057 infants analyzed, 326 (30.8%) were diagnosed with SI. The NICE guideline demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 93.3% (95% CI 90.0 to 95.7), while the SIS showed a sensitivity of 79.1% (95% CI 74.3 to 83.4). Incidence rates of SI were similar among infants who appeared well and those who did not. Among the low-risk criteria, the RC exhibited the highest sensitivity.

Severe acute hepatitis is a rare complication of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The authors report a case of an 8-month-old male infant who presented with subacute fever and jaundice. The physical examination showed hepatosplenomegaly and ecchymoses on his abdomen, chest wall, and extremities. He received vitamin K therapy and prednisolone, and he recovered well without further complications or sequelae. Although severe acute hepatitis is a rare complication of EBV infection, clinicians should recognize this condition in order to provide prompt treatment.

### Febrile seizures: Risks, evaluation, and prognosis [^114vxEjf]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

The AAFP 2019 guidelines recommend recognizing specific circumstances for febrile infants, particularly in patients with febrile seizures. Risk factors for recurrence of febrile seizures include being younger than 18 months, having a fever for less than one hour before seizure onset, having a first-degree relative with a history of febrile seizures, and experiencing a temperature of less than 40 °C (104 °F).
