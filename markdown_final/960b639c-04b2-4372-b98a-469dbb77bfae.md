## Question

sepsis with pneumonia as source
how much fluids do we give?
what antibiotics do we give?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much fluid to give and what antibiotics to start for sepsis with pneumonia as the source. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and severity using Sepsis-3 and lactate. Then, I should verify the immediate priorities: fluids, antibiotics, and source control. Next, I will examine the initial fluid strategy, including the 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus and its evidence strength. After that, I need to individualize fluid therapy for pneumonia and reassess frequently. Then, I will select empiric antibiotics for community-acquired versus hospital-acquired pneumonia, including MRSA and Pseudomonas coverage. Finally, I should integrate supportive care, monitoring, and de-escalation plans, and close with a concise synthesis of the key recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity using Sepsis-3, because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with sepsis from pneumonia and not a noninfectious mimic. Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction from a dysregulated host response to infection, and septic shock is sepsis with vasopressor requirement to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg and lactate > 2 mmol/L despite fluids; pneumonia is the most common source, so I should obtain lactate, qSOFA/SOFA, and cultures before antibiotics when feasible, while not delaying therapy if unstable [^114nkjGV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the immediate priorities. The three pillars are early fluid resuscitation, early appropriate antimicrobials, and source control, with fluids and antibiotics initiated within the first hour for septic shock and within 3 hours for sepsis without shock when feasible, alongside early imaging and cultures to guide narrowing of therapy [^111AXjoS].

> I will now examine the initial fluid strategy. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 suggests at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid within the first 3 hours for sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or septic shock; wait, let me verify the strength of evidence — this is a weak recommendation with low-quality evidence, and observational data associate failure to deliver this within 3 hours with worse outcomes, but I should also remember that pneumonia patients may be more vulnerable to fluid overload than intra-abdominal sepsis, so I need to balance this carefully [^114eN3yp] [^1164Az2o] [^114nkjGV].

> Next, I should review fluid type and practical administration. Crystalloids are first-line, and balanced solutions such as lactated Ringer's are preferred over saline when available; I initially thought "strong" for balanced crystalloids, but wait, I should double-check — SSC 2021 gives a weak recommendation for balanced crystalloids over saline, so I should correct that nuance while still favoring balanced solutions in most patients [^111Fo3yV] [^113Jgh1j]. For practical dosing, 500–1000 mL boluses over 15–30 minutes are reasonable, with reassessment after each bolus to gauge response and avoid over-resuscitation [^1173ABH8].

> Let me consider pneumonia-specific risks and individualization. Patients with pneumonia, especially older adults or those with COPD or heart failure, are at higher risk of pulmonary edema with large fluid loads; I should individualize the 30 mL/kg target, often giving smaller aliquots and reassessing frequently, and I should avoid fluid overload because positive fluid balance at 72 hours correlates with increased mortality and respiratory complications in sepsis [^115zwJZn] [^1168pvSh].

> I need to ensure dynamic assessment guides further fluids. After the initial bolus, I should use dynamic measures — passive leg raise, stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, or echocardiography — rather than static parameters alone to decide on additional fluids; if MAP remains below 65 mmHg or lactate does not improve, I should escalate to vasopressors, typically norepinephrine as first-line, rather than continuing large crystalloid volumes [^115WgDpQ] [^114zHw6V].

> Now, I will select empiric antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia with sepsis. For non-ICU CAP, a beta-lactam such as ceftriaxone or ampicillin-sulbactam plus a macrolide like azithromycin is standard; hold on, I should verify macrolide resistance thresholds — ATS/IDSA CAP guidance uses about 25% high-level macrolide resistance as a threshold to avoid macrolide monotherapy, which supports combination therapy in many regions, and I should avoid macrolide monotherapy in any case [^116P1eFg]. For ICU CAP or severe sepsis, use a beta-lactam with antipneumococcal activity plus either a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone; if MRSA risk is high, add vancomycin or linezolid, and if Pseudomonas risk is present, use an antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, or meropenem [^1162ySZU].

> For hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia with sepsis, I should confirm broader coverage. Empiric therapy should cover MRSA and Pseudomonas when risk factors or severity warrant, using vancomycin or linezolid plus an antipseudomonal beta-lactam; combination therapy for Pseudomonas is reasonable initially in septic shock or high risk of death, with de-escalation to monotherapy once susceptibilities return, and I should avoid aminoglycoside monotherapy [^115TrBbQ] [^113Wxpgw].

> I should double-check timing and stewardship. In septic shock, administer antibiotics within 1 hour of recognition; in sepsis without shock, aim for within 3 hours when feasible, obtain cultures before antibiotics if this does not cause harmful delay, and reassess at 24–48 hours to narrow or stop therapy based on cultures and clinical response; using procalcitonin alongside clinical evaluation can support earlier discontinuation when appropriate [^111AXjoS] [^1122xiuH] [^113JyKUf].

> Next, I should review supportive care and monitoring. Maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg with fluids and norepinephrine, target SpO2 about 94–98% to avoid both hypoxemia and hyperoxia, and if ARDS develops, use low tidal volume ventilation with 6 mL/kg PBW and limit plateau pressure; I need to ensure frequent reassessment of perfusion with lactate clearance, urine output, capillary refill, and bedside ultrasound to detect fluid overload and guide deresuscitation once stabilized [^111X9N81] [^1168pvSh].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a resource-limited setting or has COVID-19 pneumonia. In LMIC contexts, aggressive fluid resuscitation has been associated with harm, so a more conservative approach with careful monitoring is prudent; similarly, in COVID-19 with septic shock, WHO suggests smaller crystalloid boluses of 250–500 mL with early vasopressors and avoidance of fluid overload, reinforcing the need to tailor fluids to context and physiology [^111qzzwp] [^112Beu1Q].

> Let me synthesize the key recommendations. For fluids, give 30 mL/kg crystalloid within 3 hours for sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, but individualize in pneumonia — often using 500–1000 mL boluses with frequent reassessment — and transition to dynamic-guided therapy and vasopressors if MAP and perfusion fail to improve; for antibiotics, start broad-spectrum therapy within 1 hour for shock and within 3 hours otherwise, cover CAP pathogens with beta-lactam plus macrolide or fluoroquinolone, add MRSA and Pseudomonas coverage when risk factors or severity dictate, and de-escalate promptly based on cultures and clinical response [^113ohx4k] [^1164Az2o] [^1162ySZU].

---

For sepsis from pneumonia, give **30 mL/kg crystalloid** [^113ohx4k] within the first 3 hours [^1164Az2o], then reassess and titrate to avoid overload [^115zwJZn]. Start **broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour** [^114zHw6V] [^114nkjGV], tailoring to local resistance and severity: use a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or fluoroquinolone for CAP [^116P1eFg]; add MRSA coverage if risk factors exist [^1162ySZU]; and include antipseudomonal therapy for HAP/VAP or severe cases [^115wTfTW]. Adjust therapy to cultures and de-escalate within 48–72 hours [^114zHw6V].

## Fluid resuscitation

### Initial fluid resuscitation

- **Initial bolus**: 30 mL/kg isotonic crystalloid (preferably balanced, e.g. lactated Ringer's) [^111Fo3yV] within the first 3 hours [^113ohx4k] for sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or septic shock [^1164Az2o].

- **Rationale**: Early fluids restore intravascular volume, improve cardiac output, and enhance organ perfusion [^1168pvSh].

- **Reassessment**: After the initial bolus, reassess hemodynamics, lung status, and urine output to guide further fluids [^115WgDpQ].

---

### Subsequent fluid management

Use **dynamic measures** (passive leg raise, stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, or echocardiography) [^115WgDpQ] to guide additional fluids and avoid overload [^115zwJZn]. Avoid **fluid overload**, especially in pneumonia, to reduce the risk of pulmonary edema and respiratory failure [^114eN3yp] [^1168pvSh]. In the stabilization and evacuation phases, aim for a neutral or negative fluid balance as the patient stabilizes [^115zwJZn].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

### Initial antibiotic administration

Start **within 1 hour** [^116u9zSX] of recognition of sepsis or septic shock to reduce mortality [^114rAdte]. Obtain **blood cultures** before antibiotics if this does not delay therapy [^116ARUYJ].

---

### Empiric antibiotic selection

Empiric therapy should be guided by **community-acquired vs hospital-acquired pneumonia**, local resistance patterns, and patient-specific risk factors [^117AzBSU].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric antibiotic regimen** |
|-|-|
| Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) | - Beta-lactam (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam) [^notfound] <br/> - Plus macrolide (azithromycin) or respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) [^notfound] |
| Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) | - Antipseudomonal beta-lactam (piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, or meropenem) [^115wTfTW] <br/> - Plus MRSA coverage (vancomycin or linezolid) if risk factors present [^1162ySZU] |
| Severe sepsis or septic shock | - Broad-spectrum coverage including antipseudomonal and MRSA agents [^1162ySZU] <br/> - Consider combination therapy initially [^115TrBbQ] |

---

### Adjustment and de-escalation

Adjust **therapy** to culture results and susceptibilities, and de-escalate within 48–72 hours [^notfound] to minimize resistance and toxicity. Use **shorter courses** (7–8 days) if the clinical response is adequate and source control is achieved [^1122xiuH].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Fluid resuscitation | 30 mL/kg crystalloid within 3 hours, then reassess and titrate [^113ohx4k] |
| Antibiotic administration | Within 1 hour of recognition [^116u9zSX] |
| Empiric antibiotic selection | Based on CAP vs HAP/VAP, local resistance, and patient risk factors [^115wTfTW] |
| Antibiotic adjustment | De-escalate within 48–72 hours based on cultures [^114zHw6V] |

---

Fluid resuscitation and timely, appropriate antibiotics are the **cornerstones of sepsis management** [^112joHmZ]. Use 30 mL/kg crystalloid initially, then tailor fluids to response; start broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour and de-escalate to culture results to optimize outcomes.

### Sepsis: diagnosis and management [^114nkjGV]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines published in 2016 provide a revised definition of sepsis: life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The guidelines define septic shock as sepsis with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction that is associated with a higher risk of mortality. The measurement of serum lactate has been incorporated into the latest septic shock definition. The guidelines recommend the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (original and quick versions) as an important tool for early diagnosis. Respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and skin and soft tissue infections are the most common sources of sepsis. Pneumonia is the most common cause of sepsis. Although many patients with sepsis have fever, the clinical manifestation can be subtle, particularly in older patients and those who are immunocompromised. Initial evaluation of patients with suspected sepsis includes basic laboratory tests, cultures, imaging studies as indicated, and sepsis biomarkers such as procalcitonin and lactate levels. Fluid resuscitation is the priority in early management, including administering an intravenous crystalloid at 30 mL per kg within the first three hours. Antimicrobial therapy should also be initiated early. Most research indicates that antimicrobial therapy should be started within three hours of presentation. The latest guidelines recommend starting antimicrobials within one hour, but this is controversial. Vasopressor therapy is indicated if hypotension persists despite fluid administration. Future trials of sepsis management are focusing on improving long-term rates of readmission and death, physical disability, cognitive impairment, and quality of life.

### Beyond septic shock: who else requires immediate antibiotics? [^116u9zSX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Landmark studies published almost 20 years ago documented strong associations between time to antibiotic therapy and mortality in critically ill patients, most of whom had septic shock. These findings catalyzed early versions of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign that recommended administering antibiotics ≤ 1 hour after the diagnosis of sepsis with any acute organ dysfunction, not just septic shock. Some state and national quality metrics further extended this guidance, requiring rapid administration of antibiotic therapy for all patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock.

Sepsis, however, is a broad and heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses a wide range of inciting organisms, sites of infection, and patterns of organ dysfunctions. These differences are magnified by host factors, including extremes of age, comorbidities, and immune function. The manifestations of sepsis, prognoses, and the impact of therapy are very different for a young and healthy host with bacterial pneumonia compared with a geriatric patient with cancer complicated by neutropenia and disseminated fungal infection.

The latest version of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recognizes some of this variability. The 2021 guidelines suggest that patients be stratified by certainty of infection and severity of illness. Specifically, they advise antibiotic therapy ≤ 1 hour after recognition in all patients with possible septic shock and all patients with definite or probable sepsis without shock. In patients with possible sepsis without shock, however, in whom the diagnosis of infection is uncertain and the severity of illness is lesser, they suggest the diagnosis be clarified before antibiotic therapy is administered to minimize unnecessary antibiotic agent use and unintended harms to the individual and the population. Clarifying steps can include assessing the patient's response to the treatment of noninfectious conditions and comorbidities (e.g. fluids, diuresis, bronchodilators, heart rate control, pain control, opioid antagonists, anticoagulation) and/or obtaining additional diagnostic studies (e.g. cross-sectional imaging, respiratory viral panels) and administering antimicrobial agents only if the concern for infection persists for > 3 hours.

### Early recognition and management of sepsis in adults: the first six hours [^112GYmmV]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a complication of severe infection characterized by a systemic inflammatory response. Mortality rates from sepsis range between 25% to 30% for severe sepsis and 40% to 70% for septic shock. The clinical presentation of sepsis is highly variable depending on the etiology. The most common sites of infection are the respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal systems, as well as the skin and soft tissue. Fever is often the first manifestation of sepsis, with pneumonia being the most common presentation leading to sepsis. Early goal-directed therapy completed within the first six hours of sepsis recognition significantly decreases in-hospital mortality. Initial management includes respiratory stabilization followed by aggressive fluid resuscitation. Vasopressor therapy is indicated when fluid resuscitation fails to restore adequate mean arterial pressure and organ perfusion. Early antibiotic therapy can improve clinical outcomes, and should be given within one hour of suspected sepsis. Blood product therapy may be required in some cases to correct coagulopathy and anemia, and to improve the central venous oxygen saturation. Insulin therapy may be required to maintain serum glucose levels less than 180 mg per dL. Initiation of low-dose corticosteroids may further improve survival in patients with septic shock that does not respond to vasopressor therapy. Timely initiation of evidence-based protocols should improve sepsis outcomes.

### Fourth Surviving Sepsis Campaign's hemodynamic recommendations: a step forward or a return to chaos? [^114eN3yp]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Fluids

It is now recommended to infuse at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloids within the first 3 h of resuscitation of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. We are concerned by both the predefined volume and timeframe. First, all septic patients do not exhibit the same degree of hypovolemia. For instance, abdominal sepsis inducing massive internal or external fluid losses is generally not equivalent to community-acquired pneumonia in terms of volume deficit. Deliberate administration of 30 mL/kg of fluids in patients with pneumonia with cardiovascular comorbidities might eventually result in pulmonary edema and hasten the need for mechanical ventilation. Initial fluid resuscitation should be individualized according to several elements, including clinical signs of hypovolemia, body temperature, pulse pressure, age, comorbidities, and sepsis origin. If hypovolemia is assumed to be a major component of hypoperfusion, fluids should be infused as a rapid fluid bolus to increase mean systemic filling pressure, venous return, and stroke volume. The same amount of fluids infused in 3 h cannot have a measurable effect on systemic blood flow in this context. Second, early reassessment of hemodynamics is a fundamental aspect of management of patients with shock. It is unreasonable to wait for 3 h — as it is suggested in the SSC guidelines — before reassessing the effects of the initial fluid therapy.

Conclusions

Does this mean we should go back to the era of 'do whatever you want'? No consensus exists among clinicians regarding optimal hemodynamic monitoring, and to date no method has been proven to be superior. Given the amount of fluids given prior to randomization in the ProCESS and ARISE trials, 'usual care' appears to now include aggressive, early fluid resuscitation with at least 20 mL/kg of crystalloid and rapid administration of appropriate antibiotics. Certainly, this reflects the impact of the original trial by Rivers and colleagues and the broad-based implementation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines and bundles. If this continues to define 'usual care', then perhaps it is no longer necessary to mandate specific protocols for resuscitation, as it appears that standard sepsis management has evolved to be consistent with published protocols. That would be good news indeed for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

Pediatric VAP prevention — fluid management: Avoid fluid overload (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE). A meta-analysis in critically ill children indicates that fluid overload is associated with increased risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation (> 48 hours); interventional data include infants randomized to peritoneal dialysis versus furosemide who were less likely to develop fluid overload and less likely to have prolonged ventilator use. Pediatric consensus groups recommend limiting fluid intake, starting diuretics, and/or early renal replacement therapy for children with ARDS and in the postresuscitation phase of sepsis.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^113PfTKx]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations, built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category and not by hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics; early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy; reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate; a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits; equivalence of crystalloid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepinephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies; avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protection; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk for death; with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL; appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome; application of a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome; a semirecumbent bed position unless contraindicated; protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia, using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions/lightening; avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible; maintenance of blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization; equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration and intermittent hemodialysis; lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥ 7.15; use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric considerations included a more likely need for intubation due to low functional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access; fluid resuscitation based on weight with 40–60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points; unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy of septic shock; and greater risk of hypoglycemia with aggressive glucose control.

Conclusion

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually and even more rapidly as some important new knowledge becomes as available.

### The sepsis chain of survival: a comprehensive framework for improving sepsis outcomes [^112joHmZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Appropriate Fluids, Oxygen, and Antibiotics

Early antimicrobial therapy (ideally within the first hour), oxygen when required, and appropriate fluid resuscitation are foundational components of sepsis management. Early administration of appropriate and available antimicrobials that target the suspected causative organism (bacteria, virus, fungus, etc.) should be informed by local data on infection trends and susceptibility or resistance. Identify conditions that may require alternative management, such as dengue fever or malaria with fever and severe anemia. Monitor the patient's response to treatment closely, adjust therapies as needed based on patient response and organ dysfunction and narrow antimicrobial coverage once a definitive organism is identified.

Fluid resuscitation is a critical component of sepsis management in high-resource settings, where monitoring and adjunctive supportive therapies are available to manage consequences of any excess fluid administration. In LRS, where such supportive measures may not be available, fluid resuscitation should be approached with caution, and alternative strategies may be required. Specifically, considerations for fluid overload are particularly important in conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe anemia/malaria, impaired perfusion in children with fever, severe malnutrition, and dengue fever, and appropriate guidance should be followed. Timely and appropriate administration of supplemental oxygen, where indicated by hypoxia or signs of respiratory distress, can improve tissue oxygenation, support cellular function and mitigate risk of organ dysfunction.

Critical Care Without Walls

Early initiation and critical care management across the continuum of care should be provided, with appropriate monitoring/technology based on resource availability. A coordinated effort across the entire healthcare continuum, including both hospital-based and pre-hospital care providers, is important. While much expertise resides within hospitals, collaboration with community healthcare workers, EMS, and clinics/referral centers is crucial to ensuring seamless care from the community to the hospital setting. Interdisciplinary providers should work together to accomplish a Sepsis Chain of Survival.

Care may need to be provided in a variety of settings, based on need and resources. The ICU "without walls" concept allows for flexibility and provision of the highest-quality care possible. It denotes provision of time-critical interventions using available resources in any healthcare setting even when ICU is not available. Patients exhibiting signs of worsening sepsis or septic shock require prompt transfer to a critical care capable environment, to facilitate aggressive resuscitation, close monitoring, and delivery of specialized care. Vital signs, laboratory values, and organ function should be monitored closely. Organ support measures, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressor administration, blood products, and renal replacement therapy, should be considered in the context of the patient's clinical status and resource considerations.

Early use of care bundles

Care bundles combine several management practices to improve outcomes. In 2002, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommended that a resuscitation bundle should be performed within 6 hours for septic patients. The bundle included principles from EGDT, in addition to blood cultures and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Recent international analyses by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign showed that compliance to the guidelines was associated with decreased mortality.

A few before-and-after studies have focused on sepsis care bundles derived from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for severe CAP. In a single-centre study in China, Guo et al. defined severe CAP according to the IDSA/ATS major criteria and applied the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's 6-hour resuscitation bundle (and a 24-hour management bundle) for these patients. While the intervention was associated with a decrease in overall hospital mortality from 44% to 29%, full compliance to the bundles was associated with a greater than twofold decrease. Georges et al. reported that a similar bundle including antibiotic therapy, fluids, and vasoactive agents was associated with a decrease in mortality from 43% to 31% in patients with severe CAP as defined by ICU admission in a single French centre. Hortmann et al. implemented a care bundle for all patients with CAP in a German ED. The bundle comprised checklists on history, clinical examination, investigations including lactate measurement and blood cultures, risk stratification according to CRB65, and treatment including antibiotic guidelines and fluid resuscitation. Hospital mortality decreased from 14% to 11%. Sixteen United Kingdom hospital trusts participated in a quality improvement programme incorporating a British Thoracic Society care bundle which included the use of the CURB65 score, standardised oxygen assessment and prescription, and chest X-ray scan and targeted antibiotics within 4 hours of hospital admission. Bundle implementation was associated with improved 30-day inpatient mortality (Table 1). Dean et al. showed that four hospital EDs experienced lower CAP mortality after introduction of an electronic clinical decision support tool compared with three usual care hospitals. The tool had multiple features, including electronic calculation of the IDSA/ATS minor criteria coupled with logic for ICU admission. Treatment protocols in the EDs and ICUs guided management.

Table 2 — suspected sepsis antibiotics: out-of-hospital evidence is insufficient to make a recommendation; in the emergency department, we recommend prompt administration, reserving very short time thresholds for those with infection and shock given insufficient data to specify a threshold, administer broad-spectrum therapy when the source is unconfirmed based on local susceptibility, and target therapy to identified sources such as pneumonia or UTI per source-specific guidelines.

Regarding medical management for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to intravenous fluids, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to administer 250–500 mL crystalloid fluid as a rapid bolus in the first 15–30 minutes in the resuscitation for septic shock in adult patients with COVID-19.

Evidence.

There is currently no data regarding the optimal amount of fluid resuscitation specifically for SARS-CoV-2–infected patients in shock. Therefore, the evidence-based fluid resuscitation from the more general group of patients in shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and other related conditions needs to be extrapolated for the COVID-19 patient population. Fluid resuscitation is often the first-line treatment for undifferentiated shock, but there is considerable uncertainty regarding optimal fluid resuscitation strategy.

Patient information from the PROCESS and ARISE trials demonstrated that individuals with suspected sepsis received approximately 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluids before randomization into the two trials. However, a systematic review examining the association between fluid balance and mortality in critically ill individuals found that non-survivors had a 4.4-L more positive cumulative fluid balance than survivors, and the mortality was lower in those who received a restrictive volume strategy as opposed to a liberal strategy (OR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.32–0.55). Similarly, a meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials comparing conservative versus liberal fluid strategies in critically ill individuals in the post-resuscitation phase of sepsis and ARDS found that the conservative fluid group had a significant increase in ventilator-free days (1.82 days; 95% CI: 0.53–3.10 days) but no significant difference in mortality (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.82–1.02). There was also a significant decrease in length of ICU stay in the conservative fluid group, but there was substantial heterogeneity in this finding (−1.88 days; 95% CI: −0.12 to −3.64 days, I² = 75%). Accordingly, the 2020 surviving sepsis guidelines for COVID-19 suggest using a conservative rather than a liberal fluid resuscitation strategy in patients with sepsis or septic shock.

Early haemodynamic support

Pneumonia is the most common cause of sepsis and often presents with septic shock. In a recent multicentre Spanish study, one-third of hospitalisations for CAP were complicated by sepsis. The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) state that patients with septic shock can be identified clinically by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg, and a serum lactate level ≥ 2 mmol/L after adequate fluid resuscitation, although some controversy exists because most studies from which these criteria were derived measured lactate upon presentation and before fluids. In 2001, Rivers et al. showed that a protocol for haemodynamic optimisation known as early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) decreased hospital mortality in sepsis and septic shock from 46.5% to 30.5%. The EGDT bundle included lactate measurement, fluid resuscitation according to the central venous pressure, vasoactive agents to keep the mean arterial pressure at 65–90 mmHg, and red blood cell transfusion and/or inotropes according to the central venous oxygen saturation. Pneumonia accounted for 39% of the enrolled patients and was the commonest cause of sepsis in the study.

In 2014 and 2015, however, three large multicentre randomised trials — the ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe studies — reported that EGDT was not superior to usual care for ED patients with septic shock (Table 1). While these studies examined sepsis in general, the findings are probably applicable to pneumonia which was the leading source of infection, affecting 1278 out of the enrolled 4201 patients. Subgroup analysis by site of infection in the ProCESS study did not reveal significant differences when compared with the full analysis. It is likely that the data from Rivers et al. pushed clinicians towards more aggressive and early resuscitation in recent years, such that the majority of patients in the usual care arms of the ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe studies received prompt fluids and vasopressors, even though central venous pressure and central venous oxygenation were not targeted.

Management Recommendations

International consensus guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock published by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign reference studies primarily conducted among patients with COS. Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations inform the CMS sepsis metric (SEP-1), to which adherence is publicly reported as a quality metric for acute care hospitals in the United States. However, whether and how these recommendations should be applied to patients with HOS has not been established. As such, the research priorities identified here have significant implications for quality improvement initiatives directed toward patients with HOS, including potential modifications of current sepsis guidelines.

Given clinical differences between the groups, and the fact that patients with HOS have largely been excluded from sepsis clinical trials, whether some recommendations confer the same benefits for patients with HOS as for those with COS is unclear. Although administration of IV fluids has been associated with reduced duration of shock among patients with COS, the same effect has not been demonstrated among patients with HOS. Particularly given increasing equipoise regarding the benefits of aggressive IV fluid resuscitation for sepsis, concerns about the potential harms of overresuscitation, and data suggesting heterogeneity of treatment effect across subgroups, additional research is needed to understand how current sepsis resuscitation recommendations and practices impact outcomes in HOS.

Although rapid antimicrobial administration has been shown to be associated with improved mortality rates in patients with HOS, the optimal timing for treatment initiation and microbial coverage has not been established. Recommendations must balance the need for prompt treatment and appropriately broad coverage in this high-risk group with the realities of diagnostic uncertainty and need for appropriate risk assessment and infectious workup to guide therapy in the face of higher prevalence of fungal and multi-drug-resistant organisms in HOS.

Identification of clinical phenotypes may be helpful to examine the risks and benefits of resuscitation and treatment strategies among subgroups of patients with HOS, informing targeted enrollment in clinical trials enriched for patients most likely to benefit from given treatment arms.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116JnXM9]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Should we individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation and, if so, how? Applying a standard fluid dose to all patients with sepsis is inconsistent with other areas of sepsis management, where efforts are made to personalize care where possible. What alternative strategies can be readily used in clinical practice to individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation to maximize benefit and reduce harms?
2) Which variables should be used to titrate fluid resuscitation? Rigorous trials comparing various dynamic and static variables to evaluate fluid responsiveness are needed. Furthermore, testing various dynamic variables in subgroups of patients with sepsis would be informative. Trials should be designed to incorporate multiple methods of assessing fluid responsiveness.
3) What is the optimal timing for fluid resuscitation? After rapid identification of sepsis and septic shock, time-series studies of fluid resuscitation are needed, especially evaluating the benefits and harms of additional therapies (e.g. vasopressors) and their respective interplay.
4) Which variables should be used to trigger fluid resuscitation and deresuscitation? Related to the timing of fluid resuscitation, should a particular set of physiologic variables be assessed in a serial fashion to determine when to shift from resuscitation to deresuscitation in a structured manner?
5) Is a combined approach using several indices of fluid responsiveness better than using a single measurement in isolation? Furthermore, how should various measures be prioritized to inform clinical judgment?
6) What is the efficacy of using CRT to guide resuscitation in patients with normal lactate levels? Would the use of a rapidly assessable physiologic test be of value in patients without a derangement in lactate levels?
7) What is the duration of effect of fluid resuscitation? Recognizing that the duration of benefit of fluid resuscitation will vary between patients, having some population estimates in mind via pharmacokinetic studies would be useful to clinicians in evaluating therapeutic options and subsequent care.
8) Do early vasopressors limit the amount of fluids required to reach the same hemodynamic target? If so, what is the appropriate ratio of fluids and vasopressors? Identifying if there is a benefit to applying a polytherapeutic approach to early resuscitation is particularly interesting given the concerns regarding excessive fluid administration. A polytherapeutic approach of early fluid administration and vasopressors using a standardized assessment approach considerate of patient variables may be more precise and individualized, thereby maximizing benefit and limiting adverse effects.
9) Should the initial resuscitation of fluids be restricted to hypotensive patients or patients with lactate greater than or equal to 4 mmol/L? In an effort to limit the effects of excessive fluid administration while maximizing benefit in those patients with malperfusion, comparing strategies of fluid resuscitation in distinctive groups of septic shock would be useful.
10) Should the initial fluid resuscitation be administered as a fixed dose of 30 mL/kg or should it be administered in smaller aliquots, with further administration contingent on reassessing the patient condition prior to administering the next bolus? Although the 30 mL/kg bolus carries the risk of under- and overdosing, it has the advantage of being relatively simple to apply, especially in resource-limited settings where advanced measurements cannot be obtained. Administration of smaller doses, repeated as needed according to hemodynamic assessment, has the advantage of fine-tuning fluid administration according to an individual patient's needs. The risk associated with this approach is the potential for adding additional complexity, while still resulting with relatively similar amount of fluids administered and diverting the healthcare team from completing other essential tasks in the initial management of the patient with sepsis.
11) Should sicker patients receive a greater amount of initial resuscitation? In the continuum of sepsis and septic shock, should those patients with more severe physiologic derangements receive greater initial amounts of fluid resuscitation to restore perfusion at the cellular level? Understanding that there may be dose gradient to the initial volume of fluid resuscitation based on the severity of shock would be informative and guide further, targeted research in the field.
12) Should resuscitation differ in patient populations less able to tolerate large volumes? In an effort to individualize sepsis care for subgroups at greater risk of harm from vigorous resuscitation, trials evaluating subgroups of patients with particular comorbidities (heart failure, dysrhythmias, end-stage renal disease) are necessary. The ideal trial in this domain should test two fluid resuscitation strategies using tiered severity in the triggering variables, whereas the fluid boluses should be of similar amount and given only after the evaluation of fluid responsiveness. Ideally, the study should be stratified for subgroups such as heart failure and kidney disease.
13) What is the optimal strategy for fluid resuscitation in resource-limited settings? Data on resuscitation vary significantly between well-resourced and resource-limited settings, as in sub-Saharan Africa, the administration of fluids was associated with an increased risk of death. Understanding the physiology of fluid resuscitation in the absence of other elements of critical care provided in ICUs with higher resources is a key question for a large portion of the world's population. Developing simplified strategies for patient assessment and fluid administration would greatly improve the quality of care delivered.

Conclusions

Guideline development is a major undertaking. We have noted the robust methodology, including systematic reviews incorporated into the 2 largest and best funded programmes: the NICE and Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines.

Given the burden of sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa and across LIC, together with the significant heterogeneity in clinical practice and the emergence of data which suggest we should re-evaluate guidelines in contexts without intensive care, we feel further high-quality, evidence-based and implementable recommendations for fluid management strategies in patient with sepsis in resource-limited settings are urgently required. This could be incorporated into ongoing international efforts to make sepsis guidelines truly global.

Differences in clinical environments

The very different clinical environments in low-resource settings may also contribute to the nonapplicability of standard management strategies in high-resource settings. RCTs conducted in critically ill patients in low-resource settings reinforce this concern. A single-center RCT of adult patients with severe sepsis in Zambia was stopped early due to higher mortality among patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure in the IV fluid intervention arm. An RCT of early versus late enteral feeding among cerebral malaria patients in Bangladesh found increased incidence of aspiration pneumonia in the group receiving early feeding. Limited nursing personnel, ICU capacity, and availability of mechanical ventilation may have contributed to these adverse outcomes in the intervention groups.

The Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy trial demonstrated the dangers of aggressive IV fluid resuscitation in a population of East African febrile children who had some features of impaired circulation. Additionally, a protocol for early resuscitation with IV fluids and vasopressors among adults (most of whom were HIV-positive) with sepsis and hypotension in Zambia resulted in higher in-hospital mortality compared with usual care. With this evidence of harm in both adult and pediatric patients with sepsis and septic shock in Africa, and the absence of high-quality clinical trials in similar settings demonstrating any benefit of aggressive fluid resuscitation in sepsis, there is essentially no context-specific evidence supporting recommendations for fluid resuscitation in sepsis. Despite this lack of evidence, aggressive fluid resuscitation is advocated in some international and local LMIC sepsis management guidelines. These examples underscore the need for caution in the implementation of best practices from high-resource settings to other settings and populations in which they have not been validated.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

Wide variation in healthcare infrastructure, staffing, and funding within and across LMICs results in a broad range of treatment capabilities. A 2015 cross-sectional study of the identification and management of AKI in various healthcare facilities showed that crystalloid fluid was used as initial management in 92% of all patients in LMICs. In addition, 73.9% of these patients were administered antibiotics. Diuretics were used in 36.1% of patients. A 2016 survey of 160 physicians treating kidney disease in low-resource settings found that nearly all regional hospitals had access to oral and intravenous hydration solutions, and antibiotics, whereas only 60% and 52% of rural healthcare providers had access to intravenous fluids and antibiotics for AKI management, respectively.

Feasibility and affordability of AKI treatment has been an ongoing challenge in LMICs, especially in remote and community healthcare settings. Intravenous fluids are the most commonly available resource for the management of AKI in both urban and community settings in LMICs and could be used to the benefit of AKI patients early in their disease courses. However, emerging evidence indicating increased adverse outcomes among AKI, ARDS, and critically ill patients receiving excessive fluid resuscitation poses safety concerns if this treatment is improperly implemented by providers with little working knowledge of fluid management. One observational study of 1,808 patients with sepsis across ICUs in 84 countries found an increased risk of death in those with higher fluid balance. Multiple reviews regarding fluid management in the setting of COVID-19 therefore recommend maintaining a negative fluid balance to improve outcomes, especially in critically ill patients dependent on mechanical ventilation.

Recommendations and suggestions (Table 1).

1 We recommend the judicious use of intravenous fluid resuscitation using crystalloids for early management of AKI in all COVID-19 patients (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).
2 We recommend more conservative fluid management for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Negative fluid balance should be maintained, if possible (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).
3 We suggest the use of lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategies, where applicable, to prevent renal injury from associated cytokine release (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

Question 4: In patients with COVID-19–related AKI in LMICs, what strategies can be used to optimize efficiency and availability of dialysis?

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^111pLVtd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the GRADE system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost), or clearly do not. Weak recommendations indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include: early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for post-operative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B) targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper GI bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusion

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock, 2012 [^114zHw6V]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a PaO₂/FIO₂ < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5–10 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

Fluid management.

A restrictive fluid strategy may be important to avoid aggravation of pulmonary edema. In our patients, if organ perfusion is appropriate, fluid boluses are avoided. It has been suggested that some patients develop the so-called cytokine storm or hyperinflammatory phase, in which hypotension and hypoperfusion may respond well to fluid administration. We continue a restricted fluid approach also in cases of hypotension (Figure 2). Early application of vasopressors concurrent with proper fluid resuscitation is used to provide good tissue perfusion with limited fluid therapy. Loop diuretics are recommended in case the fluid balance becomes too positive, and renal replacement therapy may be necessary to correct the fluid balance in some patients.

Secondary infections.

COVID-19 patients frequently need prolonged intubations and stays in the ICU, and thus may develop typical nosocomial complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and sepsis. In this setting, these infectious complications are diagnosed and treated as for any hospitalized patient.

### Updates in sepsis resuscitation [^114Z19ym]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis care has evolved significantly since the initial early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) trials. Early fluid resuscitation, source control, and antibiotic therapy remain cornerstones of care but overall understanding is more nuanced, particularly regarding fluid selection, vasopressors, and inotropic support. Timely nutrition therapy and ventilatory support tend to receive less attention but also are important. Recent research has explored immunomodulation, β-blockade, and vitamin supplementation. A renewed emphasis on early, aggressive resuscitation reaffirms the importance of emergency medicine providers knowledgeable and skilled in sepsis management.

### Roundtable debate: controversies in the management of the septic patient – desperately seeking consensus [^1152Hvxt]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Despite continuous advances in technologic and pharmacologic management, the mortality rate from septic shock remains high. Care of patients with sepsis includes measures to support the circulatory system and treat the underlying infection. There is a substantial body of knowledge indicating that fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and antibiotics accomplish these goals. Recent clinical trials have provided new information on the addition of individual adjuvant therapies. Consensus on how current therapies should be prescribed is lacking. We present the reasoning and preferences of a group of intensivists who met to discuss the management of an actual case. The focus is on management, with emphasis on the criteria by which treatment decisions are made. It is clear from the discussion that there are areas where there is agreement and areas where opinions diverge. This presentation is intended to show how experienced intensivists apply clinical science to their practice of critical care medicine.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: research priorities for sepsis and septic shock [^117MBfak]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome and underlying causes of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

A consensus committee of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine was convened at the annual meetings of both societies. Subgroups had teleconference and electronic-based discussion. The entire committee iteratively developed the entire document and recommendations.

Methods

Each committee member independently gave their top five priorities for sepsis research. A total of 88 suggestions (ESM 1 - supplemental table 1) were grouped into categories by the committee co-chairs, leading to the formation of seven subgroups: infection, fluids and vasoactive agents, adjunctive therapy, administration/epidemiology, scoring/identification, post-intensive care unit, and basic/translational science. Each subgroup had teleconferences to go over each priority followed by formal voting within each subgroup. The entire committee also voted on top priorities across all subgroups except for basic/translational science.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee provides 26 priorities for sepsis and septic shock. Of these, the top six clinical priorities were identified and include the following questions: (1) can targeted/personalized/precision medicine approaches determine which therapies will work for which patients at which times? (2) what are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated? (3) should rapid diagnostic tests be implemented in clinical practice? (4) should empiric antibiotic combination therapy be used in sepsis or septic shock? (5) what are the predictors of sepsis long-term morbidity and mortality? and (6) what information identifies organ dysfunction?

Conclusions

While the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines give multiple recommendations on the treatment of sepsis, significant knowledge gaps remain, both in bedside issues directly applicable to clinicians, as well as understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the development and progression of sepsis. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

Although early fluid administration is beneficial to delayed fluid administration, the optimal amount of fluid required for an individual patient varies. "Optimal" would infer the quantity of fluid administered that restores perfusion to end organs while not worsening end-organ function. The Hour-1 bundles recommend initiating 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid to patients with suspected sepsis within 1 hour for hypotension or lactate level greater than or equal to 4 µmol/L. Although this is a strong recommendation, it is based upon a low quality of evidence, where the 30 mL/kg dose is derived from a statistical correlation between mortality and amount of fluid administered. Therefore, determining the optimal amount of fluid to be administered remains a critical issue through continued inquiry. Analysis of large databases suggest that there may be a U-shaped response curve, where limited amounts as well as large amounts of fluid administration are associated with worse outcomes. The best response was observed when fluid resuscitation was administered in volumes between 15 and 45 mL/kg, although this range is too wide to be applied readily in clinical practice. Further, data from over 50,000 patients demonstrated that delay in fluid administration was not associated with an increased risk of death. One potential explanation is "time zero" in these studies was defined as presentation to hospital and not time of sepsis recognition. Further, the benefits of fluid resuscitation may be dependent on the severity of illness in the continuum of sepsis and underlying comorbidities.

### Improving the management of sepsis in a district general hospital by implementing the 'sepsis six' recommendations [^114rAdte]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common condition with a major global impact on healthcare resources and expenditure. It is defined as the presence (probable or documented) of infection together with evidence of associated systemic manifestations, also known as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis combined with sepsis-induced organ dysfunction or tissue hypoperfusion, whilst septic shock is defined as continued sepsis-induced hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Data from studies conducted in mainly developed countries suggests that in adults, the incidence of severe sepsis is up to 300 cases per 100,000 population, and rising. Reported in-hospital mortality for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock ranges between 20% and 50%. Meanwhile, data specific for Australasia demonstrates 23% in-hospital mortality rates for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. There are few disease processes with such a high mortality, with patients admitted with severe sepsis having a 6–10 fold higher mortality risk than if they presented with an acute myocardial infarction and a 4–5 times greater risk than if they had suffered an acute stroke.

The fundamental approach to the management of sepsis includes early recognition, appropriate, and timely delivery of antibiotics, controlling the source of infection and adequate resuscitation with intravenous fluids and possibly vasoactive drugs. Mortality has been shown to increase by 7.6% for every hour of delay in starting antibiotic therapy. Unfortunately however, due to a variety of reasons including indecision by junior staff, availability of senior review and lack of awareness of the problem on general wards, there are frequently long delays between medical review and antibiotic administration. Meanwhile, whilst early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) has previously been associated with a 34% relative risk reduction in mortality, and was subsequently endorsed as a key strategy to reduce mortality from sepsis by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, more recent studies have not shown any benefit in terms of all-cause mortality in patients with early septic shock.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2012 [^114qFyMu]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Some recommendations were ungraded (UG). Recommendations were classified into three groups: 1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; 2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and 3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 hr of recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 hrs of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1C); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients) (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement, as based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 hrs) for patients with early ARDS and a Pao2/Fio2 < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 hrs after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 hrs of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5 to 10 mins (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### What is the preferred resuscitation fluid for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock? [^1142X2co]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock recommend crystalloids as the initial fluid solution of choice in the resuscitation of these patients. In recent years, there have been numerous studies published on the type of fluid used in the resuscitation of patients with sepsis. The primary goal of this article is to determine the preferred intravenous fluid for the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature review was completed to identify studies that investigated the type of resuscitation fluid in the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Articles included were those published in English between 2011 and 2016, enrolled human subjects, and limited to the following types: randomized controlled trial, prospective observational trial, retrospective cohort trial, and meta-analyses. All selected articles then underwent a structured review by the authors.

Results

Nine thousand sixty-two articles were identified in the search. After use of predetermined criteria, 17 articles were selected for review. Eleven of these were original investigations and six were meta-analyses and systemic reviews.

Conclusion

Crystalloids are the preferred solution for the resuscitation of emergency department patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Balanced crystalloids may improve patient-centered outcomes and should be considered as an alternative to normal saline, if available. There is strong evidence that suggests semi-synthetic colloids decrease survival and should be avoided. The role of albumin in the resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis and sepsis is uncertain.

Low tidal volume ventilation in non-ARDS respiratory failure — For adults with sepsis-induced respiratory failure (without acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), we suggest using low tidal volume ventilation as compared to high tidal volume ventilation. This is a weak recommendation with low quality of evidence. Prior guidance in ARDS specified low tidal volume (Vt 4–8 mL/kg of predicted body weight) versus higher volumes (Vt > 8 mL/kg). Supporting evidence includes a systematic review showing reduced composite ARDS or pneumonia with low versus high tidal volume ventilation (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.98) and an analysis of three RCTs (1,129 patients) showing no mortality difference with low Vt (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.26) with a trend toward lower ARDS risk (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.02). The rationale adds, We therefore suggest that low tidal volume ventilation be used in all patients with sepsis who are receiving mechanical ventilation to avoid underuse or delayed use of this intervention.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-and middle-income countries [^1154HTZb]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

Bedside portable ultrasound is a very useful tool that is more available than X-ray machines or CT scans in LMICs. A recent systematic review examining the trends in the use of POCUS in LMICs found the number of countries reporting use of ultrasound had grown from 50 to 62, with 70% of the included studies originating from Southeast Asia or sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, studies have demonstrated that POCUS skills can be effectively taught to both physicians and nonphysician clinicians in resource-limited settings. It remains to be seen if POCUS has the ability to effectively improve patient outcomes, although a single-center study from Tanzania demonstrated that POCUS resulted in earlier initiation of therapy, ranging widely from initiation of antibiotics to use of anticoagulants to surgical intervention, due to more rapid and accurate diagnosis.

Recommendations and suggestions

We suggest using POCUS for evaluating the etiology of shock in COVID-19 patients when performed by trained operators (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

2a. Fluid therapy for treatment of shock: For COVID-19 patients with shock in LMICs, should the overall volume resuscitation strategy be liberal or conservative?

Rationale.

Fluid resuscitation with crystalloids or colloids is often the first-line treatment for undifferentiated shock. However, both inadequate and excessive fluid resuscitation could be harmful in these patients. Currently, there is uncertainty in the literature regarding the optimal fluid resuscitation strategy.

Recommendations from other guidelines.

Surviving sepsis COVID-19 guidelines: For the acute resuscitation of adults with COVID-19 and shock, we suggest using a conservative over a liberal fluid strategy (weak suggestion).

WHO COVID-19 guidelines: In resuscitation for septic shock in adults, give 250–500 mL crystalloid fluid as rapid bolus in first 15–30 minutes. Clinical trials conducted in resource-limited settings comparing aggressive versus conservative fluid regimens suggest higher mortality in patients treated with aggressive fluid regimens.

### Moderate IV fluid resuscitation is associated with decreased sepsis mortality [^113zjDpi]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Current research suggests equipoise between a tightly restrictive or more liberal resuscitation strategy for patients with sepsis but data is lacking on a wider range of resuscitative practices.

Findings: In this retrospective analysis of 190,682 ICU patients with sepsis and septic shock, we found that being resuscitated by a physician who on average uses a moderate amount of IV fluid on the first day of care is associated with reduced mortality (2.5% lower) compared with patients resuscitated with either a very low or very high volume of IV fluid.

Meaning: A moderate approach to IV fluid is associated with decreased sepsis mortality and should be tested in future randomized controlled trials.

Since IV hypotonic saline mixed with sodium bicarbonate was first administered during the 1832 London cholera pandemic, physicians have sought to use IV fluids to restore intravascular circulating volume, improve organ perfusion, and resuscitate critically ill patients. Fluid administration practices used to resuscitate patients with sepsis have evolved over time, with significant changes in clinical practice occurring over the last three decades. Following the publication of the Rivers trial in 2001, the apparent benefit of early goal-directed therapy made high-volume IV fluid resuscitation widely popular for patients with sepsis and septic shock. The evolution in the resuscitation culture from a relatively low-volume to a high-volume strategy was swift. Throughout the 2000s, it was not uncommon for patients with sepsis to receive more than 10 L of IV fluid within the first 24 hours of care. Not long thereafter observational studies associated positive fluid balances with increased rates of respiratory failure and mortality. In the early 2010s, with growing concern that high-volume resuscitation was causing harm, there was a reevaluation of what had become accepted dogma. Clinical uncertainty surrounding the optimal IV fluid resuscitation strategy lead to large practice variation between physicians and hospitals. This phenomena is observed both in sepsis and in a variety of medical conditions across specialties. Some physicians continued to employ high-volume fluid resuscitation while others adopted a more restrictive approach, giving less than the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's recommended 30 mL/kg fluid bolus. Two large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in 2022 and 2023 compared a restrictive vs. liberal IV fluid management strategy for patients with sepsis associated hypotension. Neither study demonstrated a benefit in mortality, use of vasopressors, or mechanical ventilation for either approach.

### Practical considerations in sepsis resuscitation [^115d89JC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common condition managed in the emergency department, and the majority of patients respond to resuscitation measures, including antibiotics and i.v. fluids. However, a proportion of patients will fail to respond to standard treatment.

Objective

This review elucidates practical considerations for management of sepsis in patients who fail to respond to standard treatment.

Discussion

Early goal-directed therapy revolutionized sepsis management. However, there is a paucity of literature that provides a well-defined treatment algorithm for patients who fail to improve with therapy. Refractory shock can be defined as continued patient hemodynamic instability (mean arterial pressure, ≤ 65 mm Hg, lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L, altered mental status) after adequate fluid loading (at least 30 mL/kg i.v.), the use of two vasopressors (with one as norepinephrine), and provision of antibiotics. When a lack of improvement is evident in the early stages of resuscitation, systematically considering source control, appropriate volume resuscitation, adequate antimicrobial coverage, vasopressor selection, presence of metabolic pathology, and complications of resuscitation, such as abdominal compartment syndrome and respiratory failure, allow emergency physicians to address the entire clinical scenario.

Conclusions

The care of sepsis has experienced many changes in recent years. Care of the patient with sepsis who is not responding appropriately to initial resuscitation is troublesome for emergency physicians. This review provides practical considerations for resuscitation of the patient with septic shock. When a septic patient is refractory to standard therapy, systematically evaluating the patient and clinical course may lead to improved outcomes.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^113gAbzK]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

This report expands on clinical concepts outlined in "Fluid Resuscitation and Vasopressor Therapy", previously identified as priorities by the SSC Research Committee. The authors aimed to provide clinicians and researchers with a detailed and informative summary of pressing questions that require investigation in the realms of fluid resuscitation strategies and vasopressor administration. Optimal approaches to fluid resuscitation and application of vasopressor therapies have evolved over the past decade as knowledge accumulates in the field, necessitating iterations to previous questions. In a domain of sepsis research as ripe as shock treatment, we hope that this review serves as a roadmap for future trials in the field of septic shock treatment.

Septic shock — evidence on combination therapy across sepsis sources: A meta-analysis "of 64 randomized and quasi-randomized trials (7586 patients with culture-positive bacterial septic shock)" comparing β-lactam monotherapy with β-lactam plus aminoglycoside found "no difference in mortality, regardless of whether the trial arms included the same β-lactam (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, .75–1.35) or different β-lactams (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, .71–1.01)", whereas "a propensity-matched analysis (2446 patients) found that early combination therapy was associated with decreased mortality in septic shock". The panel noted that studies "did not require specific criteria to define the patients as having septic shock" and that inclusion of less severely ill patients may dilute benefits, and stated "very low confidence" in applying these estimates to HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa because evidence was observational, inconsistent, and indirect.

Overview of the Presentation

The three fluid and vasopressor questions identified by the Task Force as a whole are as follows:

1) What are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?
2) What is the optimal fluid for sepsis resuscitation?
3) What is the optimal approach to selection, dose titration, and escalation of vasopressor therapy?

The format for each of the three questions directly mirrors that used in the previously published overview, which contains a more extensive description of the methods. One question was assigned to each author for review and summary. The presentation of each question is followed by a critique of the existing evidence of what is currently known of the subject. Subsequently, each author presented what is not known regarding each question and the gaps in our current understanding of the subject. For each question, the suggested research questions are iterative and aim to address broad areas of uncertainty. Accordingly, clinical outcomes may need to be refined to not only determine mortality benefit but also inform stakeholders on relevant outcomes of interest, such as, quality of life, organ function, and resource utilization. Finally, each author concluded their overarching question by presenting a proposed list of research questions deemed worthy of further inquiry. This list of questions was purposefully intended to be exhaustive, and the authors acknowledge that they may not be answered in the coming decade but are necessary to describe so as to provide a roadmap for where research efforts should be directed.

Question 1: What Are Ideal Endpoints for Volume Resuscitation and How Should Volume Resuscitation Be Titrated?

What is known.

The rationale for fluid resuscitation is largely derived from multiple experimental and clinical studies. Fluid resuscitation increases cardiac output, at least at the early stages of sepsis. In addition, fluid resuscitation increases microvascular perfusion in patients with septic shock, and this is associated with improved organ function.

The impact of fluid resuscitation on outcome is less obvious and is mostly supported by experimental data. Large-scale interventional trials investigating goal-directed therapy did not directly address the amount, timing, or guiding clinical variables beyond central venous oxygenation (Sc 2). In preclinical models of sepsis, fluid administration prolongs survival time compared with no fluid resuscitation, even though long-term outcomes could not be evaluated from these types of studies. Specifically, out-of-hospital fluid administration during transport by paramedics is associated with an improved outcome in hypotensive patients (19), it has not been associated with a benefit, and it may even be associated with increased mortality, in normotensive patients.

### How I personalize fluid therapy in septic shock? [^114vJYFP]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

How to customize the initial fluid volume?

The latest SSC guidelines state that septic patients with hypotension or an elevated blood lactate should receive ≥ 30 mL/kg of crystalloid within 3 hours of presentation. This volume, which is only based on an observational study, aims to compensate for relative and absolute hypovolaemia during initial septic shock. The patient's weight is the only parameter of individualization. Yet, the degree of initial volume deficit obviously differs among patients. First, relative hypovolaemia is linked to venous vasodilation, depending on shock severity. Second, in some patients, fluid losses may account for absolute hypovolaemia, which must also be compensated. For example, the fluid deficit must be larger during peritonitis than during pneumonia. The recommendation of an arbitrary volume of 30 mL/kg inevitably leads to under-resuscitation in some patients and fluid overload in others. In addition, tolerance to fluid administration also depends on the cardiac function. The initial fluid therapy should then be individualized. For instance, deciding to reduce the initial volume infused only based on the patient condition may increase mortality.

In the very initial phase, as hypovolaemia is constant, testing preload responsiveness is not warranted and may delay resuscitation. Afterwards, volume expansion should be individualized according to the degree of preload responsiveness, to avoid unnecessary fluid infusion (Fig. 1). This is recommended by the SSC which, on this point, suggests individualization of treatment. Assessing preload responsiveness should not be delayed as it disappears quickly after the onset of septic shock and it. In the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK study, after having received 27 mL/kg of fluids, 70% of patients were still preload responsive at inclusion, and among them, < 20% remained so four hours later. Guiding initial fluid therapy by evaluating preload responsiveness during septic shock can reduce the fluid balance.

How to customize the choice of test or index of preload responsiveness?

Reviews detailing indices and tests to detect preload responsiveness can be found elsewhere. Our goal here is to describe what leads to choosing one over another. This choice depends on three questions (Fig. 1).

### A critique of fluid bolus resuscitation in severe sepsis [^115AfLgc]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Resuscitation of septic patients by means of one or more fluid boluses is recommended by guidelines from multiple relevant organizations and as a component of surviving sepsis campaigns. The technique is considered a key and life-saving intervention during the initial treatment of severe sepsis in children and adults. Such recommendations, however, are only based on expert opinion and lack adequate experimental or controlled human evidence. Despite these limitations, fluid bolus therapy (20 to 40 ml/kg) is widely practiced and is currently considered a cornerstone of the management of sepsis. In this pointof-view critique, we will argue that such therapy has weak physiological support, has limited experimental support, and is at odds with emerging observational data in several subgroups of critically ill patients or those having major abdominal surgery. Finally, we will argue that this paradigm is now challenged by the findings of a large randomized controlled trial in septic children. In the present article, we contend that the concept of large fluid bolus resuscitation in sepsis needs to be investigated further.

### Surviving sepsis: a guide to the guidelines [^115LHQs5]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The revised Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock have recently been published. These guidelines represent the end product of an intense process and provide a template approach to the early resuscitation and support of patients with sepsis, based on a synthesis of evidence that has been shown to improve the outcome of the septic patient. The SSC guidelines arose from a recognition that care of the septic patient was suboptimal for at least three reasons. First, the entity of sepsis was frequently not diagnosed in a timely fashion, allowing the process to evolve into a life-threatening syndrome of major physiologic organ system dysfunction. Secondly, even when sepsis was recognized, the urgency of treatment was underappreciated - and so haemodynamic resuscitation was tentative, and the administration of effective antibiotic therapy was often delayed. Finally, treatment was often suboptimal, and failed to take advantage of emerging insights into optimal approaches to patient management. The revised guidelines are far from perfect, but they represent the best available synthesis of contemporary knowledge in this area and as such should be promoted.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa HAP/VAP — antibiotic strategy guidance: For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who are not in septic shock or at a high risk for death, and for whom the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known, we recommend monotherapy using an antibiotic to which the isolate is susceptible rather than combination therapy (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who remain in septic shock or at a high risk for death when the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known, we suggest combination therapy using 2 antibiotics to which the isolate is susceptible rather than monotherapy (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa, we recommend against aminoglycoside monotherapy (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). High risk of death in the meta-regression analysis was defined as mortality risk > 25%; low risk of death is defined as mortality risk < 15%. For a patient whose septic shock resolves when antimicrobial sensitivities were known, continued combination therapy is not recommended.

### Early goal-directed therapy: what do we do now? [^115V3TLC]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The meta-analysis of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) by Gu and colleagues in the previous issue of Critical Care adds to the ongoing controversy about the value of EGDT for resuscitating patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. The results of the ProCESS (protocolized care for early septic shock) and ARISE (Australasian resuscitation in sepsis evaluation) trials failed to demonstrate any benefit of EGDT or protocolized resuscitation when compared with 'usual care'. The questions are the following: What is 'usual' care? What is 'real world' care? Do the results of a robust and well-conducted randomized controlled trial - in which many patients may be excluded for a variety of reasons - reflect the care given to patients on a daily basis in our emergency departments and intensive care units? Of course, there are no obvious answers to these questions, and many clinicians look forward to managing these patients without protocols. For now, the data do seem to support the management of patients with septic shock without mandated central lines or protocols. Does this mean we should go back to the era of 'do whatever you want'? No consensus exists among clinicians regarding optimal hemodynamic monitoring, and to date no method has been proven to be superior. Given the amount of fluids given prior to randomization in the ProCESS and ARISE trials, 'usual care' appears to now include aggressive, early fluid resuscitation with at least 20 mL/kg of crystalloid and rapid administration of appropriate antibiotics. Certainly, this reflects the impact of the original trial by Rivers and colleagues and the broad-based implementation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines and bundles. If this continues to define 'usual care', then perhaps it is no longer necessary to mandate specific protocols for resuscitation, as it appears that standard sepsis management has evolved to be consistent with published protocols.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^115ynsKg]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Fluid balance in sepsis and septic shock — restrictive versus liberal strategies after initial resuscitation: Recommendation 45 states "There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of restrictive versus liberal fluid strategies in the first 24 hours of resuscitation in patients with sepsis and septic shock who still have signs of hypoperfusion and volume depletion after initial resuscitation", with the remark that "Fluid resuscitation should be given only if patients present with signs of hypoperfusion". The rationale notes that "The four largest clinical trials in sepsis resuscitation used moderate to large amounts of fluids in the first 72 hours", with Rivers administering "over 13 L of fluids" and ProCESS, ARISE and ProMISe "approximately 7 to 8 L in the usual care groups"; recent evidence "suggests that IV fluids used to restore organ perfusion may damage vascular integrity and lead to organ dysfunction", and observational and African data have shown an "association of high-volume fluid resuscitation and increased mortality", though generalizability is limited by comorbidities and resource constraints.

### Diagnosis of infection in sepsis: an evidence-based review [^116ARUYJ]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for the diagnosis of infection in sepsis that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591.

Conclusions

Obtaining a precise bacteriological diagnosis before starting antibiotic therapy is, when possible, of paramount importance for the success of therapeutic strategy during sepsis. Two to three blood cultures should be performed, preferably from a peripheral vein, without interval between samples to avoid delaying therapy. A quantitative approach is preferred in most cases when possible, in particular for catheter-related infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia is complex, and a diagnostic algorithm is proposed. Appropriate samples are indicated during soft tissue and intraabdominal infections, but cultures obtained through the drains are discouraged.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116Xkvmv]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) is a long-standing initiative of Society of Critical Care Medicine and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine designed to improve mortality from sepsis. The Campaign has released four sets of guidelines, with another due to be published in 2021. Although recommendations within the SSC guidelines have been associated with improved outcomes, the guidelines are often unable to make more specific recommendations in multiple areas of clinical importance due to ongoing gaps in the literature.

In an attempt to define priorities for research within the field of sepsis, SSC created a research committee that was charged with developing a list of research questions related to sepsis. This led to the joint publication of "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Research Priorities for Sepsis and Septic Shock" in Critical Care Medicine and Intensive Care Medicine in August 2018. The initial document presented a broad overview, identifying 26 questions to explore as research priorities in several domains with an explicit intention to publish separate papers with more detailed descriptions for each domain in the future. This article is the second in a series of manuscripts (following a prior effort devoted to basic science research), which will expand upon the three research questions related to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors originating from the broader publication.

### Enhanced perioperative care in emergency general surgery: the WSES position paper [^117BbmEZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Volemic status should be evaluated and corrected with goal-directed fluid therapy as soon as possible in the pre-operative phase (LoE B)

The majority of emergency general surgery patients present with fluid derangements, mostly related to acute illness, underlying sepsis, prolonged fasting and vomiting. In this setting, preoperative evaluation of the patient should focus on the volemic assessment to rapidly correct alterations in patients' homeostasis, including stress response, gut dysfunction, insulin resistance, electrolyte imbalances, fluid shifts, SIRS and sepsis with varying degrees of organ dysfunction. Although complete optimization of medical conditions cannot be fully achieved in the emergency setting, adequate intravenous fluid resuscitation in emergency general surgery is crucial and feasible, and it should be attempted in all patients. A prospective randomized trial demonstrated better postoperative outcomes when patients were preoperatively managed with a fixed protocol to reach homeostasis. The adopted protocol defined three targets for the goal-directed crystalloid resuscitation: central venous pressure of 8–12 cmH₂O, mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg and urinary output > 0.5 mL/Kg/h. The initial resuscitation should be titrated to the clinical response, such as fluid responsiveness, and not solely guided by a predetermined protocol, with particular attention to the underlying disease. Despite restoring homeostasis should be considered a goal, surgical treatment should not be delayed. According to the indications from the 2016 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines, resuscitation from sepsis-induced hypoperfusion should require at least 30 ml/kg of intravenous crystalloid fluids within the first 3 h. However, in the updated 2021 version of the Guidelines, the strength of this recommendation was downgraded from "strong" to "weak" (quality of evidence: low) and the recommendation was modified in a suggestion. Massive fluid therapy has been challenged in the enhanced recovery approach. Fluid overload should be avoided since it is associated with higher rates of respiratory complications (i.e. pneumonia, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure) and secondary anastomotic leaks. Early, i.e. preoperative, goal-directed fluid therapy in sepsis was the treatment of the experimental arm in a randomized clinical trial enrolling septic patients published in 2001. Excluding patients who needed immediate surgery from the trial, in-hospital mortality was 30.5% in the group assigned to early goal-directed therapy, as compared with 46.5% in the group assigned to standard therapy (P = 0.009). Tendberg et al. developed a perioperative protocol for emergency high-risk abdominal surgery in which stroke volume-guided hemodynamic optimization before surgery was a key element. The study has shown a significant reduction in mortality as well as postoperative length of ICU stay after the introduction of the standardized protocol. Therefore, patients should be carefully evaluated and goal-directed fluid resuscitation should be implemented as soon as possible.

### Recommendations for fluid management of adults with sepsis in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review of guidelines [^113B6Fyd]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

We have adopted strict protocols in this systematic review, including dual extraction and synthesis. Another strength is the use of the validated AGREE II tools to describe the guideline development in multiple domains. Lastly, we have endeavoured to objectively measure the bedside utility by assessing the guidelines against structured clinical scenarios and believe that this novel method represents a further dimension in which to gauge the worth of the guidelines.

We have described guidelines over almost two decades and have summarised data agnostic of the year of publication; it is reasonable to believe that more recent recommendations are better supported by evidence and are therefore superior. This emphasises the need for explicit dates for update or retirement of all guidelines. We are also unable to map which guidelines are currently used and how discrepancies are resolved at the level of the hospital or clinician. Our search did not include local hospital policies and our assumption that these are likely to be related to one of the published guidelines may not be correct.

We have also assumed that codifying patient presentation and the markers by which they are assessed can be done without resort to "physician impression and tailored therapy". This tension is present in all guidelines, but we feel there is considerable evidence that systematising care is beneficial for patient outcomes. Improving the specificity of assessment, perhaps using decision support aids, could help clinicians and health service managers in remote and underserved areas.

### Source control in bloodstream infections in patients with sepsis, septic shock, or requiring ICU admission: a scoping review with recommendations for standardizing research [^114zw3rC]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bloodstream infections (BSI) represent 15% of intensive care units (ICU) infections, often causing sepsis or septic shock with mortality rates of 35–50%. BSIs are classified as primary, when they do not have an identifiable source, or secondary when originating from infections at sites such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections, or device- and catheter-associated infections.

BSI management includes antimicrobial therapy, source control (SC) and supportive care. SC encompasses interventions to reduce bacterial or fungal load and limit infection spread by physically controlling or removing the infection source, such as repairing, diverting, or excising a perforated viscus, draining fluid collections and abscesses, or removing infected foreign bodies and debriding devitalized tissues.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends rapidly identifying the infection source and implementing any required SC as a best practice statement. These statements are made when evidence is insufficient for GRADE evaluation but the intervention's clinical benefit is sufficiently obvious to make a recommendation. High-quality randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating SC have not been conducted. Observational data consistently associates SC failure to increased mortality in sepsis and septic shock, BSI, or intra-abdominal infections. Furthermore, SC may significantly impact research outcomes for other infectious diseases interventions, and as such is a critical variable for reporting and adjustment in antibiotic or sepsis trials.

The aims of this scoping review were to describe SC definitions, assessment and reporting in the BSI literature for patients with sepsis, septic shock, or ICU admission, and to provide recommendations for improving the quality of its reporting.

TABLE 1.
Composition of Commonly Used Isotonic Crystalloid Solutions

A similar but smaller effect was found when comparing saline with buffered solutions in the same center for noncritically ill patients admitted from the emergency department to the hospital wards. When looking at individual patient-centric outcomes including mortality and AKI (rather than a composite outcome), recent meta-analyses are conflicting as to whether balanced crystalloid solutions are superior to saline, both in critical illness in general and in sepsis specifically. Of note, trials comparing buffered solutions with saline have generally not considered arterial blood gases and laboratory data in their design. One may potentially criticize the continued administration of saline in a patient with hyperchloremic acidosis, as this deviates from the current practice of many clinicians. Similarly, retrospective or database studies have reported consistent effects of reduced occurrence of in-hospital mortality, AKI, and need for renal replacement therapy.

### Integrating sepsis management recommendations into clinical care guidelines for district hospitals in resource-limited settings: the necessity to augment new guidelines with future research [^111xEuuM]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Applicability of existing sepsis guidelines to resource-limited settings

While there is some evidence to support the feasibility of implementing modified sepsis management guidelines in resource-limited settings, substantial health system and resource challenges impede the translation of current best practice guidelines in these environments. For example, variable access and long distances to hospitals contribute to severely ill patients presenting to the health system. In addition, triage capacity is often absent in district hospitals, leading to further delays in recognizing ill patients and initiating treatment. Once recognized, a lack of effective antimicrobials, oxygen and intravenous fluids may further impair provision of optimal sepsis care. Moreover, human resources are often scarce with respect to both quantity and expertise, thus precluding the labor-intensive iterative approach that characterizes sepsis management in high resource settings.

Identifying which should be the priority interventions for sepsis management in a resource-limited setting is a further challenge. While evidence exists for the benefit of prompt and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, answering questions regarding the utility of other therapies commonly available in high-resource settings is difficult. For example, are intravenous fluid boluses safe in the absence of close patient monitoring and respiratory support equipment? Are central venous catheters beneficial for guiding volume resuscitation in a resource-limited setting when weighed against the attendant risks of mechanical complications and infection? Given global efforts to improve oxygen monitoring capacity and supply, what level of oxygen should be targeted in septic patients? Furthermore, it is not known if (or which) isolated interventions in sepsis, unbundled from the packages of sepsis care that have been adopted in high resource hospitals, may still result in net benefit.

The etiologies of sepsis in many resource-limited environments differ from high resource settings or have not been well described. Bacteraemia studies implicate a wide range of pathogens. Many other organisms including Plasmodium falciparum, dengue virus, influenza, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Cryptococcus neoformans and Rickettsia species may cause severe clinical illness that cannot be easily distinguished from typical bacterial sepsis. In addition, immune suppression from HIV is an important risk factor for adult sepsis in places where HIV prevalence is high. Thus, clinical trials of sepsis therapies conducted in high-resource settings and targeting mostly bacterial infection may not be generalizable to resource-limited settings. This issue is further compounded by the dearth of diagnostic capacity to identify the specific etiologies of sepsis and to determine antimicrobial susceptibility in most district hospitals. Consequently, there is little empirically-derived local or regional data to guide hospital procurement and clinician selection of appropriate antimicrobial treatment.

Initial resuscitation — timing, volume, and assessment approach: Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies, and "we recommend that treatment and resuscitation begin immediately" (Best practice statement). For patients with sepsis induced hypoperfusion or septic shock, "we suggest that at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid should be given within the first 3 hours of resuscitation" (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, "we suggest using dynamic measures to guide fluid resuscitation over physical examination or static parameters alone" (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), with dynamic parameters including response to a passive leg raise or a fluid bolus using stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), or echocardiography. A retrospective analysis "showed that failure to receive 30 mL/kg of crystalloid fluid therapy within 3 hours of sepsis onset was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality, delayed resolution of hypotension and increased length of stay in ICU".

### It's not just the antibiotics, it's the treatment [^111wHH6t]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The recent study by Bloos and colleagues demonstrates that early initiation of antimicrobial therapy is not associated with improved survival in sepsis. We contend that these findings should not be surprising. This study is yet another part of the growing case against early and aggressive antimicrobial therapy and highlights the important roles resuscitation and source control play in the management of the septic patient. We suggest that, whenever possible, antimicrobial therapy should we withheld until objective evidence of infection has been obtained.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — fluid bolus strategy beyond initial resuscitation: If fluid therapy beyond the initial 30 mL/kg administration is required, clinicians may use repeated small boluses guided by objective measures of stroke volume (SV) and/or cardiac output (CO). In post-cardiac surgery patients, fluid challenges of 4 mL/kg compared to 1 to 3 mL/kg increased sensitivity for detecting fluid responsiveness based on CO measurement. In resource-limited regions where CO or SV cannot be measured, a > 15% increase in pulse pressure during a passive leg-raise test for 60–90 seconds could indicate fluid responsiveness.

### Fluids in the ICU: which is the right one? [^113B6rMe]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

In the early phase of treatment it is undoubtedly important to act quickly, but as the resuscitation phase moves into the maintenance phase, a more nuanced approach to fluid therapy is warranted, with specific therapeutic targets becoming more important.

The right amount of fluid is still a matter of an ongoing discussion. For initial resuscitation in septic shock the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends 30 mL/kg in the first 3 h. However, after this initial fluid bolus, repeated lactate measurements (to determine its clearance) are recommended as parameters for adequate therapy. In addition, other clinical examinations such as central venous saturation, echocardiography, invasive hemodynamic monitoring or a simple assessment of capillary refill time are available as potential targets for the individualization of fluid strategies. In ARDS patients a restrictive fluid management strategy (leading to an equal balance over 7 days) resulted in improved weaning from mechanical ventilation. On the contrary, restrictive fluid management in the perioperative setting resulted in increased rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal replacement therapy (RRT).

Interestingly, the recently published Conservative vs. Liberal Approach to fluid therapy of Septic Shock in Intensive Care (CLASSIC) trial investigating the effect of restricted volume administration by accepting higher thresholds of lactate and mottling, as well as lower mean arterial pressures than usually recommended, did not show any difference in outcome compared with standard fluid therapy. However, the median difference in the cumulative fluid balance between the two groups was only 744 mL (1676 mL versus 2420 mL) after 5 days and in a subanalysis of patients who had received < 30 mL/kg fluids before randomization (n = 520) the 90-day mortality was 5.3% higher than in the standard-fluid group. Although these results were not statistically significant a restrictive fluid strategy may be harmful for patients with reduced effective circulating volume.

### Impact of the implementation of a sepsis protocol for the management of fluid-refractory septic shock: a single-center, before-and-after study [^1168X9zd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence-based guidelines have been published for the acute management of severe sepsis and septic shock. Key goals of institution-driven protocols include timely fluid resuscitation and antibiotic selection, as well as source control.

Objective

This study assessed the impact of a sepsis protocol on the timeliness of antibiotic administration, the adequacy of fluid resuscitation, and 28-day mortality in patients with fluid-refractory septic shock.

Methods

This was a single-center, before-and-after study (18 months before July 2007 and 18 months after) with prospective data collection evaluating the outcomes of a sepsis protocol in adult patients with fluid-refractory septic shock. All patients received a fluid challenge and antibiotics; those who did not were excluded from this analysis. Preprotocol findings led to the development of the sepsis protocol, which emphasized fluid resuscitation, timely administration of antibiotic therapy, and collection of specimens for culture at the onset of septic shock. In the pre- and postprotocol phases of the study, data were collected prospectively and analyzed for demographic characteristics; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score; appropriateness of fluid resuscitation; antibiotic use; number of vasopressor, ventilator, and intensive care unit (ICU) days; and 28-day mortality. Outcomes were measured prospectively at any time during the patient's hospital admission. The primary end points were the time to administration of antimicrobial therapy and the appropriateness of fluid resuscitation before and after implementation of the sepsis protocol.

Results

A total of 118 patients were included in the analysis: 64 and 54 in the pre- and postprotocol groups, respectively. Patients in the preprotocol group were primarily women (53% [34/64]) and had a mean (SD) age of 61 (15.5) years and a mean APACHE II score of 28 (6.0). Patients in the postprotocol group were primarily men (54% [29/54]) and had a mean age of 52 (18.0) years and a mean APACHE II score of 27 (6.4). Implementation of the sepsis protocol resulted in a greater percentage of patients receiving timely antibiotic therapy (ie, within 4.5 hours of refractory shock; 85% [46/54] vs 56% [36/64]; P = 0.001) and adequate fluid resuscitation (72% [39/54] vs 31% [20/64]; P < 0.001) compared with the preprotocol group. Post hoc analysis found significant decreases in the number of vasopressor days (mean [SD], 3.8 [2.7] to 1.4 [1.5]; P < 0.001), ventilator days (9.1 [12.2] to 2.7 [4.0]; P < 0.001), and ICU days (12.3 [12.6] to 4.9 [3.9]; P < 0.001) in the postprotocol group. In-hospital mortality was not significantly different between the groups (survival 46% [28/61] before vs 54% [33/61] after the protocol). Multivariate analysis for predictors of in-hospital mortality identified an interval between shock and empiric antibiotic administration of > 4.5 hours (odds ratio [OR] = 5.54; 95% CI, 1.91–16.07; P < 0.002), vasopressor duration in days (OR = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.01–1.59; P = 0.037), APACHE II score (OR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.05–1.24; P = 0.003), and type of infection (community vs nosocomial, OR = 0.18; 95% CI, 0.05–0.61; P = 0.006) as significant predictors. The 28-day mortality decreased from 61% (39/64) to 33% (18/54) after implementation of the protocol (P = 0.004).

Conclusion

Implementation of a sepsis protocol emphasizing early administration of antibiotic therapy and adequate fluid resuscitation was associated with improved clinical outcomes and lower 28-day mortality in patients with fluid-refractory septic shock at this institution.

### Fluid therapy for critically ill adults with sepsis: a review [^1168pvSh]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 20% to 30% of patients admitted to an intensive care unit have sepsis. While fluid therapy typically begins in the emergency department, intravenous fluids in the intensive care unit are an essential component of therapy for sepsis.

Observations

For patients with sepsis, intravenous fluid can increase cardiac output and blood pressure, maintain or increase intravascular fluid volume, and deliver medications. Fluid therapy can be conceptualized as 4 overlapping phases from early illness through resolution of sepsis: resuscitation (rapid fluid administered to restore perfusion); optimization (the risks and benefits of additional fluids to treat shock and ensure organ perfusion are evaluated); stabilization (fluid therapy is used only when there is a signal of fluid responsiveness); and evacuation (excess fluid accumulated during treatment of critical illness is eliminated). Among 3723 patients with sepsis who received 1 to 2 L of fluid, 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reported that goal-directed therapy administering fluid boluses to attain a central venous pressure of 8 to 12 mm Hg, vasopressors to attain a mean arterial blood pressure of 65 to 90 mm Hg, and red blood cell transfusions or inotropes to attain a central venous oxygen saturation of at least 70% did not decrease mortality compared with unstructured clinical care (24.9% vs 25.4%; p = 0.68). Among 1563 patients with sepsis and hypotension who received 1 L of fluid, an RCT reported that favoring vasopressor treatment did not improve mortality compared with further fluid administration (14.0% vs 14.9%; p = 0.61). Another RCT reported that among 1554 patients in the intensive care unit with septic shock treated with at least 1 L of fluid compared with more liberal fluid administration, restricting fluid administration in the absence of severe hypoperfusion did not reduce mortality (42.3% vs 42.1%; p = 0.96). An RCT of 1000 patients with acute respiratory distress during the evacuation phase reported that limiting fluid administration and administering diuretics improved the number of days alive without mechanical ventilation compared with fluid treatment to attain higher intracardiac pressure (14.6 vs 12.1 days; P < .001), and it reported that hydroxyethyl starch significantly increased the incidence of kidney replacement therapy compared with saline (7.0% vs 5.8%; p = 0.04), Ringer lactate, or Ringer acetate.

Conclusions and Relevance

Fluids are an important component of treating patients who are critically ill with sepsis. Although optimal fluid management in patients with sepsis remains uncertain, clinicians should consider the risks and benefits of fluid administration in each phase of critical illness, avoid use of hydroxyethyl starch, and facilitate fluid removal for patients recovering from acute respiratory distress syndrome.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^111yuQiB]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A recent systematic analysis demonstrated that colloids are more efficient than crystalloids in reaching hemodynamic goals. However, colloids are significantly more expensive than crystalloids, and there are no large-scale studies convincingly demonstrating a beneficial effect of colloids on patient-centric outcomes. It may not be fair to generalize amongst colloids, where the type of colloid also impacts outcome. The most straightforward example is hydroxyethyl starches, which are associated with a higher degree of renal injury and possible risk of death, without any clear benefits and, are therefore, not recommended for use in sepsis.

There is a robust body of evidence evaluating the effects of albumin administration in critical illness in general and, more specifically, in sepsis and septic shock, either as a primary comparison or as a subset analysis of a larger trial. This has resulted in a suggestion from SSC to use albumin in addition to crystalloids for initial resuscitation and subsequent intravascular volume replacement in patients with sepsis and septic shock when patients require substantial amounts of crystalloids. This recommendation is largely based on 1) the ALBIOS trial which reported albumin may be associated with decreased mortality in the subgroup of patients with septic shock and hypoalbuminemia and 2) the SAFE trial which showed no benefit to albumin in overall survival in critical illness but a decreased mortality in the subgroup of patients with sepsis. Importantly, in the ALBIOS trial, albumin was administered in hypoalbuminemic septic patients in an attempt to maintain a serum albumin level of 30 g per liter or more. In addition, albumin was given as a daily dose (up to 300 mL of 20% albumin) for 7 days. In contrast, a recent single-center trial of 360 septic patients with cancer failed to show beneficial effects for the addition of albumin on 30-day mortality. Notably, studies comparing colloids with crystalloids used saline as a comparator. If buffered solutions are indeed superior to saline, the potential benefits of colloids reported in previous trials may have been related to disadvantages related to the saline comparator and should be investigated further, perhaps in the setting of a three-armed trial with a saline arm, a buffered solutions arm, and an albumin arm. Studies evaluating albumin primary test albumin as a maintenance fluid rather than a resuscitation fluid in the stages of initial resuscitation, primarily after crystalloids, have proved ineffective. There may be a role to evaluate albumin as a supplemental resuscitation fluid following initial resuscitation with crystalloids. Finally, there are no large-scale studies evaluating albumin as a resuscitation fluid, triggered by hemodynamic endpoints.

### Is restriction of intravenous fluid beneficial for septic shock in ICU patients? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114nVzoP]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Based on studies of early goal-directed therapy, the current SSC guidelines recommend administering at least 30 mL/kg of intravenous crystalloid within the first 3 h to patients with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or septic shock. However, clinical practice and research have demonstrated that this initial dose might not be appropriate for all patients with septic shock and could potentially yield over-resuscitation, especially in patients with comorbid cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Hjortrup et al. compared the outcomes of patients with septic shock receiving restricted fluid management after initial resuscitation and standard treatment through the ClASSIC study. Although some observational studies have suggested potential benefits of restrictive strategies in reducing acute kidney injury, our meta-analysis found no significant difference between the approaches. The results of two recent large randomized controlled observational studies support our findings. Meyhoff et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 31 ICUs in eight European countries, comparing restrictive intravenous and standard rehydration therapies. The authors described that fluid restriction failed to reduce 90-day all-cause mortality or the incidence of serious adverse events. Another study involving 1563 patients from 60 centers in the United States examined the primary outcome of all-cause mortality before discharge and at day 90; secondary outcomes included 28 days without ventilator use, days without renal replacement therapy, days without vasopressor use, and days to discharge. Vasopressor application occurred earlier and lasted longer in the restricted fluid group, whereas no significant between-group difference could be observed in the 28- and 90-day mortality or serious adverse event rates. This discrepancy could be attributed to the differing condition severity of the patients included in the study and the inclusion of patients originating from the general ward or the operating room for fluid resuscitation followed by admission to the ICU, potentially yielding errors in the experimental results. In addition, a prospective observational study demonstrated that daily fluid intake was lower in patients who recovered than in those who did not recover from septic shock, despite the daily output being similar, with the daily fluid balance of non-survivors being twice that of survivors. Finally, sustained positive fluid balance was an independent risk factor for increased long-term mortality in patients with sepsis. All these studies concluded that aggressive fluid resuscitation can lead to adverse consequences in patients with sepsis, potentially attributable to aggressive fluid strategies resulting in massive fluid overload. Fluid overload increases cardiac filling and promotes the release of natriuretic peptides. These peptides cleave proteoglycans and glycoproteins in the glycocalyx, which alters vascular permeability. This process causes tissue and organ edema and dysfunction, especially in patients with coexisting cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Therefore, the recommended conventional fluid resuscitation strategy is increasingly being questioned.

### A blueprint for a sepsis protocol [^117DoGuu]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Despite numerous advances in medicine, sepsis remains an unconquered challenge. Although outcomes have improved slightly over decades, the unacceptably high mortality rate of 30%-50% for severe sepsis and septic shock continues. However, after years of unsuccessful clinical trials, several investigations over the last few years have reported survival benefit in the treatment of sepsis. Physicians now have several proven therapies to treat sepsis, but have yet to implement them on a widespread, systematic basis. This led 11 international professional societies spanning multiple specialties and continents to come together to create the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. The product of their work is an international effort organized to improve care of patients with sepsis and includes consensus, evidence-based guidelines for care that improves survival in septic patients, and an action plan for change. Given the clear role of early identification and treatment in stopping the sepsis cascade, therapy must start early in the emergency department (ED) and continue throughout the hospital course. The first of the recommendations by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign is the aggressive resuscitation strategy of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT). EGDT is reported to reduce absolute mortality by a staggering 16%. The use of recombinant activated protein C was demonstrated to confer a 6% absolute survival benefit. Steroid supplementation in adrenal insufficiency produced a 10% benefit. Additionally, early and appropriate use of antibiotics remains a cornerstone of therapy. Although no randomized trial will be performed, the effects are undisputed. Finally, although predominantly intensive care unit therapies, tight glucose control and low-tidal-volume ventilation strategies have also led to improved survival. Armed with these new therapies, the medical community must rise to this call to action. Clinicians must change the approach to this disease, as well as the way the septic patient is viewed. Although complex and challenging, these therapies must be brought to the patient's bedside. We propose and describe the Multiple Urgent Sepsis Therapies (MUST) protocol as a practical way to implement a comprehensive treatment plan using available evidence-based therapies.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: guidelines on the management of critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^113SNDxk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world. Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed.

Methods

We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for 6 questions. The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy.

Conclusion

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19. When available, we will provide new recommendations in further releases of these guidelines.

Regarding medical management for sepsis and septic shock, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation (indications), SSC 2021 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend on the use of restrictive versus liberal fluid strategies in the first 24 hours of resuscitation in patients with sepsis and septic shock still having signs of hypoperfusion and volume depletion after initial resuscitation.

### The association between time to antibiotics and relevant clinical outcomes in emergency department patients with various stages of sepsis: a prospective multi-center study [^113CXcmz]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main new finding of the present study is that a reduction in time to antibiotics was not found to be associated with an improvement of relevant clinical outcomes in our cohort of ED patients with mild to severe stages of sepsis. A reduction in time to antibiotics was also not found to be associated with an increase in number of surviving days outside the hospital at day 28 after ED presentation. Corresponding to the number of ventilator-free days in ICU-related studies, we chose this primary endpoint instead of hospital LOS to avoid confounding of the association between time to antibiotics and hospital LOS by mortality.

Our findings are in contrast to a study by Houck et al. of approximately 14,000 patients with a pneumonia, which found an increase in hospital LOS of 0.4 days with administration of antibiotics after four hours. Several differences may explain the discrepancy. The retrospective design of the study is prone to information bias, especially with regard to the timing of antibiotics. Furthermore, it consisted of a population with only elderly patients with pneumonia, while in our study all adults with all sources of infection were included. Also, there was no control for appropriateness of the initial choice of antibiotics and amount of fluids. Several smaller retrospective studies that found an increased hospital LOS with administration of antibiotics beyond two to eight hours had similar methodological drawbacks.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^115d3nLk]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Initial resuscitation

The 2012 guidelines recommended a 'protocolized, quantitative resuscitation… of patients with sepsis induced hypoperfusion as defined as hypotension persistent after initial fluid challenge or lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L'. Care bundles were developed to reflect this goal and were revised in 2015 to specify goals to be met within the first 3 hours of care and those to be achieved by 6 hours. The goals of the first bundle should be achieved within the first 3 hours of 'presentation', defined as either arrival in the emergency department or the time of the first chart documentation consistent with the patient meeting criteria for sepsis or septic shock(box 2). Time to completion of the 3-hour bundle has been shown to strongly correlate with mortality with an increased OR of 1.04 for each hour of delay.

Box 2
Three-hour and 6-hour sepsis bundles

Within 3 hours of presentation:

Measure lactate
Obtain blood cultures
Bolus 30 mL/kg crystalloid for hypotension of lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L

Within 6 hours of presentation:

If persistent hypotension (mean arterial pressure ≤ 65 mm Hg) despite adequate volume resuscitation, consider addition of vasopressors
Frequently re-assess volume status and tissue perfusion for those with persistent hypotension and/or initial lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L
Normalization of lactate

The 2016 guideline update continues to emphasize initial resuscitation with a 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus within the first 3 hours of presentation. After this initial bolus, resuscitation should be guided by either a 'repeat focused exam after initial fluid resuscitation including vital signs, cardiopulmonary, capillary refill, pulse, and skin findings'or two of the following: CVP, superior vena cava oxygenation saturation (ScvO2), bedside ultrasound or dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness. The focused examination includes reassessment of physiological parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation and urine output. The dynamic assessment includes response to straight leg raise, stroke volume variation and pulse pressure variation.

### Variability in management of early severe sepsis [^115wUTWS]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

A study was undertaken to characterise how doctors in emergency medicine (EM), acute medicine (AM) and critical care (ICU) in the UK, USA and Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) approach the initial resuscitative care of patients with severe sepsis.

Methods

In 2007, members on the mailing lists of UK, US and ANZ EM, ICU and AM specialist organisations were invited to answer an anonymous scenario-based online survey. Respondents described their management of a patient with pneumonia and signs of sepsis. Multiple-choice questions were based on the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 6-hour resuscitation bundle guidelines while avoiding the specific terms "sepsis" and "SSC guidelines".

Results

The response rate was 21% (2461/11 795). Only two respondents (0.1%) complied with all SSC resuscitation recommendations. Inter-specialty and inter-country variations included differences in reporting initial lactate measurement (ranging from 30% in US-EM to 79% in UK-EM), fluid resuscitation targeting a central venous pressure of 8–12 mm Hg (from 15% in ANZ-ICU to 60% in UK-EM), blood transfusion for a central venous oxygen saturation < 70% and haematocrit < 30% (from 15% in ANZ-ICU to 70% in US-EM and UK-EM) and insertion of invasive monitoring (intra-arterial catheter: 89% in UK-ICU vs 20% in US-EM; central venous catheter: 83% in UK-ICU vs 44% in US-EM). 81% of respondents identified at least one reason why they did not implement all the recommendations; the reasons varied by region and specialty.

Conclusions

Reported management of early sepsis varies between specialities and countries, and the responses do not follow SSC guidelines. Concerns relate to knowledge, attitudes and resources.

### Sepsis for the anaesthetist [^114qHWkQ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Sepsis is as a dysregulated systemic response to infection. Morbidity and mortality of the syndrome are very high worldwide. Recent definitions have redefined criteria for sepsis. The new definition (Sepsis-3) classifies sepsis as infection with organ dysfunction (the old 'severe sepsis'). Septic patients are at risk for secondary injuries, thus aggressive source control, resuscitation, and antibiotic therapy are the mainstays of management. Central to sepsis physiology is vasodilated shock. Many patients respond to i.v. fluid therapy. Pathophysiology also includes energy failure, or a cellular inability to oxidize fuel, and immune incompetence, often manifest by susceptibility to superinfections. Sepsis treatment is optimized by timely resuscitation and control of infection. Early recognition and resuscitation are associated with improved outcomes, although no single resuscitation end point is as good as overall patient assessment. Dynamic resuscitation metrics might be useful to avoid overinfusion of fluid therapies. Antibiotics should treat likely pathogens, with broader coverage for sicker patients (e.g. those with septic shock). Avoidance of iatrogenic injury, such as ventilator-induced lung injury from large tidal volumes, helps to prevent subsequent tissue damage and worsened systemic response. Single-agent therapies to block the systemic response have not fulfilled promise in sepsis, probably because part of the complex syndrome is adaptive. However, early aggressive care based on bundles is associated with improved outcomes. Research opportunities include understanding the role of neurological, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathophysiology in the syndrome.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^114bwYBf]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Surviving Sepsis Guidelines provide a suitable framework to guide therapy for the majority of patients with septic shock. Appropriate and timely antimicrobial therapy, source control if indicated, fluid therapy, and targeted vasopressors remain the backbone of treatment. However, a small proportion of patients fail to respond to these measures and deteriorate precipitously into refractory shock and progressive multi-organ failure. This subgroup of patients is often poorly represented in large randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of interventions in septic shock. As a result, there is little conclusive evidence to guide management in this particular population.

Refractory septic shock is variably defined as the presence of hypotension, with end-organ dysfunction, requiring high-dose vasopressor support often greater than 0.5 μg/kg/min norepinephrine or equivalent. Regardless of the precise definition, there is an associated mortality of up to 60%. Furthermore, patients with vasopressor requirements greater than 1 μg/kg/min norepinephrine or equivalent who continue to deteriorate clinically have a reported mortality as high as 80–90%. Microcirculatory failure and associated ischaemic consequences are frequently observed and alternative therapeutic strategies are desperately needed to improve outcomes in this small subgroup of critically ill patients.

In this viewpoint article we describe a pragmatic, multi-faceted approach to managing patients with refractory septic shock. The list of interventions described below is drawn from our clinical experience managing patients with confirmed, or suspected, toxin-producing bacteria in a specialist Severe Respiratory Failure centre in the UK. It is recognised that some of these interventions lack a robust evidence base. Our intention is not to rehearse the current evidence for each component of therapy, but merely to describe our institutional approach with brief reference to selected relevant literature.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^1173ABH8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis early care — fluid volume and concurrent titration of vasopressors — For the past 2 decades, large mean volumes of intravenous fluid (eg, more than 3,000 to 5,000 mL) have been common in the care of ED patients with sepsis. Many trials have used body mass–based intravenous fluid dosing (20 or 30 mL/kg) to guide initial fluid resuscitation, but practical issues limit feasibility, including unit doses of 500 mL and 1,000 mL, which make for natural break‑points to assess for clinical response. We do not believe data that support a singular body mass–based volume for all or most patients, although we recognize that many will receive and respond to certain targets like 30 mL/kg. Administration of an initial volume of 500 to 1,000 mL of crystalloid is a common and reasonable practice, as it helps gauge response without establishing an endpoint for fluid therapy and informs need for concomitant vasopressor support.

### Fluid resuscitation in severe sepsis and septic shock: an evidence-based review [^112UoWuf]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for fluid resuscitation in severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591.

Conclusion

Fluid resuscitation of severe sepsis may consist of natural or artificial colloids or crystalloids. Fluid challenge should be administered and repeated based on response (increase in blood pressure and urine output) and tolerance (evidence of intravascular volume overload).

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^11682UAw]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The content of the initial research priorities article was developed by asking each committee member to identify the research questions they believed were most important. Using a modified Delphi approach as outlined in the original article, the Task Force members focused on the original 88 suggestions to a series of 26 questions focused on all domains related to sepsis. These included questions related to clinical management (as in the SSC guidelines) and domains that were outside the scope of the guidelines (basic science, scoring, epidemiology, long-term outcomes, etc.). These top research priorities were presented in the original publication. The 26 questions were grouped by thematic similarity, with the plan to expand each question to a level of detail precluded by space constraints in the original publication. From this list of 26 questions, three committee members with specific expertise in the domain of fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapies were tasked with generating expanded reviews of the three questions on fluid resuscitation and vasopressors generated in the original article for the treatment of septic shock. Consistent with existing definitions of septic shock, the article focuses on the subset of sepsis where underlying cellular and circulatory abnormalities are substantially enough to increase mortality. The final list of questions was broad and comprehensive in an attempt to add to the collective body of knowledge regarding therapeutic benefit in addition to describing mortality. These in-depth reviews were summarized and edited by the group as a whole.

### Are clinical trials dealing with severe infection fitting routine practices? Insights from a large registry [^113Y77ZS]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Since the early 1990s, considerable efforts have been provided to improve treatment and global management of patients suffering from severe infection. In August 1991, the American College of Chest Physicians and the Society of Critical Care Medicine released a landmark Consensus Conference agreeing on definitions to be applied to patients with severe infections. Classifications were provided to assist clinicians and researchers including homogeneous and comparable populations in trials dealing with severe sepsis and septic shock. Following this conference, a number of major studies have been published that substantially modified the management and course of severe sepsis and septic shock patients. For the same period, the mortality of patients with severe infections did not decrease or remained high, suggesting that physicians might be unaware of the scientific advances in the field of severe infection.

Severe sepsis is a major problem in intensive care, accounting for over 10 to 20% of stays of increased duration and with a recent increase in hospitalization. The most severe presentation is septic shock with an individual mortality that has recently slightly decreased but with an overall specific mortality that has increased due to the higher number of patients, in particular older patients.

This observation prompted scientific societies to develop a partnership that intended to provide standards of care for management of severe sepsis and septic shock, based on the highest levels of evidence published scientific knowledge. Key recommendations overviewed management of septic patients, including specific treatments such as antimicrobial therapy, hemodynamic management and use of adjunctive therapies, and supportive care such as sedation, tight glucose control and mechanical ventilation.

Implementation of these guidelines, however, has been offset by a number of barriers. Heterogeneous levels of equipment and resuscitation skills and overburden in ICUs compromise the quality of care delivered to septic patients, especially those requiring a high level of technical support. Besides these organizational limitations, the way these guidelines are applicable or not to routine care patients is also controversial. One can suppose that differences between groups of homogeneous patients included in pivotal trials and real-life patients routinely admitted to the ICU may prevent guideline generalization. Even if non-inclusion criteria are known to explain these differences, their identification and frequency among routine ICU patients is lacking. As a consequence, it is actually difficult to assess the proportion of patients in whom the most current recommended treatments were in fact not tested. To specifically address whether international recommendations to treat septic patients fit routine ICU patients or not, we first checked for non-inclusion criteria in published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) dealing with severe sepsis and septic shock since 1992. In a second step, we investigated the frequency of these non-inclusion criteria in a large ICU population by using a multicenter ICU registry.

### Additional therapies… [^111AXjoS]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

- After initial resuscitation with 30 mL per kg of crystalloid fluids, further fluid resuscitation should be based on intravascular volume status and organ perfusion from dynamic measures.
- Empiric antibiotics should be started within one hour in septic shock and within three hours without shock. Empiric coverage for MRSA, gram-negative resistance, or fungal infection is recommended if these pathogens are considered likely. Balanced crystalloids such as lactated ringers are recommended over normal saline because of weak evidence of decreased mortality. Albumin has no clear benefits over balanced crystalloids and is more expensive. After infusing large volumes of crystalloid fluids, albumin can be considered to improve blood pressure. Hydroxyethyl starch solutions should be avoided because of increased mortality, and synthetic colloid gelatin should not be used because of lack of evidence.

Because methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus accounts for one in 20 infections in critically ill patients, empiric antimicrobial therapy should cover for MRSA in patients at high risk because delays can increase mortality. Although empiric combination antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria do not improve overall mortality, combination antibiotics are recommended for patients at high risk for multidrug-resistant organisms. Similarly, empiric antifungal agents do not improve short-term mortality in critically ill patients but are recommended for patients at high risk for invasive fungal infections. When beta-lactam antibiotics are used, prolonged intravenous infusions after an initial bolus improve antibiotic concentrations over intermittent boluses and reduce short-term mortality. Source Control Controlling the source of infection, including abscess drainage, necrotic tissue debridement, and removing potentially infective devices, is key in management of sepsis.

Source control improves survival and is recommended after initial resuscitation. Ventilation INITIAL VENTILATORY SUPPORT In sepsis-induced hypoxic respiratory failure, high-flow nasal oxygen is recommended over noninvasive ventilation because of improved 90-day survival and lower intubation rates. Compared with conventional oxygen, high-flow nasal oxygen reduces intubations but not mortality. TRANSFUSION Because a restrictive transfusion threshold leads to similar mortality as higher thresholds, restrictive transfusions are recommended. STRESS ULCER PROPHYLAXIS A proton pump inhibitor for patients with risk factors reduces gastrointestinal hemorrhage without affecting mortality, risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis, or risk of pneumonia.

### About sepsis… [^115JM9Ce]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Signs and symptoms A person with sepsis might have one or more of the following signs or symptoms:

- Clammy or sweaty skin
- Confusion or disorientation
- Extreme pain or discomfort
- Fever, shivering or feeling very cold
- High heart rate or weak pulse
- Shortness of breath. At-risk populations Anyone can develop sepsis, but some people are at higher risk for sepsis. Keep ReadingPeople at Increased Risk for Sepsis Causes Infections put you and your family at risk for sepsis. When germs get into a person's body, they can cause an infection. If that infection doesn't stop, it can cause sepsis. Bacterial infections cause most cases of sepsis. Sepsis can also be a result of other infections, including viral infections, such as influenza. Fungal infections can also cause sepsis.

Treatment Research shows that rapid, effective sepsis treatment includes:

- Giving appropriate treatment, including antibiotics, as soon as possible
- Maintaining blood flow to organs Sometimes surgery is required to remove tissue damaged by the infection. Healthcare providers should treat sepsis as soon as possible. What to know about antibiotics Antimicrobial resistance Antibiotics are critical tools for treating infections, including those that can lead to sepsis. However, anytime antibiotics are used, they can cause side effects and contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance Antimicrobial resistance happens when germs, like bacteria and fungi, develop the ability to defeat the drugs designed to kill them. Infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant germs can be difficult, or impossible to treat.

Side effects Antibiotic side effects range from minor, such as rash, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea and yeast infections, to very severe health problems, such as life-threatening allergic reactions or C. difficile infection, which causes diarrhea that can lead to colon damage or death. However, when antibiotics are needed, the benefits outweigh the risks of side effects or antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotic stewardship Antibiotic stewardship is the effort to improve antibiotic use so that antibiotics are prescribed and used when they provide a clear benefit. Improving the way healthcare providers prescribe antibiotics and the way we take antibiotics helps keep us healthy, fights antimicrobial resistance, and ensures that these life-saving drugs will work when they are needed most, such as for treating infections that can lead to sepsis.

### Fluid therapy for critically ill adults with sepsis: a review… [^112HKtz6]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance Approximately 20% to 30% of patients admitted to an intensive care unit have sepsis. While fluid therapy typically begins in the emergency department, intravenous fluids in the intensive care unit are an essential component of therapy for sepsis. Observations. For patients with sepsis, intravenous fluid can increase cardiac output and blood pressure, maintain or increase intravascular fluid volume, and deliver medications. Fluid therapy can be conceptualized as 4 overlapping phases from early illness through resolution of sepsis: resuscitation; optimization; stabilization; and evacuation.

Among 3723 patients with sepsis who received 1 to 2 L of fluid, 3 randomized clinical trials reported that goal-directed therapy administering fluid boluses to attain a central venous pressure of 8 to 12 mm Hg, vasopressors to attain a mean arterial blood pressure of 65 to 90 mm Hg, and red blood cell transfusions or inotropes to attain a central venous oxygen saturation of at least 70% did not decrease mortality compared with unstructured clinical care. An RCT of 1000 patients with acute respiratory distress during the evacuation phase reported that limiting fluid administration and administering diuretics improved the number of days alive without mechanical ventilation compared with fluid treatment to attain higher intracardiac pressure, and it reported that hydroxyethyl starch significantly increased the incidence of kidney replacement therapy compared with saline, Ringer lactate, or Ringer acetate. Conclusions and Relevance Fluids are an important component of treating patients who are critically ill with sepsis. Although optimal fluid management in patients with sepsis remains uncertain, clinicians should consider the risks and benefits of fluid administration in each phase of critical illness, avoid use of hydroxyethyl starch, and facilitate fluid removal for patients recovering from acute respiratory distress syndrome.

### Sepsis: diagnosis and management… [^115zwJZn]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

After initial airway and respiratory stabilization, patients with sepsis should complete the sepsis bundle within three hours of presentation. 24–27 Vasopressor therapy is initiated if the patient is hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation. 21, 28, 29 Infection source control with early surgical consultation should be obtained for suspected infections requiring operative or other interventional treatment. Treatment FLUID RESUSCITATION The priorities in early sepsis management are establishing vascular access and initiating fluid resuscitation. Patients with sepsis should receive an intravenous crystalloid at 30 mL per kg within the first three hours. 21 Infusing an initial 1-L bolus over the first 30 minutes is an accepted approach. The remainder of fluid resuscitation should be given by repeat bolus infusions.

43 Infusion of intravenous fluids in this manner enhances preload and cardiac output, thereby improving oxygen delivery. However, the hemodynamic effects of fluid boluses in sepsis last only 60 minutes.
44. Several individual trials showed no difference in 28-day mortality benefit between resuscitation using a colloid and a crystalloid; however, a subsequent meta-analysis suggested a marginal mortality benefit with the use of albumin. 26, 45–47 Despite these findings, crystalloids are recommended for fluid resuscitation because of availability and lower cost. 48 Regardless of the fluid used, frequent reassessment of fluid balance beyond initial resuscitation is recommended to avoid under- or overhydration. Dynamic blood pressure response, tissue perfusion, and most importantly urine output can be used to help avoid volume overload, particularly in patients with chronic renal disease, heart failure, or acute lung injury. 49 Fluid administration should be restricted in the latter phases of sepsis management. At 72 hours, the net fluid balance goal should be close to zero or slightly negative. Each 1-L increase in net positive balance at 72 hours is associated with increased risk of death.
