## Question

2. An interval containing a zero of the function f(x) = eˣ + 2x − 3 is:
(A) (−1, 0)
(B) (0, [1/2])
(C) ([1/2], 1)
(D) (1, [3/2])

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which interval contains a zero of the function f(x) = eˣ + 2x − 3. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the Intermediate Value Theorem and whether the function changes sign over each candidate interval. Then, I should verify the function's monotonicity to ensure there is only one zero. Next, I will evaluate f(x) at the endpoints of each interval to check for a sign change. Finally, I will confirm the correct choice and briefly consider numerical estimation if needed.

> Let me first confirm the strategy: the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees a zero in an interval if f is continuous and f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs. Since eˣ and 2x − 3 are continuous everywhere, f(x) is continuous on ℝ, so sign-change intervals will contain a zero [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify monotonicity before I jump to conclusions about uniqueness. The derivative f′(x) = eˣ + 2 is always positive because eˣ > 0 for all x, so f is strictly increasing everywhere, which means it can cross the x-axis at most once. Therefore, if I find a sign change, that interval contains the unique zero [^notfound].

> I will now examine each option systematically. For (A) (−1, 0): f(−1) = e^(−1) − 2 − 3 ≈ 0.3679 − 5 = −4.632, and f(0) = 1 + 0 − 3 = −2. Both are negative, so no sign change here, which means no zero in (−1, 0) [^notfound].

> Next, for (B) (0, 1/2): f(0) = −2 as above, and f(1/2) = e^(1/2) + 1 − 3 ≈ 1.6487 + 1 − 3 = −0.3513. Still both negative, so no sign change and no zero in this interval either [^notfound].

> Now, for (C) (1/2, 1): f(1/2) ≈ −0.3513, and f(1) = e + 2 − 3 ≈ 2.718 + 2 − 3 = 1.718. Here we have a negative value at the left endpoint and a positive value at the right endpoint, so by the Intermediate Value Theorem there must be a zero in (1/2, 1) [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify (D) (1, 3/2) to ensure I'm not missing anything. f(1) ≈ 1.718 is positive, and f(3/2) = e^(3/2) + 3 − 3 ≈ 4.4817, which is also positive, so no sign change and therefore no zero in this interval [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the numerical estimates to avoid a mistake. I initially thought f(1/2) might be closer to zero, but wait, e^(1/2) is about 1.6487, so f(1/2) ≈ 1.6487 + 1 − 3 = −0.3513, which confirms the sign change between 1/2 and 1, reinforcing that the zero lies in (1/2, 1) [^notfound].

> Conclusion: The interval that contains a zero of f(x) = eˣ + 2x − 3 is (1/2, 1), which corresponds to option C [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **(C) (1/2, 1)**. This is because f(x) = eˣ + 2x − 3 is continuous and strictly increasing, and f(1/2) ≈ −0.351 < 0 while f(1) ≈ 1.718 > 0, so by the Intermediate Value Theorem there is exactly one zero in (1/2, 1). The other intervals do not contain a sign change, so they cannot contain a zero.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Step 1: analyze the function properties

- **Continuity**: f(x) = eˣ + 2x − 3 is continuous everywhere because eˣ and 2x − 3 are continuous.
- **Monotonicity**: f'(x) = eˣ + 2 > 0 for all x, so f is strictly increasing, meaning it can have at most one zero.

---

### Step 2: evaluate the function at key points

| **X** | **F(x) = eˣ + 2x − 3** | **Sign** |
|-|-|-|
| 0 | e⁰ + 0 − 3 = 1 − 3 = −2 | Negative |
| 1/2 | e^(1/2) + 1 − 3 ≈ 1.6487 + 1 − 3 = −0.3513 | Negative |
| 1 | e¹ + 2 − 3 ≈ 2.718 + 2 − 3 = 1.718 | Positive |

---

### Step 3: apply the intermediate value theorem

Since f is continuous and strictly increasing, and f(1/2) < 0 while f(1) > 0, there is **exactly one zero in (1/2, 1)**.

---

### Step 4: eliminate incorrect options

- **Option A (−1, 0)**: f(−1) ≈ −2.632 and f(0) = −2; both negative → no zero.
- **Option B (0, 1/2)**: f(0) = −2 and f(1/2) ≈ −0.351; both negative → no zero.
- **Option D (1, 3/2)**: f(1) ≈ 1.718 and f(3/2) ≈ 4.482; both positive → no zero.

---

## Conclusion

The interval containing a zero of f(x) = eˣ + 2x − 3 is **(C) (1/2, 1)**.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^645f5f33]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The traditional model of clinical practice incorporates diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Diagnosis classifies the sick patient as having or not having a particular disease. Historically, diagnosis was regarded as the primary guide to treatment and prognosis ("what is likely to happen in the future"), and is still considered the core component of clinical practice.

This traditional model now has to meet the demand for health care to deliver demonstrable quality. Changes in clinical practice must be justified by better outcomes, as valued by patients, or more efficient and safer delivery of health care. The usefulness of diagnostic and treatment decisions, and the value of new tests and interventions, are judged by whether patients classified with diagnosed disease do better and those classified without disease come to no harm.

This requires information about patient prognosis – the likelihood of future outcomes in patients with a given disease or health condition. Prognosis research aims to understand the likelihood of different outcomes, which factors predict these likelihoods, how best to estimate an individual's likelihood of different outcomes, and how this information can be used to target interventions and improve outcomes.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^4bdaf436]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis is the traditional basis for decision-making in clinical practice. Evidence is often lacking about future benefits and harms of these decisions for patients diagnosed with and without disease. We propose that a model of clinical practice focused on patient prognosis and predicting the likelihood of future outcomes may be more useful.

Discussion

Disease diagnosis can provide crucial information for clinical decisions that influence outcome in serious acute illness. However, the central role of diagnosis in clinical practice is challenged by evidence that it does not always benefit patients and that factors other than disease are important in determining patient outcome. The concept of disease as a dichotomous 'yes' or 'no' is challenged by the frequent use of diagnostic indicators with continuous distributions, such as blood sugar, which are better understood as contributing information about the probability of a patient's future outcome. Moreover, many illnesses, such as chronic fatigue, cannot usefully be labelled from a disease-diagnosis perspective. In such cases, a prognostic model provides an alternative framework for clinical practice that extends beyond disease and diagnosis and incorporates a wide range of information to predict future patient outcomes and to guide decisions to improve them. Such information embraces non-disease factors and genetic and other biomarkers which influence outcome.

Summary

Patient prognosis can provide the framework for modern clinical practice to integrate information from the expanding biological, social, and clinical database for more effective and efficient care.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^e7f24845]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

We propose that prognosis can now provide the framework in which clinicians and researchers organise evidence and information to support decisions about management. This extends calls for a risk-centred approach to many syndromes and chronic conditions and parallels proposals that public health should be organised around achievable outcomes rather than disease categories. Such a framework shifts the focus of clinical practice to improving outcomes for patients in their total biological, psychological, and social environment and away from an exclusive and narrow focus on underlying disease as the determinant of outcome.

Although biomedical diagnosis is often a crucial driver of treatment selection, especially in acute life-threatening illness such as infection and trauma, diagnostic labelling and subgrouping for many ill people is about providing prognostic information to support decisions about targeted individual long-term care. A broader prognostic framework could integrate such information with evidence about other pathophysiological, psychological, behavioural, and environmental factors that affect patient outcomes, to avoid overdiagnosis and support doctors and their patients in probability-based decision-making in clinical practice.

Prognosis is not a panacea for all the problems we have discussed in relation to diagnosis, and there must be continuing debate about the benefits, value, limits, harms, and costs of medicalization and medical care. However, because prognostic classification incorporates a much wider range of information than diagnosis and disease factors alone, and because such information is expanding rapidly in volume and availability, prognosis can provide a realistic, practical, and useful framework for clinical and public health practice.

Management of patients traditionally starts with establishing a diagnosis, a process that relies heavily on how diseases are defined. But definitions of disease vary with time and are influenced by, amongst other things, culture, politics, sociology and economics. The ninth annual Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin symposium, 'Defining disease: determining practice', explored the ways disease is defined and how this might affect practice. Here, we summarise the key points raised in the presentations and subsequent discussion.

Concerns about overdiagnosis are often generated by screening programmes which diagnose early or latent disease in healthy people. There is debate, for example, about how much breast cancer screening programmes reduce premature mortality, and to what extent the nature and rate of adverse consequences are acceptable, i.e. how population prognosis changes as a result of a screening programme. Overdiagnosis of lesions that do not confer poor prognosis or affect future outcomes is an important adverse consequence of breast cancer screening because of the implications of unnecessary anxiety, investigation, and treatment in patients with such lesions.

Patient prognosis is determined by more than disease diagnosis

The traditional model of clinical practice assumes that prognosis is inferred only after the diagnosis has been made – presence or absence of disease determines prognosis. However, in the absence of effective treatment, clinicians have always understood that prognosis can be highly variable in persons with a particular diagnosis.

Example: A physician, working during a typhoid outbreak in the UK in the 1930's, provided care for the many who recovered and the few who did not. He wrote "A patient with typhoid fever usually inclines to recovery: it is a natural proclivity in one with the disease". Diagnosis characterised the sick group but was less important to the people involved than knowledge that most were likely to get better.

The science of prognosis is concerned with improving the precision, accuracy, and usefulness of measures of likely future outcomes. Modelling an individual's prognosis can draw on the full range of relevant and available information, both clinical and non-clinical. In the diagnostic model, this may appear as an interaction of disease with non-disease factors in determining outcome such as the influence of psychological health on surgical outcomes. Prognosis offers an alternative starting point with wider incorporation of factors relevant to patient outcomes than diagnosis alone.

Importantly, patient prognosis is influenced by more than disease diagnosis and diagnosis-driven treatment. Among women with advanced breast cancer, for example, treatment responsiveness and toxicity as well as survival are informed by their physical wellbeing and appetite prior to the start of treatment. The multiplicity of biological, clinical, and social factors that inform the likelihood of an individual's future outcome challenges the idea that prognosis and treatment selection are exclusively determined by diagnosis. Guidelines on statin use, for example, have shifted from "treat hypercholesterolaemia" to "treat the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes", emphasising the continuous and multifactorial nature of risk for adverse outcomes that might be lowered by intervention.

In this paper, we consider the case for prognosis to replace diagnosis as the framework for clinical decision-making. For some patients, especially those with acute illness or injury, a prognosis-based model will be dominated by diagnostic disease-based information. For many others, notably patients with long-term ill-health, healthy people classified as having a risk-based condition, and persons in screening programmes, a model framed by prognosis would integrate diagnostic and treatment information with other data relevant to future health, and place evidence about the probability of future outcomes, and how to improve those outcomes, at the forefront of clinical thinking and decision-making. Such a model has the potential to reduce or avoid overdiagnosis and to promote incorporation of quantitative estimates of future outcomes into shared decision-making with patients in clinical practice. We also discuss potential downsides and limitations of a shift to prognosis-based clinical practice.

### Diagnosis: making the best use of medical data [^aa53c8a5]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

To take the best possible care of patients, physicians must understand the basic principles of diagnostic test interpretation. Pretest probability is an important factor in interpreting test results. Some tests are useful for ruling in disease when positive or ruling out disease when negative, but not necessarily both. Many tests are of little value for diagnosing disease, and tests should be ordered only when the results are likely to lead to improved patient-oriented outcomes.

Prognosis provides a natural framework for modern clinical practice

Disease diagnosis is a crucial component of modern medicine but fails to provide a sufficient framework for a modern clinical practice which must incorporate variability in individual patient risk of different outcomes, influences on patient outcome which extend beyond disease, and avoidance of harm; prognosis provides such a framework. Clinicians often think in terms of prognosis, especially the primary care physician who may start by judging if the patient is going to get better or not. Decisions about individual patients in primary care are informed by available evidence about likely future outcomes, and a clinician's own judgement on likely outcome has prognostic value and helps to guide decision-making. Shared exploration and understanding between clinician and patient of which outcomes are wanted or needed, achieved through patients being able to voice their own priorities and goals for care and treatment in the consultation, supports a prognostic framework for the clinical encounter, particularly for the patient with long-term conditions and multimorbidity.

Example: Evidence that clinicians and patients can integrate disease-based explanation within a broader framework of prognosis is provided by back pain. Primary care practitioners undertake initial triage in a diagnostic framework to identify rare underlying conditions which have a poor immediate prognosis unless treated (e.g. cord compression from a tumour). Once these are excluded, the task diverts from diagnosis and considers the clinical problem as the risk of poor long-term outcomes (work loss, persistent pain). Activity limitation, psychological distress, and capacity to cope are used to classify people into prognostic categories that drive treatment decisions. The many at low risk of a poor outcome are managed without referral or investigation, whereas more intense care is targeted at those with poorer prognosis. This exemplifies the principle of 'stratified care'. Use of this prognostic approach to select back pain patients for different treatment programmes was effective and cost effective in a randomised controlled trial.

Such personalised medicine is likely to herald preferential expansion of prognostic modelling of individual risk for future health outcomes over new diagnostic tests of current disease status. However, research to inform and justify a prognostic model of clinical practice is crucial, including the important uncertainties about the application of this model represented by clinical, patient, and public understanding of risk and probability.

### Uncertainty-aware large language models for explainable disease diagnosis [^4eade48e]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Definition formulation

Evidence-based diagnosis refers to a diagnosis made by adhering to established diagnostic criteria, utilizing a patient's clinical information as the basis for decision-making. A confident diagnosis builds on an evidence-based diagnosis, signifying a high degree of certainty in the diagnostic decision. Diagnostic uncertainty arises when diagnostic criteria are unmet due to insufficient evidence, such as the absence of definitive symptoms, ambiguous clinical signs, or inconclusive laboratory findings. Uncertainty-aware disease diagnosis involves developing predictive models that leverage clinical information to determine both the most likely diagnosis and the occurrence of diagnostic uncertainty, distinguishing between confident diagnoses (supported by sufficient evidence) and those characterized by insufficient evidence, while providing detailed explanations.

Not "have you got it or not?" but "how much have you got?"

Clinical decisions are often dichotomous (does this person have something serious or not? should this patient be allowed to drive or not?). Diagnosis as "either you have it or you don't" (is it a heart attack or not?) aligns with such yes/no decisions, but the diagnostic process itself is often more probabilistic and uncertain – a series of decisions, guided at each stage by the changed probability of a diagnosis being present or not and designed to gradually reduce uncertainty. However, this process still assumes there is an underlying dichotomous disease state (yes or no); this assumption may be flawed.

The underlying 'disease' is often a continuous distribution of probability for future health states. Diagnosis is then not "have you got it?" but "how much of it have you got?" Gale, for example, has argued that there is no single pathology underlying diabetes, and that its identification and diagnosis subsumes much heterogeneity, given blood glucose is a continuously distributed variable. Vickers et al. highlight that many such risk variables are artificially dichotomised and treated as disease states rather than as sources of information about probability of future events, which provide a quantitative estimate of individual risk for particular outcomes.

Example: Although a person with multiple diseases will benefit from optimal care for each separate condition by disease-based specialists, the multimorbidity state itself contributes to poor prognosis, for example a higher probability of unplanned hospitalisation, and outcomes are improved if there is additional integrated care from generalists. However, much multimorbidity concerns risk-based measures (blood sugar, kidney function, blood pressure), which are more usefully considered as continuous variables rather than disease states. In constructing prognostic models to support decision-making for people with multimorbidity, such biological measures can be integrated with subjective measures, such as mood state, pain severity, and mobility limitation, to create quantitative estimates of prognosis to inform care for people with multiple long-term conditions.

Traditional disease-based classification systems are being challenged by the quest for new ways to classify persons with multimorbidity and to incorporate new information about health, such as genomics, into such systems. This new information is undermining the idea that medicine only starts when there is a diagnostic label. Biomedical diagnoses have also traditionally encouraged isolated disease-based measures of outcome, such as normal blood glucose, to assess the success of health care. The acceptance that patient-focused measures, such as improved or maintained social participation, are realistic and desirable outcomes of health care for patients with long-term conditions is subverting the idea that good prognosis is only judged by disease cure.

### Disease, diagnosis or syndrome? [^c8580415]. Practical Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The advance of medical semantics is, in general, towards causation. As knowledge increases, the common consequence is the re-definition of disease. This starts with symptoms then a disorder of structure or function, abnormalities of images, genetics or biochemistry, the ultimate aim being a specific aetiological mechanism which replaces broader descriptions. But medical terminology of diseases, diagnoses and syndromes is inherently imprecise. Careless nomenclature causes confused dialogue and communication. Symptoms of uncertain cause are commonly lumped together and given a new 'diagnostic' label which also may confuse and produce false concepts that stultify further thought and research. Such medicalisation of non-specific aggregations of symptoms should be avoided. The defining characteristics of diseases and diagnoses should be validated and agreed. The pragmatic diagnoses of 'symptom of unknown cause' or 'non-disease' are preferable to falsely labelling patients with obscure or non-existent diseases. "I tried to unveil the stillness of existence through a counteracting murmur of words, and, above all, I confused things with their names: that is belief". Jean-Paul Sartre (The Words, 1964).

### Solving the diagnostic challenge: a patient-centered approach [^df1cd6b6]. Annals of Family Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Arriving at an agreed-on and valid explanation for a clinical problem is important to patients as well as to clinicians. Current theories of how clinicians arrive at diagnoses, such as the threshold approach and the hypothetico-deductive model, do not accurately describe the diagnostic process in general practice. The problem space in general practice is so large and the prior probability of each disease being present is so small that it is not realistic to limit the diagnostic process to testing specific diagnoses on the clinician's list of possibilities. Here, new evidence is discussed about how patients and clinicians collaborate in specific ways, in particular, via a process that can be termed inductive foraging, which may lead to information that triggers a diagnostic routine. Navigating the diagnostic challenge and using patient-centered consulting are not separate tasks but rather synergistic.

### When do symptoms become a disease? [^20e3ac8d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

When do symptoms become a disease? Are there rules or norms, currently or in the past, that tell us when a particular collection of largely symptom-based criteria has enough specificity, utility, or plausibility to justify the appellation disease? The history of numerous symptom-based diagnoses in use today suggests partial answers to these questions. The 19th-century shift to understanding ill health as a result of specific diseases, increasingly defined more by signs than symptoms, led to a loss of status for illnesses that possessed little clinical or laboratory specificity. Nevertheless, clinicians then and now have used symptom-based diagnoses. Some of these diagnoses owe their existence as specific diseases to the norms and practices of an older era much different from our own. Others have not only thrived but have resisted plausible redefinition done by using more "objective" criteria. Many strategies, such as response-to-treatment arguments, quantitative methods (for example, factor analysis), and consensus conferences, have been used to find or confer specificity in symptom-based diagnoses. These strategies are problematic and have generally been used after symptom-based diagnoses have been recognized and defined. These historical observations emphasize that although biological and clinical factors have set boundaries for which symptoms might plausibly be linked in a disease concept, social influences have largely determined which symptom clusters have become diseases.

### Definitions of chronic disease need to be more patient centred [^137883e0]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Effect on patients

Another important consequence of defining an abnormal test or examination result as disease is that patients will lose, and in fact have often already lost, their say in whether they are sick, whether they need a treatment, and whether the treatment is effective. This loss is of no small matter. As a result, their health and rights cannot be adequately protected partly because of the competing interests of other stakeholders in the business of healthcare. Furthermore, interventions cannot make patients truly satisfied if they cannot sense what is wrong with their body and the benefit of interventions on it. Lastly, making small abnormal changes a disease may also increase overdiagnoses, cause health inequity, and compromise care quality and safety. Even the best evidence based policies will fail if clinicians do not have sufficient time to follow them, not to say the unsubstantiated recommendations, as clinicians have already been overloaded.

It is now evident that disease is not a black and white entity and ever earlier or smaller forms always exist. Undoubtedly, health technology will continue to advance so that in the future we can see even smaller changes in the body. Early detection and treatment are certainly beneficial for many diseases. The question is whether we should make a small abnormality a disease for which early diagnosis has little or no benefit and how much further we should go in this direction. Given the widely existent overdiagnosis and ever increasing health expenditure, we argue, for the purpose of patient care that is medicine's fundamental goal, we should rethink the way we define chronic diseases and make early, small abnormal changes a disease only if there are effective interventions that can make a clinical difference that is worthwhile to patients. To this end, the interventions' absolute benefit and cost effectiveness in the newly labelled patients should be highly emphasised and carefully evaluated before changing a diagnostic cut-off point or modifying a disease definition.

### Comorbid chronic diseases and cancer diagnosis: disease-specific effects and underlying mechanisms [^ac7d3bc1]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

An earlier diagnosis is a key strategy for improving the outcomes of patients with cancer. However, achieving this goal can be challenging, particularly for the growing number of people with one or more chronic conditions (comorbidity/multimorbidity) at the time of diagnosis. Pre-existing chronic diseases might affect patient participation in cancer screening, help-seeking for new and/or changing symptoms and clinicians' decision-making on the use of diagnostic investigations. Evidence suggests, for example, that pre-existing pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurological and psychiatric conditions are all associated with a more advanced stage of cancer at diagnosis. By contrast, hypertension and certain gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal conditions might be associated with a more timely diagnosis. In this Review, we propose a comprehensive framework that encompasses the effects of disease-specific, patient-related and health-care-related factors on the diagnosis of cancer in individuals with pre-existing chronic illnesses. Several previously postulated aetiological mechanisms (including alternative explanations, competing demands and surveillance effects) are integrated with newly identified mechanisms, such as false reassurances, or patient concerns about appearing to be a hypochondriac. By considering specific effects of chronic diseases on diagnostic processes and outcomes, tailored early diagnosis initiatives can be developed to improve the outcomes of the large proportion of patients with cancer who have pre-existing chronic conditions.

### COVID-19: staging of a new disease [^1201213b]. Cancer Cell (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), like cancer, is a complex disease with clinical phases of progression. Initially conceptualized as a respiratory disease, COVID-19 is increasingly recognized as a multi-organ and heterogeneous illness. Disease staging is a method for measuring the progression and severity of an illness using objective clinical and molecular criteria. Integral to cancer staging is "metastasis", defined as the spread of a disease-producing agent, including neoplastic cells and pathogens such as certain viruses, from the primary site to distinct anatomic locations. Staging provides valuable frameworks and benchmarks for clinical decision-making in patient management, improved prognostication, and evidence-based treatment selection.

### The challenge of rare diseases [^cf0ed046]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Rare diseases pose particular challenges to patients who are affected, to the clinicians who care for them, and to the investigators who study their conditions. Although individually uncommon, rare diseases are common in the aggregate, with approximately 7,000 described rare diseases affecting 25 to 30 million US adults. Challenges posed to affected individuals and their families largely regard being diagnosed, receiving optimal care, and affording disease-specific medications. Challenges facing clinicians who care for affected individuals include gaining knowledge and experience in caring for such patients, and the availability of local experts and of expert guidelines. Finally, challenges to investigators regard the difficulty and expense of assembling large cohorts of affected individuals for study, and garnering funding for research. Fortunately, in the face of these challenges, the steadfast resolve of patient and clinical/scientific communities to enhance care and generate new knowledge has fostered a large inventory of countermeasures to offset these challenges. Although further progress is surely needed, successes to date include the formation of powerful patient advocacy groups which have brokered collaborations between the patient, scientific communities, the government, and pharma/device communities in service of detection, optimal care, and research; procurement of funds to support research; formation of consortia of clinicians and scientists to collaborate; and general activation of the respective patient communities to perpetuate these successes. Persisting needs include enhanced detection strategies, dissemination of knowledge regarding optimal care, and research to prevent, treat, and cure disease.

### The end of the disease era [^66a79cc5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The time has come to abandon disease as the focus of medical care. The changed spectrum of health, the complex interplay of biological and nonbiological factors, the aging population, and the interindividual variability in health priorities render medical care that is centered on the diagnosis and treatment of individual diseases at best out of date and at worst harmful. A primary focus on disease may inadvertently lead to undertreatment, overtreatment, or mistreatment. The numerous strategies that have evolved to address the limitations of the disease model, although laudable, are offered only to a select subset of persons and often further fragment care. Clinical decision making for all patients should be predicated on the attainment of individual goals and the identification and treatment of all modifiable biological and nonbiological factors, rather than solely on the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of individual diseases. Anticipated arguments against a more integrated and individualized approach range from concerns about medicalization of life problems to "this is nothing new" and "resources would be better spent determining the underlying biological mechanisms". The perception that the disease model is "truth" rather than a previously useful model will be a barrier as well. Notwithstanding these barriers, medical care must evolve to meet the health care needs of patients in the 21st century.

### Definitions of chronic disease need to be more patient centred [^5ef1e7e4]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

The proposal for new diagnostic criteria for hypertension in November 2022 caused heated debate in China. The recommendations, from a guideline group of leading Chinese clinicians, followed changes to the American hypertension guideline in 2017 to reduce the cut-off blood pressure for diagnosing hypertension from 140/90 mm Hg to 130/80 mm Hg. Adoption of this new diagnostic cut-off value for the Chinese population would have created around 350 million new patients with hypertension and increase the total number with the diagnosis by 130%. The new recommendation quickly caused intense nationwide debates, and the National Health Commission finally said no to it.

The controversy over the diagnostic criteria of hypertension, which has also occurred for other non-communicable diseases, raises a fundamental question for medicine: what should count as a chronic disease? Historically, disease was known as sickness or illness, which is defined and diagnosed according to symptoms and signs and is in essence the patient's current experience of their health. In some sense, it is patients who decide what a disease is. This has all been changed since medicine started coupling with modern science and technology.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^e9f68865]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

It can be argued that diagnosis does incorporate variability under the concept of disease severity. The continuous distribution of blood pressure, for example, aligns with severity of the 'disease' (or unhealthy state). The diagnostic paradigm, however, focuses on classification and misclassification of 'hypertension'. The prognostic approach more naturally accommodates the idea of severity by relating increasing levels of blood pressure to contrasting outcomes.

A potential downside of the prognostic approach is whether clinical models in the real world can incorporate the continuous nature and variability of risk of future avoidable outcomes into decision making. Calculation of prognostic likelihoods and treatment responsiveness can combine all relevant information, but validation and translation of prognostic models into practice often relies still on categorisation (high-medium-low risk of a particular outcome) to drive stratified care. Evidence about the clinical usefulness of such new categorisations is essential – prognostic classification for its own sake should not replace diagnosis for its own sake. Nor should individual patient prognosis be a static classification in time – it needs to be updated with recent predictor values, or a profile of values over time, to reflect how clinical practice works in the real world by using new information and repeat consultations to modify treatment.

There are practical challenges to introducing an information-rich prognosis framework for a real-world clinical practice already struggling with volumes of guidelines, decision-aids, and protocols of care. Technological and statistical advances to make calculation and presentation of prognostic information more accessible and research into ways in which health care professionals and patients can better assimilate, use, and share prognostic information could help to meet these challenges.

### How Do we predict a patient's disease course and whether they will respond to specific treatments? [^b607bb4c]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Gastroenterologists will be all too familiar with the difficult decisions that managing inflammatory bowel disease often presents. How aggressively should I treat this patient? Do I expect them to have a mild or aggressive form of disease? Do they need a biologic? If so, which one? And when should I start it? The reality is that the answers that would be right for one patient might be disastrous for another. The growing therapeutic armamentarium will only make these decisions more difficult, and yet, we have seen how other specialties have begun to use the molecular heterogeneity in their diseases to provide some answers. Here, we review the progress that has been made in predicting the future for any given patient with inflammatory bowel disease-whether that is the course of disease that they will experience or whether or not they will respond to, or indeed tolerate, a particular therapy.

### The undiagnosed diseases network: accelerating discovery about health and disease [^f916780f]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis at the edges of our knowledge calls upon clinicians to be data driven, cross-disciplinary, and collaborative in unprecedented ways. Exact disease recognition, an element of the concept of precision in medicine, requires new infrastructure that spans geography, institutional boundaries, and the divide between clinical care and research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund supports the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) as an exemplar of this model of precise diagnosis. Its goals are to forge a strategy to accelerate the diagnosis of rare or previously unrecognized diseases, to improve recommendations for clinical management, and to advance research, especially into disease mechanisms. The network will achieve these objectives by evaluating patients with undiagnosed diseases, fostering a breadth of expert collaborations, determining best practices for translating the strategy into medical centers nationwide, and sharing findings, data, specimens, and approaches with the scientific and medical communities. Building the UDN has already brought insights to human and medical geneticists. The initial focus has been on data sharing, establishing common protocols for institutional review boards and data sharing, creating protocols for referring and evaluating patients, and providing DNA sequencing, metabolomic analysis, and functional studies in model organisms. By extending this precision diagnostic model nationally, we strive to meld clinical and research objectives, improve patient outcomes, and contribute to medical science.

### Classification and diagnosis of patients with medically unexplained symptoms [^82fb0e45]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) have little or no demonstrable disease explanation for the symptoms, and comorbid psychiatric disorders are frequent. Although common, costly, distressed, and often receiving ill-advised testing and treatments, most MUS patients go unrecognized, which precludes effective treatment. To enhance recognition, we present an emerging perspective that envisions a unitary classification for the entire spectrum of MUS where this diagnosis comprises severity, duration, and comorbidity. We then present a specific approach for making the diagnosis at each level of severity. Although our disease-based diagnosis system dictates excluding organic disease to diagnose MUS, much exclusion can occur clinically without recourse to laboratory or consultative evaluation because the majority of patients are mild. Only the less common, "difficult" patients with moderate and severe MUS require investigation to exclude organic diseases. By explicitly diagnosing and labeling all severity levels of MUS, we propose that this diagnostic approach cannot only facilitate effective treatment but also reduce the cost and morbidity from unnecessary interventions.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^e9cb10b1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection.

This review is part of a cluster of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms for diagnosing COVID‐19 disease.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is diagnosed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), which is a test that detects the virus' genetic material, with imaging to identify lung abnormalities and with clinical signs and symptoms.

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate; severe (causing breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease), require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In this review, we will examine the diagnostic value of signs and symptoms for symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which includes mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping, which is a subset of the above:

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^69127a11]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection and immunity.

This review is part of a suite of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

For current infection, the severity of the disease is important. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with severe or critical disease require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between them.

Thus, there are three target conditions for current infection:

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (asymptomatic or symptomatic of any severity);
mild or moderate COVID‐19;
severe or critical COVID‐19.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping (which is a subset of the above):

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

Here we summarise the evidence on signs and symptoms; as a result asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are out of scope for this review.

### Disease-targeted sequencing: a cornerstone in the clinic [^958167a7]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2013). Medium credibility.

With the declining cost of sequencing and the ongoing discovery of disease genes, it is now possible to examine hundreds of genes in a single disease-targeted test. Although exome- and genome-sequencing approaches are beginning to compete, disease-targeted testing retains certain advantages and still holds a firm place in the diagnostic evaluation. Here I examine the current state of clinical disease-targeted sequencing and evaluate the benefits and challenges of incorporating sequencing tests into patient care.

### Prednisone [^b74c31aa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

### Emerging approaches to multiple chronic condition assessment [^0fb1d13f]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Unlike comorbidity measures such as the Charlson index, the MMI is not based on a pre‐determined subset of conditions that are the most significant predictors of mortality. Instead, it considers all diagnoses of the patient, including repeated, similar, and related diagnoses; within these diagnoses it empirically finds the most serious diagnoses. For some patients, if the less severe diagnosis is the only diagnosis, then it is scored and the LR may reduce the probability of mortality. For other patients, less severe diagnoses are ignored when a more serious diagnosis in the same body system exists. The more serious diagnosis has a higher LR and it increases the probability of mortality.

The MMI relies on thousands of diseases within all body systems, and therefore is based on a comprehensive set of diagnoses. The scoring includes rare diseases, which are often ignored by other measures. Rare diseases, however, can radically change the patient's prognosis. In hospitals, patients with one rare disease are 1.80 times and those with two or more rare diseases are 2.78 times more likely to die compared with patients who do not have a rare disease. Rare diseases are almost never part of statistical prognostic indices. One does not need to look at extremely rare diseases. For example, coma is a relatively uncommon condition, that can be fatal. Yet, because coma is uncommon, it is missing in almost all prognostic indices. "Although rare diseases are individually rare by definition, they are collectively common". When thousands of infrequent, but serious, conditions are missing from a prognostic index, the effect may be substantial. MMI can improve accuracy of predictions by including rare but serious diseases in its calculations.

Information from the human genome sequence will eventually alter many aspects of clinical practice. It will increase through our understanding of disease mechanisms, and guide the development of new drugs and therapeutic procedures. In the short term, however, knowledge of the genome will have a profound clinical impact on the diagnostic capability of clinical genetics laboratories. Molecular phenotyping using genetic and genomic information will allow early and more accurate prediction and diagnosis of disease and of disease progression. Medicine will become oriented towards disease prevention rather than efforts to cure people at late stages of illness.

### Time-ordered comorbidity correlations identify patients at risk of mis-and overdiagnosis [^b6b6764d]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Comparison of similarity between temporal disease trajectories and single patient disease histories

We identified patients that do not follow any of the significant COPD trajectories and computed their individual disease history consisting of a temporal sequence of diagnoses in the registry (e.g. disease 1 > disease 2 > disease 3 > disease 4). Each disease was only counted the first time it is diagnosed. To assess the similarity between significant COPD trajectories and the individual disease history of non-followers, we used an adjusted Tanimoto similarity score. Diagnoses from each COPD trajectory were compared with diagnoses in each individual disease history of non-followers and the intersection of diagnoses was divided by the number of diagnoses in the COPD trajectory.

The Tanimoto score was adjusted, as we do not use the union in the denominator but only the number of diagnoses in the COPD trajectory. The union is affected by the amount of diseases present in the disease history of a patient, thus patients with a long disease history and many diagnoses would increase the size of the denominator and thereby decrease the similarity score, just because the patient has had many diagnoses. The similarity was calculated for all possible combinations of COPD trajectories and non-follower patient disease histories. A similarity score of 0 indicates that the patient has not had any of the diagnoses in the COPD trajectory, whereas a similarity score of 1 would indicate that the patient had all three diagnoses in the trajectory. To evaluate the overall similarity of non-followers, we calculated the mean similarity for each of the non-followers to all COPD trajectories.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^4f49022d]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up triage should help decide: i) whether to offer an in-person as opposed to a remote (telephone or virtual/online) consultation, and ii) who to prioritize. Remote follow-up could be considered when the patient or caregiver can understand the process and provide information clearly, when this is a regular COPD follow-up or the patient is followed for a known condition, when medical records and laboratory test results are accessible to the healthcare professionals, and when prescription and access to medication is possible and follow-up to the prescription can be arranged if necessary. In-person follow-up should be prioritized when the patient and caregiver have difficulty providing information, when the patient needs immediate attention due to the presence of severe medical symptoms, when changes in the patient's symptoms require a differential diagnosis work-up with the need for a physical exam and/or laboratory testing, or when patient treatment can only be given in person and cannot be given at home. Prioritization of in-person visits should take into consideration the COPD patient disease severity (symptom burden and risk of exacerbations), recent emergency department visit and/or hospital admission, associated significant comorbidities, age, and/or living alone at home.

### Human symptoms-disease network [^4348fb07]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

In the post-genomic era, the elucidation of the relationship between the molecular origins of diseases and their resulting phenotypes is a crucial task for medical research. Here, we use a large-scale biomedical literature database to construct a symptom-based human disease network and investigate the connection between clinical manifestations of diseases and their underlying molecular interactions. We find that the symptom-based similarity of two diseases correlates strongly with the number of shared genetic associations and the extent to which their associated proteins interact. Moreover, the diversity of the clinical manifestations of a disease can be related to the connectivity patterns of the underlying protein interaction network. The comprehensive, high-quality map of disease-symptom relations can further be used as a resource helping to address important questions in the field of systems medicine, for example, the identification of unexpected associations between diseases, disease etiology research or drug design.

### An official American Thoracic Society workshop report: the integrated care of the COPD patient [^ed93987e]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — problems associated with management — COPD is described as a progressive disease with systemic manifestations and common comorbidities, and optimal management requires a holistic approach with three necessary components: (1) the recognition and treatment of all aspects of the disease, its systemic effects and co-morbidities; (2) the bringing together of all the dimensions of COPD care in a continuum through the lifetime of the patient; and (3) the integration of medical care among healthcare professionals and across healthcare sectors using a patient-centered approach. The comorbidity burden is highlighted: patients with COPD have, on average, 3.7 other chronic medical conditions, compared with 1.8 for patients with other chronic illnesses, and over half of deaths in patients with COPD are from comorbid conditions; the report adds that focusing therapy solely on reversing airway obstruction is suboptimal care and will likely produce suboptimal outcomes.

### Beware of missed diagnosis in patients with multiple genetic diseases: a case report [^8c29a590]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

In general, although there are few cases similar to our reported case, we should still be on guard against the missed diagnoses of such patients. When we find nonspecific pathological changes in patients who have no symptoms, WES may help make a precise diagnosis after excluding other possible diseases. Furthermore, WES can also be used for early diagnosis and risk assessment for diseases like sporadic CCMs with late-onset and lack of obvious clinical symptoms before onset. Appropriate intervention for high-risk patients before bleeding may improve the prognosis of patients.

We should pay attention to avoid misdiagnosis in patients with multiple genetic diseases, especially some patients who lack typical clinical manifestations. Appropriate WES can help us to diagnose and guide therapy.

### When you look matters: the effect of assessment schedule on progression-free survival [^61b4298c]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2007). Low credibility.

Progression-free survival (PFS) is increasingly used as an endpoint for cancer clinical trials. Disease progression is typically assessed on the basis of radiologic testing at scheduled time points or after a fixed number of treatment cycles. The date of the radiologic evaluation at which progression is first evident is used as a proxy for the true progression time. The true progression time actually lies somewhere within the time interval between two assessments, a situation that results in interval-censored data. An analysis that ignores this interval censoring and uses the detection date as the date of progression unavoidably results in an overestimation of median PFS. This overestimation can erroneously result in a result being described as clinically significant when in fact a longer median PFS may just be a consequence of the length of the surveillance interval. Furthermore, if surveillance intervals are heterogenous within a disease group, comparisons of median PFS across studies may not be meaningful. The decision to use PFS as a primary endpoint should be made carefully when designing clinical trials, and investigators focused on a particular disease should develop consensus standards and strive for consistent surveillance intervals.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — outcomes and adverse event definitions prioritize patient-important outcomes including mortality, hospitalization, development of severe disease (e.g., need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation), clinical improvement (disease-oriented outcomes inferred by radiological findings or virologic cure), and severe adverse events leading to discontinuation; serious adverse events are death, life threatening reactions, those that require hospitalization, result in disability or permanent damage or require an intervention to prevent permanent impairment. Critical outcomes varied by population: among hospitalized patients (at any disease severity), critical outcomes included mortality, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, failure of clinical improvement, adverse events, and serious adverse events; among ambulatory populations with COVID-19 infection, hospitalization replaced duration of hospitalization; among persons receiving pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis, outcomes included measures of symptomatic COVID-19 infection.

### Computational evaluation of exome sequence data using human and model organism phenotypes improves diagnostic efficiency [^51dd83b8]. Genetics in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Medical diagnosis and molecular or biochemical confirmation typically rely on the knowledge of the clinician. Although this is very difficult in extremely rare diseases, we hypothesized that the recording of patient phenotypes in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms and computationally ranking putative disease-associated sequence variants improves diagnosis, particularly for patients with atypical clinical profiles.

Methods

Using simulated exomes and the National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) patient cohort and associated exome sequence, we tested our hypothesis using Exomiser. Exomiser ranks candidate variants based on patient phenotype similarity to (i) known disease-gene phenotypes, (ii) model organism phenotypes of candidate orthologs, and (iii) phenotypes of protein-protein association neighbors.

Results

Benchmarking showed Exomiser ranked the causal variant as the top hit in 97% of known disease-gene associations and ranked the correct seeded variant in up to 87% when detectable disease-gene associations were unavailable. Using UDP data, Exomiser ranked the causative variant(s) within the top 10 variants for 11 previously diagnosed variants and achieved a diagnosis for 4 of 23 cases undiagnosed by clinical evaluation.

Conclusion

Structured phenotyping of patients and computational analysis are effective adjuncts for diagnosing patients with genetic disorders. Genet Med 18 6, 608–617.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^0c958057]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction:

- **Definition**: HFpEF is HF in which the LVEF is ≥ 50% at the time of diagnosis and there is objective evidence of elevated left heart filling pressures either at rest or with exertion.
- **Pathophysiology**: Multiple organ systems contribute. Cardiac abnormalities include impaired LV relaxation, increased LV stiffness, subtle reductions in systolic reserve, myocardial fibrosis, coronary microvascular dysfunction, LA enlargement, and changes in pericardial constraint. Pulmonary and right heart changes include postcapillary pulmonary hypertension, small vessel remodeling, and RV dysfunction in many patients. The arterial system commonly shows increased arterial stiffness and impaired microvascular function. Systemic contributors include obesity, insulin resistance, chronic low grade inflammation, reduced skeletal muscle mass and function, kidney dysfunction with impaired sodium handling, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Several proposed biological pathways link comorbid conditions to myocardial and vascular changes, and greater heterogeneity among patients implies that distinct mechanistic subgroups exist.
- **Epidemiology**: About 3 million people in the US and up to 32 million people worldwide have this condition. It represents roughly half of all people diagnosed with HF. Incidence estimates vary by cohort and time period but are generally about 1–4 new cases per 1,000 person-years. Major risk factors include older age, high BP, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. Women are overrepresented among patients diagnosed in many observational series, although adjusted incidence differences by sex are small in some cohort studies.
- **Disease course**: Presentation is heterogeneous. About two thirds of patients present with overt congestion and volume overload, with signs such as peripheral edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary congestion on chest imaging, and resting echocardiographic indicators of high filling pressure. About one third present with exertional dyspnea without clear resting evidence of congestion; many of these patients demonstrate elevated left heart filling pressures only during exercise testing. Common comorbidities that affect presentation and trajectory include AF, chronic lung disease, anemia, obesity, and frailty. Episodes of acute decompensation are common and may be precipitated by uncontrolled BP, rapid AF, infection, anemia, medication nonadherence, or other physiologic stressors.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Clinical outcomes are substantial. Patients with this syndrome are hospitalized about 1.4 times per year on average. Annual mortality in observational cohorts is approximately 15%, with higher mortality in older patients. After a hospitalization for HF, 5-year rehospitalization rates approach 80 percent and five-year mortality ranges from about 50% to 75% in many series. Patients who have abnormal filling pressures only with exercise nonetheless have higher risks of hospitalization or death than people without elevated exercise pressures.

### Pulmonary rehabilitation for adults with chronic respiratory disease: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^b9dd2e70]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Question 1) background — burden, symptoms, and unmet need: Approximately 11.7% of people worldwide have COPD, and in the United States approximately 16 million have diagnosed COPD with likely millions more undiagnosed. Dyspnea and reduced exercise capacity are cardinal features and relate to respiratory structural and functional changes, skeletal muscle dysfunction, deconditioning, cardiocirculatory limitations, and other comorbid conditions. Acute exacerbations further worsen lung function, symptoms, and disability and increase patients' mortality risk, collectively impairing HRQoL. People with COPD typically remain symptomatic despite existing pharmacotherapies; additional treatments are therefore needed to improve patients' outcomes.

### 2019 methodology for creating expert consensus decision pathways: a report of the American college of cardiology [^3c363d65]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Expert Consensus Decision Pathways methodology — purpose and scope are described as complementing Clinical Practice Guidelines by providing "the how", including practical guidance that transforms recommendations into clinically actionable information, clinical guidance to make sense of quickly-evolving evidence, and dissemination of new information not yet incorporated into guidelines. Expert Consensus Decision Pathways are situated within the American College of Cardiology's "actionable knowledge" strategy and are an important component of "solution sets", articulating concise and focused practical guidance around high-value clinical topics. Of note, the goal of an Expert Consensus Decision Pathway is not to provide a single correct answer, but to encourage clinicians to ask certain questions and consider key factors as they come to their own decision on a treatment plan to be recommended and discussed with their patients. Topics have spanned lipid disorders, antithrombotic therapy and bleeding, valvular heart disease, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes, and tobacco cessation, with scope widening to include guidance on management of conduction disturbances for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and same-day discharge after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as well as other topics.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^2e855eb8]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Supportive, palliative, end-of-life & hospice care — palliative care for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is described as encompassing approaches to symptom control and management of terminal patients, with the goal to prevent and relieve suffering and support the best possible quality of life for patients and families regardless of disease stage or other therapies. People with COPD are reported to be less likely to receive palliative services compared to patients with lung cancer. Palliative care expands traditional disease-model treatment to focus on enhancing quality of life, optimizing function, aiding decision-making about end-of-life care, and providing emotional and spiritual support. Palliative approaches are described as essential for end-of-life care, and hospice care is noted for patients predicted to have less than 6 months to live. The text states that palliative care teams are increasingly available for hospitalized patients, while outpatient consultation is less common and has been shown to improve quality of life, reduce symptoms and even prolong survival for patients with advanced lung cancer.

### Estimation in medical imaging without a gold standard [^82dda7fe]. Academic Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

In medical imaging, physicians often estimate a parameter of interest (eg, cardiac ejection fraction) for a patient to assist in establishing a diagnosis. Many different estimation methods may exist, but rarely can one be considered a gold standard. Therefore, evaluation and comparison of different estimation methods are difficult. The purpose of this study was to examine a method of evaluating different estimation methods without use of a gold standard.

Materials and Methods

This method is equivalent to fitting regression lines without the x axis. To use this method, multiple estimates of the clinical parameter of interest for each patient of a given population were needed. The authors assumed the statistical distribution for the true values of the clinical parameter of interest was a member of a given family of parameterized distributions. Furthermore, they assumed a statistical model relating the clinical parameter to the estimates of its value. Using these assumptions and observed data, they estimated the model parameters and the parameters characterizing the distribution of the clinical parameter.

Results

The authors applied the method to simulated cardiac ejection fraction data with varying numbers of patients, numbers of modalities, and levels of noise. They also tested the method on both linear and nonlinear models and characterized the performance of this method compared to that of conventional regression analysis by using x-axis information. Results indicate that the method follows trends similar to that of conventional regression analysis as patients and noise vary, although conventional regression analysis outperforms the method presented because it uses the gold standard which the authors assume is unavailable.

Conclusion

The method accurately estimates model parameters. These estimates can be used to rank the systems for a given estimation task.

### Clinical utility of cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of complex patients with cognitive impairment [^4a74d5de]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Change of diagnosis after CSF biomarkers test

The CSF biomarkers changed the diagnoses of 158 (25.0%) participants (Fig. 3). Diagnoses changed to non-AD or undetermined diagnoses in 43.7% (69/158) participants with an initial diagnosis of AD, including 39 patients (1 patient changed to DLB, 3 patients changed to VCI, 3 patients changed to FTD, 26 patients changed to NND, and 6 patients changed to UND) because of Aβ-negative status and 30 patients (2 patients changed to DLB, 6 patients changed to VCI, 8 patients changed to FTD, 11 patients changed to NND and 3 patients changed to UND) with an A + T- status. CSF biomarkers also changed the diagnoses from non-AD to AD or undetermined diagnoses, or changed the diagnoses within the non-AD subgroup in 17.8% (69/388) patients with an initial diagnosis of non-AD. Among them, 60 patients changed to AD with a biomarker result consistent with AD and 9 patients according to the t-tau status. For patients with an initially undetermined diagnosis, 23.0% (20/87) of them received a certain diagnosis after CSF assessment (15 patients changed to AD with AD continuum and 5 patients changed to CJD with extremely elevated t-tau). The proportion of changed diagnoses showed no significant statistical differences between each two types of CSF profiles (i.e. Alzheimer's continuum, NAP, or normal AD biomarkers).

The CSF AD biomarkers contributed to the change of the diagnoses in the whole sample A and disaggregating by baseline cognitive stage B, C and D. AD Alzheimer's disease, CJD Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, DLB dementia with Lewy Bodies, FTD frontotemporal dementia, MCI mild cognitive impairment, NND non-neurodegenerative diseases, OND other neurodegenerative diseases, SCD subjective cognitive decline, UND undetermined diagnoses, VCI vascular cognitive impairment.

In analyses stratified by cognitive impairment status, etiological diagnoses changed more substantially in the MCI (49/158, 31.0%) and SCD groups (30/103, 29.1%) than in the dementia group (79/372, 21.2%). The difference between the MCI and dementia groups was statistically significant (p = 0.016), while the difference between the SCD and dementia groups was approaching significance (p = 0.09).

### Prednisolone [^dc9ce752]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage of prednisolone oral solution should be individualized according to the severity of the disease and the response of the patient. For infants and children, the recommended dosage should be governed by the same considerations rather than strict adherence to the ratio indicated by age or body weight.

Hormone therapy is an adjunct to and not a replacement for conventional therapy. Dosage should be decreased or discontinued gradually when the drug has been administered for more than a few days.

The severity, prognosis, expected duration of the disease, and the reaction of the patient to medication are primary factors in determining dosage. If a period of spontaneous remission occurs in a chronic condition, treatment should be discontinued.

Blood pressure, body weight, routine laboratory studies, including two-hour postprandial blood glucose and serum potassium, and a chest X-ray should be obtained at regular intervals during prolonged therapy. Upper GI X-rays are desirable in patients with known or suspected peptic ulcer disease.

The initial dosage of prednisolone oral solution may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisolone oral solution should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT.

After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisolone oral solution for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

### Recommendations for a standardized pulmonary function report. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^64462d9d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Lower limit of normal (LLN) and fixed cutoffs — percent predicted values should not be used to define abnormality because the true LLN is age- and/or height-dependent and varies among individuals; fixed cutoffs such as 80% predicted for forced vital capacity (FVC) or 0.70 for the FEV1/FVC ratio are based on middle-aged adults, can yield erroneous decisions in children and in older or shorter adults, and introduce sex bias. The LLN does not necessarily need to be the fifth percentile and can be adjusted with outcome data; caution is warranted near dichotomous boundaries, especially with results from a single occasion. In clinical testing where disease is suspected, the pretest probability is higher and the false positive rate is much lower than the lowest 5% implied by percentile thresholds.

### Recall intervals for oral health in primary care patients [^f6b10540]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The frequency with which patients should attend for a dental check-up and the potential effects on oral health of altering recall intervals between check-ups have been the subject of ongoing international debate for almost 3 decades. Although recommendations regarding optimal recall intervals vary between countries and dental healthcare systems, 6-monthly dental check-ups have traditionally been advocated by general dental practitioners in many developed countries.

Objectives

To determine the beneficial and harmful effects of different fixed recall intervals (for example 6 months versus 12 months) for the following different types of dental check-up: a) clinical examination only; b) clinical examination plus scale and polish; c) clinical examination plus preventive advice; d) clinical examination plus preventive advice plus scale and polish. To determine the relative beneficial and harmful effects between any of these different types of dental check-up at the same fixed recall interval. To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of recall intervals based on clinicians' assessment of patients' disease risk with fixed recall intervals. To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of no recall interval/patient driven attendance (which may be symptomatic) with fixed recall intervals.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Reference lists from relevant articles were scanned and the authors of some papers were contacted to identify further trials and obtain additional information. Date of most recent searches: 5th March 2007.

Selection Criteria

Trials were selected if they met the following criteria: design - random allocation of participants; participants - all children and adults receiving dental check-ups in primary care settings, irrespective of their level of risk for oral disease; interventions - recall intervals for the following different types of dental check-ups: a) clinical examination only; b) clinical examination plus scale and polish; c) clinical examination plus preventive advice; d) clinical examination plus scale and polish plus preventive advice; e) no recall interval/patient driven attendance (which may be symptomatic); f) clinician risk-based recall intervals; outcomes - clinical status outcomes for dental caries (including, but not limited to, mean dmft/DMFT, dmfs/DMFS scores, caries increment, filled teeth (including replacement restorations), early carious lesions arrested or reversed); periodontal disease (including, but not limited to, plaque, calculus, gingivitis, periodontitis, change in probing depth, attachment level); oral mucosa (presence or absence of mucosal lesions, potentially malignant lesions, cancerous lesions, size and stage of cancerous lesions at diagnosis). In addition the following outcomes were considered where reported: patient-centred outcomes, economic cost outcomes, other outcomes such as improvements in oral health knowledge and attitudes, harms, changes in dietary habits and any other oral health-related behavioural change.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information regarding methods, participants, interventions, outcome measures and results were independently extracted, in duplicate, by two review authors. Authors were contacted, where deemed necessary and where possible, for further details regarding study design and for data clarification. A quality assessment of the included trial was carried out. The Cochrane Collaboration's statistical guidelines were followed.

Main Results

Only one study (with 188 participants) was included in this review and was assessed as having a high risk of bias. This study provided limited data for dental caries outcomes (dmfs/DMFS increment) and economic cost outcomes (reported time taken to provide examinations and treatment).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to draw any conclusions regarding the potential beneficial and harmful effects of altering the recall interval between dental check-ups. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the practice of encouraging patients to attend for dental check-ups at 6-monthly intervals. It is important that high quality RCTs are conducted for the outcomes listed in this review in order to address the objectives of this review.

### Treatment of multiple myeloma: ASCO and CCO joint clinical practice guideline [^0978b3ff]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma — response assessment timing and testing frequency are guided by clinical context: Assessment of the response using paraprotein measurements and/or imaging should be evaluated in the context of the clinical picture, and assessment after one to two cycles will allow evaluation to ensure that the disease is not progressing based on the response criteria, in which case a change in therapy will be warranted. If the response after one to two cycles is stable disease but there is evidence of clinical deterioration or lack of improvement, such as worsening end organ damage, a potential change in therapy should be addressed, and evidence of response at the end of the first cycle will be reassuring to the patient and provider. Once there is evidence of sustained disease response, checking the response every other cycle will be adequate and can decrease the testing burden; however, if there is evidence of progression at any time, it should be repeated at the minimum during the next cycle, or sooner if there is evidence of clinical deterioration to confirm the progression. Once the patient is in plateau, the frequency can be altered to less-frequent testing aligned with the frequency of visits required for therapy and other logistical factors, and once there are results showing a trend toward increasing paraprotein, more frequent testing should be resumed, preferably every cycle until the patient meets criteria for progression or treatment is changed.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients: expert review [^4eda3d0d]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients — epidemiology and risks: Inflammatory bowel disease can occur in individuals commonly defined as 60 years and older, with approximately 1 out of every 160 elderly individuals affected and prevalence rising by 5.2% annually; up to 15% of IBD in North America and Asia is diagnosed after the age of 60 years, and incidence rates vary from 4–8 per 100,000 for persons older than 60 years. Observational studies suggest higher risks in the elderly IBD population, including infection with anti–tumor necrosis factor therapy and lymphoma with thiopurines, and surgical management can be associated with high risk due to high comorbidity. Mortality in Crohn's disease is higher in elderly patients, at 33/100,000 person-years compared with middle-age 5.6/100,000 person-years or young 7.1/100,000 person-years, while there is no difference in mortality rates for older vs younger age of onset in ulcerative colitis.

### Type 2 diabetes therapies: a STEPS approach [^fc25c424]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

A concise way to evaluate pharmacotherapy options for type 2 diabetes mellitus is to use the five patient-oriented STEPS criteria: safety, tolerability, efficacy, price, and simplicity. The first-line treatment option, metformin, is safe and fairly well-tolerated, has excellent long-term efficacy for patient-oriented outcomes, is moderately priced, and has a simple dosing regimen. However, most patients with type 2 diabetes require more than one medication. The STEPS approach can help choose subsequent medications if metformin does not provide adequate glycemic control.

Cerebrovascular diseases (I60–I69)

In total, 199,681 patients (3.9%) were diagnosed with cerebrovascular diseases. The distribution of the length of their reduced trajectories is shifted towards higher values compared to the total cohort, with more than 50% of the patients following reduced trajectories of length greater than 2, see Additional file 1: Figure S7. The most frequent reduced trajectory of length 3, followed by 1447 patients, is (0, 114, 123), meaning that patients from the "healthy cluster" 0 (all diseases are exclusion criteria) move to cluster 114 with hypertensive diseases (I10–I15) and heart diseases (I30–I52) to cluster 123 where cerebrovascular diseases (I60–I69) changed from an exclusion (cluster 114) to an inclusion criterion (cluster 123).

Malignant neoplasms (C00–C97)

A total of 312,787 patients (6.1%) received diagnoses of malignant neoplasms. More than 50% of them only visit 2 different clusters, and 44% (69,552) of those patients have the reduced trajectory (0, 55), i.e. from the healthy cluster to a cluster where cancer (C00–C97) is the only inclusion criterion. The most frequent reduced trajectory of length 3, followed by 3093 cancer patients, is (0, 55, 109) where patients acquire hypertensive diseases (I10–I15) after cancer.

Mood (affective) disorders (F30–F39)

A total of 210,589 patients (4.1%) of the study cohort are diagnosed with mood or affective disorders during the observation period. Among them, 9.5% end their trajectory in cluster 71 where, additional to mood disorders, they are diagnosed with mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use (F10–F19). The most common reduced trajectory of length 3 in this subcohort, followed by 1936 patients, is (0, 64, 71). These patients first acquire a diagnosis from the block F10–F19 and subsequently 1 from F30–F39.

AUA medical management of kidney stones guideline — screening evaluation in newly diagnosed kidney or ureteral stones states: A clinician should perform a screening evaluation consisting of a detailed medical and dietary history, serum chemistries and urinalysis on a patient newly diagnosed with kidney or ureteral stones (Clinical Principle). A detailed history should elicit from the patient any medical conditions, dietary habits or medications that predispose to stone disease; nutritional factors associated with stone disease include calcium intake below or significantly above the recommended dietary allowance, low fluid intake, high sodium intake, limited intake of fruits and vegetables and high intake of animal-derived purines; and patients should be queried regarding their regular use of any stone-provoking medications or supplements. Dietary history should elicit from the patient their average daily intake of fluids (amount and specific beverages), protein (types and amounts), calcium, sodium, high oxalate-containing foods, fruits and vegetables and over-the-counter supplements. Serum chemistries should include electrolytes, calcium, creatinine and uric acid that may suggest underlying medical conditions associated with stone disease. Urinalysis should include both dipstick and microscopic evaluation to assess urine pH and indicators of infection and to identify crystals pathognomonic of stone type, and urine culture should be obtained in patients with a urinalysis suggestive of urinary tract infection or in patients with recurrent UTIs.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrous [^8eeeec69]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Use in Patients With Concomitant Illness

Clinical experience with paroxetine in patients with certain concomitant systemic illness is limited. Caution is advisable in using paroxetine in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses.

As with other SSRIs, mydriasis has been infrequently reported in premarketing studies with paroxetine. A few cases of acute angle closure glaucoma associated with paroxetine therapy have been reported in the literature. As mydriasis can cause acute angle closure in patients with narrow angle glaucoma, caution should be used when paroxetine is prescribed for patients with narrow angle glaucoma.

Paroxetine has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarket testing. Evaluation of electrocardiograms of 682 patients who received paroxetine in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, however, did not indicate that paroxetine is associated with the development of significant ECG abnormalities. Similarly, paroxetine does not cause any clinically important changes in heart rate or blood pressure.

Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min.) or severe hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose should be used in such patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of Cardiovascular imaging [^b479f3e7]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Assessment of diastolic function (no LV structural pathology)" for heart failure.

The Assessment of Diastolic Function (no LV structural pathology) is a clinical tool designed for the evaluation of diastolic function in patients without left ventricular (LV) structural pathology. This tool aids in the identification of abnormal diastolic function, which is a key factor in the diagnosis and management of various cardiovascular conditions.

The primary components of this assessment tool are four echocardiographic parameters: septal e' velocity, lateral e' velocity, average E/e' ratio, peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity, and left atrial volume index. Each parameter is assigned a score of 1 if it meets certain criteria: septal e' velocity less than 7 cm/s or lateral e' velocity less than 10 cm/s; average E/e' ratio greater than 14; peak TR velocity greater than 2.8 m/s; and left atrial volume index greater than 34 mL/m².

The total score, which ranges from 0 to 4, is used to determine the patient's diastolic function. A score of 3 or more indicates abnormal diastolic function, a score of 2 is considered indeterminate, and a score less than 2 suggests no diastolic dysfunction. This scoring system provides a structured approach to the assessment of diastolic function, facilitating accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of patients without LV structural pathology.

The assessment of diastolic function is a method that evaluates four critical echocardiographic parameters, which aid in understanding the state of a patient's diastolic function in the absence of left ventricular structural pathology. Here's how this assessment operates:

- It examines whether the patient's septal e' velocity is less than 7 cm/s or the lateral e' velocity falls below 10 cm/s.
- It checks if the average E/e' ratio exceeds 14.
- It assesses if the peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity is greater than 2.8 m/s.
- Lastly, it considers whether the left atrial volume index surpasses 34 mL/m².

For each of these parameters:

- A 'true' response indicates the clinical threshold is met, contributing a score of 1 point to the assessment.
- The total score, therefore, ranges from 0 to 4, depending on the number of criteria met.

The total score results in an interpretation which offers insights into the patient's diastolic function:

- A score of 0 or 1 suggests normal diastolic function, indicating no diastolic dysfunction.
- A score of 2 implies an indeterminate state, where the results are ambiguous regarding the presence of diastolic dysfunction.
- Scores of 3 or 4 denote abnormal diastolic function, implying significant diastolic complications.

This concise framework aids clinicians in identifying diastolic dysfunction and determining subsequent clinical actions.

### Incorporating coexisting chronic illness into decisions about patient selection for lung cancer screening. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^0d77a5bf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society research statement on incorporating coexisting chronic illness into lung cancer screening (LCS) patient selection — states that LCS has potential benefits but that the impact of coexisting chronic illnesses on LCS outcomes is not well defined, and that balancing lung cancer risk, treatment-related harms, and competing causes of death is crucial; outlines objectives to summarize evidence, identify knowledge and research gaps, prioritize topics, and propose methods for research on incorporating comorbidities into LCS decisions; describes a multidisciplinary review focusing on juxtaposing lung cancer risk and competing risks of death, consideration of benefits and risks in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), communication of risk, and treatment of screen-detected lung cancer; reports that gaps were identified and questions developed to guide research informing patient selection, education, and implementation; and concludes there is an urgent need for further research to guide clinical decision-making for patients who may not benefit from LCS owing to coexisting chronic illness, establishing a research framework to address incorporation and communication of comorbidity risks in LCS decisions.

### The role of chest imaging in patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner society [^3d1f8c62]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Use of imaging in COVID-19 — chest radiography and CT of the thorax — is guided by clinical actionability balanced against risks and resource constraints. "The value of an imaging test relates to the generation of results that are clinically actionable either for establishing a diagnosis or for guiding management, triage, or therapy", yet this value "is diminished by costs that include the risk of radiation exposure to the patient, risk of COVID-19 transmission to uninfected health care workers and other patients, consumption of PPE, and need for cleaning and downtime of radiology rooms in resource-constrained environments". The statement "focuses exclusively on the use of chest radiography and CT of the thorax", noting that "Although US has been suggested as a potential triage and diagnostic tool for COVID-19… there is limited experience at this time… as well as infection control issues". Chest radiography "is insensitive in mild or early COVID-19 infection", but in hospitalized patients "can be useful for assessing disease progression and alternative diagnoses (eg, lobar pneumonia suggestive of bacterial superinfection, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion)", and portability "may favor chest radiography… effectively eliminating the risk of COVID-19 transmission… particularly in environments lacking PPE". In contrast, "CT is more sensitive for early parenchymal lung disease, disease progression, and alternative diagnoses including acute heart failure from COVID-19 myocardial injury and, when performed with intravenous contrast material, pulmonary thromboembolism".

### Fatal heart disease among cancer patients [^c9328d56]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Regarding objective 1, we found heart disease contributed to 5.24% of deaths among all cancer patients, and the risk of death from heart disease is 2.24 times that of the general population (Table 1, Fig. 1). Patients diagnosed with lung cancer were at a significantly increased risk of fatal heart disease within one year after diagnosis, with decreasing, yet still elevated SMRs observed throughout the entire follow-up time period. Patients with myeloma and cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx also had an elevated risk of fatal heart disease compared to the general population. This increase in risk was greatest in the first year of follow-up and remained greater than the general population over the 10 years of follow-up. For all 12 cancer sites presented in Fig. 1, risk of fatal heart disease was higher than the general population in each of the follow-up time periods, although not as pronounced in patients with cancer of the prostate, breast, bladder, and melanoma. Regarding objective 2, we found the plurality of heart disease deaths occur in patients treated for breast cancer and lymphomas in children, adolescents, and adults < 40 years old. In adults ≥ 40 years old, the plurality of heart disease deaths occur in patients with the prostate, colorectum, breast, and lung cancer. Patients diagnosed with cancer in more recent years (2001–2005, 2006–2010, 2011–2015) had a lower odds of death from heart disease than patients diagnosed from 1992 to 2000 (Table 2). Patients diagnosed in the earliest time period have had more follow-up years, and thus more years surviving their cancer; surviving their cancer makes them more likely to die from another cause, such as heart disease. Patients with more aggressive forms of cancer diagnosed in the more recent time period are more likely to die from their cancer, and are thus no longer at risk of dying from heart disease.

### Recall intervals for oral health in primary care patients [^21a36c30]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The frequency with which patients should attend for a dental check-up and the potential effects on oral health of altering recall intervals between check-ups have been the subject of ongoing international debate in recent decades. Although recommendations regarding optimal recall intervals vary between countries and dental healthcare systems, six-monthly dental check-ups have traditionally been advocated by general dental practitioners in many developed countries. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005, and previously updated in 2007.

Objectives

To determine the beneficial and harmful effects of different fixed recall intervals (for example six months versus 12 months) for the following different types of dental check-up: a) clinical examination only; b) clinical examination plus scale and polish; c) clinical examination plus preventive advice; d) clinical examination plus preventive advice plus scale and polish. To determine the relative beneficial and harmful effects between any of these different types of dental check-up at the same fixed recall interval. To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of recall intervals based on clinicians' assessment of patients' disease risk with fixed recall intervals. To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of no recall interval/patient driven attendance (which may be symptomatic) with fixed recall intervals.

Search Methods

The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 27 September 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 27 September 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 27 September 2013). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) for ongoing trials. Reference lists from relevant articles were scanned and the authors of some papers were contacted to identify further trials and obtain additional information. We did not apply any restrictions regarding language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of different dental recall intervals.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the search results against the inclusion criteria of the review, extracted data and carried out risk of bias assessment. We contacted study authors for clarification or further information where necessary and feasible. If we had found more than one study with similar comparisons reporting the same outcomes, we would have combined the studies in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model if there were at least four studies, or a fixed-effect model if there were less than four studies. We expressed the estimate of effect as mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcomes. We would have used risk ratios with 95% CI for any dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

We included one study that analysed 185 participants. The study compared the effects of a clinical examination every 12 months with a clinical examination every 24 months on the outcomes of caries (decayed, missing, filled surfaces (dmfs/DMFS) increment) and economic cost outcomes (total time used per person). As the study was at high risk of bias, had a small sample size and only included low-risk participants, we rated the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes as very low. For three to five-year olds with primary teeth, the mean difference (MD) in dmfs increment was -0.90 (95% CI -1.96 to 0.16) in favour of 12-month recall. For 16 to 20-year olds with permanent teeth, the MD in DMFS increment was -0.86 (95% CI -1.75 to 0.03) also in favour of 12-month recall. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether 12 or 24-month recall with clinical examination results in better caries outcomes. For three to five-year olds with primary teeth, the MD in time used by each participant was 10 minutes (95% CI -6.7 to 26.7) in favour of 24-month recall. For 16 to 20-year olds with permanent teeth, the MD was 23.7 minutes (95% CI 4.12 to 43.28) also in favour of 24-month recall. This single study at high risk of bias represents insufficient evidence to determine whether 12 or 24-month recall with clinical examination results in better time/cost outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a very low quality body of evidence from one RCT which is insufficient to draw any conclusions regarding the potential beneficial and harmful effects of altering the recall interval between dental check-ups. There is no evidence to support or refute the practice of encouraging patients to attend for dental check-ups at six-monthly intervals. It is important that high quality RCTs are conducted for the outcomes listed in this review in order to address the objectives of this review.
