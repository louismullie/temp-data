## Question

Can fta abs detect syphilis in early stages

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the FTA-ABS test can detect syphilis in early stages. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes "early syphilis" and the window period for seroconversion. Then, I should verify FTA-ABS sensitivity in primary syphilis from high-quality comparative studies. Next, I will compare FTA-ABS performance with TPPA and modern treponemal immunoassays. After that, I need to consider limitations like subjectivity, quality control, and prozone that could affect early detection. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation and note any exceptions such as CSF testing for neurosyphilis suspicion.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Early syphilis includes primary disease with a chancre and secondary disease with rash and systemic features; serologic tests may be negative very early in primary infection before seroconversion, so "early" detection depends on both timing and assay sensitivity, and discordant results warrant repeat testing in 2–4 weeks if suspicion remains high [^1146BUgA] [^1175xqBw].

> Now, I should verify FTA-ABS sensitivity in primary syphilis from head-to-head data. A large, well-characterized study of 959 patients found FTA-ABS sensitivity for primary syphilis was 78.2% versus 94.5% for TPPA, indicating a meaningful gap in early detection; this aligns with systematic reviews showing FTA-ABS sensitivity in primary syphilis ranging roughly 78–100% but consistently lower than TPPA in direct comparisons, and with CDC summaries noting approximately 78% sensitivity for FTA-ABS in primary disease cohorts [^117Q76ue] [^111zyaWB] [^112M4C94].

> Wait, let me verify how FTA-ABS compares with modern treponemal immunoassays. Multiple evaluations show treponemal EIAs/CIAs achieve near 100% sensitivity in secondary syphilis and 95–100% in early latent disease, and in primary syphilis they generally outperform FTA-ABS; for example, a 2024 comparative study found ELISA 100% sensitive in primary syphilis while FTA-ABS was 96.8%, and FDA 510(k) datasets report immunoassay sensitivities for untreated primary syphilis around 83–100%, reinforcing that FTA-ABS is not the most sensitive early test [^111zyaWB] [^114YLQYC] [^114V81KX].

> Hold on, I should review limitations that could further impair early detection with FTA-ABS. FTA-ABS is manual, fluorescence-based, and interpretation is subjective; variability in reagent quality and operator expertise can reduce performance, and CDC notes specificity concerns and a preference for TPPA over FTA-ABS for manual treponemal confirmation; additionally, prozone can cause false negatives in high-titer secondary syphilis, so if clinical suspicion is high and serology is unexpectedly negative, prozone must be excluded and repeat testing considered [^113dgF3Z] [^112QUEjQ] [^113UiFEy].

> Let me consider the practical clinical implication. Because FTA-ABS misses about one in five primary syphilis cases, a negative FTA-ABS cannot exclude early infection when suspicion is high; in such cases, repeating serology in 2–4 weeks, using TPPA or a modern treponemal immunoassay as the confirmatory test, and integrating lesion-based testing (darkfield or NAAT where available) improves early detection and reduces false reassurance from a single negative FTA-ABS [^1146BUgA] [^117EidvR] [^112M4C94].

> But wait, what if the question is about neurosyphilis rather than early systemic disease? I should double-check CSF testing nuances. CSF FTA-ABS can be highly sensitive for neurosyphilis and may help exclude neurosyphilis when negative in the right clinical context, yet it is not FDA-cleared for this purpose and has specificity limitations due to passive antibody transfer; thus, CSF FTA-ABS should be interpreted alongside CSF-VDRL, cell count, protein, and clinical findings rather than used as a standalone early-stage diagnostic test [^113mEdqw] [^114umqH4] [^112W1n2J].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. FTA-ABS can detect many early syphilis cases but is notably less sensitive than TPPA and modern treponemal immunoassays in primary syphilis, with an estimated sensitivity around 78% in high-quality cohorts; therefore, FTA-ABS should not be relied upon alone for early detection, and laboratories and clinicians should prefer TPPA or validated EIA/CIA within an appropriate algorithm, repeating serology if early infection is suspected and results are discordant or negative [^117Q76ue] [^111zyaWB] [^113dgF3Z] [^1146BUgA].

The FTA-ABS test can detect syphilis in early infection, but **sensitivity is lower in primary syphilis** (about 78–85%) [^117Q76ue] than in later stages, and false negatives can occur if tested too early before seroconversion [^117EidvR]. For the most reliable early detection, **combine FTA-ABS with a nontreponemal test** (RPR or VDRL) and repeat if early infection is suspected and initial results are negative [^1146BUgA]. FTA-ABS is not recommended for screening because it remains positive after treatment and cannot distinguish active from past infection [^115zAHFF]; **TPPA is preferred** for confirmatory testing due to higher sensitivity and specificity [^113dgF3Z].

---

## Diagnostic performance of FTA-ABS in early syphilis

- **Primary syphilis**: Sensitivity is 78–85%, lower than TPPA (94–100%) and some immunoassays (94–100%) [^111zyaWB] [^117Q76ue].
- **Secondary syphilis**: Sensitivity is 92–100%, similar to other treponemal tests [^111zyaWB] [^113UiFEy].
- **Early latent syphilis**: Sensitivity is 94–100%, comparable to other treponemal tests [^111zyaWB] [^115mCdpS].

---

## Limitations of FTA-ABS in early syphilis

- **False negatives**: Can occur if tested before seroconversion (typically 2–4 weeks after exposure) [^117EidvR] [^1146BUgA].
- **Subjectivity**: Interpretation is subjective and requires experienced personnel, reducing reliability [^115zAHFF] [^1156mc97].
- **Persistence**: Remains positive after treatment, limiting utility for distinguishing active from past infection [^1173eFEr] [^111F9zJ5].

## Comparison with other treponemal tests

| **Test** | **Sensitivity in primary syphilis** | **Specificity** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| FTA-ABS | 78–85% | 92–100% | Subjective; remains positive after treatment |
| TPPA | 94–100% | 94–100% | Preferred confirmatory test |
| EIA/CIA | 94–100% | 94–100% | Automated; high throughput |

---

TPPA and modern immunoassays have **higher sensitivity in primary syphilis** and are preferred for confirmatory testing [^117Q76ue] [^113dgF3Z].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Screening**: CDC recommends against FTA-ABS for screening due to persistence and subjectivity [^notfound].
- **Confirmation**: TPPA is preferred for confirming reactive screens and resolving discordant results [^117Q76ue] [^112QUEjQ].
- **Algorithms**: Use traditional (RPR/VDRL then TPPA) or reverse sequence (EIA/CIA then RPR/VDRL) with clinical correlation [^115of9NB] [^114L4tPy].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Repeat testing is warranted if early infection is suspected and initial results are negative; **retest in 2–4 weeks** [^1146BUgA]. Always interpret results alongside clinical findings, risk factors, and other tests [^1173eFEr]. For primary syphilis, direct detection (darkfield microscopy or PCR) from lesions is preferred when available [^111pPMKc] [^115sN1hJ].

---

## Conclusion

FTA-ABS can detect early syphilis but has **lower sensitivity in primary infection** than TPPA and modern immunoassays. It should not be used alone for screening or diagnosis; combine with nontreponemal tests and clinical assessment, and use TPPA or immunoassays for confirmation.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^115KhZF7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

We conducted a systematic review of relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address the question, "What is the sensitivity and specificity of the treponemal tests currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the diagnosis of syphilis (by stage)?" There were 16 treponemal assays evaluated: 13 immunoassays and 3 manual assays (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test [FTA-ABS], microhemagglutination assay for Treponema pallidum antibodies [MHA-TP], Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay [TP-PA]). MHA-TP and FTA-ABS were less sensitive in primary and secondary syphilis than TP-PA; TP-PA is the most specific manual treponemal assay. There is insufficient evidence to recommend one particular treponemal immunoassay (eg, enzyme immunoassays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, microbead immunoassays) over another based on published performance data. For diagnosis of neurosyphilis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) TP-PA has similar performance to CSF FTA-ABS in studies with patients with definitive or presumptive neurosyphilis. However, CSF treponemal testing has limitations in its sensitivity and specificity and should be interpreted within the context of the clinical scenario, additional CSF test results and syphilis prevalence.

Discussion

Among the numerous treponemal assays currently approved by the FDA, comparison of performance characteristics was more robust for the manual assays because there were few studies of the immunoassays that included clinically characterized specimens, stratified by stage. Among the manual treponemal assays included in this review (ie, MHA-TP, FTA-ABS, TP-PA), MHA-TP demonstrated poorer sensitivity for all stages of syphilis. Between the FTA-ABS and TP-PA, the 2 studies that compared their performance found lower sensitivity for the FTA-ABS for primary and secondary syphilis. Given the subjective nature of FTA-ABS interpretation, lack of quality control for FTA-ABS reagents, and the need for microbiologist experience, it is not recommended for use. TP-PA is the recommended assay among the manual treponemal tests.

Among the treponemal immunoassays, there were few published data on test performance stratified by stage, and sample sizes for Premarket FDA 510K data were small. There are insufficient data to distinguish differences in performance between treponemal immunoassays (eg, EIAs, CIAs, MBIAs) for laboratory diagnosis of syphilis. Of note, 2 studies found that TrepSure had poor sensitivity for primary syphilis and significantly lower specificity than other immunoassays.

Several factors should be considered when interpreting these test performance data. Most studies were retrospective and used reactive serology as part of the inclusion criteria, which would bias sensitivity estimates towards 100%, particularly for primary syphilis. Studies utilizing previously banked specimens (both CDC and commercial serum banks) were included in this analysis, but the quality of staging/characterization of these specimens could not be assessed. For primary syphilis, it was unclear whether studies using banked specimens included dark-field positive-seronegative cases or just cases with reactive nontreponemal and/or treponemal serology. For latent syphilis, most studies combined early and late latent into a single category defined as "combined latent syphilis" or used a 2-year cutoff for defining early versus late latent disease. Some studies included prior treated cases and untreated (current) syphilis cases. When possible, our evaluation focused on untreated or current syphilis because the time between treatment and specimen collection was not described.

As with the ELISA, the FTA-ABS test showed high performance. However, seven anti- T. pallidum -positive samples from the FTA-ABS test were falsely diagnosed as negative, with a sensitivity of 96.3%. These seven false-negative samples were correctly classified as positive by the ELISA, and five of them were classified as positive by the VDRL test. Of the anti- T. pallidum -negative samples, only one was positive when assessed by the FTA-ABS test, with a specificity of 99.5%. Our findings are consistent with those of other studies that reported sensitivity values ranging from 86.1% to 100%, and specificity ranged from 92.5% to 100%. In contrast, our results are not consistent with data from other studies, which reported sensitivity and specificity values of 77.5%and 61.5%, respectively. When the serum samples were stratified by clinical stage of syphilis, we found that sensitivity ranged from 93.7% for latent syphilis to 96.8% and 98.7% for primary and secondary syphilis. Other studies reached similar results, except for those for primary syphilis, which had a low value (∼78%).

CONCLUSION

We conclude that all tests were able to discriminate positive and negative samples, regardless of the diagnostic algorithm. Based on the performance parameters, we demonstrated the diagnostic suitability of the ELISA and VDRL test for the diagnosis of the different stages of syphilis (primary, latent, and secondary). It is also important to emphasize that the tests need to be improved in terms of eliminating false positives (cross-reactivity) with treponemal tests (ELISA and FTA-ABS) to achieve higher diagnostic accuracy.

Nontreponemal tests such as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test and the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test are based on anticardiolipin antibody detection and are helpful in monitoring the stage of infection and treatment. They are easy to perform, inexpensive, and provide a rapid diagnostic result. However, they have low specificity because of cross-reactivity with antibodies produced in various autoimmune diseases or during pregnancy. Additionally, NTTs may not reliably detect early primary syphilis because of their lower sensitivity. On the other hand, TTSs such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test, the ELISA, and the chemiluminescent magnetic microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) detect anti- T. pallidum IgG or IgM and are used for screening or as confirmatory tests to exclude false-positive results in NTTs. Moreover, they prove valuable in detecting early syphilis cases that NTTs may overlook. In comparison with NTTs, they are costly, cumbersome, automated, require a trained team to perform, and are not recommended for monitoring treatment progress, relapse, or reinfection in individuals previously treated, as they remain reactive for years, regardless of treatment.

In light of this scenario, we endeavored to perform a systematic evaluation of the performance of commercial kits for diagnosing acquired syphilis. Statistical tools were used to obtain a robust assessment of the performance of each serological test by determining the following diagnostic test parameters: sensitivity (the probability that a test is positive in the presence of infection) and specificity (the probability that a test is negative in the absence of infection).

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^113dgF3Z]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

For manual treponemal tests, one study found the specificity of FTA-ABS to be 87% (n = 128 patients), whereas the specificity ranges of FTA-ABS and TPPA (95%–100% and 94%–100%, respectively) were similar in older studies The specificity of the FTA-ABS test can be limited by laboratory expertise and quality control measures. For these reasons and on the basis of the recent high-quality, head-to-head study demonstrating superior TPPA test performance characteristics, the manual serologic TPPA test is preferred over the serologic FTA-ABS test. However, the CSF FTA-ABS can still help in excluding a neurosyphilis diagnosis because of its negative predictive value when performed in a laboratory experienced in the off-label use of this test. The immunoassays demonstrated specificity ranging from 94.5% to 100% (.); however, Trep-Sure was 82.6% (95% CI = 78.4%–86.1%) specific, significantly lower than the other immunoassays evaluated in a single head-to-head study of 959 patients.

DISCUSSION

Although numerous treponemal and nontreponemal assays are currently commercially available, a systematic evaluation of the performance of commercial kits for the diagnosis of acquired syphilis is required, because few studies of immunoassays have included clinically characterized samples stratified by stage. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of a nontreponemal assay (VDRL test) and two treponemal assays (ELISA and FTA-ABS test) to detect antibodies in the sera of anti- T. pallidum -positive and -negative individuals.

Performance evaluations were performed using the VDRL test to determine diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for syphilis. Considering all clinical stages of syphilis, the VDRL test showed high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values. In fact, only four anti- T. pallidum -positive samples were falsely classified as negative. Compared with the VDRL test, the treponemal tests evaluated also showed false-negative results. Of 187 tested samples, only seven were classified as negative by the FTA-ABS test, whereas all were correctly classified as positive by the ELISA, with no false-negative results. As with the VDRL test, similarly high sensitivity values (100%) were found in other studies, whereas specificity ranged from 64.1% to 100%. – In contrast, sensitivity (49.4% and 77.1%) – and accuracy (71.1%) were lower in other studies. Here, we found high diagnostic sensitivity (> 96%) for all stages when samples were stratified by clinical stage. These results are not consistent with the results of other studies. For example, a 2006 study described low sensitivity for primary syphilis (70%) and syphilis of unknown duration (52%), except for secondary syphilis (96%) and early latent syphilis (87%). Another study showed varying sensitivity values from 62.5% to 78.4% for primary syphilis and from 85% to 100% for early latent syphilis but a high value (100%) for secondary syphilis. The VRDL test was more sensitive than other NTTs such as the RPR. Different sensitivity and specificity values were described for the RPR, ranging from 57.7% to 100% – and from 57.1% to 96.19%, respectively. These differences may be attributed to the number of samples analyzed, which may impact the statistical results presented, to unknown clinical and epidemiologic histories, because early primary syphilis can be missed due to the lower sensitivity of NTTs, to cross-reactivity that decreases the specificity due to antibodies produced in various autoimmune diseases or during pregnancy, to the prozone phenomenon, which causes false-negative results, and to the use of the stained RPR (technical limitation). The samples used in the present study were well characterized, thus excluding the potential biases described above.

Primary and Secondary Syphilis

Among the manual assays, MHA-TP was less sensitive for primary syphilis (45.9–88.6%) than FTA-ABS (78.2–100%) or TP-PA (86.2–100%). For secondary syphilis, the sensitivity of MHA-TP was 90–100%, FTA-ABS was 92.8–100%, and TP-PA was 100% (Table 2). Based on data from 2 studies that compared head-to-head test performance, FTA-ABS was less sensitive than TP-PA in both primary and secondary syphilis.

A study by Park et al found similar sensitivity for the ADVIA Centaur, Bioplex 2200, LIAISON, and Trep-Sure in primary syphilis compared with TP-PA and FTA-ABS; however, Gratzer et al found poorer sensitivity of Trep-Sure in primary syphilis (54.8%, 39.5–67.8%). The Captia Syphilis G was 82.3–100% sensitive for primary syphilis in 3 studies, but sample sizes were small (6–13 cases). Overall, based on limited studies with small sample sizes, the sensitivity of the immunoassays in primary syphilis was comparable to the manual treponemal assays.

For the 5 treponemal assays that had data stratified by stage, all were 100% sensitive for secondary syphilis (Table 3). Therefore, the sensitivity of the immunoassays was comparable to TP-PA and slightly higher than MHA-TP or FTA-ABS.

Latent Syphilis

Among the manual assays, sensitivity is similar among FTA-ABS, TP-PA, and MHA-TP for diagnosis of early latent syphilis (94.4–100%) and sensitivity was lower for late latent disease than early latent disease (84.5–100%) (Table 2). Two studies comparing the sensitivity of FTA-ABS versus TP-PA in late latent disease found conflicting results.

Among the treponemal immunoassays with data by stage of syphilis (Table 3), sensitivity ranged from 95% to 100% for early latent syphilis and 91.7% to 100% for late latent syphilis.

Neurosyphilis

FTA-ABS

Thirteen studies described CSF FTA-ABS test performance (not all studies included both sensitivity/specificity) and were summarized in a prior systematic review. In 3 studies of patients with definitive neurosyphilis (reactive CSF Venereal Disease Research Laboratory Test), the sensitivity of CSF FTA-ABS was 90.9–100%. Among those with presumptive neurosyphilis where diagnosis was made based on reactive serology, other abnormal CSF indices, and clinical signs/symptoms, the sensitivity ranged widely (22.2–100%). A study by Luger et al of 60 symptomatic patients defined neurosyphilis by comparing ratios of serum protein and CSF protein with a ratio of serum treponemal antibody and CSF treponemal antibody; in this study, the sensitivity of the CSF FTA-ABS was 100%. Another large study by Hooshmand et al (n = 156) also found 100% sensitivity of CSF FTA-ABS, but a reactive CSF FTA-ABS was part of the case definition, thus the sensitivity results cannot be interpreted. The specificity of FTA-ABS varied greatly depending on whether true negatives were patients without syphilis or patients with syphilis, but not neurosyphilis. Six studies included patients without syphilis as true negatives, and the specificity of FTA-ABS was 100%; however, a study by Jaffe et al found that CSF FTA was reactive in 5 of 15 patients with syphilis who had no other evidence of neurosyphilis. Eleven studies included patients with syphilis, but not neurosyphilis, and the specificity ranged from 55% to 100%.

For CSF TP-PA, 4 studies described test performance. A study by Castro et al reported a sensitivity of 100% for the CSF TP-PA but the clinical characterization of true positives could not be interpreted given the data provided. The other 3 studies reported a sensitivity of 75.6–95.0%, with the highest sensitivities when using reactive CSF VDRL as the criterion for true positivity. Specificities ranged from 85.5% to 100% and were highest if a titer of 1:640 or greater was used to define neurosyphilis. Based on these limited data, CSF TP-PA appears to have similar performance to CSF FTA-ABS in studies with a mixed population of patients with definitive/presumptive neurosyphilis.

All Stages Combined

Among studies of treponemal immunoassays that looked at overall sensitivity for all stages of syphilis combined, sensitivity ranged from 94.5% to 100%. A single study that compared the overall sensitivity of 4 immunoassays (ADVIA Centaur, Bioplex 2200, LIAISON, TrepSure) found no statistically significant differences in combined sensitivity.

Food and Drug Administration 510K Premarket Notification Data

Available premarket data submitted to the FDA for the treponemal immunoassays are presented in Table 4. Among the 13 immunoassays, 8 submitted sensitivity data stratified by stage (early and late latent syphilis combined). The clinical diagnostic criteria for syphilis diagnosis were not described in any of the 510k data. Three assays (Enzy-Well Syphilis IgG, Immulite 2000 Syphilis Screen, LIAISON) submitted data on positive percent agreement against a predicate assay in patients with "medically diagnosed" syphilis (clinical criteria not described); these demonstrated 97.9–100% agreement with the respective predicate assay.

Table 4.
Sensitivity or Positive Percentage Agreement of Treponemal Tests for Diagnosis of Syphilis by Stage and Treatment Status [FDA Premarket 510(k) Data]

Among patients with untreated primary syphilis, sensitivity ranged from 83.3% to 100%; sample sizes ranged from 12 to 27 patients. For secondary syphilis, sensitivity ranged from 93% to 100%, with a sample size range of 10–43 patients. The AtheNA Multi-Lyte T. pallidum IgG (Zeus Scientific), the Zeus Scientific T. pallidum IgG Test System, and the Bioplex 2200 Syphilis IgG demonstrated poor sensitivity in untreated latent syphilis (54.5–61.5%); however, sample sizes ranged between 11 and 13 patients. The other treponemal assays were 91.5–100% sensitive for latent syphilis (n = 25–200 patients).

Aggregated Specificity

With the exception of 1 study demonstrating 87% specificity for FTA-ABS, the specificity ranges of FTA-ABS (92.0–100%) and TP-PA (94.0–100%) were similar, while MHA-TP ranged from 98.5% to 99.7% (Table 2).

The immunoassays demonstrated specificity ranging from 94.5% to 100% (Table 3), with the exception of TrepSure, which was 82.6% specific in a single study.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^112M4C94]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

The sensitivity of manual treponemal tests in primary syphilis has been estimated from studies that used reference standards such as darkfield microscopy (,–), clinical findings, or stored serum collected from patients staged as having primary syphilis, although the criteria used to stage the disease were not fully described (Supplementary Table 2). MHA-TP had a sensitivity of 53.0%, 72.5%, and 88.6% in studies that used darkfield microscopy as the reference standard. In studies that used stored sera collected from patients who were clinically classified as having primary syphilis, MHA-TP had a sensitivity of 45.9%, 64% and, 88.6%. A 2019 study involving 959 patients, 55 of whom were classified as having primary syphilis (on the basis of serology, physical findings, and positive or negative darkfield microscopy) reported a sensitivity of 78.2% (95% CI = 65.0%–88.2%) and 94.5% (95% CI = 84.9%–98.9%) for FTA-ABS and TPPA, respectively. Other studies with fewer patients, different reference standards, or both are more difficult to compare; sensitivities of FTA-ABS and TPPA have ranged from 88.4% to 100% and 86.2% to 100%, respectively, for primary syphilis (,–).

Table 1
Diagnostic performance of three commercial IgG T. pallidum immunoassays for the diagnosis of syphilis by using anti- T. pallidum -positive (all clinical stages; n = 187) and anti- T. pallidum -negative (n = 192) samples

To evaluate the heterogeneity of IgG detection by all three commercial T. pallidum immunoassays due to different clinical stages of syphilis, sensitivities were compared using samples from individuals with primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis (Table 2). We found positivity in all 31 positive samples from individuals with primary syphilis tested with the recombinant ELISA, whereas 96.8% (30/31) of the samples tested with the VDRL and FTA-ABS tests were positive. Among samples from individuals with secondary syphilis (n = 77), ELISA detected IgG in 100% of samples, and both the VDRL and FTA-ABS tests detected IgG in 98.7% (76/77) of samples. Sensitivity in individuals with late latent disease (n = 79) was 100% for samples tested with the ELISA, 97.5% (77/79) for samples tested with the VDRL test, and 93.7% (74/79) for samples tested with the FTA-ABS test. Regardless of clinical stage, no significant differences were found between tests.

Table 2
Sensitivity of three commercial IgG T. pallidum immunoassays for the diagnosis of syphilis, by clinical stage

All three commercial assays were performed to evaluate cross-reactivity against antibodies from unrelated diseases by using a panel of 323 serum samples (individual data points and results are available in). As shown in Table 3, a higher incidence of cross-reactivity was observed when serum samples were tested with the ELISA and the FTA-ABS test, especially for sexually transmitted viral infections. The highest incidence in samples tested with the FTA-ABS test was observed for HCV (14.7%), followed by HIV (12.5%), HBV (8.8%), and HTLV (7.4%). No cross-reactivity was observed when the VDRL test was used.

### Clinical development and performance of the first to know syphilis self-test for over-the-counter usage: arapid test for treponemal antibody [^115sN1hJ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The laboratory diagnosis of syphilis is complex and necessitates a combination of clinical and laboratory criteria to differentiate current or past infection and absence of infection. Culture for T. pallidum is cumbersome and is available only in selected research laboratories, and there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared PCR test for syphilis at present. Darkfield microscopy is a direct detection test for T. pallidum that can diagnose early primary syphilis (sensitivity 75% to 100%); however, it requires samples from moist lesions or exudates, along with highly trained technicians and specialized equipment. It is not recommended for secondary syphilis due to low sensitivity. Serological testing remains the mainstay for diagnosing syphilis infection. Serology is divided into two different types of tests: non-treponemal tests (NTTs), such as the rapid plasma regain [RPR] test and the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and treponemal tests (TTs), such as the T. pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) and Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption (FTA-ABS). While TT is often positive for life, NTT titers usually decrease after treatment. However, in certain cases, especially in late stages of syphilis, non-treponemal antibodies may persist at low levels for extended periods. The traditional NTTs are cost-effective and useful for initial screening and monitoring of syphilis treatment; however, they can be affected by false-positive and false-negative results. TTs provide higher specificity and sensitivity for confirming syphilis but cannot effectively monitor the disease activity after treatment or differentiate between active and past infections. Thus, both TTs and NTTs have inherent limitations due to variability in their diagnostic performance, hampering syphilis control and prevention efforts in real-world settings. A single serologic NTT or TT is not sufficient for diagnosis, and therefore a combination of positive TT and reactive NTT is required for the diagnosis of syphilis infection. In the past, syphilis screening mainly followed a traditional testing algorithm, starting with NTT, and the positive results required further confirmation through more specific TTs. With increased availability of various treponemal-specific immunoassays including enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIAs), recently, many laboratories are increasingly adopting a "reverse sequence screening" algorithm, which begins the screening with a TT, followed by confirmation of the reactivity with an NTT. When the NTT is non-reactive, a second but different treponemal test is performed to determine if the first treponemal test was a false positive. Regardless of which algorithm is used, it is important to consider the sensitivity and specificity of these assays in clinically characterized sera, stratified by the stage of syphilis, and all screening results must be correlated with clinical diagnosis, which includes patients' symptoms, previous history, and sexual risk factors to make an accurate diagnosis.

Sensitivity of Serologic Tests for Latent Syphilis

Data are limited on nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) test performance in early latent and late latent stages of syphilis, with limited information regarding reference standards, previous treatment status, patient population risk for syphilis, and specific stage of latency Furthermore, some international studies use different definitions of early and late syphilis than are used in the United States.

No studies involving RPR test performance for latent syphilis have been conducted in the United States. Two international studies conducted approximately 10 years ago and without stratification by duration of latency (i.e. early latent of < 1 year versus late latent of > 1 year) make estimates of sensitivities difficult. Three international studies on the performance of VDRL in cases of latent syphilis reported sensitivities that ranged from 82.1% to 100% for early latent syphilis of < 1 year and from 63% to 66% for late latent syphilis of > 1 year or of unknown duration; however, the studies were limited by small samples sizes (n ≤ 72), making the results difficult to interpret (Supplementary Table 1).

The sensitivity of the manual treponemal tests (FTA-ABS, TPPA, and MHA-TP) ranged from 94.4% to 100% for the diagnosis of early latent syphilis; a wider range for late latent syphilis than early latent syphilis (84.5%–100%) has been reported (Supplementary Table 2). Among the treponemal immunoassays, sensitivity ranged from 95% to 100% for early latent syphilis and from 91.7% to 100% for late latent syphilis (Supplementary Table 2). Although the sensitivity of treponemal tests is generally high for early latent and late latent syphilis, the range of sensitivities identified in these studies suggests that additional studies are needed in larger samples where the duration of infection is better characterized. The duration of latency is often difficult to pinpoint; certain patients staged as late latent could have unknown latency duration, whereas other patients classified as late latent could have recently acquired their syphilis infection. This misclassification of duration of infection could falsely elevate the syphilis test performance sensitivity in patients with late latent syphilis.

The sensitivity of nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests decreases during latent syphilis of longer duration because the antibody detected by these test titers diminishes over time. Typically, treponemal tests remain reactive during latent syphilis.

Among the automated treponemal immunoassays, few published data are available on test performance stratified by stage. One study found similar sensitivity for the ADVIA Centaur, Bioplex 2200 Syphilis IgG, Diasorin Liaison, and Trep-Sure in primary syphilis compared with TPPA and FTA-ABS; however, another study of 52 patients found poorer sensitivity of Trep-Sure in primary syphilis (53.8%; 95% CI = 39.5%–67.8%).

Nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) and treponemal tests might not yet be reactive in certain persons with primary syphilis, particularly those with very recently appearing lesions. Using darkfield microscopy as the sole comparator will skew results toward lower sensitivities because persons with early lesions are more likely to have a positive test by darkfield microscopy and be seronegative. Lesions of longer duration might become negative by darkfield microscopy because of immune clearance, but these persons are more likely to be seropositive. NAATs might be positive in both early and older lesions because this test method is not dependent on visualization of motile organisms. Additional studies of genital, anal, and oral lesions using both darkfield microscopy and NAATs as the reference standard, including studies that assess age of lesions, are needed to better refine the sensitivity estimates of nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) and treponemal tests for primary syphilis.

### Performance of treponemal tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^117Q76ue]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Treponemal immunoassays are increasingly used for syphilis screening with the reverse sequence algorithm. There are few data describing performance of treponemal immunoassays compared to traditional treponemal tests in patients with and without syphilis.

Methods

We calculated sensitivity and specificity of 7 treponemal assays: (1) ADVIA Centaur (chemiluminescence immunoassay [CIA]); (2) Bioplex 2200 (microbead immunoassay); (3) fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS); (4) INNO-LIA (line immunoassay); (5) LIAISON CIA; (6) Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA); and (7) Trep-Sure (enzyme immunoassay [EIA]), using a reference standard combining clinical diagnosis and serology results. Sera were collected between May 2012-January 2013. Cases were characterized as: (1) current clinical diagnosis of syphilis: primary, secondary, early latent, late latent; (2) prior treated syphilis only; (3) no evidence of current syphilis, no prior history of syphilis, and at least 4 of 7 treponemal tests negative.

Results

Among 959 participants, 262 had current syphilis, 294 had prior syphilis, and 403 did not have syphilis. FTA-ABS was less sensitive for primary syphilis (78.2%) than the immunoassays or TPPA (94.5%-96.4%) (all P ≤ .01). All immunoassays were 100% sensitive for secondary syphilis, 95.2%-100% sensitive for early latent disease, and 86.8%-98.5% sensitive in late latent disease. TPPA had 100% specificity.

Conclusions

Treponemal immunoassays demonstrated excellent sensitivity for secondary, early latent, and seropositive primary syphilis. Sensitivity of FTA-ABS in primary syphilis was poor. Given its high specificity and superior sensitivity, TPPA is preferred to adjudicate discordant results with the reverse sequence algorithm over the FTA-ABS.

With regard to neurosyphilis, diagnostic criteria of the included studies were diverse and included various combinations of signs/symptoms with abnormal white blood cell count/protein and/or reactive CSF VDRL. As T. pallidum IgG can cross the intact blood–CSF barrier, reactive treponemal tests in the CSF are not specific for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Although the CSF TP-PA and CSF FTA-ABS demonstrated similar sensitivity and specificity, Harding et al found that a negative CSF treponemal test may not rule out neurosyphilis among patients with a high pretest probability (patients with syphilis and neurologic symptoms). Therefore, CSF treponemal tests have limitations with both sensitivity and specificity, and results need to be evaluated within the context of the clinical scenario, additional CSF testing (eg, VDRL, cell count, protein), and syphilis prevalence.

RESULTS

A summary of characteristics of FDA-approved treponemal tests, including manufacturer, assay type, antigens, antibodies detected, and specimen type, is detailed in Table 1. Among the 16 treponemal assays reviewed, there were 13 immunoassays and 3 manual assays: fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test (FTA-ABS), microhemagglutination assay for Treponema pallidum antibodies (MHA-TP), and TP-PA. Ten treponemal tests had published data on sensitivity and specificity. Two immunoassays had performance data that were not stratified by stage of syphilis (Abbott Architect, Roche Elecsys). Among the other 8 that had data stratified by stage of syphilis, 3 were manual treponemal assays and 5 were immunoassays (ADVIA Centaur, Bioplex 2200, Captia Syphilis, G, LIAISON, Trep-Sure). The performance characteristics for these 10 treponemal assays were summarized from 21 highly relevant studies and 11 moderately relevant studies in Tables 2 and 3.

Acquired syphilis — diagnosis requires that a reactive nontreponemal test must be confirmed by a specific treponemal test such as FTA-ABS or TP-PA; treponemal tests usually remain positive for life, even with successful treatment, the prozone phenomenon is more likely in HIV-infected patients, and treponemal antibody titers do not correlate with disease activity and should not be used to monitor treatment response.

### Evaluation of an enzyme immunoassay technique for detection of antibodies against Treponema pallidum [^113ZuaEH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

In the present study, the performance of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique (Eti-syphilis-G and Eti-syphilis-M; DiaSorin) for detection of Treponema pallidum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies for the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis was evaluated. Four hundred forty-one samples were studied. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were 100 and 93%, respectively, compared with the results of a microhemagglutination assay for Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP) and 99.4 and 100%, respectively, compared with the results of the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-Abs) test. The results of the ELISA technique were concordant with those of MHA-TP for 98% of the samples tested, while the rate of concordance with the FTA-Abs test was 99.5%. The sensitivities of the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, MHA-TP, and the ELISA in the different phases of syphilis compared with the results of the FTA-Abs test were 92, 88, and 100%, respectively, for patients with primary syphilis; 100% for all tests evaluated for patients with secondary syphilis; 97.2, 99.4, and 100%, respectively, for patients with latent syphilis; and 57.9, 92.6, and 97.9%, respectively, for patients with past treated syphilis. The RPR test was reactive with 12 samples that were negative by all the specific tests. IgM antibodies were most frequently detected by the ELISA for IgM antibodies (32.8%) than by the FTA-Abs for IgM antibodies (28.4%). Detection of these antibodies by the FTA-Abs test and the ELISA for IgM antibodies decreased with the stage of disease (72 and 88%, respectively, for patients with primary syphilis to 17 and 19%, respectively, for patients with early latent syphilis). The high sensitivity and specificity of this ELISA technique during all stages of syphilis, together with the fact that it is a simple, objective, and easily automated method, lead us to believe that it could be used as a screening test for syphilis.

Sensitivity of Serologic Tests for Tertiary Syphilis

Because tertiary syphilis is rare in the postantibiotic era, published data are very limited on the performance of serologic tests for diagnosis of tertiary syphilis (e.g. gummatous disease, late neurosyphilis, and cardiovascular syphilis); further studies are unlikely to be done. One study estimated the sensitivities of the FTA-ABS and VDRL at 70.6% and 47%, respectively, in 17 patients with tertiary syphilis, although the criteria for the stage of diagnosis were not stated. There were several studies that examined sensitivity of treponemal tests (Liaison CIA, Captia EIA, and FTA-ABS) for detection of cardiovascular syphilis. All studies estimated sensitivity to be 100%; however, sample sizes were extremely small (n = 1–21 cases). The largest study of cardiovascular syphilis included 21 patients and found sensitivities of the MHA-TP and FTA-ABS were 89.5% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity of nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests varies from 47% to 64% during tertiary syphilis, whereas treponemal tests remain reactive.

Specificity of Serologic Tests

Reference standards for specificity analyses varied widely and included apparently healthy volunteers, antenatal patients, syphilis-negative blood donors who were not living with HIV infection, and patients clinically characterized as not having syphilis (from serum banks or on the basis of previous test results or chart review). Certain studies of treponemal test specificity also used results from a different treponemal test or a consensus of a panel of treponemal tests as the reference standard.

Few head-to-head studies compared the specificity of RPR with VDRL specificity on well-characterized specimens. A study of 500 antenatal serum samples found little difference in specificity between VDRL and RPR (two versus one false positive, respectively). Another study among 200 blood donors found VDRL was slightly less specific than RPR (98.5%, with RPR as the gold standard).

The assessment of imprecision between all three commercial tests is shown in a Venn diagram in Figure 2. The highest Cohen's kappa index (κ) was obtained for ELISA + VDRL [κ = 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96–1.00)], followed by ELISA + FTA-ABS [κ = 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93–0.99)] and FTA-ABS + VDRL [κ = 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91–0.98)]. In general, all tests showed high diagnostic performance in serologic recharacterization and discriminated well between positive and negative samples for syphilis.

The performances of the traditional and reverse algorithms were also evaluated. In the traditional algorithm, the VDRL test result excluded the disease in four (2.1%) of 187 anti- T. pallidum -positive samples. Subsequently, five (2.7%) and 177 (97.3%) samples tested negative and positive, respectively, using the FTA-ABS test. All five samples that tested negative with the FTA-ABS test proved positive when tested with the ELISA. Using the reverse algorithm, the FTA-ABS test diagnosed seven (3.7%) anti- T. pallidum -positive samples as negative. The other 180 correctly diagnosed anti- T. pallidum -positive samples were tested with the VDRL test, which confirmed positivity in 178 (98.9%) samples. Two anti- T. pallidum -positive samples that tested negative by the VDRL test proved positive by the ELISA. Diagnostic parameters were compared regarding sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, but no differences were found between the two screening algorithms (Figure 3). Almost perfect agreement was found between the traditional and reverse algorithms (κ = 0.97 [95% CI, 0.94–0.99]).

Biologic False Positive

A nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) test that is reactive for conditions other than syphilis is referred to as a biologic false positive (BFP). Persons with antibodies that are reactive in the nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests, but are nonreactive in a confirmatory treponemal test, are defined as BFP reactors. Health departments frequently retain records of persons with known BFP reactions; these data can assist clinicians in a future evaluation of possible syphilis infection in such persons. Reactive nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests attributable to BFP have been estimated to occur in 0.2%–0.8% of the population and are associated with medical conditions other than syphilis. BFP reactions are attributable to other infections including malaria, leprosy, and HIV; recent vaccinations; autoimmune disorders; and injection drug use.

Treponemal Tests

Treponemal tests are clinically used to confirm results of reactive nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests and evaluate patients with signs suggestive of syphilis in early primary infection when nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests might not yet be reactive. Treponemal tests can also be automated for high throughput screening in blood banks and in large laboratories for routine screening using the reverse sequence algorithm. Antibodies detected in treponemal tests typically persist for life despite treatment unless treatment occurs early in the course of infection; approximately 15%–25% of patients treated for primary syphilis can revert to a nonreactive treponemal test (FTA-ABS and MHA-TP) result within 2–3 years after treatment. In these two studies, no patients treated for secondary syphilis or stages of longer duration of infection seroreverted the reactive treponemal test. Seroreversion of treponemal tests can also occur in patients with advanced HIV disease and AIDS.

STATISTICAL ANALYSES

The diagnostic performances of the tests (VDRL, ELISA, and FTA-ABS) were calculated using a dichotomous approach (2 × 2 contingency table) and compared in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). The assessment of imprecision was based on Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ), which was interpreted as poor (κ ≤ 0.00), slight (0.00 < κ ≤ 0.20), fair (0.21 < κ ≤ 0.40), moderate (0.41 < κ ≤ 0.60), substantial (0.61 < κ ≤ 0.80), and almost perfect (0.81 < κ ≤ 1.0) agreement. The CI was used to account for the precision of the proportion estimates, and the CI was set at 95%. The screening algorithms were also evaluated based on the test agreement. Data were coded and analyzed using computer graphics software (GraphPad Prism v. 9; GraphPad, San Diego, CA). A flow chart (Figure 1) was prepared according to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies guidelines.

### Evaluation of elecsys syphilis assay for routine and blood screening and detection of early infection [^112C7CZZ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Syphilis is a curable sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the spirochetesubsp. It can also be transmitted from mother to child in utero or during birth or, rarely, by transfusion of blood, blood components, or organs from donors with active syphilis. The disease can be divided into stages, based on clinical findings. The primary and secondary stages of the disease are characterized by initial skin manifestations, such as painless sores and macules, and symptoms such as tiredness and headaches, which may be mistaken for other conditions. If undetected, syphilis enters a lengthy latent period, defined as having serological proof of infection without symptoms of disease. If left untreated, the infection can progress to the symptomatic tertiary stage, with subsequent systemic involvement and potentially serious complications. Therefore, early diagnosis is crucial to prevent transmission and to avoid delays in treatment.

We also evaluated the performance of two TTs (ELISA and FTA-ABS). For the ELISA, high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values were obtained (100%). Other studies also showed similar performance values. Using different ELISA brands (Trep-Check IgG enzyme immunoassay [EIA] Trep-Sure, ICE Syphilis detection pack, Trep-ID, TS-EIA, Cobas Syphilis EIA, TP-ELISA, Enzywell TP, Murex ICE EIA, Vircell Syphilis ELISA IgG+IgM, DIALAB ELISA, RecomWell IgG, Architect Syphilis Tp ELISA, Murex ICE, Chorus Syphilis Screen Recombinant, Advia Centaur syphilis assay, and Euroimmun Treponema pallidum Screen ELISA), sensitivity was found to range from 83% to 100%, specificity ranged from 80% to 100%, – and accuracy was 95.4%. However, other studies showed lower sensitivity for the TS-EIA (52%)and the Vircell Syphilis ELISA IgG+IgM (73.2%)and for the specificity of the ICE Syphilis detection pack (61.5%), Enzywell TP (59%), and Vircell Syphilis ELISA IgG+IgM (62.6%). Here, ELISA v. 4.0 was 100% accurate in diagnosing all clinical stages. However, Murex ICE EIA showed 84%, 100%, 75%, and 100% sensitivity for primary syphilis, secondary syphilis, early latent syphilis, and syphilis of unknown duration, respectively. In another study, similar values (100%) were obtained for secondary and early latent syphilis, whereas sensitivity for primary syphilis was lower (80%). For Trep-Sure, recomWell, Syphilis Screening ELISA, and Enzywell, values above 94% were observed at all stages.

### Improved efficiency using sequential automated immunoassays for syphilis screening in blood donors [^111aJWWh]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

There have been significant technological advances in the testing for syphilis, beginning with direct demonstration of spirochetes (e.g. darkfield microscopy) and development of blood tests: reaginic or non-treponemal tests [e.g. Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test and rapid plasma reagin (RPR)], then treponemal tests [e.g. Treponema pallidum immobilization test, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS), T. pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA), T. pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA), and various automatable immunoassay formats], and most recently nucleic acid tests for detection in lesions and chancres.

Syphilis serology using a combination of treponemal and non-treponemal assays is the mainstay of laboratory diagnostics. Treponemal tests detect treponema-specific antibodies and are sensitive in detecting very early syphilis. Individuals may be test-reactive for life; therefore, treponemal tests are not useful in differentiating between early and latent infections. Non-treponemal tests detect antibodies to lipoidal material produced due to treponemal infection and are more reliable indicators of untreated infection but are non-specific. The two types of tests can be combined to form the "traditional" and "reverse" syphilis testing algorithms.

In the traditional algorithm, a non-treponemal test is used as the screening assay with all reactive samples confirmed using a treponemal test. As non-treponemal assays are less sensitive, there is a risk that both early and latent infections may go undetected. While this algorithm is a cost-effective approach to diagnosing syphilis, non-treponemal tests are also less specific and are performed manually, and the results are subject to interpretation.

The reverse algorithm uses a treponemal assay first, with all reactive samples then confirmed using a non-treponemal test. Discordant results are usually resolved with a second treponemal test. Methods such as TPHA and treponemal chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays (CMIAs) can be automated on high-throughput analyzers making them suitable for high-volume laboratories; however, it has been reported this algorithm can be prone to higher false-positive rates in low-prevalence populations. A modification of the reverse algorithm using two treponemal tests sequentially has also been described.

DISCUSSION

The current algorithm of syphilis testing using sequential immunoassays, screening with Alinity (IA1) followed by Elecsys (IA2), improved specificity without an impact on sensitivity. In our study using blood donors, we calculated the false-positive rate for the Alinity as 0.08%. This rate is comparable to our earlier assay combination using TPHA and ARCHITECT (0.14%, data not shown). During evaluation, there was a signal that a small proportion of samples (8/129) that were IA1 repeatedly reactive/IA2 non-reactive tested reactive with one of the three confirmatory tests (TPPA reactive n = 2, FTA-ABS reactive/weakly reactive n = 6). None of these were RPR reactive and are unlikely to represent infectious syphilis. These samples may represent false-negative IA2, false-positive TPPA, or FTA-ABS results, or the early stages of infection where some markers are below the limit of assay detection. As the samples were de-identified for the evaluation, we were unable to determine if the donor returned for subsequent donations and re-screened for syphilis. However, in our experience with following up blood donors for risk factor assessment and further testing, it has been observed that these patterns of results resolve over time and represent IA1 false reactivity.

Sensitivity of Serologic Tests for Secondary Syphilis

In studies that classified secondary syphilis on the basis of clinical diagnosis that included rash, mucocutaneous lesions or patchy alopecia, mucous patches, or condylomata lata; clinical diagnosis with visualized spirochetes on darkfield microscopy; or clinical diagnosis with reactive nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) and treponemal serology, the sensitivity of both RPR and VDRL was 100% (–, –) (Supplementary Table 1). Only two studies reported an RPR sensitivity of < 100% (91% and 97.2%).

The sensitivity of the treponemal assay, MHA-TP, for secondary syphilis ranged from 96% to 100%, except in one study that reported 90% sensitivity (Supplementary Table 2). The estimated sensitivity of FTA-ABS was > 92% with six of eight studies reporting 100% Of the two studies that found sensitivity to be < 100%, FTA-ABS sensitivity was reported to be 92.8% (95% CI = 85.7%–97.0%) and 95.0% (95% CI = 76.4%–99.1%). TPPA was 100% sensitive in five studies. Among the automated treponemal immunoassays, few published data are available on test performance stratified by stage; however, the sensitivity of five treponemal immunoassays (Liaison, TrepSure, Bioplex 2200, ADVIA Centaur, and INNO-LIA) was estimated at 100% for secondary syphilis in one study of 98 patients.

The sensitivity of both nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) and treponemal tests approaches 100% because of higher antibody titers during the secondary stage of syphilis. A prozone might need to be ruled out in specimens from patients with suspected secondary syphilis that are nonreactive in nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests. Because laboratorians typically do not know the patient's stage of syphilis when the serologic specimen is submitted, clinicians should specifically request to assess for prozone when clinically indicated (e.g. in patients who have signs and symptoms of syphilis and nonreactive nontreponemal [lipoidal antigen] test results).

Although data suggest that nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) test performance sensitivities do not significantly differ between persons living with and without HIV infection, studies have reported increased likelihood of BFP in HIV-positive persons. In studies with samples sizes that ranged from 789 to 300,000, serum testing by VDRL or RPR indicated that the rate of BFP results was 2.5–34.5 times higher among HIV-positive persons than HIV-negative persons. These studies were conducted in populations before antiretroviral therapy was widely available or in populations where viral load was not assessed. BFP rates in persons living with HIV infection who are virally suppressed have not been studied.

Treponemal test positivity generally persists after previously treated infection, unless the infection is treated before the secondary stage, as has been previously described in persons without HIV infection. Before modern antiretroviral therapy, seroreversion of either the MHA-TP or FTA-ABS test was found to vary by severity of HIV disease in two studies and was lower for asymptomatic HIV infection (five of 69 patients) than symptomatic HIV/AIDS (eight of 21 patients) in one study. In another study, seroreversion was identified in 14% of 29 patients with asymptomatic HIV infection and 41% of 29 patients with symptomatic HIV infection. However, two subsequent studies including 31 and 104 patients found no difference in seroreversion of treponemal tests by HIV status in patients previously treated for syphilis. In a more recent study of 294 patients with previous syphilis followed for ≥ 6 months after treatment and with no signs of syphilis during the follow-up interval, 87% were reactive for FTA-ABS, 92% for TPPA, and 96%–99% for one of four treponemal immunoassays. Treponemal immunoassays were statistically significantly more likely to remain reactive compared with FTA-ABS.

Recommendation for syphilis serologic testing in persons living with HIV/AIDS. Nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) and treponemal tests should be interpreted in the same manner regardless of HIV status (Box).

Comment and evidence summary. On the basis of existing data, nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) and treponemal tests should be interpreted the same for patients with and without HIV infection.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Syphilis diagnostic modalities — PCR and serologic tests: Some laboratories provide locally developed and validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the direct detection of T. pallidum, and a presumptive serologic diagnosis is possible using non-treponemal tests such as VDRL and RPR and treponemal tests including FTA-ABS, TP-PA, enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIA), immunoblots, and rapid treponemal assays; serologic diagnosis traditionally involves screening for non-treponemal antibodies with confirmation by treponemal-based assays.

### Improved efficiency using sequential automated immunoassays for syphilis screening in blood donors [^113KTYpn]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study provides proof of concept for using sequential immunoassays in the diagnosis of syphilis. For blood services, this allows for most of the testing to be done on automated platforms, resulting in workflow efficiencies and assisting in donor counseling as the true positive and false-positive results are rapidly resolved. There were a small number of samples in the evaluation that tested IA1 repeatedly reactive, IA2 non-reactive, and TPPA reactive but RPR non-reactive. These are unlikely to represent infectious syphilis and are of low consequence for blood component safety; therefore, we progressed to full implementation of the sequential immunoassay algorithm. There have been no confirmed cases of blood transfusion transmission of syphilis since 1977, likely due to modern blood donation processing not facilitating survival of T. pallidum among other reasons, and several have also argued that syphilis testing could be dropped altogether. For the viral agents where Lifeblood uses sequential immunoassays, there have been no lookback investigations triggered by any IA1 repeatedly reactive/IA2 non-reactive donors in over two decades of running these algorithms (data not shown).

For diagnostic laboratories, where the purpose is the diagnosis of syphilis rather than blood product safety, a higher level of specificity, clinical correlation, risk assessment, and follow-up testing is required. So, in the diagnostic setting, the concept of sequential immunoassays lends itself to automation and probable efficient workflows especially through increasing specificity without impacting sensitivity. We suggest that the concept requires further exploration, particularly around the true result for samples testing IA1 reactive/IA2 non-reactive. Noting that all syphilis tests have suboptimal sensitivity and specificity varying with the stage of infection, we suggest future research to establish the proportion of IA1 reactive/IA2 non-reactive that are reactive on other syphilis tests (e.g. TPPA/TPHA, RPR/VDRL, and FTA-ABS) to determine the overall sensitivity and specificity of the different combinations and also the costs and turnaround times to produce the best algorithm for the serodiagnosis of syphilis.

### Prospective, multi-centre clinic-based evaluation of four rapid diagnostic tests for syphilis [^112NYyXF]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate prospectively four rapid, point-of-care serological tests for syphilis in prenatal or high risk populations in four countries.

Methods

Tests were performed on consecutive clinic attenders, using whole blood in the clinic, and whole blood and serum in the laboratory. The sensitivity and specificity of each test was evaluated, using a standard treponemal test (Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay (TPHA) or fluorescent treponemal antibody, absorbed (FTA-ABS) as gold standard. Non-treponemal tests (rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or venereal diseases research laboratory (VDRL) tests) were also performed on all subjects at three sites.

Results

The specificity of each rapid test was > 95% at each site. Sensitivities varied from 64–100% and, in most cases, were lower when whole blood was used rather than serum.

Conclusions

Rapid serological tests for syphilis are an acceptable alternative to conventional laboratory tests. Since they do not require equipment or electricity, they could increase coverage of syphilis screening, and enable treatment to be given at the first clinic visit.

Screening algorithms.

Considering the TTs and NTTs analyzed in this study, anti- T. pallidum -positive and -negative samples were evaluated according to two diagnostic algorithms: the traditional and the reverse. In the traditional algorithm, the VDRL test was used in the first level of testing in a screening algorithm. A negative VDRL test result excludes the disease, whereas positive results should be forwarded for diagnostic confirmation using the FTA-ABS test to exclude or confirm infection. Samples for which the dual-serology test in the traditional algorithm did not yield concordant results were tested with the ELISA. In the reverse algorithm, the FTA-ABS test was used in the first level of testing in a screening algorithm. A negative FTA-ABS result excludes the disease, whereas positive results should be forwarded for diagnostic confirmation using the VDRL test. Similar to the traditional algorithm, the ELISA was also used in the reverse algorithm for discordant results.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^112QUEjQ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendation for serologic syphilis testing. Nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests (e.g. RPR or VDRL) are not interchangeable when used to determine antibody titers; testing on follow-up samples must be performed with the same type of test (Box). The TPPA test is the preferred manual treponemal test.

Comment and evidence summary. Sensitivity and specificity estimates of RPR and VDRL were similar but not exact in head-to-head studies and studies that used similar reference standards (–, –, –). When assessing changes in antibody titers using nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests, it is critical that the same test be used because titers are used by clinicians to classify the infection status of a patient and follow treatment response. A recent study with 959 patients estimated the sensitivity of FTA-ABS and TPPA to be 78.2% and 94.5%, respectively, when testing specimens from patients with primary syphilis. Two studies that tested specimens from patients with secondary syphilis reported a sensitivity of 92.8%–95.0% compared with 100% for TPPA. Many automated treponemal immunoassays are similar in sensitivity, and certain ones are slightly less specific when compared with the manual TPPA, except for the Trep-Sure test which has inferior specificity. Among the other immunoassays, data are insufficient to recommend one assay based on test performance.

### Evaluation of a fully automated treponemal test and comparison with conventional VDRL and FTA-ABS tests [^111ou274]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

We evaluated analytic performances of an automated treponemal test and compared this test with the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL) and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS). Precision performance of the Architect Syphilis TP assay (TP; Abbott Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was assessed, and 150 serum samples were assayed with the TP before and after heat inactivation to estimate the effect of heat inactivation. A total of 616 specimens were tested with the FTA-ABS and TP, and 400 were examined with the VDRL. The TP showed good precision performance with total imprecision of less than a 10% coefficient of variation. An excellent linear relationship between results before and after heat inactivation was observed (R² = 0.9961). The FTA-ABS and TP agreed well with a κ coefficient of 0.981. The concordance rate between the FTA-ABS and TP was the highest (99.0%), followed by the rates between FTA-ABS and VDRL (85.0%) and between TP and VDRL (83.8%). The automated TP assay may be adequate for screening for syphilis in a large volume of samples and can be an alternative to FTA-ABS.

### Refining timely diagnosis of early syphilis by using Treponema pallidum PCR or IgM immunoblotting next to conventional serology for syphilis [^111ofZ9f]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The study population included all 182 STI consultations for 171 unique patients between January 2012 and December 2018 with concurrentPCR and serological testing. These clients of the South Limburg STI clinic (Public Health Service) were tested for the presence of an STI because of symptoms or high-risk sexual behavior (e.g. MSM or sex workers) or because of partner notification. This study was approved and registered by the local ethics committee [local medical ethics committee of the Maastricht University Medical Center] (approval number METC 2018–0579).

Diagnosis and staging of syphilis were performed on the basis of the combination of clinical symptoms, history, serological results, and PCR results. Syphilis was diagnosed in 42% of the STI consultations (77/182 consultations); 64 patients had syphilis stage I, 12 had latent syphilis, and 1 had syphilis of unknown stage.

Clinical evaluation and determination of the added value of PCR and IgM blots were performed by a physician specialized in sexual health. For each consultation, the electronic patient record was reevaluated, and two conclusions were drawn, one based on serologic results and recorded clinical symptoms without PCR results and one with inclusion of the PCR results. The difference between the two evaluations was the added value of the PCR, which was classified as "no difference", "no consequence", "missed early (re)infection", "better staging", or "avoids retesting". The IgM blots were tested retrospectively and subsequently related by a clinical microbiologist (physician) to the diagnosis made by the physician specialized in sexual health on the basis of serologic results and clinical symptoms only.

Treponemal serology was performed according to a standard reverse algorithm, using a treponemal IgG/IgM electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) for screening (Cobas 8000, product number 07802960; Roche). Positive results were confirmed with Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-abs, Trepo-spot IF, Biomerieux) or IgG immunoblot (product number 5170; Mikrogen), rapid plasma reagin (RPR) reditest (product number 3000–5511; BioKit) and aparticle agglutination assay (product number 201633; Fujirebio Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Cerebrospinal Fluid Evaluation

Further testing with CSF evaluation is warranted for persons with clinical signs of neurosyphilis (e.g. cranial nerve dysfunction, meningitis, stroke, acute or chronic altered mental status, or loss of vibration sense). All patients with ocular symptoms and reactive syphilis serology need a full ocular examination, including cranial nerve evaluation. If cranial nerve dysfunction is present, a CSF evaluation is needed. Among persons with isolated ocular symptoms (i.e. no cranial nerve dysfunction or other neurologic abnormalities), confirmed ocular abnormalities on examination, and reactive syphilis serology, a CSF examination is unnecessary before treatment. CSF analysis can be helpful in evaluating persons with ocular symptoms and reactive syphilis serology who do not have ocular findings or cranial nerve dysfunction on examination. Among patients with isolated auditory abnormalities and reactive syphilis serology, CSF evaluation is likely to be normal and is unnecessary before treatment.

Laboratory testing is helpful in supporting the diagnosis of neurosyphilis; however, no single test can be used to diagnose neurosyphilis in all instances. Diagnosis of neurosyphilis depends on a combination of CSF tests (e.g. CSF cell count, protein, or reactive CSF-VDRL) in the presence of reactive serologic test (nontreponemal and treponemal) results and neurologic signs and symptoms. CSF laboratory abnormalities are common for persons with early syphilis and are of unknown medical significance in the absence of neurologic signs or symptoms. CSF-VDRL is highly specific but insensitive. For a person with neurologic signs or symptoms, a reactive CSF-VDRL (in the absence of blood contamination) is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis.

When CSF-VDRL is negative despite clinical signs of neurosyphilis, reactive serologic tests results, lymphocytic pleocytosis, or protein, neurosyphilis should be considered. In that instance, additional evaluation by using fluorescent treponemal-antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) or TP-PA testing on CSF might be warranted. The CSF FTA-ABS test is less specific for neurosyphilis than the CSF-VDRL but is highly sensitive. Fewer data are available regarding CSF TP-PA; however, the sensitivity and specificity appear similar to the CSF FTA-ABS. Neurosyphilis is highly unlikely with a negative CSF FTA-ABS or TP-PA test, especially among persons with nonspecific neurologic signs and symptoms.

CSF Antibody Tests for Neurosyphilis

Challenges associated with the diagnosis of neurosyphilis include a lack of consensus on the clinical implications of abnormal CSF findings in patients with no neurologic symptoms or signs but with serologic evidence of syphilis and poor distinction between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients in studies evaluating laboratory tests to aid in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. In addition, the wide variation in reference standards that included CSF VDRL, CSF protein elevation and pleocytosis, CSF NAAT, CSF FTA-ABS, or other CSF treponemal and nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests, limited direct comparisons of CSF antibody test performance among neurosyphilis studies. Finally, the CSF VDRL is the only FDA-cleared test recommended to aid in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Although no treponemal test is FDA cleared to aid in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis, the CSF FTA-ABS has been used off-label for years in unique clinical circumstances for its negative predictive value (e.g. in patients with nonspecific neurologic signs or symptoms, reactive serologic tests, and a negative CSF VDRL, even if CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated CSF protein are present).

Because asymptomatic or symptomatic CNS invasion can occur in persons with primary, secondary, latent, or tertiary disease, serum examination can confirm the presence of syphilis but does not address CNS invasion or involvement. Examination of CSF is required to confirm CNS invasion but is only recommended in patients with reactive serologic tests and signs or symptoms suggestive of neurosyphilis; the clinical significance of CSF laboratory abnormalities in patients without any neurologic findings is unknown.

### Evaluation of the passive particle agglutination test in the serodiagnosis and follow-up of syphilis [^112y1AP2]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We performed the present study to determine the rate of concordance of the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) and of the microhemagglutination assay for antibodies to Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP) with the passive particle agglutination test (TP.PA) in patients with early syphilis and to observe the reactivity of the rapid plasma reagin (RPR), MHA-TP, and the TP.PA tests for 1 year after therapy. The study included 449 people who were given therapy if they had syphilis and followed up for 1 year. The rate of concordance of the TP.PA with the MHA-TP was 98.4%, and it was 98.9% with the FTA-ABS. During follow-up, a significant decrease of antibodies was found in 56%, 26%, and 70% of the patients when using the RPR, the MHA-TP, and the TP.PA, respectively. The TP.PA seems to be an adequate routine assay for the diagnosis of syphilis, being as sensitive as the FTA-ABS test in primary syphilis and as useful as the RPR test in monitoring therapy.

### Performance assessment of treponemal and nontreponemal tests for the diagnosis of acquired syphilis [^114C2hYz]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

No difference was found when assessing the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the traditional and reverse algorithms. In contrast, Evren et al.found that the rate of missed diagnoses of the traditional algorithm was 42.5%. The reverse algorithm (99.85%) had a higher sensitivity than that of the traditional algorithm (57.49%). The false-positivity rate of the reverse algorithm was 0.02%. In fact, the discrepancy between the two algorithms was large, demonstrating the diagnostic performance of the reverse algorithm. A possible hypothesis for this finding is the large sample size used by the study authors (n = 4,789), which allowed for a more in-depth analysis. Furthermore, compared with this study, the difference in sensitivity between the treponemal tests may have been influenced by differences in the inherent characteristics of each diagnostic platform used (CMIA, ELISA, and FTA-ABS).

Buono et al.found that the reverse algorithm identified 38 additional seropositive individuals not detected by the traditional algorithm (+3.7% of positivity), and Rourk et al.showed that the reverse algorithm detected 21 patients with possible latent syphilis that were not detected by traditional algorithms. As a result, many clinical laboratories have adopted the reverse screening algorithm, in which samples are first tested with a TT and then screening-reactive samples are confirmed by an NTT. Currently, the CDC and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control recommend the use of the reverse algorithm. It allows identification of patients with latent or early syphilis and increases the sensitivity of a serologic diagnosis of syphilis.

The major limitation of this study was the lack of syphilis samples from pregnant women and congenital syphilis for evaluating the diagnostic performance of all three commercial tests. Another limitation was the inability to obtain well-defined serologic samples for cross-reactivity evaluation, so only a small number of samples were analyzed in this study.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^1173eFEr]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

No published data are available that examined whether reversion to a nonreactive treponemal test occurs with an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or a chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIA) after treatment for syphilis. Treponemal tests, unlike nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests, cannot be used to monitor response to therapy because they remain reactive indefinitely. In patients with a history of treated syphilis and reactive treponemal test results, additional treponemal testing is not helpful for detecting reinfection and is not recommended. In this case, nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) testing titers along with clinical history of syphilis, physical examination, and sexual risk assessment, including contact history, must be used to determine infection status.

Manual treponemal tests include FTA-ABS, TPPA, Captia Syphilis IgG EIA, Trep-Sure EIA, and Zeus Scientific EIA. Manual assays are typically used as reflex tests to confirm reactive nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) specimens in the traditional testing algorithm. The FTA-ABS test is based on florescence microscopy and uses a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antihuman immunoglobulin to detect antibody binding to whole T. pallidum that has been fixed on a glass slide. TPPA is an indirect agglutination assay with T. pallidum antigens bound to gelatin particles.

The manual TPHA and MHA-TP tests are no longer available for in vitro diagnostics in the United States but are still used in certain international settings. TPHA and MHA-TP are indirect agglutination with T. pallidum antigens bound to avian or ovine erythrocytes. MHA-TP is a microplate version of TPHA.

As of December 31, 2021, a total of 12 FDA-cleared automated treponemal immunoassays were available for clinical use, including EIA, CIA, and multiplex flow (microbead) immunoassays (MFIA). In contrast to the manual assays, the treponemal immunoassays are often run as the initial test in a reverse sequence screening algorithm. All FDA-cleared treponemal tests can be performed on serum; certain tests also can be performed on plasma, including heparin, EDTA, and citrate plasma. Certain laboratories also have also validated use of treponemal tests with dried blood spots (DBS); however, no available tests have been cleared by FDA for this specimen type, nor have data been published on DBS specimens collected in the United States to aid in the diagnosis of syphilis.

Treponemal Tests for Neurosyphilis

The lack of a definitive diagnosis standard makes it difficult to interpret studies of the use of treponemal tests to support neurosyphilis diagnosis. Studies of treponemal test sensitivity in CSF included patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic neurosyphilis; various laboratory tests were used for the reference standard, including CSF white blood cell count, protein, and CSF-VDRL. Studies of test specificity included patients without syphilis as well as patients with syphilis but no symptoms suggestive of neurosyphilis. The variation in reference standards limits the ability to compare sensitivity and specificity estimates among studies. No CSF treponemal antibody tests are cleared by FDA to aid in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis.

Thirteen studies describing CSF FTA-ABS test performance were summarized in a previous systematic review. Sensitivity varied depending on whether the reference standard required reactive CSF-VDRL to meet the case definition (definitive neurosyphilis) or a combination of other criteria (presumptive neurosyphilis), including reactive nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) or treponemal CSF, other CSF indices (pleocytosis or elevated protein), rabbit inoculation, or clinical signs and symptoms.

In studies of definitive neurosyphilis, sensitivity of CSF FTA-ABS was 90.9%–100%. In the two largest studies of presumptive neurosyphilis (n = 60 and n = 156), CSF FTA-ABS demonstrated 100% sensitivity.

CSF FTA-ABS specificity varied greatly depending on whether true negatives were patients without syphilis or patients with syphilis but not symptomatic neurosyphilis. Six studies included patients without syphilis as true negatives, and CSF FTA-ABS specificity was 100%. In 11 studies that included patients with syphilis but not symptomatic neurosyphilis, the specificity ranged from 55% to 100%, likely because of passive diffusion of serum antibodies across an inflamed blood-brain barrier. This wide range of specificity in patients with syphilis but without neurologic symptoms could lead to false-positive results and overtreatment in these patients and in patients with nonspecific neurologic symptoms where the diagnosis of neurosyphilis is unlikely. A negative CSF FTA-ABS result can be clinically helpful to exclude neurosyphilis in complex cases where the cause of nonspecific neurologic signs or symptoms is most likely from other conditions.

Introduction

Syphilis, a chronic bacterial infection caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum, has been a significant public health challenge for centuries. Described as early as the 15th century, syphilis is often termed "the great imitator" due to its capacity to mimic a wide array of other diseases. This chameleon-like nature extends to its ocular manifestations, which can present variably across different stages of the disease. Despite significant advances in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, ocular syphilis remains a pertinent issue, particularly with its resurgence in the context of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) pandemic.

The incidence of syphilis has fluctuated over the decades, with significant public health campaigns in the mid-20th century leading to a dramatic decline. However, recent years have witnessed a concerning resurgence globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), millions of new cases are reported annually, with a notable increase in high-income countries among men who have sex with men (MSM) and individuals co-infected with HIV. Ocular syphilis, while less common than other manifestations, represents a critical subset due to the potential for severe visual impairment and blindness if left untreated.

Ocular syphilis can manifest at any stage of the disease, from primary to tertiary syphilis, and may present as an isolated symptom or in conjunction with systemic signs. Early syphilitic eye disease typically involves anterior segment inflammation, such as interstitial keratitis. Secondary syphilis may present with uveitis, retinitis, and vitritis. Tertiary syphilis can lead to more severe complications, including optic atrophy and gummatous involvement of ocular structures. The diversity in presentation necessitates a high index of suspicion, especially in endemic areas or high-risk populations.

The diagnosis of ocular syphilis is complex, often requiring a multifaceted approach. Serological testing remains the cornerstone, with both non-treponemal (eg, RPR, VDRL) and treponemal-specific tests (eg, FTA-ABS, TP-PA) employed to confirm infection. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests can vary, particularly in different stages of the disease or in the context of co-infections such as HIV. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct visualization of the spirochete in ocular fluids can provide definitive diagnosis but are not universally available.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of ocular syphilis, co-infection, and therapy response [^1165Xufr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Syphilis is an infectious disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum which is most often transmitted sexually in acquired disease or vertically during pregnancy in congenital syphilis (CS). Four stages have been described in acquired disease, and overlap can exist between the stages. The primary stage is characterized by a painless ulcerated lesion known as a chancre, which is thought to be the site of entrance into the host. The secondary stage typically occurs 2 weeks to several months after infection and is associated with a skin rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. A period of latency can occur after the secondary stage, and recurrences often present during the 1st year after diagnosis. Patients can remain in this stage indefinitely or develop tertiary syphilis.

During this stage, serious systemic manifestations occur, including cardiovascular and neurologic symptoms as well as gumma formation throughout the body.–Ocular syphilis is considered to occur during any stage of infection, and it is known as "great masquerader".CS has been classified as early CS and late CS. Early CS is characterized by organ involvements including liver, kidney, bone, and hematological and mucocutaneous manifestations. Ocular manifestations including interstitial keratitis, chorioretinitis, salt–pepper fundus, glaucoma, cataract, and chancres of the eyelid have been mostly described in late CS. Every patient with ocular inflammation is recommended to be tested for syphilis. Since non-specific treponemal tests, including venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL) and rapid plasma reagin test (RPR), normalize during the latent and tertiary stages, testing for syphilis should include both non-specific treponemal tests and specific treponemal antibody tests including fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) and the microhemagglutination assay for T. pallidum (MHA-TP). Treatment for presumed latent ocular syphilis is the same as for neurosyphilis, specifically 10–14 days of intravenous penicillin (IV PCN) 3–4 million units every 4 hours. In this study, we describe the clinical presentation of patients diagnosed with presumed latent ocular syphilis and congenital late syphilis at a tertiary referral center in Turkey. We compare the clinical findings with patients described in other studies, specifically focusing on demographics and co-infections.

Treponemal and non-treponemal testing

Specific tests react to treponemal antibodies against spirochaetes and include; fluorescent treponemal-antibody absorption (FTA ABS), Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay (TPHA), Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA), microhaemagglutination assay for antibodies to Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP), and Treponema pallidum enzyme immunoassay (TP-EIA). They remain positive for life following infection and remain positive after successful treatment. A positive result does not inform the recency or activity of infection. False-positive results can occur from other inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or from other infections especially other spirocheteal infections such as yaws, bejel and pinta.

Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and VDRL are non-specific tests that detect cardiolipin antibodies produced in response to cardiolipin-cholesterol lecithin antigen in active syphilis infection. These tests are read by dilutional titration, decrease following treatment and increase with active infection. Usually a 4x fold titre decrease/increase is a significant result as a halving or doubling could result from reader interpretational error. With appropriate treatment, titres typically return to non-reactive or occasionally to a long term low titre (Fig. 12).

Fig. 12
Graph depicting serological testing reactivity during the natural history of syphilis infection.

Treponemal specific tests react to treponemal antibodies which once positive remain so for life (although there will be no reaction the first few weeks of primary infection). Non-treponemal testing react in response to cardiolipin-cholesterol lecithin antigen in active syphilis infection. With adequate treatment titres will normally return to a non-reactive level. Again, there may be no reactive result in early infection. (Permissions from Ghanem, Ram, and Rice 2020, NEJM).

False negative results may occur with non-treponemal testing, especially in early primary/acute infection, and patients may need re-testing two weeks after initial presentation. False-positive non-treponemal testing can occur with infections such as tuberculosis, rickettsia and leprosy, in endocarditis and during pregnancy.

Availability of specific assays varies and it is critical that clinicians liaise with their local Infectious Disease physicians and laboratories to determine the available tests and their interpretation.

### Is serological testing a reliable tool in laboratory diagnosis of syphilis? Meta-analysis of eight external quality control surveys performed by the German infection serology proficiency testing program [^1156mc97]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

The accuracy of diagnostic tests is critical for successful control of epidemic outbreaks of syphilis. The reliability of syphilis serology in the nonspecialist laboratory has always been questioned, but actual data dealing with this issue are sparse. Here, the results of eight proficiency testing sentinel surveys for diagnostic laboratories in Germany between 2000 and 2003 were analyzed. Screening tests such as Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (mean accuracy, 91.4% [qualitative], 75.4% [quantitative]), Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (mean accuracy, 98.1% [qualitative], 82.9% [quantitative]), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (mean qualitative accuracy, 95%) were more reliable than Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) testing (mean accuracy, 89.6% [qualitative], 71.1% [quantitative]), the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) (mean accuracy, 88% [qualitative], 65.8% [quantitative]), and immunoblot assays (mean qualitative accuracy, 87.3%). Clearly, immunoglobulin M (IgM) tests were more difficult to manage than IgG tests. False-negative results for samples that have been unambiguously determined to be IgM and anti-lipoid antibody positive accounted for 4.7% of results in the IgM ELISA, 6.9% in the VDRL test, 18.5% in the IgM FTA-ABS, and 23.0% in the IgM immunoblot assay. For negative samples, the mean percentage of false-positive results was 4.1% in the VDRL test, 5.4% in the IgM ELISA, 0.7% in the IgM FTA-ABS, and 1.4% in the IgM immunoblot assay. On average, 18.3% of participants misclassified samples from patients with active syphilis as past infection without indicating the need for further treatment. Moreover, 10.2% of laboratories wrongly reported serological evidence for active infection in samples from patients with past syphilis or in sera from seronegative blood donors. Consequently, the continuous participation of laboratories in proficiency testing and further standardization of tests is strongly recommended to achieve better quality of syphilis serology.

Congenital and acquired syphilis — diagnosis and evaluation are outlined as follows: Congenital syphilis can be definitively diagnosed if T. pallidum is detected by darkfield microscopy or special stains of infant lesions or body fluids, but failure to detect T. pallidum does not definitively rule out infection because false-negative results are common. A quantitative nontreponemal serologic titer in an infant that is fourfold higher than the mother's is suggestive of infection, and infection also should be assumed in infants born to mothers who were untreated or inadequately treated prior to delivery, including non-penicillin regimen or treatment completion < 30 days before delivery, regardless of lack of findings. Evaluation of suspected cases should include a careful and complete physical examination with signs such as nonimmune hydrops, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, rhinitis, skin rash, and pseudoparalysis, and further evaluation may include a complete blood count and differential and platelet count, long bone radiographs, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for VDRL, cell count, and protein; a positive CSF VDRL test, elevated CSF protein, and/or elevated CSF white blood cell count without other causes may be due to congenital syphilis. For diagnosis of acquired syphilis, a reactive nontreponemal test must be confirmed by a specific treponemal test such as FTA-ABS or TP-PA, treponemal tests usually remain positive for life even with successful treatment, the prozone phenomenon is more common in HIV-infected patients, and treponemal antibody titers do not correlate with disease activity and should not be used to monitor treatment response.

### Clinical prediction and diagnosis of neurosyphilis in HIV-infected patients with early syphilis [^111TzmDx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of neurosyphilis (NS) is a challenge, especially in HIV-infected patients, and the criteria for deciding when to perform a lumbar puncture (LP) in HIV-infected patients with syphilis are controversial. We retrospectively reviewed demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 122 cases of HIV-infected patients with documented early syphilis who underwent an LP to rule out NS, and we evaluated 3 laboratory-developed validated real-time PCR assays, the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay, the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) assay, and the line immunoassay INNO-LIA Syphilis, for the diagnosis of NS from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of these patients. NS was defined by a reactive CSF-VDRL test result and/or a CSF white blood cell (WBC) count of > 20 cells/μl. Thirty of the 122 patients (24.6%) had early NS. Headache, visual symptoms, a CD4 cell count of < 500 cells/μl, and viremia, as defined by an HIV-1 RNA count of ≥ 50 copies/ml, were associated with NS in multivariate analysis (P = < 0.001 for each factor). Blood serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titers were not associated with early NS (P = 0.575). For the diagnosis of NS, the PCR, FTA-ABS, TPPA, and INNO-LIA assays had sensitivities of 58%, 100%, 68%, and 100%, specificities of 67%, 12%, 49%, and 13%, and negative predictive values of 85%, 100%, 84%, and 100%, respectively. Visual disturbances, headache, uncontrolled HIV-1 viremia, and a CD4 cell count of < 500 cells/μl were predictors of NS in HIV-infected patients with early syphilis, while blood serum RPR titers were not; therefore, RPR titers should not be used as the sole criterion for deciding whether to perform an LP in early syphilis. When applied to CSF samples, the INNO-LIA Syphilis assay easily helped rule out NS.

### Comparison of six automated Treponema-Specific antibody assays [^116S5sVg]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Six different Treponema (TP)-specific immunoassays were compared to the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test. A total of 615 samples were tested. The overall percent agreement, analytical sensitivity, and analytical specificity of each assay compared to the FTA-ABS test were as follows: Architect Syphilis TP, 99.2%, 96.8%, and 100%; Cobas Syphilis, 99.8%, 99.4%, and 100%; ADVIA Centaur Syphilis, 99.8%, 99.4%, and 100%; HISCL Anti-TP assay kit, 99.7%, 98.7%, and 100%; Immunoticles Auto3 TP, 99.0%, 97.5%, and 99.6%; Mediace TPLA, 98.0%, 98.1%, and 98.0%. All results that were discrepant between the TP-specific assays were associated with samples from noninfectious cases (11 immunoassay false positives and 7 from previous syphilis cases). Our study demonstrated that TP-specific immunoassays generally showed high sensitivities, specificities, and percentages of agreement compared to FTA-ABS, with rare cases of false-positive or false-negative results. Therefore, most TP-specific immunoassays are acceptable for use in screening for syphilis. However, it is important to perform a thorough review of a patient's clinical and treatment history for interpreting the results of syphilis serology.

### Syphilis predicts HIV incidence among men and transgender women who have sex with men in a preexposure prophylaxis trial [^114eZybQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Participants diagnosed with prevalent and incident syphilis (see definitions below) were treated in accordance with local guidelines, or if not available, according to the 2006 sexually transmitted disease guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Evaluation and treatment were managed by the local treating physician under the supervision of the site investigator. Each incident case was also reviewed by a studywide clinical monitoring committee to ensure that appropriate guidance for clinical management was provided.

Definitions

At screening, we examined the number of participants with a positive RPR result and a positive confirmatory test, which was defined as syphilis prevalence. Patients newly diagnosed with syphilis were treated and their serological response was subsequently monitored. At follow-up, incident syphilis was defined as (1) a change in serology from negative to positive with confirmation by FTA-ABS, or (2) at least a 4-fold increase in serological titer from prior test with documentation of prior treatment appropriate for the stage of syphilis.

Person-time was calculated for participants with incident syphilis as time between enrollment and first episode and for HIV as the time between enrollment and first evidence of HIV infection. For participants without syphilis, person-time was calculated as years between enrollment and the date of last syphilis test. Those with confirmed syphilis at screening without clear documentation of prior effective treatment were treated and were excluded from the analysis of syphilis incidence, unless clear documentation of prior effective treatment was available.

Detected drug was defined as the detection of FTC or TDF in plasma or FTC-TP or TFV-DP in PBMCs regardless of level.

### Pruritic, erythematous, arcuate, and serpiginous smooth plaques [^112R8QUn]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which lab test can be used to monitor treatment response?
A. Rapid plasma reagin
B. Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS)
C. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels
D. Treponema pallidum enzyme immunoassay (IgG)
E. Chemiluminescence immunoassay

Answers:

A. Rapid plasma regain – Correct. Nontreponemal tests such as rapid plasma regain, venereal disease research laboratory, and toluidine red unheated serum tests are traditionally used as initial screening tests but also as the main way of monitoring a patient's response to treatment due to their quantitative results. Successful therapy will be indicated by a decline in antibody titers.
B. FTA-ABS – Incorrect. FTA-ABS is a qualitative treponemal test, thus providing no useful tracking of treatment response. The FTA-ABS assay is thought to be most sensitive in primary syphilis.
C. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels – Incorrect. Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels correlate with disease severity and activity in response to treatment in sarcoidosis, not syphilis.
D. Treponema pallidum enzyme immunoassay (IgG) – Incorrect. The T. pallidum enzyme immunoassay is also a treponemal test that has become a favorite of large laboratories as a screening test due to its lower cost compared with the others.
E. Chemiluminescence immunoassay – Incorrect. The chemiluminescence immunoassay is also a treponemal test. All treponemal tests are based upon the detection of antibodies directed against specific treponemal antigens and thus tend to be more specific than nontreponemal tests.

### Performance assessment of treponemal and nontreponemal tests for the diagnosis of acquired syphilis [^114YLQYC]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT.

There are a variety of nontreponemal test (NTT) and treponemal test (TT) kits for the serologic diagnosis of syphilis. Because of the complexity of the infection (multiple clinical stages) and the different antigens used in these kits, a systematic evaluation of the accuracy of the currently available commercial tests is warranted. Our objective was to evaluate the performance of commercially available tests for the diagnosis of syphilis infection. In this study, we analyzed one NTT (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] test, Wiener Laboratories, Rosario, Argentina) and two TTs (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS] test, Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany, and syphilis recombinant ELISA v. 4.0 test [ELISA], Wiener Laboratories, Rosario, Argentina) using a panel of 187 samples, including serum samples from 31 individuals with primary syphilis, 77 with secondary syphilis, and 79 with latent syphilis. An additional 192 samples from uninfected individuals and 323 serum samples from individuals with other diseases were included. The sensitivities of the VDRL, ELISA, and FTA-ABS tests were 97.9%, 100%, and 96.3%, respectively. The VDRL and ELISA tests showed a specificity of 100%, and the FTA-ABS test showed a specificity of 99.5%. Accuracy was 98.9% for the VDRL test, 100% for the ELISA, and 97.9% for the FTA-ABS test. For primary, secondary, and latent syphilis, the ELISA achieved a diagnostic performance of 100%, whereas the sensitivity for the VDRL and FTA-ABS tests ranged from 96.8% to 98.7% and 93.7% to 98.7%, respectively. No difference was observed when the tests were used as traditional or reverse algorithms. In general, all three tests are able to discriminate positive and negative samples for syphilis, regardless of the diagnostic algorithm.

### A 14-year retrospective clinical analysis of ocular manifestations of syphilis in a Portuguese tertiary center [^111UhFPy]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the frequent co-infection of HIV-syphilis and the often-associated ocular involvement, it should be systematically sought. In our study, 21.3% of patients also had HIV co-infection. The association between HIV status and ocular segment involvement has been analyzed in previous case series with a suggestion that HIV positive patients tend to present with predominantly posterior segment involvement, that goes along with our findings. It is possible that posterior segment involvement in ocular syphilis is not solely associated with positive HIV status but may also be influenced by the degree of immunosuppression. Our study did not identify significant differences between seropositive and seronegative patients regarding visual acuity recovery or cerebrospinal fluid involvement, likely due to the moderate sample size. The literature presents divergent perspectives on this matter: some indicate seropositivity as a potential prognostic factor for poorer outcomes, while others attribute this variation to consistent patient monitoring and early intervention before symptom manifestation. The presentation of ocular syphilis heralded diagnosis of HIV in one patient of our cohort.

Darkfield microscopy and PCR tests, which directly identify Treponema pallidum from lesion exudate or tissue, or in the aqueous humor, are definitive for early syphilis diagnosis. Despite this, serological testing remains the primary method for most diagnoses. A presumptive diagnosis involves using two types of serological tests: nontreponemal and treponemal tests. Nontreponemal tests, such as the VDRL and RPR tests, detect antibodies against cardiolipin, a membrane phospholipid. These tests are quick, straightforward, and cost-effective but lack specificity for syphilis, leading to potential false positives and negatives. They are valuable for assessing disease activity, and serial testing is useful for monitoring the response to antibiotic therapy. Post-treatment, titres usually decrease and may become non-reactive or remain very low. Treponemal tests, including FTA-ABS and TP-PA, detect syphilis-specific antibodies that remain positive for life. While these tests are effective for confirming a diagnosis, they are not suitable for assessing treatment response.

### Congenital syphilis: refining newborn evaluation and management in shenzhen, Southern China [^116pGvMC]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Consistent definitions of congenital syphilis are critical for determining true incidences and setting up targets of elimination. This study aimed to assess the evaluation and management of infants at high risk of congenital syphilis with an antenatal syphilis-screening programme in the Shenzhen SEZ and to develop feasible definitions for the detection of congenital syphilis in China.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted of all standardised records of pregnant women with positive syphilis between 2003 and 2007. Infants at high risk of congenital syphilis were evaluated by laboratory tests at birth and longitudinal follow-up. A screening test-positive congenital syphilis case was defined based on a positive 19S-IgM-FTA-ABS result at birth. Assuming that 19S-IgM-FTA-ABS was the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the ascertainment methods were calculated.

Results

During the study period, 1010 live infants were born to women with active syphilis during pregnancy. 19S-IgM-FTA-ABS detected 42 screening-positive congenital syphilis cases and another nine cases were identified by longitudinal follow-up only. Using 19S-IgM-FTA-ABS as the gold standard, 'fourfold rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titres' had the highest sensitivity and specificity compared with the other two follow-up methods.

Discussion

19S-IgM-FTA-ABS makes congenital syphilis case classification simpler and faster for newborns. In areas where 19S-IgM-FTA-ABS is not available, comparing newborn RPR titres with maternal titres can be an alternative method. Meanwhile, positive follow-up results act as treatment indicators for older infants. As congenital syphilis definitions vary over the country, the Shenzhen programme suggested a practical model for surveillance and treatment in areas with or without available 19S-IgM-FTA-ABS testing.

Serologic Tests for Congenital Syphilis

Passive transfer of maternal antibody can cause positive treponemal test results in neonates and infants for > 1 year. Performing a treponemal test (i.e. TPPA, FTA-ABS, or immunoassay) on neonatal serum is not currently recommended because interpreting these results is difficult. Although studies have found good correlation between IgM FTA-ABS or ELISA and clinical congenital syphilis findings or other reactive serology in neonates, these studies were not performed with commercially available IgM tests. No IgM test is recommended to aid in the diagnosis of congenital syphilis. Quantitative nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests (e.g. RPR or VDRL) are recommended for use in newborns born to mothers with positive syphilis serologies during pregnancy. Nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests should be performed on serum and not umbilical cord blood because umbilical cord blood can become contaminated with maternal blood and yield a false-positive result, and Wharton's jelly within the umbilical cord can yield a false-negative result. The same nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) test should be used for the infant that was used for the mother at delivery so titer levels can be compared.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: a retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^112eipdK]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Other approaches to confirmatory treponemal antibody testing include the use of a secondary immunoassay. A recent study by Cheng et al. described the use of sequential treponemal immunoassays in blood donors. In this large study of 1,767,782 blood donor samples over a 2-year period, 1,850 samples were reactive on the Alinity s CMIA, with 1,456 of those non-reactive on the secondary treponemal assay, the Elecsys ECLIA. This was determined as a presumed Alinity false-positive rate of 0.08%; however, TPPA, RPR, and FTA-Ab testing were not performed on these samples, nor were clinical syphilis infection data or results of repeat testing reported for these individuals. Importantly, this change was implemented after an initial pilot where testing of 129 samples on the two different treponemal immunoassays was performed. In this smaller study, 105 samples had a discordant result (reactive Alinity s CMIA and non-reactive Elecsys ECLIA). Of these, 92.3% were determined to be false-positive Alinity results and 7.6% were determined to have likely syphilis infection based on reactive TPPA or FTA-Abs. Although this study demonstrates the feasibility of sequential treponemal immunoassay screening in the blood donor population, questions remain about the sensitivity and specificity of this approach for clinical diagnostic testing, particularly in populations with a high pre-test probability of syphilis infection, such as the STI clinic population.

In conclusion, our evaluation studies showed that the prototype TP-IgA has met the WHO TPP performance criteria for a POCT for confirmatory diagnosis of active syphilis infections. The test demonstrated its potential utility as an accurate confirmatory test when used in combination with a treponemal total antibody-screening test. Further study is warranted to assess diagnostic performance of the final manufactured test as well as its clinical utility in real world settings.

### Field evaluation of the performance and testing costs of a rapid point-of-care test for syphilis in a red-light district of manaus, Brazil [^116nMCoC]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the performance, usefulness and cost of a rapid treponemal antibody assay (VisiTect Syphilis) to detect syphilis in high risk populations.

Methods

People who attended STI clinics in Manaus, Brazil, were screened for syphilis using the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-Abs) test and a non-treponemal test (Venereal Diseases Research Laboratory (VDRL)), and for HIV. Finger prick blood samples were tested with VisiTect Syphilis. The rapid test was evaluated against the reference FTA-Abs and for its usefulness in detecting active syphilis (FTA-Abs and VDRL positive). Operational performance was assessed through providers' and patients' interviews. An economic evaluation was conducted from the provider's perspective.

Results

510 patients (60% men) were enrolled, of whom 13 (2.5%) were HIV-1 seropositive. Syphilis prevalence (FTA-Abs) was 18% and active syphilis prevalence was 7.5%. 11% (57/506) of samples were positive by VisiTect. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of VisiTect Syphilis were 57% (95% CI 45.8 to 66.7), 99% (95% CI 97.0 to 99.6), 91% (95% CI 80.0 to 96.7) and 91% (95% CI 88.0 to 93.5), respectively. VisiTect Syphilis identified 79% (30/38) of active syphilis cases. The cost per case of syphilis was $16.8 for VDRL, $33.2 for low cost and $56.3 for high cost VisiTect Syphilis; the cost per case of active syphilis was $21.3, $57.5 and $97.6, respectively. Patients identified finger prick pain and preference for venous blood collection as minor barriers to test use.

Conclusion

VisiTect Syphilis had low sensitivity in field use and was less cost effective than conventional VDRL. However, rapid and correct identification of a high proportion of active syphilis cases combined with operational characteristics suggest a role in high risk populations.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: a retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^1157yCrH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Importantly, the majority of samples with an initial reactive result using the NewBio TPHA remained reactive on repeat testing. In our study, only a single sample was discordant with the initial reactive NewBio TPHA results on repeat testing. This sample was T. pallidum CLIA non-reactive (s/co < 0.10; TPPA non-reactive), with this discordance triggering repeat testing according to local testing protocols. These data suggest that local modification of the NewBio TPHA testing protocol from the IFU may be possible, with the omission of the requirement to perform repeat testing for reactive samples when using the assay for confirmatory testing of T. pallidum CLIA reactive samples. This protocol modification would substantially improve laboratory efficiency and result turnaround time.

The TPPA has been demonstrated to be highly sensitive and specific for T. pallidum infection. The sensitivity and specificity of the commercial TPHAs described in our study are similar to the performance characteristics of the TPPA described in a large laboratory evaluation by Park et al. that determined clinical syphilis status and compared the TPPA with five treponemal immunoassays and the fluorescent treponemal antibody (FTA-Ab) assay. This evaluation comprised samples from 262 individuals with active untreated syphilis, 294 samples from individuals with prior syphilis, and 403 from those without syphilis. The sensitivity and specificity of the TPPA were 95.4% and 100%, respectively, with the sensitivity and specificity of the alternative immunoassays reported between 96.9–98.5% and 82.6–98.5%, respectively. Although agglutination assays are manual tests, they are simple to perform, do not require specific instrumentation and can be used with a low sample input volume. They are also more specific and less subjective than alternative treponemal assays, such as the FTA-Ab assay.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111R19Yy]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Neurosyphilis diagnosis in persons with HIV infection — no single test can diagnose neurosyphilis, and the diagnosis depends on a combination of CSF tests (CSF cell count or protein, and a CSF-VDRL) with reactive serologic results and neurologic signs and symptoms. CSF findings can include mononuclear pleocytosis (6–200 cells/mm³), mildly elevated protein concentration, or a reactive CSF-VDRL; among persons with HIV infection, the CSF leukocyte count can be elevated (> 5 white blood count [WBC]/mm³) and using a higher cutoff (> 20 WBC/mm³) might improve specificity. In persons with neurologic signs or symptoms, a reactive CSF-VDRL (in a specimen not contaminated with blood) is considered diagnostic, and if the CSF-VDRL is negative but serologies are reactive, CSF cell count or protein are abnormal, and clinical signs or neurologic involvement are present, treatment for neurosyphilis is recommended. If signs and symptoms are nonspecific, FTA-ABS testing on CSF can be considered; the CSF FTA-ABS test is less specific than the CSF-VDRL but is highly sensitive, and neurosyphilis is unlikely with a negative CSF FTA-ABS in the absence of specific neurological signs and symptoms. RPR tests on the CSF are not recommended because of a high false negative rate, and PCR-based diagnostic methods are not currently recommended as diagnostic tests for neurosyphilis. CSF laboratory abnormalities are associated with CD4 counts ≤ 350 cells/mm³ or with RPR titers ≥ 1:32, but unless neurologic signs and symptoms are present, a CSF examination has not been associated with improved clinical outcomes.

### Clinical development and performance of the first to know syphilis self-test for over-the-counter usage: arapid test for treponemal antibody [^1169G9Ap]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The resurgence of syphilis in the United States and globally has hastened the need for widely available syphilis testing. Early detection of syphilis is crucial for avoiding serious clinical complications and preventing the spread of infection. Self-tests enhance access to testing and promote timely treatment for positive cases. Herein, we describe the performance of First to Know Syphilis Test (FTK), the first over-the-counter (OTC) treponemal test. A prospective multi-site clinical study with 1,270 subjects was conducted, where subjects self-collected fingerstick capillary blood and self-tested without assistance. FTK test results were compared with a composite reference standard to evaluate the diagnostic performance. The FTK test exhibited an overall sensitivity of 93.4% (95% CI, 87.0% to 96.8%) and specificity of 99.5% (95% CI, 98.9% to 99.8%) and accuracy of 99%. The overall agreement was 98.9%, with Cohen's Kappa (ⱪ) value 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90 to 0.97) showing excellent agreement between the reference standard and FTK results. In addition, the test was validated in a panel of 125 clinically staged syphilis patient samples, and the results showed 100% agreement in detecting anti-treponemal antibodies in all the samples. These data show excellent performance of the FTK Test, demonstrating its utility in the screening and diagnosis of syphilis. The availability of this OTC test and its excellent performance will have a profound impact on syphilis detection and prevention strategies and could reduce comorbidities such as HIV and transmission of other STIs.

Importance

The resurgence of syphilis in the United States and globally underscores the urgent need for rapid, accessible testing. The First To Know Syphilis Test, as the first at-home, over-the-counter (OTC) test for syphilis, represents a significant breakthrough in rapid diagnostics for increased access to testing and support early diagnosis and treatment. The FTK test demonstrated excellent overall clinical performance, with 93.4% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity, confirming its reliability for syphilis detection. This novel, easy-to-use OTC syphilis test allows individuals to privately test at home and can promote testing among those hesitant or unable to seek traditional healthcare, reducing barriers like stigma and limited access. The availability of this OTC test will have a significant impact on syphilis detection and prevention strategies and reduction of comorbidities such as HIV.

### Effectiveness and tolerability of oral amoxicillin in pregnant women with active syphilis, Japan, 2010–2018 [^112W5cpA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Definitions

We defined CS following the reporting criteria set by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare. Diagnosis of CS in newborns required fulfillment of any 1 of the following criteria: serum RPR titer > 4-fold that of the mother's; fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test result positive for serum IgM; lesion tissue or body fluid samples positive by PCR; lesion or fluid samples positive for T. pallidum on dark field microscopy; or physical examination findings consistent with CS, such as nonimmune hydrops, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, skin rash, pseudoparalysis, and rhinitis. We classified the mother's stage of syphilis into early syphilis (primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis) and late syphilis (late latent syphilis or latent syphilis of unknown duration). We defined early latent syphilis as asymptomatic syphilis that could be linked to reported syphilis symptoms, a sexual exposure, or conversion from a prior negative syphilis test < 1 year after diagnosis. These criteria occurring > 1 year after diagnosis constituted a late latent case and at an undefined time point after diagnosis as a latent case of unknown duration. We defined miscarriage as the loss of a fetus before week 20 of pregnancy and stillbirth as the loss during or after week 20.

### Evaluation of a rapid one-step immunochromatographic test and two immunoenzymatic assays for the detection of anti-Treponema pallidum antibodies [^116dvvJY]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The control of syphilis depends on screening of the population at risk and is usually performed using the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test (TPPA). Outside Europe the rapid plasma reagin test (RPR) or venereal disease research laboratory test is most often used for screening purposes. Because of the drawbacks in current diagnostic procedures, ie, long turnaround time, the need is felt for a rapid and simple test that can potentially be performed on whole blood.

Objective and Study Design

In this study a one-step immunochromatographic test (Biorapid Syphilis) and two ELISA, the Bioelisa Syphilis 3.0 and ETI-Treponema Plus, were evaluated.

Methods

Serum samples were collected between February 2000 and May 2006 at the University Hospital in Maastricht, The Netherlands. 145 TPPA-positive sera, confirmed by fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-Abs, treponemal test) and/or RPR (non-treponemal) were included. Furthermore, 41 sera from healthy controls and 144 TPPA-negative sera from controls with underlying conditions that might interfere with T pallidum serology were collected.

Results

The sensitivity and specificity of the Biorapid Syphilis, Bioelisa Syphilis 3.0 and ETI-Treponema Plus were 92% and 79%, 100% and 100% and 100% and 100%, respectively, with our selected sera.

Conclusions

The performance of both ELISA was excellent in our study and is favoured over the TPPA because of its ability to be run on an automated system. The sensitivity and specificity of the Biorapid Syphilis were considered too low to implement the test in a hospital laboratory in a developed country but it might be useful in primary healthcare settings in developing countries.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^111unL8V]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Data are limited on the use of CSF TPPA in public health and commercial laboratories, and no studies have been published on the performance of automated treponemal immunoassays in CSF. For CSF TPPA, three studies reported sensitivities of 75.6%–95.0%; the highest sensitivities ranged from 83.3% to 95.0% when a reactive CSF-VDRL was the reference standard for neurosyphilis. CSF TPPA specificity increased from 75.6% to 93.9% with increasing CSF TPPA titers from ≥ 1:160 to ≥ 1:640, respectively, when neurosyphilis was defined as a reactive CSF-VDRL or as new vision or hearing loss (Supplementary Table 5). On the basis of these limited data, CSF TPPA might have similar sensitivity performance to CSF FTA-ABS in studies of patients with definitive or presumptive symptomatic neurosyphilis. However, further studies on CSF TPPA test performance and titers are needed before this treponemal test can be recommended for off-label use in unique clinical situations to aid in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis.

CSF Antibody Tests for Ocular Syphilis and Otosyphilis

Ocular syphilis and otosyphilis diagnoses are difficult, and data are limited on CSF nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) and treponemal test performance in these clinical scenarios. Existing studies are largely retrospective with small sample sizes (< 50) and use of CSF VDRL testing, with low sensitivity for both ocular syphilis (< 50%) and otosyphilis (< 10%) when compared with clinical manifestations and serological evidence of syphilis as reference standards. CDC's Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines, 2021 state that CSF analysis, including a cell count, protein determination, and CSF-VDRL, might be helpful in diagnosis of suspected ocular syphilis for patients without neurologic symptoms and no evidence of ocular infection on examination; however, it is not recommended in suspected otosyphilis among persons with isolated auditory symptoms and a normal neurologic examination.

No published data are available on CSF treponemal test performance in ocular syphilis, and limited studies of CSF treponemal tests in patients with otosyphilis include insufficient sample sizes and unsuitable reference standards. No CSF treponemal tests are recommended for off-label use in patients with suspected ocular syphilis or otosyphilis and no symptoms or signs suggestive of neurosyphilis.

Generally, inconclusive results arise in early infection or from waning antibody levels in late infection. The most common combinations are:

A positive RPR with negative treponemal screening (EIA/CLIA) and confirmatory tests (TPPA) suggests the RPR result is a false positive
A positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with negative confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR is likely a false positive but could indicate early infection
A positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with indeterminant confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR could represent waning antibody levels after a previous, treated infection or a new infection.

When results are inconclusive, clinicians should inquire about previous syphilis infection and treatment, and, if early syphilis is possible, retest in two to four weeks. If results are unchanged, interpretation is based on history — consider the possibility of late untreated infection, treated infection, or non-venereal treponemal disease in adults from endemic countries in South and Central America, South-East Asia, and Africa.

### Syphilis prevalence has rapidly decreased in south Korea [^113XwHbX]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the current prevalence of syphilis in the general population of South Korea and its trend over the past 20 years.

Methods

15,402 adults, who all were aged over 20 (6888 blood donors, 4951 physical examinees, and 3563 pregnant women) were examined from January 1999 to December 2000. All subjects were screened using a VDRL test, and positive results were confirmed by a FTA-ABS test. The prevalence was compared with the results of previous surveys in similar population groups performed by same authors.

Results

The prevalence of syphilis in South Korea was found to be 0.2%. Although has been consistent decreasing trend since 1977 (p < 0.0001), there is no statistical difference between 1995 and 2000 (p = 0.6992).

Conclusions

The prevalence of syphilis has decreased significantly since 1977. However, it has not reduced much since 1995, and it seems that the prevalence has reached a plateau. Until now, not all syphilis patients were registered and followed up by the public health centres because there were so many syphilis patients. However, as this survey shows, the number of syphilis patients has reduced a great deal and it is believed that a more thorough management strategy including all newly diagnosed patients is necessary in order to further reduce the prevalence of syphilis in South Korea.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116VypNP]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV neurosyphilis diagnostic evaluation — cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing should be interpreted with clinical context: the diagnosis "depends on a combination of CSF tests (CSF cell count, CSF protein, and CSF-VDRL) in the setting of reactive serologic test results and neurologic signs and symptoms". CSF may show mononuclear pleocytosis "6–200 cells/mm³", and among people with HIV the CSF leukocyte count can be elevated "(> 5 white blood cell count [WBC]/mm³); using a higher cutoff (> 20 WBC/mm³) may improve the specificity of neurosyphilis diagnosis". In symptomatic people, "a reactive CSF-VDRL (in a specimen not contaminated with blood) is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis" but has "very low sensitivity", so neurosyphilis should be considered even when CSF-VDRL is negative in the presence of "reactive serologic test results, lymphocytic pleocytosis, or elevated protein", and "additional evaluation by using FTA-ABS or TP-PA testing on CSF might be warranted". CSF FTA-ABS "is less specific" but "is highly sensitive", fewer data exist for CSF TP-PA though "the sensitivity and specificity appears similar to the CSF FTA-ABS", and "Neurosyphilis is highly unlikely with a negative CSF FTA-ABS or TP-PA test". RPR tests of CSF "have been associated with a high false-negative rate and are not recommended", and "PCR-based diagnostic methods are not currently recommended as diagnostic tests for neurosyphilis"; moreover, "a CSF examination has not been associated with improved clinical outcomes".

### Clinical test performance of a rapid point-of-care syphilis treponemal antibody test: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111TJ9wY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Syphilis, caused by infection with the bacterium Treponema pallidum, is a re-emerging public health problem that can lead to significant complications if left untreated. In addition, syphilis has been demonstrated to facilitate human immunodeficiency virus acquisition and transmission. In the United States, syphilis rates have increased nearly every year since 2000. In 2017, the rate was 9.5 per 100 000, the highest rate since 1993. While men who have sex with men account for the majority of cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the increases in syphilis incidence among women (up 155.6% between 2013 and 2017) are of significant concern due to the impact that syphilis can have on pregnant women and their fetuses.

Routine screening and early treatment are essential to reduce the burden and impact of this disease. Fortunately, syphilis is curable; generally, penicillin G is utilized to treat persons in all stages of syphilis. Congenital syphilis can be prevented by screening early in pregnancy, treating syphilis-infected pregnant women, and preventing reinfection.

Globally, over the past 15 years, rapid tests that can be used at the point-of-care have been developed that detect treponemal antibody using fingerstick whole-blood specimens. In global settings, rapid syphilis tests play an important role in prompt diagnosis. These tests can be performed without laboratory processing, at the point-of-care and while the patient waits, thus reducing the potential for loss to follow-up. With a shortened time to diagnosis, patients may be treated much more quickly, resulting in reduced complications from untreated infection as well as reducing the spread of syphilis to others. Most rapid tests that are available globally detect treponemal antibody and therefore cannot be used to determine if the infection is current and requires treatment. Testing with a nontreponemal test (anticardiolipin antibody test) is therefore still recommended in some settings to inform patient management. However, a nonreactive treponemal test may be useful to rapidly rule out syphilis.

### Discordant results from reverse sequence syphilis screening – five laboratories, United States, 2006–2010 [^114L4tPy]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

CDC recommends syphilis serologic screening with a nontreponemal test, such as the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, to identify persons with possible untreated infection; this screening is followed by confirmation using one of several treponemal tests. Recently, the availability of automatable treponemal enzyme and chemiluminescence immunoassays (EIA/CIA) has led some laboratories to adopt a reverse sequence of screening in which a treponemal EIA/CIA is performed first, followed by testing of reactive sera with a nontreponemal test. To better understand the performance of reverse sequence screening for syphilis, CDC analyzed data from five laboratories that used reverse sequence screening during 2006–2010. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that among sera reactive on initial screening with a treponemal EIA/CIA, 56.7% had a nonreactive RPR test. Among these discordant sera, 31.6% also were nonreactive by treponemal testing using Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed (FTA-ABS) tests. Among discordant sera, the rate of nonreactive confirmatory treponemal tests was 2.9 times higher in a population with low prevalence of syphilis, suggesting that the low-prevalence population had a higher percentage of false-positive test results. Although CDC continues to recommend the traditional algorithm with reactive nontreponemal tests confirmed by treponemal testing, in this report CDC offers additional recommendations if reverse sequence syphilis screening is used.

### Appraisal of vitreous syphilis antibody as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of syphilitic uveitis: a prospective case-control study [^112AiHjA]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the sensitivity and specificity of syphilis antibody tests in vitreous samples and to propose an algorithm using vitreous syphilis antibody as a supplementary test to confirm syphilitic uveitis (SU).

Methods

A prospective case-control study was conducted at the Retina and Uveitis Clinic from May 2017 to January 2020. Initially, patients were classified based on syphilis serology into group 1 (positive testing) and group 2 (negative testing). Group 1 was further divided into 2 subgroups (group 1A and 1B) depending on their relevant clinical manifestations and clinical improvement. Group 2 served as a control group.

Results

Thirty-eight patients were enrolled in the study: 14 in group 1A, 5 in group 1B, and 19 in group 2B. No patient was assigned to group 2A. All patients in group 1A, representing definite SU, completed syphilis test (rapid plasma reagin [RPR], enzyme immunoassay [EIA], and fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption [FTA-ABS]) for vitreous, and all vitreous samples yielded positive results. Of the 5 subjects in group 1B, 3 cases were considered to be not SU with different conditions, and 2 were indeterminate for SU. They presented with different features not typical of SU, and they had variable and fewer positive syphilis antibody responses. The most sensitive test for detecting syphilis antibodies in vitreous was EIA (90.9%), followed by RPR (80.0%) and FTA-ABS IgG (78.9%). EIA and FTA-ABS had the highest specificity, detecting 100% of the syphilis antibody.

Conclusions

Vitreous analysis of syphilis antibody can serve as a supplementary test to confirm SU in selected cases as the proposed algorithm.

### Syphilis testing in antenatal care: policies and practices among laboratories in the americas [^117BV1on]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

4 Discussion

The results of this survey of syphilis testing policies and practices among laboratories in the Americas region included data from 30 (86%) member states. Some areas of adequate capacity were identified: all 30 countries reported having national or regional reference laboratory capacity for syphilis testing. Additionally, at least one laboratory from each of the 30 reporting countries indicated the existence of a national algorithm for syphilis testing in ANC services. All responding laboratories had available staff trained in syphilis testing and most reported familiarity with basic QC strategies (e.g. use of standard operating procedures and daily controls). The turn-around times reported by the laboratories tended to be short.

The survey results also identified several service gaps and areas of concern. Less than half of the laboratories used RSTs, some to confirm positive non-treponemal test results, but most (including lower-level clinics where RSTs are most useful) within a traditional testing algorithm (non-treponemal test followed by a laboratory-based treponemal confirmatory test). Further, a handful of national or regional laboratories were using either a treponemal or a non-treponemal test alone, limiting the diagnostic accuracy of their syphilis test results. Additionally, of the laboratories using laboratory-based treponemal tests, many continued to use the FTA-ABS test despite the more cost-effective, less subjective, and higher-throughput consuming alternative tests available (e.g. TPPA, EIAs).

Relatively few laboratories serving lower-level health facilities were using RSTs in ANC settings, despite these greatly simplifying procedures and improving services in such settings. Most laboratories reported that testing was performed primarily by laboratory staff and not by health providers. The WHO promotes a qualitative non-treponemal screening test with confirmatory rapid treponemal tests as an efficient strategy in ANC clinics connected to laboratories. In ANC settings without laboratories, a rapid treponemal screening test performed by a health provider could allow syphilis-infected women to be identified and a first dose of penicillin to be administered at the clinic visit, thus ensuring prompt treatment of the fetus. In these cases, sending out a blood sample to a laboratory for a non-treponemal test would support the syphilis diagnosis and the provision of additional treatment for the woman and her partner. This approach would be more cost-effective and have a higher efficacy in protecting the fetus against adverse outcomes while minimizing the risks of syphilis complications for both the patient and her sexual partner.

### Evaluation of elecsys syphilis assay for routine and blood screening and detection of early infection [^115zAqKn]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Although it is typically considered an historic infection, the incidence of syphilis is increasing. In 2008, approximately 11 million new cases of infection were reported worldwide; from 2005 to 2013, the numbers of primary and secondary syphilis cases per year reported in the United States almost doubled and the annual rate increased from 2.9 to 5.3 cases per 100,000 population. In high-income countries, infection rates are specifically increasing among men who have sex with men, and high rates of HIV coinfection have also been documented. This reemergence warrants renewed attention to the strategies used for the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis.

In order to treat syphilis and to prevent its transmission, testing is a common component of prenatal, blood donor, organ donor, and STI screening. There are many diagnostic tests for syphilis available; however, a commonly accepted standard method is still lacking, and the algorithms used for initial screening and confirmation vary between countries.cannot be cultured in vitro, and direct swabbing and testing of a primary lesion for syphilis are often not possible, as primary lesions are apparent only for a short time and, depending on the location, may go unnoticed by the patient. As a result, the diagnosis of syphilis is usually based on serological methods and typically uses either a treponemal or nontreponemal test for primary screening. The result is subsequently confirmed by retesting, e.g. with an alternative treponemal test and a quantitative nontreponemal test. However, this is dependent on the diagnostic algorithm that is being followed. Guidelines currently leave decisions about which tests to use as first-line tests and as tests for confirmation to laboratories and/or clinicians. Historically, the traditional algorithm, which uses a nontreponemal test followed by a treponemal test, has been the standard in many parts of the world. However, the higher sensitivity of recently available enzyme- and chemiluminescence-based immunoassays and the ability to automate such treponemal tests has led to more widespread use of the reverse algorithm.

### Improving the coverage and accuracy of syphilis testing: the development of a novel rapid, point-of-care test for confirmatory testing of active syphilis infection and its early evaluation in China and South Africa [^1166UWnb]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Third, current treponemal serological tests for syphilis use native or recombinant Treponema pallidum antigens to detect IgM and IgG antibodies to treponemal components. They are more sensitive than non-treponemal tests for all stages of syphilis but cannot distinguish active from past-treated infection and therefore, cannot be used to monitor the effectiveness of syphilis treatment. Our study findings showed that the TP-IgA POCT is highly sensitive, able to distinguish between active and past infections and can potentially be used for monitoring treatment outcomes. It will also be of interest to determine the persistence of IgA antibodies in patients with non-venereal treponemal infections such as non-venereal trepanematoses, which may confound results especially in young subjects from endemic regions. These particular applications of the TP-IgA POCT, however, need to be further examined in prospective, longitudinal field studies with a final manufactured version of the device. Future studies should also evaluate diagnostic performance of the test for congenital syphilis and in individuals who have become reinfected as people with repeated episodes of syphilis (e.g. key population at high risk of STIs such as men who have sex with men) may have different immunological responses compared to those with initial infection.

The present studies have some limitations. First, for the China study we were unable to source the DPP tests to perform a head-to-head comparison with the TP-IgA POCT in identifying active and/or past/treated syphilis from a pool of pre-characterised stored plasma samples as originally planned. This makes us unable to draw conclusion on the potential advantage of the TP-IgA POCT compared to the DPP test in distinguishing between active syphilis and past/treated infections. Future study to directly compare the two tests for this purpose is needed. Second, for the South Africa study, there was a low prevalence of active and/or past/treated syphilis among the study population and no clinical data were collected so that the categorisation of syphilis status was solely based on serological tests, which introduces some uncertainty and limits the generalisation of study findings. Third, both studies were conducted in a laboratory environment with trained technical staff and using venous blood (either fresh or plasma) rather than finger-prick samples that would be more likely to be used in field settings. Therefore, future studies are needed to examine diagnostic accuracy of the TP-IgA POCT, as performed by health care worker in clinical settings, with different sample types.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Congenital syphilis diagnosis in neonates — The standard serologic tests for syphilis are based on measurement of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, and because IgG in an infant reflects transplacental passively transferred maternal antibody, interpretation of reactive serologic tests for infants is difficult; all infants born to women with reactive nontreponemal and treponemal test results should be evaluated with a quantitative nontreponemal test (e.g. Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] slide test, rapid plasma reagin [RPR], the automated reagin test) from the infant and compared with the same test done at the same laboratory on the mother's serum; umbilical cord specimens should not be tested because of potential maternal blood contamination; specific treponemal tests such as fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) and T. pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) are not necessary to evaluate congenital syphilis in the neonate; there is no commercially available IgM test recommended for diagnostic use; some laboratories use treponemal tests for initial screening and nontreponemal tests for confirmation of positive specimens, however such an approach with congenital syphilis has not been published.

Serological analyses

Blood samples were obtained from sedated immunized and RIT rabbits via ear bleeds at 3-week intervals; serum was stored at −20 °C until tested. VDRL slide flocculation and FTA-ABS analyses were performed blindly and as described in the Manual of Tests for Syphilis. The FTA-ABS test was performed using FTA-ABS IFA Test system (Zeus Scientific, Branchburg, NJ, USA) and goat anti-rabbit FITC IgG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd, Oakville, ON, Canada). The standard 1+ to 4+ FTA-ABS scale was used, where 1+ denotes the lowest reactivity and 4+ denotes the highest reactivity. Antibody titres against the antigen, Tp0751 (Cys24-Pro237), were obtained for the immunized rabbits (Supplementary Fig. 2) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay format. The 96-well NUNC Maxisorp plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON, Canada) were coated with 0.1 μg of recombinant Tp0751 (Cys24-Pro237), and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Rabbit serum was diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin up to 1:20,000. Goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd) was used as a secondary antibody in a 1:3,000 dilution, and binding was detected by using TMB (3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine) peroxidase substrate (KPL, Guelph, ON, Canada) and detecting absorbance at 600 nm with a Biotek Synergy HT (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON, Canada) plate reader. Serum reactivity for Im26, a Tp0751-immunized rabbit used for antibody production, was used as a standard; each individual rabbit was compared with Im26 to account for interexperiment variability.

### False-positive TPPA and TRUST syphilis test results in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome and monoclonal immunoglobulinaemia [^112vZ6Xe]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2022). Medium credibility.

A 56-year-old woman presented to our hospital service with headache and neck and shoulder pain. She was eventually diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and monoclonal immunoglobulinaemia of unknown significance (MGUS). The Treponema pallidum (TP) particle agglutination assay (TPPA) and syphilis toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST) were positive with TPPA 1:20 480 and TRUST 1:131 072. HIV and hepatitis tests were negative. Previous medical history included four miscarriages for unknown causes. No skin rash or other abnormalities suggestive of syphilis were observed. Her spouse was healthy and showed negative syphilis serology. There were no other partners. Based on a diagnosis of latent syphilis, she was given the recommended penicillin therapy. However, after three courses of treatment, the TRUST titre was 1:32 768, and the TPPA titre remained unchanged with 1:20 480. TP IgM was positive by immunoblotting, whereas ELISA IgG anti-TP assays (TP-ELISA) and the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test (FTA-ABS) and blood TP-nested PCR were negative. Further investigations showed a normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with negative TPPA and TRUST, and unremarkable brain MRI, abdominal ultrasound scan and Doppler echocardiography. Hence, we considered the possibility of false-positive syphilis TPPA and TRUST results associated with antiphospholipid syndrome and MGUS.

False-positive non-specific syphilis serology (TRUST/venereal disease research laboratory test) can be caused by various diseases, especially autoimmune diseases like antiphospholipid syndrome. In addition, plasma cell diseases such as multiple myeloma and macroglobulinaemia can lead to false-positive tests, but titres are usually low, and TP/specific tests (TPPA/TP-ELISA/FTA-ABS) are negative. Unusually in this case, both TPPA and TRUST titres were significantly higher than previously reported.

### Evaluation of INNO-LIA syphilis assay as a confirmatory test for syphilis [^116ucM4t]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of a new confirmatory test for treponemal antibodies, INNO-LIA Syphilis (Innogenetics NV, Ghent, Belgium), on a large number of sera from a clinical laboratory. This multiparameter line immunoassay (LIA) uses recombinant and synthetic polypeptide antigens derived from Treponema pallidum proteins. In a single-blinded cross-sectional retrospective study, 289 seronegative sera, 219 seropositive sera, and 23 sera with an indeterminate serological status for syphilis were analyzed. All sera were tested by the T. pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA), the immunoglobulin (IgG)-fluorescent T. pallidum absorption assay (IgG-FTA-ABS), and the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test. In addition, some seropositive samples were analyzed by the 19S-IgM-FTA-ABS test, an enzyme immunoassay (IgM-EIA), and the MarDx immunoblotting assay. Based on a consensus diagnosis derived from conventional serology, all of the sera were classified as positive, negative, or indeterminate, and the results were compared with the findings of the INNO-LIA Syphilis assay. The sensitivity and specificity of the LIA were 100% (219 of 219) and 99.3% (286 of 288), respectively. Compared to TPHA and IgG-FTA-ABS, the new test gave a significantly higher number (P = 0.021 and P < 0.0001, respectively) of correct results than either of the other two tests. The multiparameter INNO-LIA Syphilis assay is a useful confirmatory test for syphilis because it increases the reliability of syphilis diagnosis with respect to current conventional techniques.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for syphilis, more specifically with respect to management of treatment failure or reinfection, IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that a negative non-treponemal test can be obtained in a substantial number of (but not in all) patients treated for early syphilis after 1–2 years. Regard a negative non-treponemal test after treatment as the best confirmation of cure. Obtain a strict follow-up in patients with persistent low titers (≤ 4) in a non-treponemal test (serofast state), but regard these patients as successfully treated in the absence of ongoing risk. Consider performing CSF assessment to detect asymptomatic neurosyphilis in patients with persistent high titers of non-treponemal test (≥ 8).

3 Results

A total of 69 laboratorians from 30 (86%) of the 35 PAHO member states completed the survey (Table 1). Participating institutions were fairly equally distributed between larger national or regional reference laboratories (n = 36, 52%) and lower-level or local laboratories (n = 33, 48%) comprised of maternity hospital laboratories, private or public hospitals, and other primary or local health clinics. Most (94%) participating laboratories were public. Of the participating laboratories, 54 (78%) reported receiving specimens for syphilis testing from ANCs.

3.1. Types and use of syphilis tests and testing algorithms applied

The most common non-treponemal test used was the RPR, reported by 62% of laboratories (Table 2); 25 (39%) laboratories (46% of national/regional; 32% of lower-level) reported using only the RPR for non-treponemal testing, 20 (31%) used only the VDRL test for non-treponemal testing (30% of national/regional; 32% of lower-level laboratories), and 14 (22%) performed both RPR and VDRL. Four (6%) did not conduct any non-treponemal syphilis testing. For treponemal serological tests, FTA-ABS was the most commonly used single test by both national/regional (47%) and lower-level (33%) laboratories. Twenty-two laboratories (32%; 25% of national/regional and 39% of lower-level) reported that they used no laboratory-based treponemal test, although four of these reported using an RST.

### Correlation of treponemal immunoassay signal strength values with reactivity of confirmatory treponemal testing [^111me4Qj]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Automated treponemal immunoassays are used for syphilis screening with the reverse-sequence algorithm; discordant results (e.g., enzyme immunoassay [EIA] reactive and reactive plasma reagin [RPR] nonreactive) are resolved with a second treponemal test. We conducted a study to determine automated immunoassay signal strength values consistently correlating with reactive confirmatory treponemal testing. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of four automated immunoassays (BioPlex 2200 microbead immunoassay [MBIA], Liaison chemiluminescence immunoassay [CIA], Advia-Centaur CIA, and Trep-Sure EIA) and three manual assays (Treponema pallidum particle agglutination [TP-PA], fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS] test, and Inno-LIA line immunoassay). We compared signal strength values of automated immunoassays and positive and negative agreement. Among 1,995 specimens, 908 (45.5%) were true positives (≥ 4/7 tests reactive) and 1,087 (54.5%) were true negatives (≥ 4/7 tests nonreactive). Positive agreement ranged from 86.1% (83.7 to 88.2%) for FTA-ABS to 99.7% (99.0 to 99.9%) for Advia-Centaur CIA; negative agreement ranged from 86.3% (84.1 to 88.2%) for Trep-Sure EIA to 100% for TP-PA (99.6 to 100%). Increasing signal strength values correlated with increasing reactivity of confirmatory testing (P < 0.0001 for all automated immunoassays by Cochran-Armitage test for trend). All automated immunoassays had signal strength cutoffs corresponding to ≥ 4/7 reactive treponemal tests. BioPlex MBIA and Liaison CIA had signal strength cutoffs correlating with ≥ 99% and 100% TP-PA reactivity, respectively. The Advia-Centaur CIA and Trep-Sure EIA had signal strength cutoffs correlating with at least 95% TP-PA reactivity. All automated immunoassays had signal strength cutoffs correlating with at least 95% FTA-ABS reactivity. Assuming that a 95% level of confirmation is adequate, these signal strength values can be used in lieu of confirmatory testing with TP-PA and FTA-ABS.

CSF fluorescent treponemal antibody (FTA) reactivity and % CSF lymphocytes that were B cells in fresh and frozen samples were determined for 47 HIV-infected cases with syphilis and 26 HIV-infected controls. As for serum, CSF fluorescent treponemal antibody reactivity ≥ 2+ was considered positive. Based on the results in controls and cases with normal CSF measures, cut-offs for elevated CSF B cells were proposed to be ≥ 9% in fresh and ≥ 20% in frozen samples. Neurosyphilis was defined as a reactive CSF-VDRL.

Results

CSF-FTA-ABS (absorbed) and CSF-FTA (unabsorbed and undiluted) were 100% sensitive for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Elevated % CSF B cells in fresh and cryopreserved samples was specific (100%) but not sensitive (40 and 43%) in post hoc analyses. The results of CSF-FTA and assessment of % CSF B cells together allowed 16% of cases with pleocytosis but nonreactive CSF-VDRL to be diagnosed with neurosyphilis and 26% to be diagnosed as not having neurosyphilis.

Conclusion

When the CSF-VDRL is nonreactive, CSF-FTA and % CSF B cells may help exclude or establish the diagnosis of neurosyphilis.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for syphilis, more specifically with respect to management of treatment failure or reinfection, IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that the serological response of non-treponemal tests in late (latent) syphilis is often absent. Avoid obtaining follow-up after treatment in HIV-negative patients with late latent syphilis with a reactive non-treponemal test remaining stable in a low titer range.

Congenital syphilis — diagnosis in neonates and infants: The standard serologic tests for syphilis are based on measurement of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, and because IgG in an infant reflects transplacental passively transferred maternal antibody, interpretation of reactive serologic tests for infants is difficult; therefore the diagnosis of neonatal congenital syphilis depends on a combination of physical, laboratory, radiographic, and direct microscopic examinations. All infants born to women with reactive nontreponemal and treponemal test results should be evaluated with a quantitative nontreponemal test from the infant and compared with the same test done at the same laboratory on the mother's serum, and umbilical cord specimens should not be tested because of the potential for maternal blood contamination. Specific treponemal tests, such as fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) and T. pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA), are not necessary to evaluate congenital syphilis in the neonate, and there is no commercially available IgM test recommended for diagnostic use; some laboratories use treponemal tests for initial screening and nontreponemal tests for confirmation of positive specimens, but such an approach with congenital syphilis has not been published.

### Serodiagnosis of syphilis… [^112PCfNN]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test is as specific as, and much more sensitive than, the Treponema pallidum immobilization test. The FTA-ABS test may detect syphilis earlier than the venereal disease research laboratories test for syphilis, and it will rule out biologic false reactors with a high degree of accuracy. The FTA-ABS test likewise will permit the diagnosis of syphilis in many instances of late symptomatic syphilis which are nonreactive with routine reagin tests. Tests employing protein derived from the Reiter treponeme as antigen cause confusion because of lower sensitivity. The Kolmer test with Reiter protein Reiter protein complement fixation test should be considered obsolete with the present availability of the FTA-ABS test. Nicholas L. Serodiagnosis of Syphilis.

Diagnostic Considerations Darkfield examinations and molecular tests for detecting T. pallidum directly from lesion exudate or tissue are the definitive methods for diagnosing early syphilis and congenital syphilis. Although no T. pallidum direct-detection molecular NAATs are commercially available, certain laboratories provide locally developed and validated PCR tests for detecting T. pallidum DNA. Multiple studies demonstrate that high quantitative index values or high signal-to-cutoff ratio from treponemal EIA or CIA tests correlate with TP-PA positivity, which might eliminate the need for additional confirmatory testing; however, the range of index values varies among different treponemal immunoassays, and the values that correspond to high levels of reactivity with confirmatory testing might differ by immunoassay. If cranial nerve dysfunction is present, a CSF evaluation is needed. Among persons with isolated ocular symptoms, confirmed ocular abnormalities on examination, and reactive syphilis serology, a CSF examination is unnecessary before treatment. CSF analysis can be helpful in evaluating persons with ocular symptoms and reactive syphilis serology who do not have ocular findings or cranial nerve dysfunction on examination. Among patients with isolated auditory abnormalities and reactive syphilis serology, CSF evaluation is likely to be normal and is unnecessary before treatment or TP-PA testing on CSF might be warranted. The CSF FTA-ABS test is less specific for neurosyphilis than the CSF-VDRL but is highly sensitive.

Fewer data are available regarding CSF TP-PA; however, the sensitivity and specificity appear similar to the CSF FTA-ABS. Neurosyphilis is highly unlikely with a negative CSF FTA-ABS or TP-PA test, especially among persons with nonspecific neurologic signs and symptoms.

### Screening for syphilis infection in nonpregnant adults and… [^113LfWky]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

A. If the nontreponemal test is positive, you can conclude that R. J. has syphilis. B. If the nontreponemal test is positive, it must be followed with a confirmatory nontreponemal test. C. If the nontreponemal test is positive, it must be followed with a confirmatory treponemal antibody detection test. D. A nontreponemal test and a treponemal antibody test must be conducted at the same time. E. FTA-ABS or TPPA must be conducted first, followed by a confirmatory nontreponemal test. Which one of the following statements best reflects the benefits and harms of screening for syphilis. A. The net benefit of early detection and treatment with antibiotics is substantial and can prevent manifestation of late-stage disease and transmission to others. B.

There are no harms associated with screening and early detection. C. Screening all sexually active patients annually has the greatest benefit. D. Although there is a chance of false-positive results from screening, there is no harm in treatment with antibiotics.
2. The correct answer is C. There are a number of screening tests for syphilis. Commonly, a nontreponemal test is performed first, followed by a treponemal antibody test if the first nontreponemal test is positive.
3. The correct answer is A. Effective treatment with antibiotics can prevent progression to late-stage disease, as well as provide benefit at any stage of disease. The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the harms of screening for syphilis; however, potential harms include false-positive results, unnecessary anxiety, overtreatment, and known harms associated with antibiotic treatment.

### Performance of treponemal tests for the diagnosis of syphilis… [^112zVH1C]. stacks.cdc.gov (2019). Medium credibility.

Performance of treponemal tests for the diagnosis of syphilis Supporting Files March 05 2019 By Park, Ina U.; Fakile, Yetunde F.; Chow, Joan M. ;. File Language: English. Methods: We calculated sensitivity and specificity of seven treponemal assays: 1) ADVIA Centaur, 2) Bioplex 2200, 3) fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed. test, 4) INNO-LIA, 5) LIAISON CIA, 6) TP-PA, and 7) Trep-Sure, using a reference standard combining clinical diagnosis and serology results. Sera were collected between May 2012 to January 2013. Cases were characterized as: 1) current clinical diagnosis of syphilis: primary, secondary, early latent, late latent 2) prior treated syphilis only, 3) no evidence of current syphilis, no prior history of syphilis and at least 4/7 treponemal tests negative.

Results: Among 959 participants, 262 had current syphilis, 294 had prior syphilis, and 403 did not have syphilis. FTA-ABS was significantly less sensitive for primary syphilis, compared to the immunoassays or TP-PA. All immunoassays were 100% sensitive for secondary syphilis and 95. 2–100% sensitive for early latent disease, but were less sensitive in late latent disease. TP-PA had 100% specificity. Conclusion: Treponemal immunoassays demonstrated excellent sensitivity for early syphilis. Sensitivity of FTA-ABS in primary syphilis was poor compared to the immunoassays and TP-PA. Given its high specificity and superior sensitivity, TP-PA is a better test to adjudicate discordant results with the reverse sequence algorithm than the FTA-ABS.
