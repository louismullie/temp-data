## Question

When does hick up worries?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when hiccups should be considered worrisome and what actions to take based on duration, context, and associated features. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard classification by duration. Then, I should verify red flags that mandate urgent evaluation. Next, I will consider high-risk populations and medication triggers. After that, I need to review complications of persistent hiccups. Finally, I will outline a pragmatic diagnostic and treatment approach, including when to escalate to imaging, specialty referral, or procedural options.

> Let me first confirm the classification because duration frames risk and urgency. Acute hiccups last less than 48 hours, persistent hiccups exceed 48 hours, and intractable hiccups persist beyond one month; this schema is consistently used in oncology and supportive care literature and aligns with systematic reviews, so I should anchor on this framework to guide decisions.

> Wait, let me verify the immediate red flags that make even short-lived hiccups concerning. I need to ensure I flag cardiovascular, neurologic, and systemic emergencies: persistent hiccups as the sole or prominent symptom of acute myocardial infarction or cardiac tamponade have been reported, so chest pain, dyspnea, diaphoresis, or hypotension with hiccups warrants urgent cardiac evaluation; similarly, new focal deficits, severe headache, or altered mental status with hiccups raise concern for brainstem pathology; and in febrile or ill-appearing patients, hiccups can herald pneumonia, COVID-19, or even Ebola, so I should not dismiss them in infectious contexts [^1178vARY] [^117NnaLi] [^116wZEt8] [^112QRfrB] [^115RhEiH] [^115BAsiQ] [^117N2om5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should also consider high-risk populations where hiccups carry added significance. In cancer and palliative care, hiccups are common, often medication-related, and can impair nutrition, sleep, and treatment adherence; in stroke or neurorehabilitation, hiccups may reflect brainstem involvement; in pregnancy, while fetal hiccups are usually reassuring, maternal intractable hiccups warrant standard adult evaluation; and in older adults with vascular risk, atypical ischemic presentations including hiccups should be considered [^111jR5GP] [^112rDf2a] [^1138qcYU] [^112bz5uW] [^1178vARY].

> I should double-check medication triggers because removing the cause can be curative. Glucocorticoids, particularly dexamethasone, can provoke hiccups in a nontrivial minority; opioids and intrathecal morphine have also been implicated; and among chemotherapeutics, platinum agents are frequent culprits, so a careful drug history is essential before labeling hiccups idiopathic [^112Wg7JS] [^112AotvR].

> Next, I should review complications of persistent and intractable hiccups to quantify harm and justify intervention. Prolonged hiccups can cause dehydration, weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and even arrhythmias; they can interfere with ventilation during procedures, delay rehabilitation, and degrade quality of life substantially, which is why timely escalation beyond home remedies is reasonable when hiccups persist beyond 48 hours [^115o9w6U] [^1138qcYU] [^116SHbis] [^112rDf2a].

> Let me think about the diagnostic approach once hiccups persist beyond 48 hours. I should confirm a focused history and exam, review medications, and obtain basic labs including electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, and glucose; if there are cardiac or respiratory symptoms, I need an ECG and chest imaging; if neurologic signs are present or hiccups are intractable, brain MRI is indicated to evaluate for brainstem lesions including area postrema syndrome in NMOSD; and in the right clinical context, I should consider thoracic imaging for mediastinal or diaphragmatic processes irritating the phrenic nerve [^112rDf2a] [^112QDZVZ] [^113NFJHK] [^116wZEt8].

> I will now examine treatment sequencing, but wait, I should verify the evidence base because it is limited. For acute hiccups, physical maneuvers such as breath-holding, Valsalva, or a forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool (FISST/HiccAway) can be effective and are low risk; observational data suggest FISST stops hiccups in roughly 90% of cases, though randomized trials are needed, so I can offer it while acknowledging the evidence quality [^115q57e6] [^113tbQ5j] [^115sJvB7].

> For persistent hiccups beyond 48 hours, I should confirm initiation of pharmacotherapy guided by suspected mechanism and comorbidities. Baclofen, gabapentin, and metoclopramide are reasonable first-line agents; baclofen has the most contemporary real-world data suggesting about one-third achieve meaningful palliation, with better response in chronic cases, and it is FDA-recognized for this use; gabapentin has supportive case-series evidence and a favorable profile in frail patients; metoclopramide is preferred when a peripheral gastrointestinal driver is suspected; chlorpromazine remains the only FDA-approved agent for intractable hiccups and can be used orally or intramuscularly, but I need to monitor for sedation, hypotension, and extrapyramidal effects; if gastroesophageal reflux is suspected, a proton pump inhibitor is sensible; and in refractory cases, I should consider combination therapy or targeted interventions [^112LmBMn] [^116QwvDx] [^112rDf2a] [^111KnpSH] [^111VNoNi] [^117KVtDL] [^113xGabi] [^116dLNdU].

> But wait, what if medications fail or hiccups threaten critical care or surgical safety? In that scenario, I should verify procedural options: ultrasound-guided phrenic nerve block can rapidly terminate intractable hiccups, including intraoperatively, with attention to respiratory implications; vagus nerve stimulation has case-level evidence in select refractory cases; and in life-threatening metabolic decompensation with intractable hiccups, supportive ventilation and correction of the underlying crisis may be required, as illustrated in thyroid storm and DKA case reports [^115o9w6U] [^114375HZ] [^113grWJp] [^115daXcw] [^114xehM6].

> Let me reconsider special populations briefly to ensure I did not miss anything important. In NMOSD, intractable hiccups with or without nausea can herald an area postrema attack and should prompt urgent immunotherapy and MRI; in stroke rehabilitation, hiccups may reflect medullary involvement and respond to gabapentin or baclofen; and in cancer care, hiccups can be a treatment toxicity signal requiring oncologic review and supportive care integration [^112QDZVZ] [^116HeiiD] [^1138qcYU] [^112rDf2a].

> In summary, I should confirm that hiccups become worrisome when they are persistent beyond 48 hours, intractable beyond one month, or accompanied by red flags such as chest pain, dyspnea, fever, neurologic deficits, or altered mental status; they warrant heightened concern in patients with cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, or recent steroid exposure; and management should escalate from simple physical maneuvers to mechanism-targeted pharmacotherapy and, if refractory, procedural interventions, with a parallel search for underlying causes to prevent recurrence and morbidity [^111jR5GP] [^112vR4G9] [^112rDf2a] [^112LmBMn].

---

Hiccups are worrisome when they persist beyond **48 hours** (persistent) or last longer than **1 month** (intractable), as this can signal serious underlying conditions such as CNS or gastrointestinal disease, metabolic derangements, or medication effects [^1135F33x]. Persistent hiccups can cause **significant morbidity**, including dehydration, weight loss, insomnia, and respiratory complications, and may require medical evaluation and treatment [^115o9w6U]. Immediate medical attention is warranted if hiccups are accompanied by red flags such as chest pain, dyspnea, neurologic deficits, or severe fatigue, or if they occur in patients with cancer, recent surgery, or immunocompromise [^1178vARY] [^117NnaLi] [^116wZEt8] [^115o9w6U] [^112rDf2a].

## Duration-based classification and clinical significance

Hiccups are classified by duration, which correlates with **clinical significance** and the need for intervention:

| **Duration** | **Classification** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| < 48 hours | Acute | Usually benign and self-limited |
| 48 hours–1 month | Persistent | May indicate underlying pathology; warrants evaluation |
| > 1 month | Intractable | Strongly associated with serious disease; requires thorough investigation |

---

Persistent (> 48 hours) and intractable (> 1 month) hiccups are **clinically significant** and warrant further evaluation to identify and treat underlying causes [^112vR4G9].

---

## Underlying medical conditions associated with persistent hiccups

Persistent hiccups can be a symptom of various **underlying medical conditions**, including:

- **Central nervous system (CNS) disorders**: Stroke, brainstem lesions, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and intracranial tumors [^113NFJHK] [^116nsMed] [^112QRfrB].
- **Gastrointestinal disorders**: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophagitis, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, and hepatobiliary diseases [^113xGabi] [^115vWaJv].
- **Metabolic and endocrine disorders**: Diabetic ketoacidosis, thyroid storm, uremia, and electrolyte imbalances [^114XMYLd] [^113qYDCs].
- **Cardiovascular conditions**: Myocardial infarction, pericarditis, and cardiac tamponade [^1178vARY] [^117NnaLi].
- **Respiratory conditions**: Pneumonia, bronchitis, and pleurisy [^115RhEiH].
- **Medication-induced hiccups**: Corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone), benzodiazepines, opioids, and chemotherapy agents [^112Wg7JS] [^111jR5GP].

---

## Potential complications of persistent hiccups

Persistent hiccups can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance**: Due to impaired fluid intake and vomiting [^notfound].
- **Weight loss and malnutrition**: Resulting from difficulty eating and swallowing [^115o9w6U].
- **Insomnia and fatigue**: Due to repeated nocturnal hiccups [^115o9w6U].
- **Respiratory complications**: Including respiratory distress, aspiration pneumonia, and respiratory failure [^114XMYLd].
- **Psychological effects**: Anxiety, depression, and reduced quality of life [^114XMYLd].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend that persistent hiccups (> 48 hours) warrant **medical evaluation** to identify and treat underlying causes. Initial management includes non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. breath-holding, drinking cold water, vagal maneuvers) [^115q57e6] and pharmacological treatments such as baclofen, gabapentin, metoclopramide, and chlorpromazine [^112rDf2a] [^112LmBMn]. If hiccups persist despite medical therapy, interventional procedures such as phrenic nerve block or vagus nerve stimulation may be considered [^113grWJp] [^115zQSWr].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate medical attention

Immediate medical attention is warranted if hiccups are accompanied by any of the following **red flag symptoms**:

- **Chest pain or dyspnea**: Suggesting cardiovascular or respiratory involvement [^117NnaLi].
- **Neurological deficits**: Such as weakness, numbness, or altered consciousness [^112QRfrB].
- **Severe fatigue or weight loss**: Indicating significant systemic involvement [^115o9w6U].
- **Signs of respiratory distress**: Including cyanosis or respiratory failure [^114XMYLd].

---

## Patient populations at higher risk

Certain patient populations are at **higher risk** for serious underlying conditions if they experience persistent hiccups, including:

- **Patients with cancer**: Particularly those undergoing chemotherapy or with metastatic disease [^111jR5GP].
- **Patients with recent surgical procedures**: Especially thoracic or abdominal surgeries [^1135F33x].
- **Patients with immunocompromised states**: Including HIV/AIDS or immunosuppressive therapy [^notfound].

---

Hiccups are worrisome when they persist beyond **48 hours** or last longer than **1 month**, as this can indicate serious underlying medical conditions. Persistent hiccups can cause significant morbidity and complications, warranting medical evaluation and treatment. Immediate medical attention is required if hiccups are accompanied by red flag symptoms or occur in high-risk patient populations.

### Perspectives on the medical, quality of life, and economic consequences of hiccups [^116SHbis]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Singultus or hiccups (HU) is a common, usually temporary, event. Its potentially serious consequences are often overlooked. This review explores published evidence describing HU burden (clinical, economic, and quality of life [QoL] consequences) across patient populations.

Recent Findings

Literature review identified 81 articles (including 57 individual case reports). We extracted relevant information to better understand the burden of HU and to identify knowledge gaps for future study. HU are physiologic events that can complicate existing medical conditions and treatments regardless of duration. Relatively short episodes can have devastating consequences in patients who have pre-existing conditions. HU appear to impact physical and psychological health, diminish QoL, increase healthcare resource use, and increase costs. A better understanding of HU burden is needed.

### Management of hiccups in palliative care patients [^112rDf2a]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Persistent hiccups are a frustrating experience for palliative care patients, and can have a profound impact on their quality of life. This article provides an evidence-based approach overview of the causes and treatment of this not infrequently debilitating condition for such patients, with a management algorithm. In situations where no readily reversible cause is identified, or where simple physical manoeuvres, such as breath holding have failed, a systematic approach is required. Hiccups can be broadly divided into central and peripheral types. These respond differently to pharmacological intervention. The drug of choice for central causes of persistent hiccups is baclofen, with metoclopramide recommended as the first choice for peripheral causes. Midazolam may be useful in cases of terminal illness. Interventional procedures such as vagal or phrenic nerve block or stimulation should be considered in patients who are refractory to medications. The management of persistent hiccups still presents an ongoing clinical challenge however, requiring further research on pathophysiology and treatment strategies. Multinational randomised controlled trials to evaluate and compare both current and new medications or procedures to better manage this difficult condition are suggested as a means of reaching this goal.

### 'What puts the 'hic' into hiccups?' [^115q57e6]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Recurrent and persistent bouts of hiccups impact the quality of life by interfering with eating, social interaction and work. Popular home remedies, such as breath holding and drinking ice water, target activity in the vagal and phrenic nerves that are thought to trigger these repetitive, myoclonic contractions. However, the pathophysiology of hiccups and the mechanism by which any of these methods work are unclear. Indeed, so little is known that there is no agreement whether the 'Hic' sound is due to the abrupt closure of the epiglottis or the glottis, including the vocal cords. Investigations were performed in a 50-year-old, otherwise healthy male with recurrent hiccups, in whom contractions persisted for up to 4 hours. Hiccups were initiated by drinking carbonated soda. The aerodigestive tract was visualised by video fluoroscopy. Hiccups were terminated by drinking a non-viscous contrast agent through a forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool. This device requires significant suction pressure (-100 mm Hg) to draw fluid into the mouth and is effective in approximately 90% of cases. The images were analysed together with concurrent audio recordings to gain insight into 'what causes the 'hic' in hiccups' and how this commonplace but annoying problem can be treated.

### Patient-directed behavioral-physical interventions to alleviate acute hiccups associated with chemotherapy: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^111jR5GP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chemotherapy remains an important approach in cancer treatment, and hiccups are a common and clinically significant complication. However, they are often underestimated or underrecognized. Studies have shown that the incidence of hiccups after chemotherapy ranges from approximately 30–54% in patients with different cancer types or treatment regimens. This symptom not only affects patients' quality of life but may also interfere with the treatment process in some cases. Chemotherapy-associated hiccups can be classified as acute (lasting less than 48 h), persistent (lasting more than 48 h but less than a month), or refractory (lasting more than a month), with acute hiccups being particularly bothersome. One study also indicates that hiccups may occur outside the typical risk window, potentially affecting patients in the long term.

Currently, clinical interventions for acute hiccups in patients undergoing chemotherapy fall into two main categories: non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments. Non-pharmacological interventions are usually based on physical mechanisms or traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theories, aiming to relieve symptoms by stimulating specific nerves or muscle groups. In contrast, pharmacological treatments primarily act by modulating neurotransmitter levels or altering gastrointestinal motility. Systematic reviews and expert consensus recommend initiating management with non-pharmacological treatments for acute hiccups, escalating to pharmacological options if necessary. Despite the variety of available therapies, many are not consistently effective. Some pharmacological agents have notable side effects, limiting their use in vulnerable populations, such as chemotherapy patients. Moreover, there is a lack of high-quality clinical studies to support evidence-based recommendations.

In recent years, non-pharmacological behavioral-physical interventions have drawn growing attention for their potential to alleviate acute CIH. Preliminary studies have yielded promising results; however, further data are needed to confirm their efficacy and safety. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a patient-directed behavioral-physical intervention model for managing acute hiccups during chemotherapy.

### A randomized, double-blinded feasibility trial of educational materials for hiccups in chemotherapy-treated patients with cancer [^112FUHqN]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Chemotherapy can cause hiccups but few randomized controlled trials have focused on hiccups. This trial examined the feasibility of such research.

Methods

This single-institution, multi-site trial used phone recruitment for patients: (1) 18 years or older, (2) able to speak/read English, (3) with a working e-mail address, (4) with hiccups 4 weeks prior to contact, and (5) with ongoing oxaliplatin or cisplatin chemotherapy. The primary outcome was feasibility. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two sets of educational materials, each of which discussed hiccups and palliative options. The experimental materials were almost identical to the standard materials but provided updated content based on the published medical literature. At 2 weeks, patients responded by phone to a 5-item verbally administered questionnaire.

Results

This trial achieved its primary endpoint of recruiting 20 eligible patients within 5 months; 50 patients were recruited in 3 months. Among the 40 patients who completed the follow-up questionnaire, no statistically significant differences between arms were observed in hiccup incidence since initial contact, time spent reviewing the educational materials, and the troubling nature of hiccups. Twenty-five patients tried palliative interventions (13 in the experimental arm and 12 in the standard arm), most commonly drinking water or holding one's breath. Eleven and 10 patients, respectively, described hiccup relief after such an intervention.

Conclusions

Clinical trials for chemotherapy-induced hiccups are feasible and could address an unmet need.

### Hiccups as the presenting manifestation of cardiac tamponade: a case report [^117NnaLi]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. Its clinical manifestations depend on the length of time over which pericardial effusion accumulates. Among those, hiccups are rarely reported.

Case Report

We present a 48-year-old man who came in with a chief complaint of persistent hiccups and later had hypotension and dyspnea at the emergency department. Electrocardiogram revealed diffuse ST elevation with mildly elevated cardiac enzymes. Echocardiography showed massive pericardial effusion, implying cardiac tamponade. Catheter pericardiocentesis was performed and massive pericardial effusion was drained. Hiccups subsided after the procedure and the patient recovered uneventfully. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of cardiac tamponade with the presenting manifestation of persistent hiccups. Emergency physicians should stay vigilant when approaching those patients with unexplainable prolonged hiccups.

### Interventions for treating persistent and intractable hiccups in adults [^112vR4G9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Persistent and intractable hiccups (typically defined as lasting for more than 48 hours and one month respectively) can be of serious detriment to a patient's quality of life, although they are relatively uncommon. A wide range of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been used for the treatment of persistent and intractable hiccups. However, there is little evidence as to which interventions are effective or harmful.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions used in the treatment of persistent and intractable hiccups of any aetiology in adults.

Search Methods

Studies were identified from the following databases: CENTRAL, CDSR, DARE, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO and SIGLE (last search March 2012). The search strategy for all the databases searched was based on the MEDLINE search strategy presented in Appendix 1. No additional handsearching of journals was undertaken. Investigators who are known to be carrying out research in this area were contacted for unpublished data or knowledge of the grey literature.

Selection Criteria

Studies eligible for inclusion in this review were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs).

Inclusion Criteria

adults (over 18 years old) diagnosed with persistent or intractable hiccups (hiccups lasting more than 48 hours), treated with any pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention.

Exclusion Criteria

less than ten participants; no assessment of change in hiccup frequency or intensity in outcome measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors assessed each abstract and title for relevance. Disagreement on eligibility was resolved by discussion. Where no abstract was available the full paper was obtained and assessed. We obtained full copies of the studies which met the inclusion criteria for further assessment. Two review authors independently collected data from each appropriate study and entered them into the software Review Manager 5. Two independent review authors assessed the risk of bias using the RevMan 5 'Risk of bias' table following guidance from the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2009).

Main Results

A total of four studies (305 participants) met the inclusion criteria. All of these studies sought to determine the effectiveness of different acupuncture techniques in the treatment of persistent and intractable hiccups. All four studies had a high risk of bias, did not compare the intervention with placebo, and failed to report side effects or adverse events for either the treatment or control groups. Due to methodological differences we were unable to perform a meta-analysis of the results. No studies investigating pharmacological interventions for persistent and intractable hiccups met the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to guide the treatment of persistent or intractable hiccups with either pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions. The paucity of high quality studies indicate a need for randomised placebo-controlled trials of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. As the symptom is relatively rare, trials would need to be multi-centred and possibly multi-national.

### Persistent hiccups during rehabilitation hospitalization: three case reports and review of the literature [^1138qcYU]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Persistent hiccups have been reported to occur occasionally during rehabilitation hospitalizations. Hiccups can interfere with patient participation and progress, and this can lengthen and complicate the rehabilitation hospitalization. Chlorpromazine, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved agent specifically indicated for hiccups, is often chosen as a first-line treatment. However, chlorpromazine does not always provide favorable results. The intent of this paper is to (1) review hiccups and implications of persistent hiccups in the rehabilitation setting, (2) provide additional evidence that chlorpromazine is often not the best treatment choice for hiccups in rehabilitative patients, (3) report the effectiveness and favorable tolerability of modest doses of gabapentin in a small case series of three patients, and (4) review potentially effective treatment approaches for hiccups.

### Management of belching, hiccups, and aerophagia [^116RfmGh]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Although belching and hiccups are regarded as normal behaviors, they can occur at high frequency or become persistent, becoming bothersome and requiring medical care. Patients with excessive belching frequently have supragastric belches. Excessive belching should be treated as a behavioral disorder. Persistent hiccups, however, can be the first presentation of a serious disorder that requires extensive diagnostic testing. When no cause is found, only the symptoms can be treated. Aerophagia is an episodic or chronic disorder in which patients (children and adults) swallow large quantities of air, which accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract to cause abdominal distention and bloating. These patients should not undergo explorative laparotomy because they do not have ileus. New treatment approaches are needed for patients with aerophagia.

### Recurrent hiccups may signal brainstem pathology and should be investigated [^116wZEt8]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

While occasional hiccups are normal, their persistent recurrence is distressing and may have an underlying aetiology. Patients with recurrent hiccups may undergo a long journey and see many physicians before the diagnosis is finally made. The purpose of this report is to increase awareness of central nervous system lesions as a possible cause for recurrent hiccups and provide an illustrative case of an otherwise fit man presenting with ongoing hiccups caused by a medullary haemangioblastoma.

### 'What puts the 'hic' into hiccups?' [^117D5KpY]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Answer

Analysis of the concurrent imaging and audio recordings showed that the 'Hic' sound occurs due to rapid closure of the glottis during hiccups. The epiglottis did not move during the repetitive contractions of the diaphragm and glottis (video 1).

As expected, forceful suction of water through the FISST device and swallowing was accompanied by epiglottic flexion to protect the tracheal entrance during drinking. At the same instant, this physiological event was associated with the termination of hiccups.

These novel observations indicate that (1) the 'Hic' sound of hiccups is produced by abrupt myoclonic contraction and closure of the glottis, not the epiglottis, and (2) the combination of breath-hold with suction pressure and swallowing appears to provide rapid and effective relief of transient hiccups. This work also shows how a device that combines key elements of popular 'home remedies' for hiccups, provides rapid relief of this commonplace but annoying problem (video 2). Specifically, FISST requires generation of high-negative, intrathoracic pressure, breath-holding and also the act of swallowing. At present the use of this device is supported by observational data from a large cohort of patients; however, a randomised controlled trial using a dummy device as a comparator intervention is planned.

### Ultrasound-guided phrenic nerve block for intraoperative persistent hiccups: a case report [^115o9w6U]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hiccups are an unpleasant experience; they usually last for a short duration of time and do not cause any harm. However, long-term hiccupping can cause serious complications such as dehydration, weight loss, fatigue, insomnia, psychosis, depression, arrhythmia. Persistent hiccups rarely occur during an ongoing operation. However, when they do, the hiccups affect not only the patient's respiratory and circulatory function, they also interfere with the surgical procedure. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to interrupt the hiccups as soon as possible. A phrenic nerve block may be a suitable treatment choice because it can quickly and effectively terminate hiccups when physical or medical treatments are not effective. An ultrasound-guided block can improve the success rate and reduce the potential for complications. The effects of surgery and anesthesia on the patient's respiratory system should be highly considered when performing an intraoperative phrenic nerve block. Here, we report a case of an intraoperative persistent hiccups that appeared during vaginal hysterectomy performed under low continuous epidural anesthesia. We administered a unilateral phrenic nerve block under ultrasound guidance, and the hiccups were terminated successfully without any related complications.

### Hiccups as a migraine aura [^114fUVVn]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case series of hiccup as a migraine aura.

Background

Hiccup is a syndrome of inappropriate muscle contraction. To our knowledge, hiccup as a migraine aura has not been reported.

Case Series

We describe series of patients who presented with hiccups as their migraine aura symptom.

Conclusion

Hiccups can present as a primary aura symptom in patients with migraine.

### Gabapentin therapy of hiccups [^116QwvDx]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether gabapentin is effective in the treatment of persistent or intractable hiccups.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE (1966-March 2013) using the MeSH search terms gabapentin, hiccups, and hiccups/drug therapy was performed. Additional databases searched included Web of Science (1945-March 2013) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-March 2013) using the text words gabapentin and hiccups. Bibliographies of relevant articles were reviewed for additional citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All data sources were considered for inclusion. Preference was given for articles written in English, although one abstract in German was used.

Data Synthesis

Because of the low incidence of persistent or intractable hiccups, few if any controlled clinical trials are conducted on the efficacy of drug treatment. Therefore, most of the data involve case reports or case series. We evaluated 17 case reports and 2 case series involving gabapentin therapy for persistent or intractable hiccups. Therapeutic outcomes with gabapentin were positive in all cases, with temporal evidence suggesting an effect, but outcomes often were obscured by combination therapy and comorbidities in some cases. Case reports suggest that gabapentin might be useful as a second-line agent in patients undergoing stroke rehabilitation or in the palliative care setting where chlorpromazine adverse effects are undesirable. Gabapentin was very well tolerated, with only a few minor adverse effects.

Conclusions

Gabapentin has a similar body of evidence as other pharmacotherapeutic agents used to treat hiccups. Gabapentin is well tolerated and should be considered as a second-line agent in selected patients.

### 'What puts the 'hic' into hiccups?' [^116ffCW2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent and persistent bouts of hiccups impact the quality of life by interfering with eating, social interaction and work. These repetitive, myoclonic contractions are maintained by a reflex arc that consists of an afferent sensory limb (includes vagus nerve and sympathetic chain), an integration centre in the spinal cord and brainstem, and an efferent motor limb that involves the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and accessory nerves to the intercostal muscles. This activity draws air into the lungs that is, within a few milliseconds, interrupted by closure of the upper airway producing the characteristic sound, the 'hic' in hiccups. Popular home remedies, such as breath holding and drinking ice water, seek to interrupt this neuromuscular relay. However, the pathophysiology of hiccups and the mechanism by which any of these methods work are unclear. Indeed, so little is known that there is no agreement whether the 'Hic' sound is due to the abrupt closure of the epiglottis or the glottis, including the vocal cords.

Investigations were performed in a 50-year-old, otherwise healthy male with recurrent hiccups, in whom contractions can persist for up to 4 hours. This unique experiment was possible because hiccups could be reproducibly initiated in this volunteer by drinking carbonated soda. The aerodigestive tract was visualised using video-fluoroscopy by drinking a non-viscous, barium sulfate suspension through a 'forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool' (FISST). This device has been described previously and patients report that its use terminates hiccups in more than 90% of cases (figure 1).FISST uses Bernoulli's principle to generate a high-negative, intrathoracic, suction pressure (−100 cmH₂O). This draws fluid through a small orifice in a rigid drinking tube into the mouth, an action that is immediately followed by swallowing. The images were analysed together with simultaneous audio recordings to gain insight into 'what causes the 'hic' in hiccups' (video 1).

### Hiccups as the only symptom of acute myocardial infarction [^1178vARY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Hiccups are usually benign, while myocardial infarction (MI) has the potential for morbidity and mortality. Here, we report 3 cases of MI, with hiccups being the only symptom on presentation to the emergency department. Attention should be given to patients who present with hiccups and multiple risk factors for acute coronary syndrome, especially those with factors predisposing them to atypical presentations, such as diabetes mellitus, and old age.

### Singultus: avoiding a hiccup in care [^112UMJpV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Hiccups (singultus) is often a benign, common and self- limited condition. A case of profound electrolyte disturbances presenting with chief complaint of hiccups is presented in which chlorpromazine was not administered and could have been problematic had it been given. For those who present to the ED with chief complaint of hiccups, it is critical to consider a life threatening etiology as the cause of their symptom. This case presents a potential pitfall in the management of singultus.

### A better understanding of the association between maternal perception of foetal movements and late stillbirth-findings from an individual participant data meta-analysis [^117KqrKS]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The sensation of foetal movements from mid-pregnancy onwards is interpreted as a sign of foetal well-being. Conversely, changes in foetal movements, particularly when they reduce or become absent, are a cause of maternal concern and have been associated with an increased risk of poor outcomes including preterm birth, small for gestational age infants, late stillbirth and neurodevelopmental delay. However, translating this information into practical advice for women is complex, because each pregnancy is different, there are no robustly determined 'alarm limits', and intervention has the potential for inadvertent harm.

A number of case-control studies have examined the changes in frequency and strength of maternal perception of foetal movements in the third trimester. The Auckland Stillbirth Study (TASS) found no increased risk of late stillbirth associated with a decrease in frequency or decrease in strength of foetal movements in women after 37 weeks' gestation. Conversely, increasing strength or frequency of movements in late pregnancy was associated with a reduction in late stillbirth. A confirmatory multicentre case-control study in New Zealand and a larger study in the UK identified similar prevalence's and effect sizes.

Two recent cluster randomised control trials (cRCT) have been conducted, the 'AFFIRM' trial and 'Mindfetalness', found no difference in their primary outcomes of perinatal death and proportion of Apgar scores < 7, respectively. A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs which included 468,601 pregnancies (82% from the AFFIRM study) reported a small reduction in perinatal deaths. However, this systematic review was limited to univariable analyses, and the AFFIRM trial which dominates this review showed the risk moved towards unity after adjustment for potential confounders. The lack of conclusive findings from these large RCTs has led to uncertainty about how to address and manage reduced foetal movements in clinical practice.

Furthermore, the relationship between other aspects of foetal activity and late stillbirth is unclear. The case-control studies identified the common presence of hiccups, with over 60% of all control women reporting feeling hiccups in the last 2 weeks and reported decreased odds of late stillbirth with this sensation. However, in an internet-based case-control study using a self-completed online questionnaire, frequent hiccups were reported by high proportions of both women who had a late stillbirth and women whose infants were live born. This study also reported that a single episode of vigorous movements followed by cessation of movements was associated with late stillbirth, which the authors attributed to the timing of the demise of the infant.

### A better understanding of the association between maternal perception of foetal movements and late stillbirth-findings from an individual participant data meta-analysis [^112bz5uW]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this analysis has shown that increasing strength of movements throughout the third trimester is the most typical pattern of foetal movements, alongside the experience of foetal hiccups; this should be considered part of normal foetal development and is associated with decreased odds of late stillbirth. Maternal obesity should not be interpreted as a reason for maternal perception of reduced movements. A decrease in the frequency of foetal movements in the third trimester is of concern, particularly at earlier gestations and thus merits investigation to exclude acute and/or chronic foetal compromise. Experiencing a single episode of unusually vigorous movements particularly at term is also associated with stillbirth, but remains an area requiring further research before it can be decided whether any clinical recommendations can be made.

### Chronic hiccups: an underestimated problem [^111RnZwf]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

Persistent singultus, hiccupping that lasts for longer than 48 hours, can have a tremendous impact on a patient's quality of life. Although involved neurologic structures have been identified, the function of hiccups remains unclear-they have been controversially interpreted as a primitive reflex preventing extent swallowing of amniotic fluid in utero, an archaic gill ventilation pattern, or a fetus' preparation for independent breathing. Persistent singultus often presents as a symptom for various diseases, most commonly illnesses of the central nervous system or gastrointestinal tract; they can also be evoked by a variety of pharmacological agents. It is often impossible to define a singular cause. A wide range of treatment attempts, pharmacological and nonpharmacological, have been concerted to this date; however, chlorpromazine remains the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug in this context. Large-scale studies on efficacy and tolerance of other therapeutic strategies are lacking. Gabapentin, baclofen, and metoclopramide have been reported to accomplish promising results in reports on the therapy of persistent singultus; they may also be effective when given in combination with other drugs, eg, proton pump inhibitors, or as conjoined therapy. As another approach of note, acupuncture treatment was able to abolish hiccups in a number of studies. When managing hiccup patients within the clinical routine, it is of importance to conduct a comprehensive and effective diagnostic workup; a well-functioning interdisciplinary team is needed to address possible causes for the symptom. Persistent singultus is a medical problem not to be underestimated; more research on options for effective treatment would be greatly needed.

### Vagus nerve stimulation for chronic intractable hiccups. case report [^113grWJp]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Intractable hiccups are debilitating and usually a result of some underlying disease. Initial management includes vagal maneuvers and pharmacotherapy. When hiccups persist despite medical therapy, surgical intervention rarely is pursued. Cases described in the literature cite successful phrenic nerve blockade, crush injury, or percutaneous phrenic nerve pacing. The authors report on a case of intractable hiccups occurring after a posterior fossa stroke, Complete resolution of the spasms has been achieved to date following the placement of a vagus nerve stimulator.

### Hypnotic hiccups [^116SKw9F]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Our patient presented with repetitive, self-limited bouts of forceful hiccups in sleep. Eszopiclone, a commonly prescribed hypnotic, appeared to cause these intermittent hiccups. This case is a reminder that eszopiclone may cause this adverse effect, and that it may be the bed partner and not the patient who furnishes critical sleep medicine history.

### Anesthesia as therapy for persistent hiccups [^113P3AAD]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Implications

Chronic hiccups may be a serious therapeutic problem. Pharmacological treatment with increasing dosages of baclofen, carbamazepine, or gabapentin is not always successful. In this paper, the use of general anesthesia with positive-pressure ventilation and muscle relaxation for the termination of chronic hiccups is described.

### Dexamethasone and hiccups: a 2000-patient, telephone-based study [^112Wg7JS]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Objectives

Dexamethasone causes hiccups in an undefined percentage of patients, and these hiccups are often ignored ('My doctors just shook their heads like I was joking… '). This study sought to learn the percentage of dexamethasone-treated patients who develop hiccups and to explore patients' responses to the availability of educational materials on hiccups.

Methods

English-speaking, adult outpatients treated with oral, intravenous or epidural dexamethasone 2 weeks prior were contacted by phone and asked about hiccups. Educational materials were offered, and patients were queried on their opinion of the availability of such materials.

Results

One hundred and twenty-seven patients or 11% (95% CI 9% to 13%) reported hiccups. This percentage was derived from 1186 reachable patients from 2000 total patients. Fifty-four (43%) of those with hiccups desired to learn about educational materials. Of these, 49 completed a single-item, 5-point scale item: 21 (43%) viewed the availability of educational materials 'extremely helpful', providing a 5 rating; 8 (16%) provided a 4; 4 (8%) provided a 3; and 1 (4%) provided a 2.

Conclusions

Dexamethasone-induced hiccups occur in a small percentage of patients. The fact that most patients responded favourably to learning about the availability of educational materials suggests some have unmet needs.

### Case report: two cases of persistent hiccups complicating COVID-19 [^116SGKBG]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hiccups are familiar to everyone; they are repetitive contractions of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles. The classification of hiccups is based on their duration. An acute attack lasts less than 48 hours. Persistent hiccups last more than 2 days. Intractable hiccups are present if the attack lasts more than 1 month. Hiccups are more common in diseases affecting the gastrointestinal or central nervous systems. Among the causes of hiccups, toxic and pharmacological drug use, and recent surgical operations are included. Ear–nose–throat (ENT), cardiovascular, and pulmonary disorders affecting the peripheral nervous system are also among the causes of hiccups. Hiccups are rarely described as a clinical manifestation of community-acquired pneumonia, and one should consider this diagnosis in a patient with unexplained fever. Rarely, pneumonia manifests as intractable hiccups, with the latter resolving with antibiotic treatment. Whenever possible, the treatment of hiccups should be directed at the underlying cause of the condition. Several pharmacological agents (metoclopramide, baclofen, gabapentin, and chlorpromazine) are reported for empirical treatment of persistent hiccups. Two large case series from 1950s documented the efficacy of chlorpromazine for cessation of persistent hiccups.

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) was designated by the WHO in February 2020, and the pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes SARS has spread throughout the world. The most frequently reported symptoms are fever, dry cough, muscle pain, fatigue, and complicated dyspnea, with less commonly reported symptoms of headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, rhinorrhea, and cough with phlegm. The first case of a COVID-19 infection presenting with persistent hiccups was reported by Prince et al. Bakheet et al.reported that hiccup attacks could be more severe and prolonged.

We describe two male patients who presented with COVID-19-related hiccups: one during his initial presentation and one 10 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19 was made.

### A better understanding of the association between maternal perception of foetal movements and late stillbirth-findings from an individual participant data meta-analysis [^114BD2iM]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Whilst the association between increased strength of movements over a discrete time period in late pregnancy and the reduced risk of late stillbirth is consistent across studies, the effect of other aspects of foetal movements over the same period of time is less clear. In addition, it is uncertain whether such associations are consistent in different groups of women. For example, women with obesity are more likely to present to their care provider with RFM; their concerns may be dismissed because of an assumption that perception of RFM movements is due to their body size. A systematic review of the literature supported these suggestions but found that there was limited evidence of the association of increased maternal BMI, RFM and outcomes. However, available data from a study that included 233 obese women suggested that women with obesity feel changes in strength and frequency in foetal movements in the same proportion as non-obese women. To optimise the quality of information available from the case-control studies and evaluate the influence of confounding factors, we established the Collaborative Individual Participant Data (IPD) Meta-analysis of Sleep and Stillbirth (CRIBSS). It was anticipated that a better understanding of the association of altered foetal activity and late stillbirth would contribute to the interpretation of clinical trials in this field.

This study was a planned secondary analysis of the CRIBSS data set; the specific aims of this analysis were as follows:
To determine the association of the frequency and strength of foetal movements, the presence of hiccups, uterine contractions and the frequency of vigorous movements in the third trimester in relation to late stillbirth
To determine whether associations of foetal movements and hiccups differ in terms of gestational age at interview
To determine whether associations of foetal movements and hiccups differ in terms of whether women are obese

Forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool ('HiccAway', Aim Dynamics, Longmont, Colorado, USA). The tool has a mouthpiece on the top, a rigid body and a cap with a pressure valve on the bottom. The valve and the body's dimensions were designed to generate high-negative suction pressure. The cap is removable and can be rotated to set the valve to the adult or child settings. The tip is submerged in a half-filled cup of water. The lips are pursed around the mouthpiece and forceful suction draws water into the mouth and is immediately swallowed. Hiccups usually stop after one to three attempts.

### Protracted hiccups due to severe erosive esophagitis: a case series [^113xGabi]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hiccups although a common annoyance of life, have been linked with significant morbidity and even death. There are numerous causes of prolonged hiccups, including diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Hiccups are reported to represent an atypical manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Cases

We report 4 cases of prolonged hiccups in patients who failed to respond to initial treatment with abortive neurologic medications and who subsequently improved on proton-pump inhibitors. Endoscopic examination revealed severe reflux esophagitis.

Conclusion

Hiccups are an atypical manifestation and may represent a more severe course of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

### Ultrasound-guided phrenic nerve block for intraoperative persistent hiccups: a case report [^114375HZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Continuous hiccups during surgery not only affect the surgical procedure, they can also cause adverse effects for the patient. Apart from active investigation of the cause of the hiccups, their timely termination is also necessary.

Case presentation

We reported a case of a 70-year-old woman with continuous intraoperative hiccups that appeared during vaginal hysterectomy under low continuous epidural anesthesia. After the ineffectiveness CO₂ repeated inhalation and intravenous administration of chlorpromazine and methoxychlorpromide, we performed unilateral phrenic nerve block under ultrasound guidance. Hiccups were terminated without any related complications.

Conclusions

During intraoperative continuous hiccups, ultrasound guided phrenic nerve block may be a suitable treatment option when physical methods and drug therapy are not effective. However, given the absence of a vital risk related to hiccups, this block should imply the complete absence of any respiratory contraindication and a prolonged postoperative respiratory monitoring.

### High dose of prokinetics for refractory hiccups after chemotherapy or the return to a simple drug [^116tPo4p]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Hiccups in patients with cancer might be difficult to treat, impacting negatively on the quality of life. Many therapies are available, but they are usually started empirically, and often they are unsuccessful. We report a case of a man with metastatic colon cancer who after the first cycle of chemotherapy developed persistent hiccups refractory to neuroleptics and low dose of metoclopramide. After searching for the potential cause, a high dose of prokinetics was initiated in the hospital and his symptoms disappeared. This case shows how searching for potential causes helps start the right treatment immediately, and therefore it is relevant for the prompt relief from this bothersome symptom. So far, no cases reporting high doses of prokinetics to treat persistent hiccups after chemotherapy have been published. This option should be taken into account when developing hiccups and gastro-oesophageal reflux after chemotherapy, especially if low doses of prokinetics have already been tried.

### Pharmacologic interventions for intractable and persistent hiccups: a systematic review [^116dLNdU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chlorpromazine is the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hiccups; however, many other pharmacologic treatments have been proposed for intractable and persistent hiccups. Currently, there is little evidence to support the use of one agent over another.

Objective

This review aims to identify literature concerning the use of pharmacologic treatments for intractable and persistent hiccups with the goal of evaluating therapies in terms of their level of evidence, mechanism of action, efficacy, dosing, onset of action, and adverse effects.

Methods

A systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and the New York Academy of Medicine was performed to find articles where a pharmacologic agent was used to treat intractable or persistent hiccups between the years 1966 and 2016. The GRADE method was used to assess the level of evidence for the studies included in this review.

Results

This review identified 26 articles involving 10 pharmacologic treatment options that met our inclusion criteria. Amitriptyline, baclofen, gabapentin, haloperidol, metoclopramide, midazolam, nifedipine, nimodipine, orphenadrine, and valproic acid were found in the literature to be successful in treating hiccups.

Conclusion

Baclofen, gabapentin, and metoclopramide were the only agents that were studied in a prospective manner, while only baclofen and metoclopramide were studied in randomized controlled trials. No specific recommendations can be made for treating intractable and persistent hiccups with the evidence currently available in the literature. Therapy selection should be specific to individual patients, their underlying comorbidities, etiology of hiccups, and take into account the individual properties of the drugs.

### Intractable hiccups as a rare gastrointestinal manifestation in severe endocrine and metabolic crisis: case report and review of the literature [^115daXcw]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

As to the therapeutic measures of intractable hiccups, a wide range of treatment attempts have been conducted, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to this date. However, chlorpromazine remains the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug in this context due to the lack of large-scale studies on efficacy and tolerance of other therapeutic strategies. Gabapentin, baclofen and metoclopramide have been reported to accomplish promising results in reports on the therapy of persistent singultus; they may also be effective when given in combination with other drugs, for example, proton pump inhibitors, prokinetics or as conjoined therapy. As another approach of note, acupuncture treatment was able to abolish hiccups in a number of studies. In therapy-refractory cases, invasive procedures such as the selective phrenic nerve block are available. More studies are needed to help deal with the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges that hiccups presents for clinicians. Finally, we successfully saved the patient's life with artificial ventilation under general anaesthesia to correct respiratory failure as well as intractable hiccups.

### Baclofen for hiccups: a large mixed methods multisite study [^112LmBMn]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Objective

Hiccups can be bothersome and spawn morbidity. Although oral baclofen is perhaps the most prescribed agent for hiccups, a paucity of data supports its use.

Methods

This multisite, single institution study examined the medical records of patients who had hiccups and had been prescribed baclofenas noted in a clinical encounter. Mixed methods were used to assess baclofen's palliative efficacy. In view of the sometimes transient nature of hiccups and other such factors, cessation or palliation of hiccups in 75% of patients was sought to indicate true palliation.

Results

A total of 301 patients with a median age of 61 years (range 20–87 years) and a male predominance are the focus of this report. Baclofen was most often prescribed at 10mg orally three times a day. Only 105 patients (35%) (95% CI: 30% to 41%) acquired hiccup palliation. Corroborative medical record quotations included, 'Still has hiccups'. uotations such as, 'Responding to baclofen this AM', were also recorded. Baclofen appeared more likely to benefit patients with hiccups of > 48hours (chronic) duration in univariable analyses (OR for benefit: 0.51 (95% CI: 0.29 to 0.91; p = 0.02) with similar conclusions drawn from multivariable analyses. Adverse events occurred in 15 patients with drowsiness the most common.

Conclusions

Baclofen did not meet this study's a priori threshold for successful hiccup palliation, but further study is indicated to learn whether baclofen might help patients with chronic hiccups.

### Vaccine technologies jockey for primacy in pandemic response [^115CQ3N4]. Molecular Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

What's more, both vaccines proved to be around 95% effective at preventing disease, with reasonable safety profiles to boot. Few experts had foreseen those kinds of results. "I was stunned about the performance", says Peter Palese, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, who was not involved in either vaccine's development.

Still, the RNA vaccines have their drawbacks. Raw materials that go into synthesizing nucleic acids and encapsulating them in lipid nanoparticles can be expensive. Side effects are typically worse than those from, say, a flu shot. The two-dose, prime-boost regimen comes with logistical challenges and compliance concerns. And distribution requires cold-chain handling to maintain the integrity of the RNA, a temperature requirement that has contributed to delays in mass vaccination campaigns around the world.

As such, other vaccines are still needed, especially to meet the huge demand for cheap and easy-to-store vaccines that can be readily integrated into health systems found in lower-income countries. "You want the vaccine that works in your context", says Naor Bar-Zeev, a statistical epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, MD, who helped establish a national vaccine surveillance program in Malawi.

"For me, the key issue isn't in the production of an efficacious vaccine", Bar-Zeev adds. "The delivery aspects are going to be what differentiates one vaccine from another".

Yet, several of the leading vaccine candidates that offer those kinds of delivery advantages have encountered development hiccups along the way. At best, the issues have simply pushed back timelines for late-stage human testing and eventual deployment. At worst, they have called into question the clinical utility of vaccines already going into millions of people's arms.

### Case report: two cases of persistent hiccups complicating COVID-19 [^112nCr4u]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Two cases are presented with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-related hiccups: one during initial presentation and one 10 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Hiccups in both patients were resistant to treatment and responded only to chlorpromazine. COVID-19 patients may present with hiccups and also may have hiccups after treatment. Resistant hiccups without any underlying disease other than COVID-19 should be considered in association with COVID-19 and may respond well to chlorpromazine.

### Rare clinical manifestation of community-acquired pneumonia [^115RhEiH]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 71-year-old patient was admitted due to fever and persistent (> 48hours) hiccups. History and physical examination were not instructive. Lab tests were not specific, showing an inflammatory response. Chest film did not demonstrate opacities. The patient was treated with chlorpromazine with no relief. Fever and hiccups persisted, and therefore neck and chest CT was performed revealing a right lower lobe infiltrate, a finding consistent with pneumonia. Antibiotics were initiated and within 48hours fever and hiccups resolved and patient recovered. Although hiccups are rarely described as a clinical manifestation of community acquired pneumonia, one should consider this diagnosis in a patient with unexplained fever.

### Intractable hiccups as a rare gastrointestinal manifestation in severe endocrine and metabolic crisis: case report and review of the literature [^114XMYLd]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and literature review

The incidence of endocrine emergencies is quite low but not negligible because once it occurs, the mortality is very high. DKA is a severe metabolic crisis induced by absolute or relative insufficiency of insulin activity, which is mainly associated with type 1 diabetes. However, DKA is increasingly recognized in patients with type 2 diabetes in recent years. The incidence of hospital admission for DKA increased from 0.70 to 0.98 per 1000 person-years in adults with T2DM. One in five cases of DKA is reported to have a history of type 2 diabetes, which leads to higher mortality, with infection, myocardial infarction and stroke as triggering factors in these patients. It is noted that some DKA cases caused by type 2 diabetes may not have an obvious precipitating cause. –

Hiccups are usually benign and self-limiting. Intractable hiccups is hiccups lasting more than 48 h. Intractable hiccups may produce significant discomfort and may also represent the clinical manifestation of life-threatening clinical conditions such as lateral medullary lesions, myocardial infarction, respiratory failure and pulmonary embolism. Hiccups are caused by stimulation of the diaphragm, phrenic nerve, vagus nerve, or central nervous system, causing paroxysmal spasm of one or both the diaphragm and intercostal muscle or anterior scalene muscle. Hiccups refers to a short, loud sound accompanied by a sudden closing of the glottis during inhalation. Intractable hiccups can cause severe anxiety, depression, reduced physical strength, respiratory failure and even death without timely treatment. Previous studies have revealed that cerebrovascular disorders, intracranial infectious diseases, severe pneumonia, uraemia, gastrointestinal problems, toxic or metabolic disorders and DKA all can cause intractable hiccups.

### Ultrasound-guided phrenic nerve block for intraoperative persistent hiccups: a case report [^117Hcytx]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Several limitations of the current case report should be considered. First, we did not report information on the recovery of phrenic nerve function and the timing of hemi-diaphragm movement. Second, we did not observe the spread of local anesthetics and its effect on brachial plexus under ultrasound. In addition, we did not pay attention to the effect of phrenic nerve block on other organ functions.

Continuous hiccup during surgery is a rare occurrence that can lead to severe outcomes. Hence, when choosing the methods to treat hiccups, we should consider the causes of hiccups, the surgery, and the anesthesia. This article described only one case, which was successfully treated with phrenic nerve block, a technique which may not be suitable for all cases with hiccups during surgery. Nevertheless, this case may provide relevant evidence for selecting suitable treatment strategies for treating continuous hiccups that develop during surgery.

### Evaluation of the forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool to stop hiccups [^113tbQ5j]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This study supports the use of FISST as an option to stop transient hiccups, with more than 90% of participants reporting subjectively superior results compared with home remedies. Many home remedies consist of physical maneuvers designed to stimulate contraction of the diaphragm and/or closure of the epiglottis. These maneuvers lack clear, standardized instructions and can be cumbersome to perform, and there are few, if any, scientific studies of their effectiveness. Pharmacological and other therapies have had varying levels of success, and adverse effects are a concern. A systematic review concluded that there was a lack of high-quality data on which to make any strong recommendations.

The limitations of the study include the absence of a control group and the subjective nature of the scoring system. The strengths of the study include the prospective nature of the study, the relatively large sample size, and the broad applicability of the results.

FISST is an easy-to-use tool to relieve transient hiccups. The sample of participants who responded to the online questionnaire associated the device with superior results compared with home remedies. Future studies will need to assess the efficacy of FISST in randomized clinical trials.

### Persistent hiccups as an atypical presenting complaint of COVID-19 [^115BAsiQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hiccups (singultus) are reflex inspiratory movements that involve the swallowing reflex arc and can be classified as acute (< 48 h) or persistent (> 48 h). A 62-year-old man with no history of malignancy or pulmonary disease presented to the Emergency Department with a four-day history of persistent hiccups. Other than episodic hiccupping, his physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. An abnormal chest X-ray led to a CT scan of the chest with IV contrast, which demonstrated regional, peripheral groundglass opacities of the upper lobes with small focal groundglass opacities scattered throughout the lungs. He was tested for COVID-19 per admission protocol, started on hydroxychloroquine, his hiccups improved, and he was discharged to home after 3 days. An emergency medicine physician should keep COVID-19 on the differential and be vigilant of exposure in atypical presentations.

### Intractable hiccups as a rare gastrointestinal manifestation in severe endocrine and metabolic crisis: case report and review of the literature [^11355WSQ]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endocrine and metabolic emergencies, such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and thyroid storm (TS) are life-threatening clinical conditions. – Typical endocrine emergencies may be characterized by sudden onset with severe symptoms. Furthermore, prompt and aggressive treatment may significantly decrease mortality risk.DKA, one of the most common metabolic disease crises, occurs when there is insufficient insulin available for cellular uptake of glucose. Common clinical manifestations in patients with DKA are severe polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, shock and even coma. In addition, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, acute gastrointestinal bleeding, hiccup and diabetic gastroparesis are uncommon digestive manifestations of DKA. –

TS is a relatively rare endocrine crisis but is probably misdiagnosed and mismanaged in many cases. Despite its rarity, TS has a significantly high mortality rate of over 10%. Common causes of TS are infection, surgery, discontinuation of anti-thyroid drugs and worsening mental and disease status in patients with Graves' disease. Particularly when TS is complicated by DKA, the diagnosis of TS is usually delayed because the level of thyroid hormone is suppressed by some factors, such as fever. To the best of our knowledge, uncommon digestive complications as a cause of TS have not been reported in the literature. We herein report a rare digestive complication (intractable hiccups) during the treatment of DKA that resulted in TS and acute respiratory failure. Both DKA, TS and respiratory failure are severe clinical emergencies, which can result in high mortality without appropriate management. Although the condition is rare, the mortality rate is quite high. Thus, in severe cases, clinicians should pay close attention to the progress of rare endocrine emergencies with timely diagnosis and prompt treatment. In addition, we review the literature to explore the possible underlying mechanism of intractable hiccups in the development of TS.

### Intractable hiccups as the harbinger of a diffuse pontine glioma [^112QRfrB]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Hiccups are experienced by people of all ages. While acute hiccups are benign and self-limited, persistent and intractable hiccups can sometimes signal a serious disease. We present a young previously healthy man who complained of only hiccups for 4months and later developed a severe headache and projectile vomiting. His systemic examination was within normal limits. Brain imaging revealed a diffuse pontine glioma with mild hydrocephalus.

### The annoyance of singultus: a case report of a rare adverse effect after epidural steroid injection [^116CMHFN]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Given that hiccups can emerge after diverse interventional pain procedures and can be distressing to patients, a modified management algorithm was devised for patients experiencing singultus (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Modified management algorithm for singultus after interventional pain procedures

Although there is limited supporting data to advocate for a specific pharmacologic treatment, historically baclofen, gabapentin, pregabalin, metoclopramide, and chlorpromazine have been recommended for singultus. However, given that many pain management patients are already on gabapentin and pregabalin, baclofen may be a better first-line agent unless there is concern over its potential side effects. Baclofen has been shown to lead to full cessation of persistent hiccups within the first six days of treatment in 34 of 35 cases, whereas Gabapentin led to cessation in 81 of 83 cases with a duration of therapy ranging up to six months. Furthermore, if patients fail treatment with any first-line agent chlorpromazine should be elected since it is the only medication approved for this indication and has shown efficacy in previous reported cases. Patients treated with chlorpromazine should be monitored due to a higher risk for side effects such as sedation, palpitations, syncope, extrapyramidal symptoms, and dermatologic reactions. If a patient complains of reflux there should be a strong consideration for a proton-pump inhibitor such as omeprazole.

Providers should counsel patients that singultus is a rare adverse effect of ESIs and should be ready to treat the outcome should it occur. Given that singultus typically resolves with pharmacologic therapy or within a couple weeks after the ESI, providers should refer patients to other specialists, including a Neurologist, if symptoms continue beyond this timeframe. Advanced imaging should be considered in any patient with refractory singultus after an image-guided pain procedure.

### Case report: two cases of persistent hiccups complicating COVID-19 [^112mjCk6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Pneumonia may rarely present with persistent hiccups, and hiccups may disappear after antibiotic treatment. A review of the literature reveals very few reported cases of pneumonia presenting with hiccups. Burdette and Marinellasuggested that inflammatory pneumonic irritation of the phrenic nerve and its pericardial branch, which are located along the superior portion of the diaphragm and right heart border, respectively, may be the pathophysiological cause of hiccups.

The first case of COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with persistent hiccups was reported by Prince et al. A 62-year-old woman presented with a 4-day history of hiccups. Ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities compatible with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were noted on chest X-ray and CT scan. Bakheet et al.reported a patient in whom hiccup attacks were more severe and prolonged (from 1 week before admission to 1 week afterward). He showed improvement after a baclofen dosage increase toward the end of his first week after admission, and he later proved to be COVID-19 negative. A small number of other case reports with atypical presentation of COVID-19 pneumonia with hiccups have been published.

One of our patients presented to the neurology department for hiccups, similar to other reports in the literature. Radiology and PCR confirmed a COVID-19 diagnosis. His persistent hiccups responded well to chlorpromazine and regressed within hours. After 2 months, his COVID-19 infection had resolved and there was no recurrence of hiccups. Our second patient is the first reported in the literature (to our knowledge) with a 15-day history of hospital treatment for COVID — without hiccups — who presented 2 days after discharge with persistent hiccups. Clinicians should be aware of the atypical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in patients in epidemic areas.

### Intractable hiccups as a rare gastrointestinal manifestation in severe endocrine and metabolic crisis: case report and review of the literature [^116cesC8]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

DKA and TS are potentially life-threatening endocrine emergencies, with high morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized and treated. When DKA is accompanied by TS, it is essential to consider the possibility of coexisting rare complications with uncommon clinical manifestations.

In general, endocrine emergencies have a rapid and aggressive clinical course and pose significant diagnostic challenges. Physicians should be aware of possible presenting features and diagnose and manage promptly to prevent life-threatening severe complications.

### Do some people with a prolonged disorder of consciousness experience pain? A clinically focused narrative review and synthesis [^115w7KZ9]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Prolonged disorders of consciousness

In 2020, the Royal College of Physicians working party on managing people with a prolonged disorder of consciousness defined it as: ' any disorder of consciousness that has continued for at least four weeks following sudden onset brain injury'. It includes coma and the vegetative and minimally conscious states. Most patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness have progressive neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease or dementia. Cumulative co-morbidities accrued over a while may also result in a prolonged disorder of consciousness. This article refers to all those people with prolonged disordered consciousness resulting from all these conditions.

Brains from patients who had a prolonged disorder of consciousness show widespread cortical damage, diffuse axonal injury after trauma and extensive nerve cell body loss after metabolic injury, combined with damage to the dorsomedial and ventral posterior thalamic nuclei. Thus, pain networks in the cortex are inevitably extensively disrupted, and it is unlikely that any cognitive analysis or moderation of lower brain networks will be undertaken.

Midbrain and brainstem structures are more resistant to damage. Less extensive damage will not disrupt lower networks because networks are intrinsically resilient and resist degradation unless the loss is severe.

Therefore, lower brain networks are probably still functioning in people with prolonged disorders of consciousness. The nature of the output and how the loss of cortical modulation of their function affects it are unknown, but they may increase arousal and produce non-specific non-willed behaviours. These aversive behavioural and autonomic reactions are retained as basic outputs arising from nociceptive stimuli.

Many factors are likely to lead to pain in people with a prolonged disorder of consciousness:
Nursing and care procedures, such as moving and handling people, stretching muscles to facilitate personal care, tracheal suctioning, complex mouth care, bowel management and replacing urethral catheters.
Muscle immobility and increased muscle tone, maintaining posture and positioning for long periods
Blood tests and injections for spasticity and salivary management
Other unpredictable phenomena such as hypersensitivity to touch, muscle spasms, local infections, skin pressure ulcers, hiccups and coughing.

### Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) of the phrenic nerve for intractable hiccups: a novel use case report [^113WQggr]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intractable hiccups, defined as those persisting for over 1month, represent a rare but significant clinical challenge often associated with substantial morbidity and refractory to standard treatments.

Case Presentation

This case report describes the innovative use of phrenic nerve peripheral neuromodulation for managing chronic intractable hiccups in a 73-year-old male patient with a 6-year history of daily hiccups. Conventional treatments and interventional procedures had failed to provide lasting relief. Bilateral phrenic nerve peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) placed under ultrasound guidance resulted in immediate and substantial improvement, with the patient's Hiccup Assessment Instrument score decreasing from 6/10 to 2/10. The patient experienced significant enhancements in speech and quality of life without complications.

Conclusions

This novel application of phrenic nerve PNS highlights its potential as a therapeutic strategy for intractable hiccups, underscoring their pathophysiologic involvement of the diaphragm and respiratory muscles. The findings suggest that phrenic nerve PNS could offer a viable treatment option for patients unresponsive to conventional therapies, warranting further research to establish its long-term efficacy and safety.

### Intractable hiccups as a rare gastrointestinal manifestation in severe endocrine and metabolic crisis: case report and review of the literature [^1161vbPr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and thyroid storm (TS) are severe metabolic and endocrine disorders. Both usually manifest with multiple systemic clinical signs and symptoms, and digestive symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, are most common in these patients. Moreover, the presence of a concurrent severe or rare complication may worsen the condition or even cause death due to misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, or inappropriate treatment. The identification of these symptoms is usually closely related to the severity and prognosis of the disease. Although clinical prognosis might be improved by prompt diagnosis and aggressive treatment, some rare and insidious metabolic complications are difficult to identify early. Moreover, life-threatening gastrointestinal symptoms are very rare in patients with DKA and TS. Here, we report an inpatient diagnosed with DKA and Graves' disease who developed life-threatening intractable hiccups resulting in TS and respiratory failure during the treatment of DKA. In addition, we review the literature to discuss the possible underlying mechanism of intractable hiccups in the development of TS.

### Successful treatment of intractable hiccups by oral application of lidocaine [^114cagp2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Persistent and intractable hiccups are a rather rare, but distressing gastrointestinal symptom found in palliative care patients. Although several recommendations for treatment are given, hiccups often persist.

Case Reports

We describe a new pharmacological approach for successfully treating hiccups in four cancer patients. In the first patient, chronic and intractable hiccups lasted for more than 18 months, but disappeared immediately after swallowing a viscous 2% lidocaine solution for treatment of mucositis. Based on this experience, we successfully treated three further patients suffering from singultus using a lidocaine-containing gel. To our knowledge, this is the first report about managing hiccups by oral application of a lidocaine solution.

### Ultrasound-guided phrenic nerve block for intraoperative persistent hiccups: a case report [^115zQSWr]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

A hiccup is an involuntary spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm, which is an unconscious spinal reflex and has a complete reflex arc. The afferent nerves are the phrenic nerve, vagus nerve, and sympathetic nerve (T6 – T12), and the reflex center consists of the brainstem, phrenic nucleus, medullary reticular formation, and hypothalamus. The efferent nerves are the phrenic nerve and intercostal nerves, and the effectors comprise of the diaphragm, intercostal muscle, and anterior scalene muscle. There are various causes of hiccups, and the most common are diseases located in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous pathways and digestive system diseases.

In the current patient, who had continuous hiccups during surgery, the cause may be related to uterine stretching during gynecological surgery, which caused stretching of other organs and tissues in the abdominal cavity and stimulation of the phrenic nerve leading to causing spasm of the diaphragm. In addition, hiccups may occur when, as a result of anxiety, a patient swallows a lot of cold air into the stomach before surgery. It has been reported that bupivacaine epidural anesthesia could also induce hiccups.

Continuous hiccups during surgery is a rare phenomenon; however, it can severely influence both the patient and the surgical procedure. Stuth et al. reported a case where continuous hiccups induced pulmonary edema, and Rullo et al. reported a case in which continuous hiccups caused left common iliac artery perforation. Therefore, timely termination of continuous hiccups during surgery is essential.

Various methods can be used for treating hiccups, including physical treatment (rebreathing carbon dioxide), drug treatment (chlorpromazine), and nerve block. When physical and pharmacological treatments are not successful, a phrenic nerve block may be a good option; it can quickly block the hiccup reflex pathway and terminate the hiccups. As the phrenic nerve is thin, blind puncture has a higher failure rate, and may easily damage the nerve, blood vessels, and peripheral tissues. A high-resolution ultrasound scan can accurately distinguish the phrenic nerve and its surrounding anatomy. As a result, phrenic nerve block under ultrasound guidance has an improved success rate and can also decrease the damage to nearby nerves and blood vessels. Furthermore, it has been reported that five cancer patients with intractable hiccups underwent unilateral phrenic nerve block under ultrasound guidance and all patients had satisfactory results without any complications.

### Archetypal trajectories of social, psychological, and spiritual wellbeing and distress in family care givers of patients with lung cancer: secondary analysis of serial qualitative interviews [^113NzTHe]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Psychological wellbeing

Carers, like patients, often felt they were on an emotional rollercoaster, experiencing peaks and troughs at key times of stress and uncertainty in the cancer trajectory (fig 1).

Diagnosis

The time of diagnosis was surrounded with particularly acute anxiety:

We were just absolutely gobsmacked [shattered] (patient)

It's just like being hit by a train, isn't it?. It's just like, you, you just hear the word. [a month on] you still cannae take it in (carer)

Return home

At home after initial treatment, trying to communicate in itself was distressing, and the carer could feel increasingly worn down and under pressure:

It's much harder for him, he hates me talking about it, it distresses him, which isn't fair (patient)

Tired of it! Yes, you get fed up. it's going on a long time and. yes. I think we do feel that the pressure is getting to us really. It has been hard, it's not easy for us to say that. But yes, it is difficult (carer)

Yeah. I'd say now, a wee bit depressed, eh, wearing you down, kind of thing, you know? Oooh! (carer)

Recurrence

When the disease recurred carers might empathise with the worry the patients had at that stage, but sometimes had to deal with difficult behaviour along with their own concerns that their partner might suddenly die:

Nothing worse than thinking it is. it must be incredible for cancer patients, a terrible thing to live with

He went through a phase where he [husband] was really aggressive and very moody and he was terrible — it just drives me crazy

Terminal stage

At the terminal stage, one carer sat up at night worried that her husband might die soon:

These last few nights when I've been sat up with him because of these hiccups, it's just gone on and on and it's really made me start to wonder what it will be like, you know? Sometimes I wonder, is this it? Is this the end?

### The annoyance of singultus: a case report of a rare adverse effect after epidural steroid injection [^1135F33x]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Hiccups are attributable to a diverse array of etiologies, with over 100 documented in the current literature. The foremost culprits include gastrointestinal causes such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, while other cases point to cerebrovascular events, intracranial tumors, meningitis or encephalitis, renal dysfunction, metabolic irregularities, and psychosomatic triggers like stress or excitement. Notably, surgical procedures impacting the thorax or upper abdomen, along with endoscopy, have also been implicated in the development of singultus. The estimated incidence of singultus after ESIs stands at 0.5%. Singultus is categorized by duration, with most sources defining it as "persistent" if it lasts beyond 48 h and "intractable" if it persists over a month. While existing literature commonly reports isolated episodes of post-injection singultus, recurring cases following multiple ESIs is limited.

It appears that persistent hiccups result from ESIs with betamethasone, methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, and dexamethasone, regardless of whether local anesthetic was used. Notably, hiccups have even been triggered by oral, intravenous, and intra-articular steroid administration. Switching steroids during repeat ESIs has shown potential to prevent reoccurrence of singultus. However, the literature even suggests that some cases of post-epidural injection hiccups may be linked to local anesthetic use without correlation to steroids. Singultus has been associated with ESIs across the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, suggesting no discernible correlation with the level of blockade. Despite uncertainty about the injectate and approach employed during our patient's prior lumbar ESI, the patient reported no complications from the procedure in the past.

### Evaluation of the forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool to stop hiccups [^115eRpXV]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Home remedies to relieve transient hiccups, such as breath holding, recycled breathing in a paper bag, and drinking water from the far side of a glass, are plagued by unclear instructions, inconsistent performance, and poor effectiveness. There is a need for a simple and effective method to stop hiccups. The forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool (FISST) has a low-cost design and straightforward mode of action that stimulates the phrenic and vagus nerves by inducing diaphragmatic contraction and epiglottis closure, respectively. The study hypothesis was that patients with hiccups would associate FISST with more effective termination of transient hiccups compared with home remedies.

### Intractable hiccup: an odd complication after laparoscopic fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113wdmM4]. Surgical Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Intractable hiccup can be an unbearable circumstance and its treatment is often frustrating. More than 100 causes for hiccup have been described in the literature; the most common cause is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). We report a case of a 31-year-old patient who suffered from intractable hiccup starting 3 weeks after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for GERD, a potential surgical complication that has not been described. After frustrating medical treatment, the patient underwent computed tomography and nerve stimulator-guided blockade of vagal and phrenic nerves on each side separately. Hiccup ceased only after blockade of the right phrenic nerve with 4 ml/h l% ropivacaine and relapsed soon after discontinuation. He underwent thoracoscopic right phrenicectomy, which rendered him symptom free for well over 2 months, at the time of this writing.

Table 3.
The literature review of clinical characteristics in thyroid storm.

Considering that hiccups are not common in either DKA or TS, we speculate that the incidence of intractable hiccups is rare when DKA overlaps with TS. By carefully searching the literature, we found the following related cases. A case of TS associated with Graves' disease masked by DKA in a 59-year-old woman was reported by Osada et al. However, this patient had no history of diabetes, Graves' disease or respiratory failure compared with the present patient. Management of the functional gastrointestinal tract in patients with severe thyrotoxicosis represents a difficult but significant clinical challenge associated with a high mortality rate. Monteiro et al. reported a 70-year-old male who was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and TS. The patient presented gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, asthenia, psychomotor retardation and generalized decrease in muscle strength but no hiccups. Ahmed et al. reported a case of hiccups as an extremely rare presentation of thyrotoxicosis in Graves' disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a woman with DKA who developed TS by intractable hiccups that subsequently induced respiratory failure.

### Persistent hiccup associated with intrathecal morphine infusion pump therapy [^112AotvR]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Intraspinal drug-delivery therapy has been increasingly used in patients with intractable nonmalignant pain syndromes during the past two decades. Morphine, the only FDA-approved opioid for intrathecal administration, has been the principle agent for such therapy. Although intrathecal morphine infusion can produce profound spinal analgesia, it may also cause some untoward side effects. We describe the first case of persistent hiccup caused by intrathecal morphine infusion therapy.

### Use of baclofen in the treatment of esophageal stent-related hiccups [^116LFT3S]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Hiccupping is a characteristic noise caused by a sudden closure of the glottis after repeated, involuntary, spasmodic contraction of the respiratory muscles. Hiccupping caused by gastric distention, spicy foods, and neural dysfunction often resolves itself without any treatment. Some hiccups are associated with certain diseases or occur postsurgically, and life-restricting intractable hiccups should be treated. The cause of hiccups should be expressly stated for treatment. We report a case of inoperable esophagogastric junction tumor with hiccupping after esophageal stent that could only be treated with baclofen.

### Intractable hiccups as a rare gastrointestinal manifestation in severe endocrine and metabolic crisis: case report and review of the literature [^114Mx6XX]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

DKA can cause hiccups, although this is quite rare in clinical practice and the mechanism is also not clear. Therefore, we speculate that the intractable hiccups in the present patient was likely caused by severe endocrine and metabolic diseases. The other possible reason is that intractable hiccups may be an early rare clinical manifestation in patients with TS.

TS manifests as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome often triggered by severe conditions, including accompanying illness, radiation thyroiditis, DKA, toxaemia of pregnancy or perioperative events. The diagnosis of TS is usually based on the Burch–Wartofsky score in patients with severe and life-threatening manifestations of hyperthyroidism. DKA concurrent with TS is relatively uncommon in clinical practice; it commonly occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes but not type 2 diabetes. Based on weight status, glycated haemoglobin of 11% and the oral glucose tolerance test, the present patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Examination results on admission suggested that her hyperthyroidism and blood glucose were poorly controlled. Acute tracheobronchitis is a common high-risk factor for DKA and TS that is worsened by abnormal glucose metabolism and increased oxygen consumption. DKA can be effectively corrected by fluid infusion and glucose control. Treatment goals for TS are reduction of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones, control of peripheral effects, resolution of systemic manifestations and treatment of the precipitating illness. In our case, hydrocortisone was immediately used to control the peripheral effects of thyroid hormone, and the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormone was inhibited by propylthiouracil. Nonetheless, a long time, approximately five half-lives of thyroid hormones, may be needed for thyroid function to recover from TS, until thyroid hormone production has been suppressed by anti-thyroid medications. The half-life of thyroid hormones is as long as 6.7 ± 0.7 days in normal subjects but 4.4 ± 1.1 days in patients with hyperthyroidism. Thus, upper respiratory tract infection and continuous gastrointestinal disease worsen the condition and cause the disease state to develop into a vicious circle. In the hyperthyroid state, the insulin level decreases because of the increase in the glomerular filtration rate, and the ratio of C-peptide to proinsulin is very low. These factors aggravate the underlying abnormal glucose metabolism and intensify insulin deficiency, which in this case served as a trigger for the onset of DKA. It has been reported that the identification of TS tends to be delayed in patients with DKA because of suppression by fever, and relatively low thyroid hormone levels. Our patient presented a high fever even after DKA was corrected, and this clinical presentation might delay the diagnosis of TS. In addition, thyroid hormones may decrease the possible compensation mechanism, leading to multi-organ dysfunction.

### Intractable hiccups as a rare gastrointestinal manifestation in severe endocrine and metabolic crisis: case report and review of the literature [^117EFmap]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

TS has been reported in 0.20 people per 100,000 in the Japanese population annually and occurs in 0.22% of patients with thyrotoxicosis.TS is a life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism that has a very high mortality rate of 8–25%. Symptoms and signs of endocrine crisis may overlap with those of other severe disease states. In general, failure to recognize endocrine crises results in delayed diagnosis, and a lack of rapid specific therapy may have fatal consequences. Therefore, the early identification of TS is very important to reduce the mortality rate. TS is characterized by decompensation of multiple organ functions, leading to severe clinical manifestations such as high fever, disturbed consciousness, marked tachycardia, congestive heart failure, and gastrointestinal and hepatic disturbances.TS usually occurs in patients with previously undiagnosed or poorly treated hyperthyroidism, even subclinical hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease is a leading cause of TS and may be the first clinical presentation. The usual cause of TS is associated with infection, withdrawal of anti-thyroid drugs, radioiodine therapy, surgical procedure and severe emotional stress. Common clinical manifestations are central nervous system manifestations and gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Diarrhoea is the most common gastrointestinal symptom in thyrotoxicosis as well as in TS. The literature related to TS was searched from 2016 to 2019, and the clinical characteristics of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with TS were found to mainly be nausea, and the main cause of TS to be Graves' disease with unknown or poor compliance with anti-thyroid drugs (Table 3). -

### Case report: two cases of persistent hiccups complicating COVID-19 [^117PVT2C]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Case 1.

A 60-year-old man was admitted with hiccups lasting for 3 days. The patient had no fever, cough, sore throat, chest tightness, or shortness of breath. He arrived at the neurology department with a complaint of hiccups. His neurological examination and magnetic resonance images of the head were normal. The patient was then referred to the internal medicine department for a differential diagnosis of hiccups. The patient had no previous history of chronic diseases such as gastrointestinal, neurological, or anxiety disorders; or benzodiazepine or opioid use. He reported no alcohol intake and he was not a smoker. His blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, his respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min, his heart rate was 96 beats/min, his temperature was 36.7°C, and his arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. He had a regular heart rhythm. ENT and abdominal examinations were normal. There were obvious moist crackles during auscultation of the inferior lobes of the lung. Routine blood test results were as follows: white blood cells, 4.07 × 10⁹ cells/L; neutrophils, 67.7%; lymphocytes, 18.4%; total number of lymphocytes, 0.75 × 10⁹ /L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 50 mg/L; potassium, 4.8 mmol/L; sodium, 142 mmol/L; urea, 38 mg/dL; serum creatinine (Cr), 0.97 mg/dL; D-dimer, 419 ng/mL; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 78 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 33 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 272 U/L; ferritin, 761 ng/mL; and troponin, 13.6 pg/mL. Blood tests for rapid detection of influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus were all negative. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was normal.

### Intractable hiccups as a rare gastrointestinal manifestation in severe endocrine and metabolic crisis: case report and review of the literature [^115vWaJv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In the present case, evaluation results on the usual causes of intractable hiccups were negative. Firstly, we excluded almost all neurologic causes with computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid examination. Neither acute haemorrhagic nor ischaemic lesions was found in the patient. Secondly, because area postrema syndrome, as one typing of neuromyelitis optica, may be characterized by intractable hiccup, nausea and vomiting that cannot be explained by other causes, MR imaging shows a T2-hyperintense in dorsal medulla/area postrema lesion, the cause of hiccup in this patient should be considered. However, AQP4-IgG monitoring was not conducted because MR imaging did not show positive manifestation, and cerebrospinal fluid examination was not found abnormal. Importantly, the hiccup was eventually relieved after aggressive treatment on TS. All these do not support the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica. Thirdly, negative CT scan of chest excluded pleurisy, pneumonia, enlarged lymph nodes, mediastinitis, mediastinal tumour. Fourthly, some digestive system diseases which may cause hiccup, such as abdominal abscess, pancreatitis, biliary tract diseases, abdominal tumours, intestinal obstruction, have been excluded with clinical manifestation and CT scan of the abdomen. Gastroscopy was not performed because the patient's severe clinical condition would not have tolerated it. Furthermore, proton pump inhibitor and gastric mucosal protectants cannot take effect to hiccups, which was supported that peptic ulcer, gastritis, duodenitis might not be the reason of hiccups. Finally, acute myocardial infarction was not considered because the patient's clinical symptoms, electrocardiogram and myocardial zymogram were not supported.

### The experience of live-remote exercise-perspectives after cancer treatment [^116ws198]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

"It's good if you are physically active", that's all that was said. So I tried to ask more, "So, how physically active should I be, should I walk ten thousand steps a day?" The response was, "No, that's far too much. If you are just a little bit active, you'll be fine. If you're taking walks, then that's enough". (Female, 47, breast cancer)

Despite not receiving specific advice, the participants generally expressed a lack of concern about engaging in exercise after cancer treatment. In fact, before the start of the EX-MED Cancer exercise intervention, they eagerly anticipated it. However, several participants reported feeling uncertain about their own ability to exercise due to the physical toll of treatment, describing needing a push to dare to really exert themselves.

It was like you needed a little push to even dare to really try, really dare to go for it, because it's one thing to go out for a fast walk, but it's another thing to push yourself almost to the max. (Female, 45, breast cancer)

The first exercise session was really challenging for some, and they questioned whether they would make it through the 12-week programme. Nonetheless, they had confidence in the expertise of the programme facilitators and were even surprised at their own ability to perform the exercises, which they felt improved with each session.
2) Bringing exercise closer

Interestingly, the participants did not encounter significant difficulties when using the videoconferencing platform Teams for exercising. Although a few mentioned occasional technical hiccups, they found these issues easily resolvable and not disruptive to the exercise sessions. They attributed this to the prevalence of videoconferencing technology usage in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which made them more accustomed to its use in various settings. The participants expressed gratitude for the virtual format, as it removed some of the barriers that had previously deterred them from going to an on-site facility. However, some scepticism was expressed before the start of the intervention regarding exercising "in front of a screen" and there were doubts about the intensity of the workout. Nonetheless, participants were surprised to discover that they experienced an effective workout.

### Nasocardiac reflex-induced resolution of persistent hiccups via intranasal swab stimulation: a case report [^1148RcZg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hiccups are a common respiratory reflex experienced by most individuals at some point in their lives and are typically self-limiting. In emergency department treatment, vagal maneuvers are usually the first-line approach; if unsuccessful, pharmacologic therapies are considered. We present a case of persistent hiccups successfully resolved through vagal stimulation induced by the nasocardiac reflex following nasopharyngeal stimulation with an intranasal swab. A 31-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 72-h history of hiccups. Prior to arrival, she had attempted various vagal maneuvers without relief. Nasopharyngeal stimulation was performed via the right nostril using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab. The hiccups ceased approximately five seconds into the procedure. Additionally, the patient experienced a 28% decrease in heart rate and a 22% reduction in systolic blood pressure compared to pre-procedure values. The patient was contacted by phone at 48 h, and no recurrence was reported. Although various vagal maneuvers are utilized in the management of hiccups, the role of the nasocardiac reflex has not been clearly defined. Nasopharyngeal stimulation using a PCR swab may offer a simple and safe alternative for patients with persistent hiccups. This approach also raises the possibility that PCR-induced nasocardiac reflex stimulation could serve as an alternative method in other conditions where vagal maneuvers are used, such as supraventricular tachycardia. Moreover, this method may reduce patient discomfort and potentially decrease emergency department visits.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (2%) are transient hypotension and hypertension. The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:

· Anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

· Residual paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]

· Myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]

· Increased pulmonary vascular resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Clinical studies in the U.S. (n = 1137) and Europe (n = 1394) totaled 2531 patients. The patients exposed in the U.S. clinical studies provide the basis for calculation of adverse reaction rates. The following adverse reactions were reported in patients administered rocuronium bromide (all events judged by investigators during the clinical trials to have a possible causal relationship):

Adverse reactions in greater than 1% of patients: None

Adverse reactions in less than 1% of patients (probably related or relationship unknown):

Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, abnormal electrocardiogram, tachycardia

Digestive: nausea, vomiting

Respiratory: asthma (bronchospasm, wheezing, or rhonchi), hiccup

### Intractable hiccups as a rare gastrointestinal manifestation in severe endocrine and metabolic crisis: case report and review of the literature [^112zFbix]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 55-year-old female was transferred to the emergency department with chief complaints of nausea, vomiting and expectoration. In addition, she also presented with cough, palpitation, hyperhidrosis, dizziness, anorexia, poor sleep and weight loss of 5 kg. The patient had no history of diabetes but a recent diagnosis of hyperthyroidism with methimazole treatment (10 mg tid) in another hospital. Before referral from a community hospital, laboratory results revealed the following: pH 7.23; serum blood glucose level 15.4 mmol/L; β-hydroxybutyric acid level 4.0 mmol/L (normal reference range of 0.0–1.0 mmol/L); and severely positive urine ketones. The patient was diagnosed with DKA, type 2 diabetes, hyperthyroidism and upper respiratory tract infection in the community hospital.

The patient was admitted with signs of dehydration; she was awake and alert, ill looking, had an active position, and answered correctly to inquiries; her body mass index was 24.4 kg/m². Regarding vital signs, she had a body temperature of 36.9°C, blood pressure of 146/80 mmHg, heart rate of 105 beats/min and respiration rate of 20 times/min. The thyroid gland showed no enlargement or murmur. Her breath sound was rough. Assessments of muscular strength, visual fields and postural tremor were unremarkable.

Based on whole blood count analysis, the total amount of leucocytes was 14.61 × 10⁹ /L, and the percentage of neutrophil granulocytes was 83.6%. The blood lactic acid level was 1.02 mmol/L (the normal reference range was 0.60–2.20 mmol/L). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was 0.9 mg/L, and serum procalcitonin was 0.04 ng/mL (Table 1). Urinalysis, electrocardiography, and liver and kidney function analyses were unremarkable. Thyroid ultrasound scanning showed a normal size with a heterogeneous, reduced echo and abundant flow signals, with no nodules. Thyroid function tests revealed very high tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine levels under the normal range of undetectable thyroid-stimulating hormone (Table 2). Immediate treatments included rehydration, anti-infection (levofloxacin, 0.6 g intravenous guttae qd), glycaemic control and anti-thyroid therapy (methimazole and propranolol). Her blood glucose was adjusted to the range of 5.0–14.0 mmol/L; blood plasma β-hydroxybutyric acid was controlled at approximately 1.1–3.8 mmol/L.

### Evaluation of the forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool to stop hiccups [^115sJvB7]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

A total of 249 responses were validated, with a mean (SD) age of 30.9 (19.3) years (range, 1–90 years), primarily adult (175 of 249 participants [70.3%]), female (126 of 249 participants [50.6%]), and White (197 of 249 participants [79.1%]). Most participants (69.5%) reported hiccups at least once a month, and most (65.9%) had hiccups of less than a 2-hour duration. FISST stopped hiccups in nearly 92% cases and was rated favorably compared with home remedies across all demographic characteristics, hiccup frequencies, and hiccup durations (Table). The mean (SD) subjective effectiveness score of FISST was 4.58 (0.90) in the sample of participants who responded, with 183 of 203 participants (90.1%) rating it favorably (4 or 5) compared with home remedies. The mean (SD) satisfaction was 4.57 (1.61), with 226 of 249 participants (90.8%) rating FISST more feasible than home remedies (4 or 5). No adverse effects were reported.

### Wavelet principal component analysis of fetal movement counting data preceding hospital examinations due to decreased fetal movement: a prospective cohort study [^1153KgNB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Ethical approval

This study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics (S-08694d, 2008/18353, 06.26.2009). All participants provided written informed consent.

Instruments and measures

Demographic and obstetric information for each participant was obtained from antenatal pregnancy charts and hospital records. The details and rationale for the FM counting method used in this study (FEMINA protocol) have been presented in detail previously. A designated research midwife informed participants about FM and instructed them in the use and interpretation of the FM chart (Additional file 1). Each woman was instructed to count FM daily from pregnancy week 24 until delivery using the count-to-ten procedure. She was encouraged to count within the same two hour period every day at a time when she knew her baby was usually active. The mother initiated counting when she perceived the first movement, and then recorded the time needed to count the additional nine movements (in minutes) on the FM chart (Figure 2). All movements counted as kicks, simultaneous kicks and rolling movements counted as a single kick, and hiccups were disregarded. Women were advised to be attentive to significant and sustained reductions in normal fetal activity, which took priority over any formal DFM limit. If women were worried about their baby, regardless of reason, they should seek advice and help from their doctor or midwife. If they were concerned because their baby was less active as weeks went by, they should bring their kick count form to their next pregnancy check-up. They were instructed to contact their maternity unit directly if the baby did not kick one day (never wait until the next day) or if the baby kicked less during day/days and they perceived decreased fetal movement. They were informed that a healthy baby rarely kicks fewer than 10 times within a 2-hour period when the baby is normally active.

### Intractable hiccup and nausea in neuromyelitis optica with anti-aquaporin-4 antibody: a herald of acute exacerbations [^116nsMed]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Intractable hiccup and nausea (IHN) are unique symptoms in neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Recent studies have strongly suggested that the pathogenesis of NMO is closely associated with anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody. However, clinical implications of IHN and the relationship with anti-AQP4 antibody remain unknown.

Methods

The past medical records of 35 patients with seropositivity for anti-AQP4 antibody were reviewed. We also followed the titres of anti-AQP4 antibody in a patient with NMO, who had newly developed IHN.

Results

Of the 35 patients, 15 patients (43%) had episodes of IHN. There was a total of 35 episodes of IHN in these 15 patients and, of the 35 episodes, hiccup was seen in 23 episodes (66%) and nausea was seen in 28 episodes (80%). The IHN frequently preceded (54%) or accompanied (29%) myelitis or optic neuritis. The IHN was often preceded by an episode of viral infection. The titres of anti-AQP4 antibody were remarkably increased when the intractable hiccup appeared in a case.

Conclusions

IHN could be a clinical marker for the early phase of an exacerbation. Careful observation may be needed when INH is seen in patients with NMO, and the early initiation of the treatment could prevent subsequent neurological damage.

Gangrenous cholecystitis (GC) is a serious complication of acute cholecystitis that has been associated with increased morbidity. Patient with GC can present with a wide variety of non-specific clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics, making the diagnosis challenging. This disease requires emergent treatment, which is why a quick and reliable diagnosis is essential for the wellbeing of the patient. The authors herein present a case of GC in a patient whose initial complaint was intractable hiccups, and provide a thorough review of the literature of cases of GC with atypical presentations.

Thyroid function tests.

On the second day of hospitalization, the patient exhibited extremely sudden hiccups, profuse sweating and nausea with a high fever (39.8°C). Her heart rate was 170 beats/min (sinus rhythm). The following was sequentially implemented: fever control, metoclopramide (10 mg injection intramuscular bid), omeprazole (40 mg intravenous guttae q12h), hydrotalcite, domperidone, promethazine (25 mg injection intramuscular bid), chlorpromazine (500 mg intravenous guttae q12h), acupuncture, continuous infusion of traditional herbal drugs (Yi Wei Tang, the soup beneficial to stomach), esmolol (intravenous guttae 0.05 mg/kg per min–0.25 mg/kg per min) and rhubarb enema. Intractable hiccups were not controlled but progressively worsened. Brain computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no acute haemorrhagic or ischaemic lesions. Abdominal computed tomography scan, chest X-ray and cerebrospinal fluid examination also were negative. On the fourth day of hospitalization, the intractable hiccups progressively worsened, accompanied by mental changes. TS was diagnosed based on the Burch–Wartofsky score (total score of 60). The patient was immediately treated with hydrocortisone (100 mg/6 h), propylthiouracil (200 mg/6 h), propranolol (20 mg/8 h), paracetamol and intravenous fluids. On the sixth day of hospitalization, her intractable hiccups were still not controlled and she developed respiratory failure. Transcutaneous oxygen saturation quickly decreased to 47% (under continuous and high flux inhalation of oxygen with a facemask). Tracheal intubation was immediately performed, with artificial ventilation, and the patient became tranquil and calm. Her hiccups gradually slowed. De-ventilator and extubation were conducted after 1 week of treatment. According to the clinical manifestations and experimental examination results, Graves' disease (Table 2, Figure 1) was definitively diagnosed. The dosages of hydrocortisone, propranolol and propylthiouracil were reduced gradually, and her free T4 and T3 levels were nearly normal after 16 days of therapy (Table 2). She was maintained on a treatment with propylthiouracil (with a discharge dose of 100 mg bid) and propranolol (with 20 mg tid). She had completely recovered from her intractable hiccups 2 weeks later, and her metabolic parameters of diabetes had improved significantly. Her pulse rate was 84 beats/min, blood pressure was 118/70 mmHg, and temperature was 36.5°C when she was discharged. After a 1-year follow-up in the endocrinology department, the patient had no recurrence of hiccups.

### Persistent hiccups as main COVID-19 manifestation with transient cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum splenium during the omicron wave in the post-vaccination era [^1178qYj3]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

CLOCCs is a rare, non-specific and reversible finding on brain MRI, recently described by Tada and colleagues in 2004 that can be caused by a wide range of factors such as medications (typically antiepileptics: carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin), infections (viruses: Epstein–Barr, hantavirus, adenovirus, influenza) CNS malignancies, subarachnoid hemorrhage, metabolic disorders (acute renal failure, hypernatremia, hypoglycemia, and hepatic encephalopathy) and migraine with aura.

The splenium of the corpus callosum is particularly vulnerable due to its higher density of glutamate and cytokine receptors. The lesions usually heal within a month of the onset of symptoms.

In the past 2 years, a growing body of literature reported CLOCCs associated to COVID-19 alpha and delta variant presenting with a wide clinical spectrum ranging from rapidly developed and fatal systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) to asymptomatic patients and characterized in most of the reported cases by a mild encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesion (MERS) and to a lesser extent by a severe encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesion (SERS).

To date CLOCCs, due to its rarity and to the lack of repeated MRI scans, is likely to remain underdiagnosed and particularly in the COVID-19 era has been frequently mistaken for an ischemic lesion of the splenium of the corpus callosum.

Importantly, despite a significantly higher transmissibility due to an evolutionary very strategic combination of more than 50 mutations, COVID-19-Omicron infection in the post-COVID-19 vaccination era has been described as milder and accompanied by a modest respiratory involvement compared to COVID-19 alpha and delta variant syndrome.

However, COVID-19 Omicron-associated clinical features have not been extensively characterized.

We report the first case of COVID-19 Omicron illness post COVID-19 vaccination associated to CLOCCs and persistent hiccups in the absence of any additional neurological or respiratory sign. Importantly, hiccups has been reported in patients carrying COVID-19 alpha and delta variant mostly displaying a severe pneumonia and a peculiar endophenotype has been identified among these patients: particularly affected were male patients, with an average age between 50 and 60 years, with a mild to very severe COVID-19 pneumonia, non-smokers and without any additional clinical sign. Remarkably, due to the prevalent respiratory disease, MRI was not performed in these patients, possibly leading to CLOCCs missed diagnoses.

### Area postrema syndrome: frequency, criteria, and severity in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD [^116HeiiD]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the frequency, duration, and severity of intractable nausea, vomiting, or hiccups in aquaporin-4–immunoglobulin G (AQP4-IgG)-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and propose diagnostic criteria and a severity scale for area postrema syndrome (APS).

Methods

An International NMOSD database was interrogated for frequency of APS. Patients with AQP4-IgG–positive NMOSD completed an APS symptom questionnaire. Nausea and vomiting severity was derived from the Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis and Nausea (PUQE) score. The diagnostic criteria, severity scale, and immunotherapy response was applied to a prospective validation cohort of patients from multiple centers.

Results

Analysis of an international database for AQP4-IgG–seropositive NMOSD (n = 430) revealed a high prevalence of isolated APS attacks (onset 7.1%–10.3%; subsequent 9.4%–14.5%) across continents. For 100 patients with 157 episodes of APS, nausea (n = 127, 81%) lasted for a median of 14 days (range 2–365), vomiting (113, 72%) with a median of 5 episodes/d (2–40) lasted 1–20 minutes, and hiccups (102, 65%) lasted a median of 14 days (2–365). Symptoms consistently and completely resolved following immunotherapy. Data were used to propose APS diagnostic criteria and repurpose PUQE score (hiccups severity grade based on symptom duration). The clinical utility was demonstrated in a prospective validation cohort.

Conclusion

Isolated APS attacks are frequently encountered both at onset and during the NMOSD course. The diagnostic criteria proposed here will assist clinicians in recognizing APS. Diagnosis of an APS attack earlier than 48 hours is possible if a dorsal medulla lesion is detected. Accurate diagnosis and evaluation of APS attack severity will assist in outcome measurement in NMOSD clinical trials.

### Improving the paediatric surgery patient experience: an 8-year analysis of narrative quality data [^117424eN]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Communication

Families had different experiences with the types of information provided to them during their stay at the hospital regarding surgical processes, information about home care after discharge and information about the healing trajectory after discharge (figure 3). A majority (74%, 158/214) of comments indicated that families felt that they were provided with adequate information for them to feel comfortable at the hospital, and some felt that there were communication issues between doctors, departments and other staff which affected the care they received:

Figure 3
Communication. The experiences of families with the communication encountered during their stay at the hospital.

[There was a] hiccup, miscommunication, the right people didn't know he was scheduled for surgery. Gtube nurse didn't know he had surgery, so we had to wait to see her, didn't end up seeing her. Nurse had to sign forms for supplies, but the nurse didn't have [Patient] on list. So no supplies, and didn't actually get them for 1.5 wks.

A common discharge issue identified in the comments was that families did not feel they received enough information that prepared them for caring for their child at home after surgery (79%, 67/85) as well as not given adequate details about what would happen during the healing process (89%, 59/66):

We were discharged with no specific follow-up instructions, unless we were concerned or saw infection or other complication. [Patient] was doing very well post-op but I just wanted reassurance by having our GP look at incision.

Another example highlights the emotional aspect of the lack of communication after discharge:

When getting discharged we did not get any instructions regarding possibility of post-surgical seizures. [He] did not experience a seizure until 5 days after surgery; the night we went home to [City] 2 days prior to that he was taken off the steroids used to control the swelling. I wonder if this was why he had seizures & why we were not warned this could happen. We had no knowledge of what to do we were unprepared & frightened.

### Update on the diagnosis and treatment of neuromyelits optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD)-revised recommendations of the Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group (NEMOS). Part I: diagnosis and differential diagnosis [^112QDZVZ]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Extra-opticospinal symptoms must not lead to premature exclusion of NMOSD. Following the discovery of AQP4-IgG, the clinical spectrum was found to be much broader than initially thought and to include, although more rarely, supratentorial and brainstem encephalitis. The latter often affects the dorsal medulla oblongata, causing intractable acute or subacute nausea, vomiting and/or hiccups (either in combination or isolated; constant or episodic), the so-called area postrema syndrome (APS). APS is much less common in AQP4-IgG-negative patients with NMOSD and in MOG-EM/MOGAD. The diagnosis should be made according to the criteria proposed by Shosha et al. These require persistence of symptoms for at least 48 h if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows no evidence of acute area postrema involvement (considering both the rarity of APS as a cause of vomiting and hiccups in the general population and the broad spectrum of differential diagnoses), whereas shorter duration is deemed sufficient if MRI shows such involvement. Moreover, demonstration of a lack of complete resolution after symptomatic therapy (antiemetics, IV fluid, hiccup treatments) and exclusion of other etiologies (gastrointestinal/mediastinal, metabolic [e.g. liver or kidney dysfunction, hyponatremia], CNS tumor, stroke, migraine, psychiatric eating disorders, etc.) is required. Symptom severity may be quantified using the recently proposed APS severity scale. However, a broad spectrum of brainstem symptoms other than APS (oculomotor disturbances, facial palsy/numbness, ataxia, etc.) has also been described in patients with NMOSD, and all patients should be thoroughly examined for possible brainstem involvement. It should also be taken into account that NMOSD rarely causes diencephalic lesions that may cause hypersomnolence/narcolepsy or a syndrome of inadequate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Patients should also be screened for signs of depression, fatigue, and cognitive impairment, and, if these are found, neuropsychological/neuropsychiatric consultation should be considered. Cerebral manifestations may also include headache, and, very rarely, epileptic seizures (with the latter being more frequent in MOG-EM/MOGAD than in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD). Extra-opticospinal symptoms are relatively rare at onset both in AQP4-IgG-positive and in AQP4-IgG-negative patients (e.g. 4% in a German cohort and 9% in a Chinese study), but many patients develop one of them at least once over the course of disease.

### Area postrema syndrome: frequency, criteria, and severity in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD [^112ng6DA]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are a clinically and radiologically defined group of CNS inflammatory autoimmune demyelinating diseases, the majority of which are associated with a pathogenic antibody specific for the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channel.NMOSD-typical brain MRI lesions occur in AQP4-enriched areas, including the area postrema (AP), an emetic reflex centerat the floor of the fourth ventricle that is penetrated by convoluted capillaries that lack tight endothelial junctions. The AP, via hypothalamic/brainstem connections, regulates fluid balance, osmoregulation, immunomodulation, and other important physiologic systems, and also has chemo-sensitive neurons mediating hiccups.

NMOSD lesions in the AP are associated with loss of AQP4 immunoreactivity and with inflammation, but different from spinal and optic lesions, lack demyelination and necrosis. This difference may explain the almost universal complete remission of symptoms from such lesions. Experimental ablation arrests intractable vomiting, and an increase in neuronal firing is associated with projectile vomiting. Attacks of intractable nausea, vomiting, or hiccups (INVH), in the context of a lesion in the dorsal medulla, are known as AP syndrome (APS). Up to 30% of patients will have an APS during their illness.

APS is included as a core clinical criterion for NMOSD; however, the APS phenotype (onset, frequency, duration, severity, associated symptoms, and treatment response) is not well described. Herein, we define the frequency, duration, and severity of INVH in AQP4-IgG–positive NMOSD and propose diagnostic criteria and a severity scale for APS.

### International consensus diagnostic criteria for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders [^113NFJHK]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Consensus diagnostic criteria.

Nomenclature.

The Panel reaffirmed the decision to unify the terms NMO and NMOSD. Given the greater degree of diagnostic uncertainty and potential heterogeneity of seronegative NMOSD, criteria were developed for both NMOSD with AQP4-IgG and NMOSD without AQP4-IgG. An additional category of NMOSD with unknown AQP4-IgG status may be used for patients in whom serologic testing is unavailable. The nomenclature allows for future modifications based on potential discovery and validation of other biomarkers in AQP4-IgG-seronegative patients who have otherwise typical NMOSD clinical syndromes.

Clinical presentation.

Consensus diagnostic criteria for NMOSD are presented in table 1. Table e-2 contains a glossary of terms to guide interpretation of individual components of the criteria. The criteria allow NMOSD diagnosis with occurrence of at least 1 of 6 core clinical characteristics and detection of AQP4-IgG. The core clinical characteristics each implicate 1 of 6 CNS regions: optic nerve, e28–e31 spinal cord, e27, e32–e34 area postrema of the dorsal medulla, e35 brainstem, e35–e38 diencephalon, e39–e44 or cerebrum.e45–e48 Certain clinical presentations are particularly suggestive of NMOSD: optic neuritis that is simultaneously bilateral, involves the optic chiasm, causes an altitudinal visual field defect, or causes severe residual visual loss (acuity 20/200 or worse), e49–e51; a complete (rather than partial) spinal cord syndrome, especially with paroxysmal tonic spasms, e52; and an area postrema clinical syndrome (16%–43% incidence) consisting of intractable hiccups or nausea and vomiting.e35 Clinical judgment remains necessary because no characteristic is pathognomonic. For example, altitudinal visual field defects may result from ischemic optic neuropathy and bilateral simultaneous optic neuritis may occur in MS. e53

### Cluster of Ebola cases among Liberian and U.S. health care workers in an Ebola treatment unit and adjacent hospital – Liberia, 2014 [^117N2om5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Investigation

On July 26, 2014, Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare was informed of a laboratory-confirmed case of Ebola in an HCW at an ETU located adjacent to a general hospital (hospital A) in Monrovia, Liberia; in the following 24 hours CDC was informed of two additional HCW cases at the same ETU. Concern among HCWs and patients about the possible risk for Ebola transmission resulted in suspension of hospital and ETU operations. During July 27–31, CDC conducted a rapid evaluation to identify additional cases among HCWs and possible sources of exposure at the request of the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and the humanitarian relief organizations involved in ETU and hospital A operations. Given time constraints in an evolving, somewhat chaotic epidemic environment, evaluation methods included unstructured in-person and telephone interviews with the infected HCWs, staff members and volunteers at the ETU and hospital A, and administrators, as well as onsite visits to hospital A and the ETU (at both its initial and relocated sites) (Figure). Employee work schedules were reviewed when available. Exposure risk to HCWs outside of the work environment at the ETU or hospital A were assessed through interview when possible.

Cases of Ebola were categorized as suspected, probable, or confirmed; this was consistent with the CDC Ebola virus disease case definitions in use in the field during the investigation. A suspected case was defined as fever and three or more additional symptoms (intense fatigue, myalgia, headache, nausea, difficulty in breathing or swallowing, hiccups, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea); fever with signs and symptoms of hemorrhage, or any unexplained death. A probable case was an illness meeting the suspected case definition in a person who had contact with a person with a confirmed or probable case in the past 3 weeks, or had at least fever and contact with a person with a confirmed or probable case in the past 3 weeks. A confirmed case was a suspected or probable case with laboratory evidence of Ebola virus infection by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction at the National Reference Laboratory in Liberia.

### The annoyance of singultus: a case report of a rare adverse effect after epidural steroid injection [^116LyKvG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cervical epidural steroid injections (ESIs) can provide effective pain management for patients suffering from chronic neck pain due to various pathological changes of the cervical spine. There are several rare adverse effects reported from interventional pain procedures, including persistent hiccups ("singultus"). Based on a limited number of cases, we propose a modified treatment algorithm for this adverse outcome (Fig. 3).

Case report

Singultus has been documented as an adverse effect of interventional pain procedures, including epidural steroid, facet joint, and sacroiliac joint injections. We describe the case of a general contractor who presented to our clinic with chronic neck pain and central canal stenosis. The patient received an uncomplicated lumbar ESI in the past and was recommended for a cervical interlaminar ESI. After an uneventful C6-C7 interlaminar ESI with dexamethasone, 1% lidocaine, and normal saline the patient developed singultus. Baclofen was sent to his pharmacy, but this was unsuccessful at alleviating his hiccups. The patient was subsequently started on chlorpromazine and found relief from his symptomatology.

Conclusion

Persistent hiccups after ESI or interventional pain procedures can be treated with conservative measures and non-pharmacologic methods, with escalation to therapy with baclofen, gabapentin, pregabalin, metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, other antipsychotic or antidopaminergic agents, and possible dual or triple therapy if further indicated.

### The annoyance of singultus: a case report of a rare adverse effect after epidural steroid injection [^112paKD6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Proposed non-pharmacologic therapies and "cures" for singultus encompass various approaches involving nasopharyngeal stimulation (e.g. inhalation of smelling salts, uvular stimulation), glottic stimulation (e.g. drinking multiple sips of water, chewing lemon, inhaling pepper), vagal maneuvers (e.g. fright induction, application of cold compresses), or respiratory techniques (e.g. breath-holding, rebreathing). Other options involve hypnosis, massage, electrotherapy, and acupuncture (i.e. auricular), although limited bias-free studies exist on acupuncture due to undefined study population characteristics.

A lack of high-quality evidence hampers advocating a specific pharmacologic treatment for singultus. Proton-pump inhibitors like omeprazole have been suggested as first-line therapy for persistent hiccups since as many as 80% of cases may be related to gastroesophageal reflux disease. Baclofen, gabapentin, pregabalin, metoclopramide, and chlorpromazine are also considered effective treatments for singultus. Other agents such as antipsychotics or antidopaminergics are recommended based on anecdotal cases, and combination therapy can also be considered. Since baclofen, gabapentin, and pregabalin have a lower side effect profile they are typically recommended after proton-pump inhibitors, with metoclopramide, then chlorpromazine following. However, chlorpromazine is the only pharmacologic agent approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hiccups. Chlorpromazine antagonizes dopamine in the hypothalamus, which may contribute to its role in treating singultus.

Postmarketing Experience

Adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Orapred ODT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The postmarketing experience has not raised new safety concerns beyond those already established for immediate-release prednisolone.

Common adverse reactions for corticosteroids include fluid retention, alteration in glucose tolerance, elevation in blood pressure, behavioral and mood changes, increased appetite and weight gain. (6)

### Intractable hiccups as a presenting symptom of cerebellar hemangioblastoma. case report [^115X2zPW]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

The authors report on a 52-year-old woman with a cerebellar hemangioblastoma who presented with a 2-year history of intractable hiccups. Computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance images revealed a cerebellar hemangioblastoma with compression of the brainstem at the level of the medulla oblongata. The patient has been free of hiccups and has been neurologically intact since the day after total removal of the tumor. A review of the literature on medullary lesions presenting with intractable hiccups is provided.

### Groundhog day (film) [^113eW1UH]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Plot On February 1, cynical television weatherman Phil Connors reassures his Pittsburgh viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss Western Pennsylvania. Alongside his new producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry, Phil travels to Punxsutawney for his annual coverage of the Groundhog Day festivities. He makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the "hicks" who live there, asserting that he will soon be leaving his station for a new job. On February 2, Phil awakens in the Cherry Street Inn to Sonny & Cher's "I Got You Babe" playing on the clock radio. He gives a half-hearted report on the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil and the festivities. Contrary to his prediction, the blizzard strikes the area, preventing all travel out of Punxsutawney, and although he desperately searches for a way to leave, he is forced to spend the night in the town.

The next morning, Phil wakes once more to "I Got You Babe" and the same DJ banter on the radio in his room at the Cherry Street Inn. Phil experiences the previous day's events repeating exactly and believes he is experiencing déjà vu. He again unsuccessfully attempts to leave the town and retires to bed. When he awakes, it is again February 2. Phil gradually realizes that he is trapped in a time loop of which no one else is aware. He confides his situation to Rita, who directs him to a neurologist, who in turn directs him to a psychologist; neither can explain his experiences. Phil gets drunk with locals Gus and Ralph and then leads police on a high-speed car chase before being arrested and imprisoned; the next morning, Phil awakens in the Cherry Street Inn once again.

Realizing that there are no consequences for his actions, Phil begins to spend loops indulging in binge eating, one-night stands, robbery, and other dangerous activities, using his increasing knowledge of the day's events and the town's residents to manipulate circumstances to his advantage. Eventually, he focuses on seducing the sweet-natured Rita, using the loops to learn more about and manipulate her. No matter what steps he takes, Rita rebuffs his advances, particularly when Phil tells her he loves her; Rita asserts that he does not even know her. Phil gradually becomes depressed and desperate for a way to escape the loop. He commits suicide in a variety of ways, even kidnapping Punxsutawney Phil and driving them both off a cliff. Each time, he reawakens on February 2 to "I Got You Babe". He eventually tries to explain his situation to Rita again, using his detailed knowledge of the day to accurately predict events.

Convinced, Rita spends the rest of that day's loop with Phil; she encourages him to think of the loops as a blessing instead of a curse. As they lie on the bed together at night, Phil realizes that his feelings for Rita have become sincere. He wakes alone on February 2. Phil decides to use his knowledge of the loop to change himself and others: he saves people from deadly accidents and misfortunes and learns to play the piano, sculpt ice, and speak French. Regardless of his positive actions, however, he is haunted by his inability to prevent a homeless old man from dying of natural causes. He reasoned that vampires were like normal people who did not need to adhere to ordinary rules or moral boundaries. He questioned if and when immortality would become boring or pointless, and how a person would change over time, especially if they were incapable of substantial change. He singled out men he deemed to be in arrested development, who could not outlive their adolescence.
