## Question

Management of precancerous gastric lesions

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of precancerous gastric lesions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the lesions and the Correa cascade. Then, I should verify the overarching principles of management. Next, I will examine H. pylori eradication as primary prevention. After that, I need to check diagnostic and staging strategies, including endoscopic technique and biopsy protocols. Then, I will review risk stratification for intestinal metaplasia and surveillance intervals. Next, I should confirm indications and techniques for endoscopic resection of dysplasia. Finally, I will consider special populations, post-resection management, and chemoprevention, and close with a concise, risk-stratified algorithm and key takeaways, ensuring each step is supported by current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities and the progression model. Precancerous gastric lesions include chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia, which align with the Correa cascade of gastritis to atrophy to metaplasia to dysplasia to carcinoma; this stepwise model remains foundational for risk stratification and management decisions, and I should keep it front and center as I proceed [^1171py5J] [^113VN8AE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to state the overarching principles that guide management. The three pillars are primary prevention via H. pylori eradication, secondary prevention via high-quality endoscopic detection and staging, and tertiary prevention via curative-intent endoscopic resection of dysplasia, with all decisions individualized by age, comorbidity, and life expectancy; I should confirm that these principles are consistent across contemporary European and U.S. guidelines, which they are [^116GNJAW] [^113LrWHB] [^1153G8bC].

> Next, I should review H. pylori eradication as the cornerstone. I need to ensure I cite the strength of recommendation correctly: multiple high-credibility guidelines recommend testing and eradicating H. pylori in patients with precancerous conditions or resected early gastric cancer to reduce progression and metachronous lesions; randomized and observational data show meaningful reductions in gastric cancer incidence after eradication, with effect sizes around 30–40% in some cohorts, though benefits vary by baseline risk and lesion stage [^112o35sZ] [^113s6aDd] [^111X1Qkt] [^114QaVqC].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach and staging. High-quality endoscopy with high-definition white light and image-enhanced modalities (virtual chromoendoscopy or narrow-band imaging) improves detection and guides targeted biopsies; I should confirm that MAPS III and ACG endorse this, which they do, and they also recommend systematic biopsy sampling per updated Sydney protocol with at least two antrum/incisura and two corpus biopsies in separate vials, plus additional targeted biopsies of abnormalities; photodocumentation and standardized reporting of location, extent, and morphology are essential for staging and follow-up [^113frm99] [^113iHNBy] [^116GNJAW] [^115dpwPM].

> I will now examine risk stratification for gastric intestinal metaplasia, because this drives surveillance. High-risk GIM includes corpus-extended disease, incomplete histologic subtype, OLGA/OLGIM III–IV, or additional risk factors such as first-degree family history, emigration from high-incidence regions, or persistent H. pylori; conversely, low-risk GIM is limited to the antrum without these features. I should double-check that MAPS III, BSG, and ACG align on 3-year surveillance for high-risk GIM and no routine surveillance for low-risk GIM, which they do, with some U.S. guidance allowing consideration of 3-year surveillance in select high-risk phenotypes even if not universally recommended [^116GNJAW] [^113XaxF9] [^112SaPee] [^112st72C].

> But wait, what if dysplasia is present; I need to ensure I handle that correctly. For any visible dysplasia, endoscopic resection is indicated; ESD is generally preferred for en bloc, R0 resection and accurate staging, whereas EMR may be acceptable for small, flat lesions under 10 mm with low malignancy risk; I should confirm curative criteria and when to escalate to surgery, which MAPS III and BSG detail, including submucosal invasion depth, differentiation, ulceration, size, and lymphovascular invasion as determinants of curative versus noncurative resections [^116GNJAW] [^11241GMt] [^11626MED].

> Let me consider indefinite and low-grade dysplasia without a visible lesion. I should confirm that guidelines recommend repeat high-quality endoscopy with image enhancement and systematic biopsies after H. pylori eradication, because inflammation can obscure dysplasia; up to 30% may be upstaged on re-evaluation, so I need to ensure we do not miss a higher-grade lesion masked by active gastritis [^1175gPrp] [^1112Eb6i].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In high-incidence regions or in individuals with high-risk ancestry or strong family history, population-level or targeted endoscopic screening and surveillance strategies are more compelling; I should confirm that European and Asia-Pacific guidance support selective screening and 3-year surveillance in these groups, while U.S. guidance emphasizes individualized risk assessment and opportunistic H. pylori testing in high-risk communities, including family-based testing in households of infected patients [^116GNJAW] [^1124CQrF] [^1175gPrp] [^1138b78D].

> I need to check post-resection management. After complete endoscopic resection of dysplasia or early cancer, ongoing surveillance is required; intervals are individualized by stage, differentiation, and number of lesions, but many guidelines default to 6–12 months initially, then extending if no recurrence; I should confirm that eradication of H. pylori is essential and should not delay endoscopic therapy, and that multidisciplinary review is warranted for high-risk resections to consider additional treatment such as surgery [^1175gPrp] [^112PASDr] [^114RYKRr].

> Hold on, I should verify chemoprevention outside of H. pylori. Routine use of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, or antioxidants is not recommended for gastric cancer prevention in patients with precancerous lesions; low-dose aspirin may be considered only for selected patients at high cardiovascular risk, and even then, evidence for gastric cancer prevention is limited, so I should avoid implying a chemopreventive benefit where none is proven [^115eNCqH] [^1172Uxst] [^115nscqu].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified algorithm, and I will double-check it against guidelines. For all patients with precancerous lesions, test and eradicate H. pylori and confirm eradication; for GIM, stratify risk using endoscopic extent, histologic subtype, and risk factors, surveilling high-risk GIM every 3 years and avoiding routine surveillance for low-risk GIM; for dysplasia, treat visible lesions with ESD when feasible and reassess indefinite or low-grade dysplasia without visible lesions after H. pylori eradication; for early gastric cancer meeting curative criteria, perform ESD and arrange surveillance; for noncurative features, discuss surgery or intensified surveillance in MDT [^112o35sZ] [^116GNJAW] [^112C9JGV] [^11626MED].

> Finally, I should confirm the key takeaways. H. pylori eradication is the only proven non-endoscopic intervention that reduces gastric cancer risk across the spectrum of precancerous lesions; high-quality endoscopy with image enhancement and systematic biopsies is essential for accurate staging and detection; risk-adapted surveillance focuses resources on those most likely to benefit; and ESD-based resection of dysplasia and early cancer achieves high cure rates when appropriately selected, with post-resection surveillance preventing metachronous disease; aligning practice with MAPS III, BSG, ACG, and AGA guidance ensures evidence-based care and minimizes both under- and overtreatment [^112o35sZ] [^113frm99] [^116GNJAW] [^111z3LER].

---

Precancerous gastric lesions (atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia) require a **risk-stratified approach** anchored in H. pylori eradication, high-quality endoscopy with systematic biopsies, and selective surveillance or endoscopic resection based on histology and endoscopic features [^112o35sZ] [^113frm99] [^116GNJAW]. H. pylori should be **tested and eradicated in all patients** with these lesions to reduce cancer risk, with confirmation of eradication [^112o35sZ] [^1153G8bC]. Surveillance is reserved for high-risk phenotypes (e.g. extensive atrophy/metaplasia, incomplete metaplasia, family history) at 3-year intervals, while low-risk lesions do not require routine surveillance [^116GNJAW] [^116yQgsw]. Visible dysplasia or early cancer should undergo endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for curative resection and staging, with post-resection surveillance individualized to risk [^112C9JGV] [^111z3LER]. No medications (NSAIDs, antioxidants, probiotics) are recommended for chemoprevention outside trials [^117KqVC7] [^115eNCqH].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### High-quality endoscopy

- **High-definition white-light endoscopy**: Essential for detection and characterization of precancerous lesions [^113frm99] [^113jAAar].

- **Image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE)**: Narrow-band imaging or virtual chromoendoscopy improves detection and guides targeted biopsies [^113frm99] [^115ZNEvE].

- **Systematic biopsy protocol**: Obtain at least 5 biopsies (antrum, incisura, corpus) in separate vials for histologic staging (OLGA/OLGIM) [^113iHNBy] [^1165xyDL].

---

### Histopathological assessment

Histopathology should **stage atrophy and intestinal metaplasia** using OLGA/OLGIM to stratify cancer risk [^1165xyDL] [^112sNfTt]. Dysplasia should be **graded as low or high grade** and confirmed by an expert GI pathologist, given interobserver variability [^116wUd4o] [^111jRbSm].

---

## Risk stratification

| **Risk category** | **Histological features** | **Endoscopic features** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|-|
| High risk | - Extensive atrophy/metaplasia (OLGA/OLGIM III/IV) <br/> - Incomplete intestinal metaplasia <br/> - Family history of gastric cancer | - Corpus-extended changes <br/> - Kimura-Takemoto C3 or EGGIM 5+ | - 3-year surveillance <br/> - Consider ESD for visible lesions [^116GNJAW] [^112C9JGV] |
| Intermediate risk | - Moderate atrophy/metaplasia (OLGA/OLGIM II) <br/> - Persistent H. pylori gastritis | - Antrum-restricted changes | - Consider 3-year surveillance if additional risk factors [^116GNJAW] [^111MYKoV] |
| Low risk | - Mild atrophy/metaplasia (OLGA/OLGIM I) <br/> - No additional risk factors | - Antrum-only changes | - No routine surveillance [^116yQgsw] [^115H9fgC] |

---

## Medical management

### Helicobacter pylori eradication

- **Universal testing and eradication**: Strongly recommended for all patients with precancerous lesions to reduce cancer risk [^112o35sZ] [^113s6aDd].

- **Confirmation of eradication**: Test 4+ weeks after therapy completion [^notfound].

- **Family-based approach**: Consider testing and treating household members in high-prevalence settings [^1138b78D] [^1175gPrp].

---

### Chemoprevention

Routine use of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, antioxidants, or probiotics is **not recommended** for gastric cancer prevention outside clinical trials [^117KqVC7] [^115eNCqH].

---

## Endoscopic management

### Endoscopic resection

- **Indications**: Visible dysplasia or early gastric cancer (Tis/T1a) with low risk of lymph node metastasis [^112C9JGV] [^11241GMt].

- **Technique**: ESD is preferred for en bloc resection and accurate staging; EMR for small (< 10 mm), flat lesions [^112C9JGV] [^116GNJAW].

- **Curative criteria**: R0 resection, no lymphovascular invasion, ≤ 500 μm submucosal invasion, well/moderately differentiated [^116GNJAW].

---

### Post-resection surveillance

Post-resection surveillance should be **individualized** based on histology, margins, and patient risk, typically at 6–12 months initially, then extending intervals if disease-free [^111z3LER] [^112hHkfh]. High-risk resections (positive margins, deep invasion, poor differentiation) warrant **multidisciplinary discussion** and consideration of additional therapy [^11626MED] [^114RYKRr].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Surveillance intervals are **3 years** for high-risk phenotypes (extensive atrophy/metaplasia, incomplete metaplasia, family history) [^116GNJAW] [^113XaxF9]. Low-risk lesions do not require routine surveillance, though individualized decisions may be made [^116yQgsw] [^115H9fgC]. Post-resection surveillance should be tailored to lesion stage, differentiation, and multiplicity, with shorter intervals for high-risk features [^111z3LER] [^112hHkfh].

---

## Special considerations

### Geographic and ethnic variations

In high-incidence regions (e.g. East Asia), **population-level screening and surveillance** are cost-effective [^115ZNEvE] [^111GBntg]. In low-incidence regions (e.g. Western countries), **risk-adapted strategies** focus on high-risk individuals (family history, emigrants from high-incidence regions) [^1175gPrp] [^1153G8bC].

---

### Emerging technologies

Artificial intelligence shows promise for detection and characterization but remains investigational and is **not yet routine** [^111AGPeY] [^112fZAvs]. Advanced endoscopic imaging (e.g. confocal laser endomicroscopy) is under study for **real-time histology** [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **H. pylori eradication**: Universal testing and treatment with confirmation of eradication [^112o35sZ] [^1117qsn9].

- **High-quality endoscopy**: HD-WLE with IEE and systematic biopsies for staging [^113frm99] [^113iHNBy].

- **Risk-stratified surveillance**: 3-year intervals for high-risk lesions; no routine surveillance for low-risk lesions [^116GNJAW] [^116yQgsw].

- **Endoscopic resection**: ESD for visible dysplasia/early cancer meeting curative criteria [^112C9JGV] [^11241GMt].

- **Post-resection surveillance**: Individualized intervals based on histology and risk [^111z3LER] [^112hHkfh].

- **No chemoprevention**: Avoid NSAIDs, antioxidants, or probiotics outside trials [^117KqVC7] [^115eNCqH].

---

Effective management of precancerous gastric lesions hinges on **H. pylori eradication**, **risk-adapted surveillance**, and **curative endoscopic resection** of dysplasia, with care individualized to patient risk, comorbidities, and preferences [^112o35sZ] [^116GNJAW] [^112C9JGV].

The means for screening to decrease the burden from gastric cancer

Historically, there has been some confusion around the definitions and terminology of gastric cancer screening either in terms of the target group or target lesions. Often screening terminology has been inappropriately used when referring to pretesting of symptomatic individuals to decide whether or not to refer them for upper endoscopy. Depending on the approach, screening could be aimed at different target lesions — that is, screening could be aimed at cancer itself, precancerous lesions or the presence of the main causative risk factor — H. pylori infection. Those different target lesions and modalities are demonstrated in figure 1.

Figure 1
Potential approaches to screening for decreasing the burden of gastric cancer

Eradication of H. pylori infection falls under the primary prevention of gastric cancer, while screening for cancer or precancerous lesions is secondary prevention. Therefore, when discussing gastric cancer screening, we tend not to differentiate between the types of prevention.

According to the European Council recommendation, screening is the process of testing for diseases in people in whom no symptoms have been detected. The presence of H. pylori infection is always associated with gastritis, and H. pylori gastritis is an infectious disease according to the current guidelines, irrespective of symptoms. Therefore, a screen and treat strategy is a screening strategy for H. pylori gastritis not for gastric cancer itself. This strategy is very similar to that for cervical cancer screening as the European Commission is recommending testing for human papilloma virus as a primary intervention to prevent cervical cancer.

The appropriate terminology for managing the potential infection should be used as follows:

Screen and treat strategy — searching for H. pylori in the general population — that is, screening individuals without symptoms of the disease or previous related medical history (including family history) and treating those who tested positive for the infection.

Test and treat — traditionally has been applied to symptomatic subjects without alarm symptoms and younger than 50 years with the objective of treating those found to be positive for H. pylori. However, the term could be used also in case-finding settings (individual level) outside organised screening programmes.

Test and scope — generally applies to symptomatic individuals and involves referral of those with positive H. pylori test results for further investigation — that is, upper endoscopy.

### Adherence to clinical practice guidelines for management of epithelial precancerous conditions and lesions in the stomach in Europe [^1132Km8v]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The first international guideline for managing preneoplastic conditions of the stomach (MAPS I) was published in 2012, followed by an update (MAPS II) in 2019. As adherence to these guidelines remains uncertain, we evaluated adherence by comparing the management of preneoplastic gastric conditions before and after the introduction of MAPS I and II in selected European centers.

Patients data were retrieved from nine endoscopy units in seven European countries during three periods: pre-MAPS I (2010/2011), post-MAPS I (2017/2018), and post-MAPS II (2022/2023). Screening and dyspepsia-related endoscopies were included. Data on endoscopy, histopathology, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) treatment, and surveillance were collected using a standardized form. Adherence to nine MAPS recommendations was assessed, with improvement defined as a ≥ 10% increase in guideline-concordant management.

Results

A total of 2,426 patients were included. Over the years, most centers (57%) improved in 7/9 recommendations. Virtual chromoendoscopy use improved in six centers, with four reporting its use in > 50% of cases. All centers improved in performing biopsies from the antrum and corpus, five conducted random biopsies in nearly all patients, and four performed these plus an incisura biopsy in > 90% of cases. Endoscopic scores for patient stratification were rarely used, while five centers improved in histological scoring or intestinal metaplasia subtyping. H. pylori treatment recommendation remained high (71%-100%), and endoscopic surveillance adherence improved in 4/7 centers.

Conclusions

Adherence to MAPS guidelines improved in most centers. However, gaps in virtual chromoendoscopy, targeted biopsies, and endoscopic/histopathological scoring remain, potentially affecting surveillance recommendations. This underscores the need for a more tailored approach to enhance implementation.

### Is gastric cancer preventable? [^117Dgf4r]. Gut (2004). Low credibility.

Gastric cancer is a major health burden worldwide and prevention is the most promising strategy to control the disease. The available scientific evidence indicates that curing Helicobacter pylori infection results in a modest retardation of the precancerous process but does not prevent all cancers. Individuals at the highest risk should be cured of their infection and monitored endoscopically to detect dysplasia and "early" cancer, amenable to successful treatment.

### Chinese consensus report on family-basedInfection control and management (2021 edition) [^111k6n15]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the consensus statements and conclusions being well supported by the current available evidence, this strategy has limitations. First, the concept of family-based H. pylori infection control and management is introduced to the field for only several years before reaching current consensus; therefore, experience from this practice is very limited and future refinement is necessary. Second, this consensus is based on and for the setting of China and areas with high infection rates and related disease burden; some of the statements may not be suitable for other countries or areas, as infection condition and treatment strategies vary greatly between different countries or communities. Third, available evidences supporting the strategy on health economics/cost-effectiveness, and several other statements are actually weak, and they are in much need to be improved and strengthened by future investigations. Fourth, massive population-wide eradication-related problems, such as antibiotic resistance, drugs' adverse effects and refractory cases, may increase with the increasing number of patients treated, which deserves serious attention from clinicians, pharmacists and health administrative officials. This version of the consensus will need to be improved and revised based on future clinical practice and evidence-based medicine.

For future perspectives, there are several important areas that need to be improved: first, one critical issue discussed in statement 6 is that if H. pylori might induce gastric mucosal precancerous lesions in children and adolescents, and if the CagA-positive and VacA-positive strains might have different effects compared with CagA-negative and VacA-negative strains in inducing gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia in this population, future investigations in these areas are critical to provide evidence to guide future clinical practice and consensus recommendations. Second, another statement that caused much debate and barely passed the consensus is statement 10, which tackles the problem if concurrent treatment of H. pylori -infected family members might reduce the chance of reinfection among family members. As large-scale, randomised controlled clinical trials are actually lacking in these areas, further studies are required for more convincing evidence. Third, future investigations on the molecular mechanisms that H. pylori infection induced gastric precancerous lesion and cancer are critically important to increase our understanding on the carcinogenesis, and to help identify therapeutic targets for intervention and prevention. Fourth, techniques for reliable diagnosis methods for H. pylori infection, confirmation of eradication, and detection drug resistance to guide antibiotics selections are also needed for more convenient and easy access; future development in these areas is of great value to assist accurate detection and susceptibility-guided H. pylori eradication.

### Where are we with gastric cancer screening in Europe in 2024? [^117VxcF1]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Now also in the recommendations of the European Commission

Until recently, European countries have been following the 2003 Council of the European Union Recommendation on Cancer Screening, including breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screenings. In late 2022, the Council issued a new recommendation, 'Council recommendation on strengthening prevention through early detection: a new EU approach on cancer screening replacing Council Recommendation 2003/878/EC'. In addition to the previously recommended screening programmes, three new programmes have been recommended — that is, for lung, prostate and gastric cancers. The details of how each of the programmes has to be implemented, have still to be elaborated.

Specifically for gastric cancer, the recommendation states as follows: ' Screen and treat strategies for Helicobacter pylori, including implementation studies, should be considered in those countries or regions inside countries with high gastric cancer incidence and death rates. Screening should also address strategies for identification and surveillance of patients with precancerous stomach lesions unrelated to Helicobacter pylori infections'. There is a minor inconsistency with formulation of this recommendation. Since most high-risk precancerous lesions are related to H. pylori, screening 'strategies for identification and surveillance' would target patients with precancerous lesions irrespective of the presence or absence of the infection.

This Council recommendation has been subject to a thorough scientific review conducted by SAPEA (Science Advice for Policy by European Academies) on the request of the Scientific Advice Mechanism of the European Commission and followed by extensive consultations with the member states of the EU. In March 2022, two documents were published: SAPEA Evidence Review Report No. 10 'Cancer Screening in the European Union'and Scientific Opinion No. 12 by the Group of Chief Scientific Advisors 'Cancer screening in the European Union'.

The SAPEA experts have identified that there is insufficient evidence to recommend endoscopic screening for gastric cancer in Europe, but the screen and treat strategy for reducing H. pylori infection provides an opportunity to prevent gastric cancer in EU member countries with intermediate to high gastric cancer incidence. The report of the Scientific Advice Mechanism endorses the statement by emphasising the importance of the population-based screen and treat approach for H. pylori as the only strategy that could be recommended in regions with intermediate to high gastric cancer incidence. Additionally, the report emphasises the importance of following available guideline recommendations for endoscopy referrals in groups at risk to maximise the opportunities for earlier diagnosis.

### Asian pacific association of gastroenterology task force recommendations on surveillance forassociated gastric premalignant conditions [^1124CQrF]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The burden of gastric cancer remains substantial in Asia. Gastric premalignant conditions, including chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia, are important intermediate stages in the gastric carcinogenesis cascade. The sojourn time allows endoscopic surveillance to have a pivotal role in early detection and timely intervention.

Objective

This task force was commissioned by the Asian Pacific Association of Gastroenterology to formulate recommendations for the surveillance and management of Helicobacter pylori associated gastric premalignant conditions in the region.

Design

A systematic literature review was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase, focusing on studies related to gastric premalignant conditions and their surveillance, particularly from Asia. The evidence quality and strength of recommendations were appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.

Results

These recommendations address four key aspects of gastric premalignant condition surveillance: (1) epidemiology and risk factors; (2) endoscopic and histopathological diagnosis; (3) risk stratification and endoscopic surveillance strategies; and (4) management strategies. 28 statements were made after multiple rounds of voting by experts. The statements offer a comprehensive, evidence based framework designed to assist clinicians in the Asia Pacific region on the early detection and management of gastric premalignant conditions.

Conclusion

These statements aim to provide a structured, evidence based surveillance framework for clinical practice in the Asia Pacific region, while also identifying priority areas for future research.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the diagnosis and management of patients at risk of gastric adenocarcinoma [^113VN8AE]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastric adenocarcinoma is a major cause of cancer mortality worldwide. In the UK in 2016, there were 5314 cases of gastric cancer, which has been declining gradually with the incidence of H. pylori infection. Although there has been a decline in the incidence over the past 50 years, studies have demonstrated an increasing incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma among young white people in the USA, alongside a Swedish study demonstrating an increasing incidence of premalignant gastric lesions among adults aged 35–44 years. These studies may suggest that historically declining gastric adenocarcinoma incidence rates may alter. At present within the UK, gastric cancer is the 16th most common cancer, within Europe it is the sixth most common cancer, and worldwide it is the fifth most common. Importantly, with the exception of Japan and South Korea, the majority of gastric cancers worldwide are diagnosed at a late stage, resulting in poor prognosis with a 29% average 5-year survival. The UK all-stage average 5-year survival rate is 18%, compared with an 80% average 5-year survival for stage 1A. Clearly, Japan's earlier stage of diagnosis and superior 5-year survival highlight the need for earlier recognition and treatment to overcome this bleak prognosis.

The key to having a significant impact on the prognosis of gastric cancer and its global economic burden is to accurately identify the individuals who are at greatest risk and intervene, before gastric cancer development, through recognised efficacious treatments, including endoscopic resection. The canonical model for cancer progression in the stomach is the Correa sequence, which outlines a stepwise linear progression from chronic gastritis through GA, GIM, dysplasia and finally, invasive cancer. This model was amended to involve the role of H. pylori as the prime causative environmental agentand has remained the dominant model since. Diagnosis and surveillance of higher risk patients in this cascade have been proposed as a strategy to reduce the mortality and morbidity of gastric adenocarcinoma.

The first international guidelines on the management of precancerous conditions and lesions in the stomach (MAPS) were published in 2012 by an international guidelines development group. These have not yet been revised. There is significant heterogeneity of practice in the management of premalignant and early malignant gastric lesions in the UK, partly because few endoscopists follow MAPS guidance.

### Recent US gastric cancer prevention recommendations: advances, unanswered questions, and the need for a unified approach [^113xiqy7]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the past year, two major American gastroenterology societies have introduced pivotal updates to their recommendations for gastric cancer (GC) prevention. – The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) released new guidelines on Helicobacter pylori management, recommending screen-and-treat to individuals at high-risk for GC, as well as guidelines on the management of gastric precursor lesions. Moreover, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) issued a clinical practice update (CPU) focusing on endoscopic screening and surveillance of high-risk groups for GC. These updates represent important advances in the rapidly evolving landscape of GC prevention. However, key differences in focus — between H pylori screen-and-treat vs endoscopic screening — may leave health care providers uncertain which to prioritize and which populations to consider for these interventions. In this commentary, we aim to provide a perspective on GC prevention integrating these recommendations, highlighting the unanswered questions they raise, and proposing new research avenues.

### Where are we with gastric cancer screening in Europe in 2024? [^1116WGMy]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Basic principles for cancer screening in Europe

In Europe, only organised, properly governed, population-based and quality-assured screening programmes are recommended. Recently, an international consensus has been established on 16 essential criteria for an 'organised' cancer screening programme. Among others, the following criteria have been included: (a) protocol/guideline should be available, describing target populations, screening intervals, screening tests, referral pathways and management of positive cases; (b) the target population should be identifiable and there should be a system for inviting the eligible individuals for screening; (c) performance indicators should be present and the performance of the system should be evaluated and audited against them; (d) proper governance and quality assurance should be in place. Most of the cancer screening programmes in Europe have followed these recommended criteria for cancer screening programmes until now (breast, cervical, colorectal cancers), yet these criteria are not in place for gastric cancer screening. There are still some gaps in our knowledge of the required indicators before evidence-based protocols or guidelines can be developed for an organised gastric cancer screening programme.

Traditionally, cancer screening has been part of secondary prevention — that is, the search for cancer or precancerous lesions in the target population. In the case of gastric cancer screening, means of either primary or secondary prevention are used and could be combined; this is further elucidated in the following paragraph.

### The road to a world-unified approach to the management of patients with gastric intestinal metaplasia: a review of current guidelines [^112sNfTt]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

During the last decade, the management of gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) has been addressed by several distinct international evidence-based guidelines. In this review, we aimed to synthesise these guidelines and provide clinicians with a global perspective of the current recommendations for managing patients with GIM, as well as highlight evidence gaps that need to be addressed with future research.

Design

We conducted a systematic review of the literature for guidelines and consensus statements published between January 2010 and February 2023 that address the diagnosis and management of GIM.

Results

From 426 manuscripts identified, 16 guidelines were assessed. There was consistency across guidelines regarding the purpose of endoscopic surveillance of GIM, which is to identify prevalent neoplastic lesions and stage gastric preneoplastic conditions. The guidelines also agreed that only patients with high-risk GIM phenotypes (eg, corpus-extended GIM, OLGIM stages III/IV, incomplete GIM subtype), persistent refractory Helicobacter pylori infection or first-degree family history of gastric cancer should undergo regular-interval endoscopic surveillance. In contrast, low-risk phenotypes, which comprise most patients with GIM, do not require surveillance. Not all guidelines are aligned on histological staging systems. If surveillance is indicated, most guidelines recommend a 3-year interval, but there is some variability. All guidelines recommend H. pylori eradication as the only non-endoscopic intervention for gastric cancer prevention, while some offer additional recommendations regarding lifestyle modifications. While most guidelines allude to the importance of high-quality endoscopy for endoscopic surveillance, few detail important metrics apart from stating that a systematic gastric biopsy protocol should be followed. Notably, most guidelines comment on the role of endoscopy for gastric cancer screening and detection of gastric precancerous conditions, but with high heterogeneity, limited guidance regarding implementation, and lack of robust evidence.

Conclusion

Despite heterogeneous populations and practices, international guidelines are generally aligned on the importance of GIM as a precancerous condition and the need for a risk-stratified approach to endoscopic surveillance, as well as H. pylori eradication when present. There is room for harmonisation of guidelines regarding (1) which populations merit index endoscopic screening for gastric cancer and GIM detection/staging; (2) objective metrics for high-quality endoscopy; (3) consensus on the need for histological staging and (4) non-endoscopic interventions for gastric cancer prevention apart from H. pylori eradication alone. Robust studies, ideally in the form of randomised trials, are needed to bridge the ample evidence gaps that exist.

### Management of precancerous conditions and lesions in the stomach (MAPS): guideline from the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE), European Helicobacter study group (EHSG), European Society of Pathology (ESP), and the sociedade portuguesa de endoscopia digestiva (SPED) [^115xcvfi]. Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and epithelial dysplasia of the stomach are common and are associated with an increased risk for gastric cancer. In the absence of guidelines, there is wide disparity in the management of patients with these premalignant conditions. The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE), the European Helicobacter Study Group (EHSG), the European Society of Pathology (ESP) and the Sociedade Portuguesa de Endoscopia Digestiva (SPED) have therefore combined efforts to develop evidence-based guidelines on the management of patients with precancerous conditions and lesions of the stomach (termed MAPS). A multidisciplinary group of 63 experts from 24 countries developed these recommendations by means of repeat online voting and a meeting in June 2011 in Porto, Portugal. The recommendations emphasize the increased cancer risk in patients with gastric atrophy and metaplasia, and the need for adequate staging in the case of high grade dysplasia, and they focus on treatment and surveillance indications and methods.

At a population level, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE), the European Helicobacter and Microbiota Study Group (EHMSG), and the European Society of Pathology (ESP) suggest endoscopic screening for gastric cancer (and precancerous conditions) in high-risk regions (age-standardized rate [ASR] > 20 per 100000 person-years) every 2 to 3 years or, if cost-effectiveness has been proven, in intermediate risk regions (ASR 10–20 per 100000 person-years) every 5 years, but not in low-risk regions (ASR < 10).ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that irrespective of country of origin, individual gastric risk assessment and stratification of precancerous conditions is recommended for first-time gastroscopy. ESGE/EHMSG/ESP suggest that gastric cancer screening or surveillance in asymptomatic individuals over 80 should be discontinued or not started, and that patients' comorbidities should be considered when treatment of superficial lesions is planned.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that a high quality endoscopy including the use of virtual chromoendoscopy (VCE), after proper training, is performed for screening, diagnosis, and staging of precancerous conditions (atrophy and intestinal metaplasia) and lesions (dysplasia or cancer), as well as after endoscopic therapy. VCE should be used to guide the sampling site for biopsies in the case of suspected neoplastic lesions as well as to guide biopsies for diagnosis and staging of gastric precancerous conditions, with random biopsies to be taken in the absence of endoscopically suspected changes. When there is a suspected early gastric neoplastic lesion, it should be properly described (location, size, Paris classification, vascular and mucosal pattern), photodocumented, and two targeted biopsies taken.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP do not recommend routine performance of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET)-CT prior to endoscopic resection unless there are signs of deep submucosal invasion or if the lesion is not considered suitable for endoscopic resection.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for differentiated gastric lesions clinically staged as dysplastic (low grade and high grade) or as intramucosal carcinoma (of any size if not ulcerated or ≤ 30mm if ulcerated), with EMR being an alternative for Paris 0-IIa lesions of size ≤ 10mm with low likelihood of malignancy.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP suggest that a decision about ESD can be considered for malignant lesions clinically staged as having minimal submucosal invasion if differentiated and ≤ 30 mm; or for malignant lesions clinically staged as intramucosal, undifferentiated and ≤ 20 mm; and in both cases with no ulcerative findings.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommends patient management based on the following histological risk after endoscopic resection: Curative/very low-risk resection (lymph node metastasis [LNM] risk < 0.5%-1%): en bloc R0 resection; dysplastic/pT1a, differentiated lesion, no lymphovascular invasion, independent of size if no ulceration and ≤ 30mm if ulcerated. No further staging procedure or treatment is recommended.C urative/low-risk resection (LNM risk < 3%): en bloc R0 resection; lesion with no lymphovascular invasion and: a) pT1b, invasion ≤ 500µm, differentiated, size ≤ 30mm; or b) pT1a, undifferentiated, size ≤ 20mm and no ulceration. Staging should be completed, and further treatment is generally not necessary, but a multidisciplinary discussion is required. Local-risk resection (very low risk of LNM but increased risk of local persistence/recurrence): Piecemeal resection or tumor-positive horizontal margin of a lesion otherwise meeting curative/very low-risk criteria (or meeting low-risk criteria provided that there is no submucosal invasive tumor at the resection margin in the case of piecemeal resection or tumor-positive horizontal margin for pT1b lesions [invasion ≤ 500 µm; well-differentiated; size ≤ 30mm, and VM0]). Endoscopic surveillance/re-treatment is recommended rather than other additional treatment. High-risk resection (noncurative): Any lesion with any of the following: (a) a positive vertical margin (if carcinoma) or lymphovascular invasion or deep submucosal invasion (> 500µm from the muscularis mucosae); (b) poorly differentiated lesions if ulceration or size > 20mm; (c) pT1b differentiated lesions with submucosal invasion ≤ 500µm with size > 30mm; or (d) intramucosal ulcerative lesion with size > 30mm. Complete staging and strong consideration for additional treatments (surgery) in multidisciplinary discussion.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP suggest the use of validated endoscopic classifications of atrophy (e.g. Kimura-Takemoto) or intestinal metaplasia (e.g. endoscopic grading of gastric intestinal metaplasia [EGGIM]) to endoscopically stage precancerous conditions and stratify the risk for gastric cancer.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that biopsies should be taken from at least two topographic sites (2 biopsies from the antrum/incisura and 2 from the corpus, guided by VCE) in two separate, clearly labeled vials. Additional biopsy from the incisura is optional.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that patients with extensive endoscopic changes (Kimura C3+ or EGGIM 5+) or advanced histological stages of atrophic gastritis (severe atrophic changes or intestinal metaplasia, or changes in both antrum and corpus, operative link on gastritis assessment/operative link on gastric intestinal metaplasia [OLGA/OLGIM] III/IV) should be followed up with high quality endoscopy every 3 years, irrespective of the individual's country of origin.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that no surveillance is proposed for patients with mild to moderate atrophy or intestinal metaplasia restricted to the antrum, in the absence of endoscopic signs of extensive lesions or other risk factors (family history, incomplete intestinal metaplasia, persistent H. pylori infection). This group constitutes most individuals found in clinical practice.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend H. pylori eradication for patients with precancerous conditions and after endoscopic or surgical therapy.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that patients should be advised to stop smoking and low-dose daily aspirin use may be considered for the prevention of gastric cancer in selected individuals with high risk for cardiovascular events.

### AGA technical review on gastric intestinal metaplasia-natural history and clinical outcomes [^111jrauQ]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

After finalizing the PICO questions, the technical review team and the guideline panel ranked outcomes by importance and prioritized outcomes critical for decision making (Table 1). Patient important outcomes of interest included both benefits and harms such as early NCGA detection, reduced morbidity/mortality from NCGA, complications associated with endoscopy, psychological outcomes (e.g. anxiety and stress related to endoscopic surveillance, coping with a precancerous condition), and resource implications (e.g. cost of surveillance).

A comprehensive list of direct and indirect evidence needed to inform the questions was developed (Table 1). The desired evidence included incidence and prevalence data for GIM, incidence of NCGA in individuals with GIM, and risk factors associated with progression to NCGA in patients with GIM compared to individuals without GIM. This "wish list of needed evidence" guided the systematic literature search. Given the presumed paucity of robust direct data on GIM in the US, evidence from all regions of the world was considered relevant in the evidence-gathering phase. Details related to the management and natural progression of dysplasia were considered outside the scope of this technical review, unless there was clear discernible clinical relevance to outcomes of GIM.

The Systematic Review Process

We reported the systematic review and the related meta-analyses results in concordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) statements. The technical review team scheduled weekly meetings to conduct the systematic review and develop the GRADE evidence profiles for each PICO question. The weekly meetings clarified and addressed issues that arose during the review process. Decisions were documented and input from the guideline panel was requested for key decisions.

Literature Search Strategy

In collaboration with a medical librarian, we defined a systematic search strategy and searched three electronic databases including Ovid MEDLINE ® Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE® Daily and Ovid MEDLINE® from 1946; Embase Classic+Embase from 1947; and Wiley's Cochrane Library. The initial search was conducted in July 2017 and updated in September 2018. The primary search terms included "stomach", "precancerous conditions", "neoplasms", "gastric/stomach mucosa", and "metaplasia". The full literature search strategy is provided in Supplementary Table 1. Additionally, we checked the references of prior systematic reviews and guidance documents to identify additional studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for precancerous gastric lesions, more specifically with respect to endoscopic surveillance, ACG 2025 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining endoscopic surveillance at 3-year intervals in patients with gastric intestinal metaplasia deemed high risk for gastric cancer. High-risk groups include patients with gastric intestinal metaplasia with at least one of the following:

- **High-risk gastric intestinal metaplasia histology**: incomplete gastric intestinal metaplasia histological subtype versus complete subtype; corpus-extension defined as corpus involvement also with antrum or incisura involvement

- any gastric intestinal metaplasia histology with one of the following risk factors for gastric cancer: family history of gastric cancer in a first-degree relative; foreign-born with emigration from a high-incidence nation; high-risk race or ethnicity including East Asian, Latino/a, Black, and American Indian or Alaska Native.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Gastric premalignant conditions (GPMC) include atrophic gastritis, gastric intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and certain gastric epithelial polyps and have an increased risk of progression to gastric adenocarcinoma. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on upper endoscopic screening for gastric cancer (GC)/GPMC detection in US populations deemed high-risk for GC. Surveillance endoscopy is recommended for individuals at high risk for GPMC progression, as defined by endoscopic, histologic, and demographic factors, typically every 3 years, but an individualized interval may be warranted. H. pylori testing, treatment, and eradication confirmation are recommended in all individuals with GPMC.

In the initial report from a randomized clinical trial, 3, 365 participants were followed in an intention-to-treat analysis. Short-term treatment with amoxicillin and omeprazole was associated with a 39% reduction in gastric cancer incidence during a period of 15 years after randomization. With follow-up to 22 years, there was a reduction in both incidence and mortality. A single-center randomized clinical trial in China included a total of 1, 676 participants who were at higher risk of developing gastric cancer because they had a first-degree relative with gastric cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin or placebo for 7 days. After 9. 2 years, this treatment regimen resulted in a reduction in gastric cancer, from
2. 7% in the placebo group to 1. 2% in the treatment group, with a hazard ratio of 0.
45.

No reduction in gastric cancer mortality was found, but the power to detect any difference was low. A randomized controlled trial of 3, 365 participants from a nutritionally deprived population showed that short-term treatment with amoxicillin and omeprazole reduced the incidence of gastric cancer by 39% during a period of 15 years following randomization. With follow-up to 22 years. The magnitude of benefit of treating H. pylori in populations with different levels of gastric cancer risk has been unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs and observational studies assessed the treatment of H. pylori with curative regimens for three different clinical scenarios:

- Asymptomatic patients.
- Patients with atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia.
- Patients who have had endoscopic treatment for cancer.

In a randomized, double-blind, chemoprevention trial in Venezuela among a population at increased risk for gastric cancer, a combination of antioxidant vitamins failed to modify progression or regression of precancerous gastric lesions. Another potential explanation for the lack of benefit of vitamin supplementation in this trial was the high prevalence of advanced premalignant lesions and the high.

Summary of statements, recommendations and suggestions

Pathogenesis, diagnosis and epidemiology of premalignant and early malignant gastric lesions

Pathogenesis and epidemiology of premalignant and early malignant gastric lesions

What are the precancerous lesions of the stomach, what is their prevalence within the UK and what risk do they confer?

Patients with GA and GIM have an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma. Increased severity of atrophy and extent of intestinal metaplasia is associated with an increased risk of cancer (evidence level: moderate quality; level of agreement: 100%).

Visible low-grade gastric dysplasia has an increased risk of prevalent HGD and gastric adenocarcinoma (evidence level: low quality; level of agreement: 100%).

Non-visible, low-grade gastric dysplasia increases the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma, but the magnitude of this risk is unknown (evidence level: low quality; level of agreement: 93%).

Gastric HGD carries a significant risk of progression to gastric adenocarcinoma (evidence level: moderate quality; level of agreement: 100%).

GA, GIM and dysplasia

For the purposes of this guideline, CAG collectively includes GA and GIM. It is important to define the histopathology of the premalignant stomach in order to understand progression to cancer and its endoscopic appearances. The normal gastric mucosa is divided into two compartments, and includes the gastrin and mucus-secreting glands of the antrum and the acid and pepsinogen-secreting oxyntic glands of the corpus. GA is defined as the loss of pre-existent glands native to the gastric compartment. The two phenotypic features of GA include the loss of glandular mass with fibrosis of the lamina propria and replacement of the native gastric glands by metaplastic or pseudopyloric glands.

The Correa cascade describes the stepwise progression of precursor lesions towards intestinal-type gastric cancer. H. pylori infection initiates the cascade through non-atrophic chronic gastritis, GA, GIM and finally, dysplasia.

### AGA technical review on gastric intestinal metaplasia-natural history and clinical outcomes [^112crBSC]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Current US-based guidelines do not recommend endoscopic screening for NCGA nor do they recommend universal surveillance of gastric precancerous lesions for the purpose of early NCGA detection.GIM is usually encountered incidentally in patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and biopsy for nonspecific symptoms (e.g. dyspepsia). Limited awareness of risk factors for NCGA, uncertainty regarding the risk factors for neoplastic progression of GIM, and unadjudicated risk versus benefit of GIM surveillance, have resulted in wide clinical practice variability in the evaluation and management of patients with GIM. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) and the European Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) have position statements on the management of gastric precancerous lesions, with the European guidelines based on a comprehensive review of the literature at the time (through November 2010) and expert consensus vote. By contrast, the ASGE position statement is limited in its recommendations on GIM management without a formal systematic review of the available literature. There is an unmet need for updated comprehensive guidelines for GIM management that are practical and relevant for the US population, particularly given the diversity of the population and potentially variable risk profiles for NCGA. Our aim is to provide a systematic and comprehensive synthesis of the literature to inform the AGA guideline panel in formulating evidence-based recommendations on the management of GIM in the absence of concurrent neoplasia (dysplasia or cancer), with a focus on the potential role of H. pylori eradication and endoscopic surveillance.

Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia (IM) are at risk for gastric adenocarcinoma. This underscores the importance of diagnosis and risk stratification for these patients. High definition endoscopy with chromoendoscopy (CE) is better than high definition white-light endoscopy alone for this purpose. Virtual CE can guide biopsies for staging atrophic and metaplastic changes and can target neoplastic lesions. Biopsies should be taken from at least two topographic sites (antrum and corpus) and labelled in two separate vials. For patients with mild to moderate atrophy restricted to the antrum there is no evidence to recommend surveillance. In patients with IM at a single location but with a family history of gastric cancer, incomplete IM, or persistent Helicobacter pylori gastritis, endoscopic surveillance with CE and guided biopsies may be considered in 3 years. Patients with advanced stages of atrophic gastritis should be followed up with a high quality endoscopy every 3 years. In patients with dysplasia, in the absence of an endoscopically defined lesion, immediate high quality endoscopic reassessment with CE is recommended. Patients with an endoscopically visible lesion harboring low or high grade dysplasia or carcinoma should undergo staging and treatment. H. pylori eradication heals nonatrophic chronic gastritis, may lead to regression of atrophic gastritis, and reduces the risk of gastric cancer in patients with these conditions, and it is recommended. H. pylori eradication is also recommended for patients with neoplasia after endoscopic therapy. In intermediate to high risk regions, identification and surveillance of patients with precancerous gastric conditions is cost-effective.

### Controlling gastric cancer in a world of heterogeneous risk [^111GBntg]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading cause of global mortality but also a cancer whose footprint is highly unequal. This review aims to define global disease epidemiology, critically appraise strategies of prevention and disease attenuation, and assess how these strategies could be applied to improve outcomes from GC in a world of variable risk and disease burden. Strategies of primary prevention focus on improving the detection and eradication of the main environmental risk factor, Helicobacter pylori. In certain countries of high incidence, endoscopic or radiographic screening of the asymptomatic general population has been adopted as a means of secondary prevention. By contrast, identification and targeted surveillance of individuals with precancerous lesions (such as intestinal metaplasia) is being increasingly embraced in nations of low incidence. This review also highlights existing knowledge gaps in GC prevention as well as the role of emerging technologies for early detection and risk stratification.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the diagnosis and management of patients at risk of gastric adenocarcinoma [^113VrRQY]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

The success of an H. pylori eradication strategy to try to prevent cancer development in patients who have premalignant gastric conditions will obviously be influenced by the success rate of the bacterial eradication regimen that is used. The choice of eradication regimen is beyond the scope of these guidelines, but its efficacy should be monitored. Regimens other than the classic triple therapy may need to be employed, particularly in geographical locations where the rates of H. pylori antibiotic resistance are known to be high.

In addition to the conventional Correa cascade of gastric carcinogenesis, there are other gastric conditions that are potentially associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer development — in particular, some gastric polyps. Although there is good evidence to suggest that H. pylori eradication leads to the regression of gastric hyperplastic polyps, no studies appear to have analysed whether this influences the subsequent risk of gastric adenocarcinoma. Studies on the effects of H. pylori eradication in patients with gastric adenomas are too small to draw any valid conclusions.

Biomarkers and gastric cancer

What biomarkers are useful in the management of these lesions?

Can they be applied to population screening, monitoring those at risk or those with known lesions?

Measurement of serum pepsinogen I and serum pepsinogen I/II ratio alone or in combination with H. pylori serology, and/or gastrin-17 can identify individuals with extensive atrophic gastritis (evidence level: low quality; grade of recommendation: weak; level of agreement: 93%).

We do not recommend the use of biomarkers as a screening tool in areas with a low incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma, such as the UK (evidence level: low quality; grade of recommendation: weak; level of agreement: 100%).

### AGA clinical practice update on screening and surveillance in individuals at increased risk for gastric cancer in the United States: expert review [^1175gPrp]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading cause of preventable cancer and mortality in certain US populations. The most impactful way to reduce GC mortality is via primary prevention, namely Helicobacter pylori eradication, and secondary prevention, namely endoscopic screening and surveillance of precancerous conditions, such as gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM). An emerging body of evidence supports the possible impact of these strategies on GC incidence and mortality in identifiable high-risk populations in the United States. Accordingly, the primary objective of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update (CPU) Expert Review is to provide best practice advice for primary and secondary prevention of GC in the context of current clinical practice and evidence in the United States.

Methods

This CPU Expert Review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute CPU Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPU Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These best practice advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these best practice advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: There are identifiable high-risk groups in the United States who should be considered for GC screening. These include first-generation immigrants from high-incidence GC regions and possibly other non-White racial and ethnic groups, those with a family history of GC in a first-degree relative, and individuals with certain hereditary gastrointestinal polyposis or hereditary cancer syndromes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Endoscopy is the best test for screening or surveillance in individuals at increased risk for GC. Endoscopy enables direct visualization to endoscopically stage the mucosa and identify areas concerning for neoplasia, as well as enables biopsies for further histologic examination and mucosal staging. Both endoscopic and histologic staging are key for risk stratification and determining whether ongoing surveillance is indicated and at what interval. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: High-quality upper endoscopy for the detection of premalignant and malignant gastric lesions should include the use of a high-definition white-light endoscopy system with image enhancement, gastric mucosal cleansing, and insufflation to achieve optimal mucosal visualization, in addition to adequate visual inspection time, photodocumentation, and use of a systematic biopsy protocol for mucosal staging when appropriate. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: H pylori eradication is essential and serves as an adjunct to endoscopic screening and surveillance for primary and secondary prevention of GC. Opportunistic screening for H pylori infection should be considered in individuals deemed to be at increased risk for GC (refer to Best Practice Advice 1). Screening for H pylori infection in adult household members of individuals who test positive for H pylori (so-called "familial-based testing") should also be considered. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: In individuals with suspected gastric atrophy with or without intestinal metaplasia, gastric biopsies should be obtained according to a systematic protocol (eg, updated Sydney System) to enable histologic confirmation and staging. A minimum of 5 total biopsies should be obtained, with samples from the antrum/incisura and corpus placed in separately labeled jars (eg, jar 1, "antrum/incisura" and jar 2, "corpus"). Any suspicious areas should be described and biopsied separately. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: GIM and dysplasia are endoscopically detectable. However, these findings often go undiagnosed when endoscopists are unfamiliar with the characteristic visual features; accordingly, there is an unmet need for improved training, especially in the United States. Artificial intelligence tools appear promising for the detection of early gastric neoplasia in the adequately visualized stomach, but data are too preliminary to recommend routine use. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Endoscopists should work with their local pathologists to achieve consensus for consistent documentation of histologic risk-stratification parameters when atrophic gastritis with or without metaplasia is diagnosed. At a minimum, the presence or absence of H pylori infection, severity of atrophy and/or metaplasia, and histologic subtyping of GIM, if applicable, should be documented to inform clinical decision making. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: If the index screening endoscopy performed in an individual at increased risk for GC (refer to Best Practice Advice 1) does not identify atrophy, GIM, or neoplasia, then the decision to continue screening should be based on that individual's risk factors and preferences. If the individual has a family history of GC or multiple risk factors for GC, then ongoing screening should be considered. The optimal screening intervals in such scenarios are not well defined. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Endoscopists should ensure that all individuals with confirmed gastric atrophy with or without GIM undergo risk stratification. Individuals with severe atrophic gastritis and/or multifocal or incomplete GIM are likely to benefit from endoscopic surveillance, particularly if they have other risk factors for GC (eg, family history). Endoscopic surveillance should be considered every 3 years; however, intervals are not well defined and shorter intervals may be advisable in those with multiple risk factors, such as severe GIM that is anatomically extensive. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Indefinite and low-grade dysplasia can be difficult to reproducibly identify by endoscopy and accurately diagnose on histopathology. Accordingly, all dysplasia should be confirmed by an experienced gastrointestinal pathologist, and clinicians should refer patients with visible or nonvisible dysplasia to an endoscopist or center with expertise in the diagnosis and management of gastric neoplasia. Individuals with indefinite or low-grade dysplasia who are infected with H pylori should be treated and have eradication confirmed, followed by repeat endoscopy and biopsies by an experienced endoscopist, as visual and histologic discernment may improve once inflammation subsides. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Individuals with suspected high-grade dysplasia or early GC should undergo endoscopic submucosal dissection with the goal of en bloc, R0 resection to enable accurate pathologic staging with curative intent. Eradication of active H pylori infection is essential, but should not delay endoscopic intervention. Endoscopic submucosal dissection should be performed at a center with endoscopic and pathologic expertise. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Individuals with a history of successfully resected gastric dysplasia or cancer require ongoing endoscopic surveillance. Suggested surveillance intervals exist, but additional data are required to refine surveillance recommendations, particularly in the United States. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Type I gastric carcinoids in individuals with atrophic gastritis are typically indolent, especially if < 1 cm. Endoscopists may consider resecting gastric carcinoids < 1 cm and should endoscopically resect lesions measuring 1–2 cm. Individuals with type I gastric carcinoids > 2 cm should undergo cross-sectional imaging and be referred for surgical resection, given the risk of metastasis. Individuals with type I gastric carcinoids should undergo surveillance, but the intervals are not well defined. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: In general, only individuals who are fit for endoscopic or potentially surgical treatment should be screened for GC and continued surveillance of premalignant gastric conditions. If a person is no longer fit for endoscopic or surgical treatment, then screening and surveillance should be stopped. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: To achieve health equity, a personalized approach should be taken to assess an individual's risk for GC to determine whether screening and surveillance should be pursued. In conjunction, modifiable risk factors for GC should be distinctly addressed, as most of these risk factors disproportionately impact people at high risk for GC and represent health care disparities.

Background

Globally, gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Regrettably, the majority of patients receive a diagnosis at advanced or late local stages, leading to poor prognoses. GC develops via a multi-step process, beginning with superficial gastritis and advancing through to chronic atrophic gastritis (AG), intestinal metaplasia (IM), low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, ultimately leading to invasive GC. According to epidemiological data, AG is a prevalent and persistent condition, often without symptoms, affecting over half of the world's population at some stage. IM significantly increases GC risks, doubling the likelihood of its occurrence. Fortunately, at gastritis and IM stages, timely detection and intervention can effectively control or even reverse the disease. However, once the disease has progressed to different intraepithelial neoplasia levels, it is difficult to manage progression with non-surgical treatments. Therefore, identifying high-risk populations at AG and IM stages is crucial for developing and implementing effective prevention and management strategies. While Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is strongly associated with gastritis and gastric disease advancement, it does not directly cause GC. Currently, limited biomarkers can accurately predict GPL progression. Therefore, to inform precise clinical intervention strategies, addressing GC prevention and control challenges require enhanced etiological research and the exploration of novel molecular features to delineate gastric lesion progression.

Risk factors for gastric adenocarcinoma

Are there groups of individuals (without known precancerous lesions) known to be at increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma?

There are subgroups of individuals (other than those with H. pylori infection) who have an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma. The strongest risk factors include family history of gastric adenocarcinoma and serologically confirmed pernicious anaemia with GA. Additional risk factors include non-white origin, history of gastric surgery for benign disease longer than 15 years, age older than 45 years, male sex, high salt intake and smoking (evidence level: low quality; level of agreement: 93%).

Several factors increase the risk of developing malignant lesions of the stomach, which should be taken into account when considering screening on an individual basis. These risk factors might help in the development of larger scale screening programmes in the future and relate to multiple subcategories including patient demographics and epidemiological factors, as well as personal, medical, social and family history. Unfortunately, the grade of evidence on the link between risk factors and gastric cancer development is low, as this comes almost universally from retrospective or observational studies, including meta-analyses from these studies. The working group has analysed the evidence related to 11 risk factors based on the available literature.

CQ11. Should H. pylori be screened and treated among family members living in the same household with patients who have GC or gastric mucosal precancerous lesions?

Statement 11: For patients with GC or gastric mucosal precancerous lesions, H. pylori infection should be screened and treated for their family members living in the same household.

Evidence quality: moderate.

Recommendation strength: strong recommendation 78.9%, conditional recommendation 21.1%.

Consensus level: 84.2%.

Comments: H. pylori has the characteristic of family clustering infections. Persistent H. pylori infection is the most important factor for the initiation and development of gastric mucosal precancerous lesions, such as atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia, and H. pylori -infected family members of patients with GC have increased risk of developing gastric mucosal precancerous lesions and GC. Although H. pylori infection-related diseases are more frequently present in adulthood, infections are mostly acquired during childhood and adolescents; the chronic gastritis progresses into atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and GC after years of slow development. Despite other factors such as genetics, chemical factors, diet, living habits and age are also closely related to histological gastric mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia; H. pylori is the most important known cause of these precancerous lesions and GC, especially for patients who carry the CagA-positive genotype strains. As the high-risk group of individuals for GC, family members of patients with GC should be tested for H. pylori, and those who are H. pylori -positive should receive eradication therapy. For family members with gastric mucosa precancerous lesions, H. pylori infection status should be tested and eradicated if it is positive. In addition, regular endoscopic examination is recommended for early GC surveillance in these patients.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for precancerous gastric lesions, more specifically with respect to diagnostic endoscopy, technical considerations, ACG 2025 guidelines recommend to use high-quality endoscopy for the evaluation of the stomach (including achieving adequate mucosal visualization with cleansing and insufflation, visual station mapping, photodocumentation of anatomic landmarks and any abnormalities, and ensuring adequate gastric evaluation time) in patients undergoing upper endoscopy to identify gastric premalignant conditions (or gastric cancer).

Regarding specific circumstances for gastric cancer, more specifically with respect to patients with precancerous gastric lesions, endoscopic resection, BSG 2019 guidelines recommend to consider performing complete (R0) endoscopic resection of gastric dysplasia and early gastric adenocarcinoma with the following features:

- low-grade dysplasia

- high-grade dysplasia

- well or moderately differentiated intramucosal adenocarcinoma, irrespective of size and without ulceration

- well or moderately differentiated intramucosal adenocarcinoma, < 3.0 cm in size if ulcerated

- well or moderately differentiated submucosal adenocarcinoma, < 3.0 cm in size, with superficial submucosal invasion (Sm1; < 500 mcm submucosal invasion as measured in a straight line from the deepest fiber of the muscularis mucosae)

- poorly differentiated intramucosal adenocarcinoma, ≤ 2.0 cm in size.

Gastric epithelial polyps (GEP) — resection and biopsy strategy: We recommend endoscopic resection of all gastric adenomas, regardless of size, to exclude and prevent dysplasia and early GC, and for adenomas not amenable to endoscopic resection, we recommend referral for surgical resection if clinically appropriate (low quality of evidence, conditional recommendation). We could not make a recommendation on endoscopic resection of all hyperplastic polyps greater than 10 mm in size (insufficient evidence, no recommendation). In individuals with GEP, with the exception of fundic gland polyps, we recommend systematic gastric biopsies be obtained from the surrounding flat mucosa given the prevalence of GPMC, H. pylori infection, and AIG in these patients (very low quality of evidence, conditional recommendation).

Gastric premalignant conditions (GPMC) — endoscopic management: We recommend testing for Helicobacter pylori (and eradication treatment if positive) in patients with GPMC and resected early gastric cancer (GC) to reduce the risk of progression to GC and metachronous early GC, respectively (moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation). We do not suggest the use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, COX-2 inhibitors, or antioxidants for individuals with GPMC for the purpose of GC chemoprevention (very low quality of evidence, conditional recommendation).

Indefinite for dysplasia (IND) and low-grade dysplasia (LGD) — natural history and management indicate both potential regression and notable progression risk. IND and LGD have a lower rate of progression and may even show regression, with measurable proportions regressing or remaining stable on long-term follow-up; however, diagnostic upstaging to more severe lesions occurs in a minority, up to 30% based on most cohort studies. Endoscopic resection is recommended for IND or LGD when associated with a visible lesion. In an Australian LGD surveillance-only cohort (mean follow-up 2.3 ± 2.1 [SD] years), 7.9% had cancer at index, 5.3% developed interval cancer, 28.9% had unchanged pathology, and 57.9% showed no dysplasia.
