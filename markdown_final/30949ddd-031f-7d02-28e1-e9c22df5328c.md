## Question

Can I give misoprostol for induction of labor in a vaginal birth after cesarean?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether misoprostol can be used for induction of labor in a patient attempting vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality guideline recommendations. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and risk estimates for uterine rupture. Next, I will distinguish term pregnancy with a live fetus from second-trimester or fetal demise scenarios. After that, I should review safer alternatives for cervical ripening and induction. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and counseling points, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the authoritative guidance. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on the same answer: misoprostol should not be used for cervical ripening or labor induction at term in patients with a prior cesarean delivery because of increased uterine rupture risk. This is a Level A recommendation in ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 205 and is echoed by FIGO and SOGC, as well as the FDA labeling that explicitly warns against third-trimester misoprostol use in women with prior cesarean or major uterine surgery [^6070d354] [^78f41080] [^65b8918a] [^c7bd2205] [^1183e9d6].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of risk so I don't overstate it. Large cohort data summarized in ACOG show that prostaglandin-induced labor carries a uterine rupture risk around 2.24% compared with 0.52% in spontaneous labor, and FIGO cites a rupture rate of 2.2% with induction versus 0.7% with spontaneous labor. A Cochrane review of induction methods after prior cesarean was underpowered but reported rupture events with misoprostol and early termination for safety concerns, reinforcing caution [^33076725] [^65b8918a] [^12c7c8b2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without distinguishing contexts. I initially thought misoprostol is categorically contraindicated after cesarean, but wait, I should correct that: the prohibition applies to term pregnancies with a live fetus. In second-trimester pregnancy loss or fetal demise, misoprostol is considered acceptable and may have rupture rates comparable to spontaneous labor in some series, with ACOG noting rupture risk less than 1% in that setting and FIGO allowing prostaglandins including misoprostol for second-trimester indications, albeit with careful counseling and monitoring [^e940dd3c] [^65b8918a].

> Next, I should review safer alternatives for cervical ripening and induction at term in VBAC candidates. Mechanical methods such as a transcervical Foley catheter are preferred and have reassuring safety signals in this population, and oxytocin induction is acceptable with appropriate monitoring, recognizing a modest increase in rupture risk compared with spontaneous labor. Sequential prostaglandin followed by oxytocin should be avoided when possible due to additive risk [^78f41080] [^65b8918a] [^33076725].

> I need to ensure the counseling is balanced. Induction of labor in VBAC is not absolutely contraindicated, but method selection matters: misoprostol increases rupture risk and should be avoided, whereas mechanical ripening and oxytocin can be used judiciously with continuous fetal monitoring and readiness for emergent cesarean. Shared decision-making should incorporate individual predictors of VBAC success and the patient's preferences, and documentation of risks, benefits, and alternatives is essential [^bf6ed2b8] [^78dd04d6].

> But wait, what if the cervix is very unfavorable and the patient strongly desires to avoid repeat cesarean? I should double-check that no high-quality evidence supports misoprostol in this exact scenario. The best available evidence and guidelines consistently advise against misoprostol at term after cesarean due to rupture risk, and although some observational studies report no ruptures in small series, these are insufficient to overturn the consensus. Therefore, even in unfavorable cervices, mechanical methods remain the preferred first step, with oxytocin considered once the cervix is more favorable or if membranes are ruptured [^78f41080] [^65b8918a] [^12c7c8b2].

> Final synthesis: No, misoprostol should not be used for cervical ripening or induction of labor at term in a patient attempting VBAC because of a significantly increased risk of uterine rupture. If induction is indicated, use mechanical methods such as a Foley catheter and/or oxytocin with continuous monitoring, and reserve misoprostol for second-trimester indications or fetal demise where the risk–benefit profile differs and professional guidance permits its use with appropriate precautions [^6070d354] [^78f41080] [^65b8918a] [^e940dd3c].

---

Misoprostol should **not be used** for cervical ripening or labor induction in women with a prior cesarean delivery because of the **significantly increased risk of uterine rupture** [^6070d354] [^78f41080]. This is a **Level A recommendation** from ACOG and is supported by multiple guidelines and studies showing rupture rates of 2–3% with misoprostol compared with 0.5–1% with spontaneous labor or oxytocin alone [^33076725] [^65b8918a]. If induction is indicated, use mechanical methods (Foley catheter) or oxytocin with close monitoring, and avoid sequential prostaglandin–oxytocin regimens [^78f41080] [^65b8918a].

## Risks associated with misoprostol use in VBAC

Misoprostol use in VBAC is associated with a **significantly increased risk of uterine rupture**, a rare but catastrophic complication with high maternal and neonatal morbidity [^d34977c4]. The risk is **dose-related** and higher with vaginal administration than with oral regimens [^notfound].

- **Uterine rupture risk**: 2.24% with prostaglandin-induced labor (including misoprostol) vs 0.52% with spontaneous labor; 1.4% with prostaglandins ± oxytocin vs 0.4% with spontaneous labor [^33076725] [^65b8918a].
- **Severity**: Rupture can cause massive hemorrhage, hysterectomy, fetal hypoxia, and perinatal death [^1183e9d6].
- **Dose and route**: Higher vaginal doses (≥ 50 µg) further increase risk; oral regimens are not safer in this context [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Multiple high-quality sources **advise against misoprostol** in VBAC:

| **Guideline/source** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 205 (2019) | - Misoprostol should not be used for cervical ripening or induction in patients with prior cesarean or major uterine surgery [^6070d354] [^78f41080] |
| SOGC Clinical Practice Guideline No. 155 (2005) | - Prostaglandin E1 (misoprostol) is associated with a high risk of uterine rupture and should not be used for TOLAC [^c7bd2205] |
| FIGO Good Practice Recommendations (2025) | - Misoprostol should not be used for cervical ripening or induction in women with previous CS due to increased rupture risk [^65b8918a] |
| FDA labeling (2025) | - Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with prior CS or major uterine surgery because of increased rupture risk [^1183e9d6] |

---

## Alternative methods for labor induction in VBAC

When induction is indicated, **safer alternatives** include:

- **Mechanical methods**: Transcervical Foley catheter is preferred for cervical ripening; rupture risk is comparable to spontaneous labor (~0.5%) [^78f41080] [^65b8918a].
- **Oxytocin**: Can be used for induction/augmentation with continuous monitoring; rupture risk is modestly higher than spontaneous labor (~1.1%) but lower than with prostaglandins [^33076725] [^65b8918a].
- **Avoid sequential prostaglandin–oxytocin**: Combining agents increases rupture risk and should be avoided [^2f588012].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety profile

Misoprostol induction in VBAC is associated with:

- **Higher uterine rupture rate**: 2–3% vs 0.5–1% with other methods [^33076725] [^65b8918a].
- **Increased cesarean delivery**: Due to rupture and fetal distress [^notfound].
- **Maternal and neonatal morbidity**: Higher rates of hemorrhage, transfusion, hysterectomy, and neonatal asphyxia [^notfound].

---

## Patient selection and counseling

Careful selection and counseling are essential. Candidates should have a **low transverse uterine incision**, adequate pelvis, and no prior rupture; they should be counseled on rupture risks, alternatives, and the need for continuous fetal monitoring and immediate access to cesarean delivery [^bf6ed2b8] [^c7bd2205].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Misoprostol**: Contraindicated for cervical ripening or induction in VBAC because of increased rupture risk [^6070d354] [^78f41080].
- **Preferred alternatives**: Mechanical methods (Foley catheter) or oxytocin with close monitoring [^78f41080] [^65b8918a].
- **Avoid**: Sequential prostaglandin–oxytocin regimens [^2f588012].

---

Misoprostol is **contraindicated** for cervical ripening or induction in VBAC due to the significantly increased risk of uterine rupture. Use mechanical methods or oxytocin with appropriate monitoring, and avoid sequential prostaglandin–oxytocin regimens.

Background

To systematically review the literature on clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) rates.

Methods

We searched Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Wiley Cochrane Library, CINAHL via EBSCOhost; and Ovid PsycINFO. Additional studies were identified by searching for clinical trial records, conference proceedings and dissertations. Limits were applied for language (English and French) and year of publication (1985 to present). Two reviewers independently screened comparative studies (randomized or non-randomized controlled trials, and observational designs) according to a priori eligibility criteria: women with prior cesarean sections; any clinical intervention or exposure intended to increase the VBAC rate; any comparator; and, outcomes reporting VBAC, uterine rupture and uterine dehiscence rates. One reviewer extracted data and a second reviewer verified for accuracy. Meta-analysis was conducted using Mantel-Haenszel (random effects model) relative risks (VBAC rate) and risk differences (uterine rupture and dehiscence). Two reviewers independently conducted methodological quality assessments using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT).

Results

Twenty-nine studies (six trials and 23 cohorts) examined different clinical interventions affecting rates of vaginal deliveries among women with a prior cesarean delivery (CD). Methodological quality was good overall for the trials; however, concerns among the cohort studies regarding selection bias, comparability of groups and outcome measurement resulted in higher risk of bias. Interventions for labor induction, with or without cervical ripening, included pharmacologic (oxytocin, prostaglandins, misoprostol, mifepristone, epidural analgesia), non-pharmacologic (membrane sweep, amniotomy, balloon devices), and combined (pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic). Single studies with small sample sizes and event rates contributed to most comparisons, with no clear differences between groups on rates of VBAC, uterine rupture and uterine dehiscence.

Conclusions

This systematic review evaluated clinical interventions directed at increasing the rate of vaginal delivery among women with a prior CD and found low to very low certainty in the body of evidence for cervical ripening and/or labor induction techniques. There is insufficient high-quality evidence to inform optimal clinical interventions among women attempting a trial of labor after a prior CD.

6.3 Induction and augmentation of labor during

A meta‐analysis of 14 cross‐sectional studies that included 48 457 women who attempted VBAC showed a significantly higher rate of VBAC success in the spontaneous labor group compared with the induced labor group (74.3% vs. 60.7%; P = 0.001) and a significantly lower rate of uterine rupture (0.7% vs. 2.2%; P = 0.0003). The rate of uterine rupture in women using oxytocin in VBAC was significantly higher than in women not using oxytocin (1.4% vs. 0.5%; P = 0.0002). In addition, the rate of uterine rupture following oxytocin augmentation among women with spontaneous labor was lower than in women who were induced, although the difference was not significant (1.7% vs. 2.2%; P = 0.443).

Observational studies have reported rates of uterine rupture of 0.4%–0.52% for spontaneous labor, 0.77%–0.9% for labor induced without prostaglandins, 0%–2.45% for labor induced with prostaglandins alone, 1.4% for labor induced with prostaglandins with or without oxytocin, 1.1% for labor induced with oxytocin alone, and 0.9% for augmented labor. A Cochrane review that evaluated methods of labor induction for women with a previous CS concluded that there was insufficient evidence and the studies were underpowered to determine the optimal method of labor induction in women with a prior CS.

Based on available evidence, current guidelines recommend the use of mechanical methods, such as amniotomy and transcervical extra‐amniotic Foley catheter, over prostaglandins for cervical ripening and induction of labor in women with a previous CS. Misoprostol (prostaglandin E 1) should not be used for cervical ripening and induction of labor because it is associated with an increased risk of uterine rupture in women with a previous CS. Some studies have suggested that low dose dinoprostone (prostaglandin E 2) is a safe option for induction of labor in women undergoing VBAC, with no appreciable increase in rates of uterine rupture or maternal and perinatal mortality when compared with women undergoing a spontaneous VBAC.

Compared with induction of labor at > 41 weeks, induction at 39–41 weeks is associated with lower odds of CS and greater odds of VBAC success. Gestational age ≥ 41 weeks increases the odds of uterine rupture.

While the studies show heterogeneity and certainty of evidence is low to very low, the uterine rupture and dehiscence rates among studies are very clinically equivalent to rates reported in the literature (ruptures, pharmacological/non-pharmacological/combined for each comparison group 0.56, 0.70%; 0, 0; 1.05, 0.65%, respectively and dehiscence, pharmacological/non-pharmacological/combined for each comparison group 2.10, 0.76%; 1.44, 0.72%; 1.21, 0.87%, respectively). These findings can support the safety of oxytocin use for ripening alone and in combination with mechanical methods to allow amniotomy as commented above.

Candidates for TOLAC

Various maternal characteristics, clinical history, and presenting labor indications associated with likelihood of VBAC have been reported in the literature. Factors associated with increased risk of maternal morbidity from a TOLAC include: prior classical cesarean section or T incision as a contraindication, previous low segment cesarean section where the uterus was closed in a single layer, less than 18-month inter-delivery interval, medical induction or augmentation of labor as compared to spontaneous labor, medical induction of labor with misoprostol or PGE2, and increasing number of prior CDs.

A previous successful trial of vaginal delivery is associated with greater likelihood of successful VBAC; alternatively, the history of a failed trial of vaginal delivery requires a CD. Multiple obstetrical indications for inducing labor or considering CD, also need to be considered (e.g. post-dates, hypertension, macrosomia, intra-uterine growth restriction, unfavorable cervix). Different induction methods may have differential effects on progress of labor, and the impact on mode of delivery. Limited evidence from RCTs on methods of labor induction have not been able to determine which method results in greater benefits and lower risks.

### Clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates: systematic review&meta-analysis [^10d54717]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines comparison from the US (2010 version), Canada (2005 version) and United Kingdom (2007 version) show similarities and differences in recommendations for VBAC process. Uterine rupture is identified as the most serious complication among women attempting a trial of labor; however, there is recognition that differences in the definition may contribute to the reported incidence rates. With regards to induction of labor, all three guidelines agree that induction and augmentation of labor is an option for women attempting a VBAC, but there is an increased risk of uterine rupture with inappropriate use of oxytocin. Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and SOGC recommend against PGE1 for the same outcome, with the SOGC guideline recommending PGE2 only in rare circumstances. All three guidelines agree that women with a history of one or two uncomplicated low-transverse CD and no contraindications to VBAC should be educated, counselled and offered a TOLAC. The SOGC's updated guidelines (July 2019) continue to support the previous recommendation of offering women (without contraindications) the option of a TOLAC. The new guideline provides details on the likelihood of VBAC (greater among women with spontaneous labor, lower among women with factors that negatively affect this likelihood), the risk of uterine rupture (baseline risk of 0.47% among women with a prior CD; higher relative risk of uterine rupture, but low absolute risks for women attempting TOLAC compared with elective repeat cesarean section; risk greatest for women over 40 weeks of gestation; use of fetal monitoring is recommended as an indicator of the presence of uterine rupture), risk of other outcomes (higher relative risk of maternal and perinatal morbidity, but lower absolute risks for women attempting TOLAC compared with elective repeat cesarean section; higher relative risk of maternal death for elective cesarean section), and recommends against using ultrasonographic measurements of the lower uterine segment to counsel patients on the possibility of a TOLAC.

Vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC)/trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) — Level A recommendations state that most women with one previous cesarean delivery with a low-transverse incision are candidates for and should be counseled about and offered TOLAC. Misoprostol should not be used for cervical ripening or labor induction in patients at term who have had a cesarean delivery or major uterine surgery. Epidural analgesia for labor may be used as part of TOLAC.

All studies included patients who delivered in a healthcare setting.

Studies included a range of 32 to 12,676 women (median 237 women), aged 17 to 45 (among 24 studies). Nine studies (31%) reported parity (range 1 to 12). Among three studies (10%) that reported women with a prior CD, women with a single cesarean comprised the highest proportion of the study population (> 80%), while those with two prior cesarean births (two studies; 650 women) represented approximately 14 to 20%. Eight studies (28%) reported a range of 12 to 64% of women who had a prior or history of vaginal delivery. Approximately 60% women in one study had previously experienced both a cesarean and vaginal delivery. Two studies (7%) reported women with (6% versus 31%, balloon catheter versus oxytocin, respectively), and without (greater than 90%), a history of VBAC. Three studies (10%) reported women with a Bishop's score at study entry or just prior to labor induction (range 0 to 6). Six studies (21%) did not report any baseline demographic information for the study population.

### Practice bulletin no. 184: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^f6b23106]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cesarean delivery, more specifically with respect to vaginal birth after Cesarean delivery, technical considerations, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to do not use misoprostol for cervical ripening or labor induction in patients at term with a history of a Cesarean delivery or major uterine surgery.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 342: induction of labor for vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^e323cfae]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Induction of labor in women who have had cesarean deliveries may be necessary because of fetal or maternal indications. The potentially increased risk of uterine rupture should be discussed with the patient and documented in the medical record. Selecting women most likely to give birth vaginally and avoiding the sequential use of prostaglandins and oxytocin appear to offer the lowest risks. Misoprostol should not be used in patients who have had cesarean deliveries or major uterine surgery.

### SOGC clinical practice guidelines. guidelines for vaginal birth after previous caesarean birth. number 155 (replaces guideline number 147), February 2005 [^c7bd2205]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based guidelines for the provision of a trial of labor (TOL) after Caesarean section.

Outcome

Fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality associated with vaginal birth after Caesarean (VBAC) and repeat Caesarean section.

Evidence

MEDLINE database was searched for articles published from January 1, 1995, to February 28, 2004, using the key words "vaginal birth after Caesarean (Cesarean) section". The quality of evidence is described using the Evaluation of Evidence criteria outlined in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Exam.

Recommendations

1. Provided there are no contraindications, a woman with 1 previous transverse low-segment Caesarean section should be offered a trial of labor (TOL) with appropriate discussion of maternal and perinatal risks and benefits. The process of informed consent with appropriate documentation should be an important part of the birth plan in a woman with a previous Caesarean section (II-2B). 2. The intention of a woman undergoing a TOL after Caesarean section should be clearly stated, and documentation of the previous uterine scar should be clearly marked on the prenatal record (II-2B). 3. For a safe labor after Caesarean section, a woman should deliver in a hospital where a timely Caesarean section is available. The woman and her health care provider must be aware of the hospital resources and the availability of obstetric, anesthetic, pediatric, and operating-room staff (II-2A). 4. Each hospital should have a written policy in place regarding the notification and (or) consultation for the physicians responsible for a possible timely Caesarean section (III-B). 5. In the case of a TOL after Caesarean, an approximate time frame of 30 min should be considered adequate in the set-up of an urgent laparotomy (IIIC). 6. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring of women attempting a TOL after Caesarean section is recommended (II-2A). 7. Suspected uterine rupture requires urgent attention and expedited laparotomy to attempt to decrease maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality (II-2A). 8. Oxytocin augmentation is not contraindicated in women undergoing a TOL after Caesarean section (II-2A). 9. Medical induction of labor with oxytocin may be associated with an increased risk of uterine rupture and should be used carefully after appropriate counseling (II-2B). 10. Medical induction of labor with prostaglandin E2 (dinoprostone) is associated with an increased risk of uterine rupture and should not be used except in rare circumstances and after appropriate counseling (II-2B). 11. Prostaglandin E1 (misoprostol) is associated with a high risk of uterine rupture and should not be used as part of a TOL after Caesarean section (II-2A). 12. A foley catheter may be safely used to ripen the cervix in a woman planning a TOL after Caesarean section (II-2A). 13. The available data suggest that a trial of labor in women with more than 1 previous Caesarean section is likely to be successful but is associated with a higher risk of uterine rupture (II-2B). 14. Multiple gestation is not a contraindication to TOL after Caesarean section (II-2B). 15. Diabetes mellitus is not a contraindication to TOL after Caesarean section (II-2B). 16. Suspected fetal macrosomia is not a contraindication to TOL after Caesarean section (II-2B). 17. Women delivering within 18–24 months of a Caesarean section should be counseled about an increased risk of uterine rupture in labor (II-2B). 18. Postdatism is not a contraindication to a TOL after Caesarean section (II-2B). 19. Every effort should be made to obtain the previous Caesarean section operative report to determine the type of uterine incision used. In situations where the scar is unknown, information concerning the circumstances of the previous delivery is helpful in determining the likelihood of a low transverse incision. If the likelihood of a lower transverse incision is high, a TOL after Caesarean section can be offered (II-2B).

Validation

These guidelines were approved by the Clinical Practice Obstetrics and Executive Committees of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 205: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^78f41080]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Cervical ripening and induction during trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) are addressed as follows: Given the lack of compelling data suggesting an increased risk of uterine rupture with mechanical dilation and transcervical catheters, such interventions may be an option for TOLAC candidates with an unfavorable cervix. Studies examining the effects of prostaglandins in women with a prior cesarean delivery have demonstrated inconsistent results, and evidence from small studies shows increased risk with misoprostol; therefore, misoprostol should not be used for cervical ripening or labor induction in patients at term who have had a cesarean delivery or major uterine surgery. Prostaglandins can be considered if delivery is indicated in the second trimester, but because data are limited, it is difficult to make definitive recommendations regarding the use of prostaglandin E2.

### Planning for labor and vaginal birth after cesarean delivery: guidelines from the AAFP [^db7e96d1]. American Family Physician (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cesarean delivery, more specifically with respect to vaginal birth after Cesarean delivery, indications for trial of labor, AAFP 2015 guidelines recommend to offer labor induction in females planning a vaginal birth after Cesarean who have indications. Recognize that the method used affects the risk of uterine rupture. Do not use misoprostol for cervical preparation or induction of labor in females with a previous Cesarean delivery who are in the third trimester.

### Misoprostol for induction of labor with a live fetus [^ad6067db]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2007). Low credibility.

Induction of labor is common in clinical practice. Many different medical and mechanical methods have been used, but the current gold standard is vaginal dinoprostone. Misoprostol has been used for the induction of labor since 1987. In early studies with large misoprostol doses (e.g. 200 microg) there were high rates of uterine hyperstimulation. Cochrane meta-analysis, however, shows that when used in low doses it is as effective as vaginal dinoprostone and with no excess of hyperstimulation. 25 microg vaginal misoprostol 4-hourly, 50 microg oral misoprostol 4-hourly or 20 microg oral misoprostol solution 2-hourly are all safe and effective regimens. Reports of uterine rupture in women with previous cesarean sections mean that it remains contraindicated in this group.

Shared decision-making

For women with a previous CD, the decision to proceed with a repeat cesarean section or attempt a vaginal delivery will be based on multiple factors. First steps in the decision-making process should be consultation with a healthcare provider regarding maternal and neonatal benefits and risks, for both VBAC (induction/spontaneous onset of labor) and scheduled CD options. Triaging women for VBAC (i.e. women without contraindications) must include maternal characteristics and obstetric history to assist in the prediction of a successful vaginal delivery. Family planning plays a key role. Women who have had one or more prior cesarean deliveries may opt for a trial of vaginal birth or elect to have another CD; this maternal decision impacts future pregnancies and delivery due to the increased risk of abnormal placentation secondary to the additional uterine surgeries. Unexpected severe adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes (e.g. maternal mortality) are important for patient-level counselling and decision-making.

Each woman should be given the opportunity to be counselled early in pregnancy on her available options, with provision of written or on-line patient information literature (e.g. VBAC clinical care pathway, decision aids) to help inform decision-making throughout her pregnancy for optimal delivery outcomes and patient satisfaction.

### Methods of term labour induction for women with a previous caesarean section [^12c7c8b2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Women with a prior caesarean delivery have an increased risk of uterine rupture and for women subsequently requiring induction of labour it is unclear which method is preferable to avoid adverse outcomes. This is an update of a review that was published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms associated with different methods used to induce labour in women who have had a previous caesarean birth.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (31 August 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any method of third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction, with placebo/no treatment or other methods in women with prior caesarean section requiring labour induction in a subsequent pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and trial quality, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

Eight studies (data from 707 women and babies) are included in this updated review. Meta-analysis was not possible because studies compared different methods of labour induction. All included studies had at least one design limitation (i.e. lack of blinding, sample attrition, other bias, or reporting bias). One study stopped prematurely due to safety concerns. Vaginal PGE2 versus intravenous oxytocin (one trial, 42 women): no clear differences for caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 2.03, evidence graded low), serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.70, evidence graded low), serious maternal morbidity or death (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.70, evidence graded low). Also no clear differences between groups for the reported secondary outcomes. The GRADE outcomes vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours, and uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes were not reported. Vaginal misoprostol versus intravenous oxytocin (one trial, 38 women): this trial stopped early because one woman who received misoprostol had a uterine rupture (RR 3.67, 95% CI 0.16 to 84.66) and one had uterine dehiscence. No other outcomes (including GRADE outcomes) were reported. Foley catheter versus intravenous oxytocin (one trial, subgroup of 53 women): no clear difference between groups for vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.44, evidence graded low), uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes (RR 3.11, 95% CI 0.13 to 73.09, evidence graded low), and caesarean section (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.92, evidence graded low). There were also no clear differences between groups for the reported secondary outcomes. The following GRADE outcomes were not reported: serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death, and serious maternal morbidity or death. Double-balloon catheter versus vaginal PGE2 (one trial, subgroup of 26 women): no clear difference in caesarean section (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.32, evidence graded very low). Vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours, uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes, serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death, and serious maternal morbidity or death were not reported. Oral mifepristone versus Foley catheter (one trial, 107 women): no primary/GRADE outcomes were reported. Fewer women induced with mifepristone required oxytocin augmentation (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.76). There were slightly fewer cases of uterine rupture among women who received mifepristone, however this was not a clear difference between groups (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.02). No other secondary outcomes were reported. Vaginal isosorbide mononitrate (IMN) versus Foley catheter (one trial, 80 women): fewer women induced with IMN achieved a vaginal delivery within 24 hours (RR 2.62, 95% CI 1.32 to 5.21, evidence graded low). There was no difference between groups in the number of women who had a caesarean section (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.59, evidence graded very low). More women induced with IMN required oxytocin augmentation (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.32). There were no clear differences in the other reported secondary outcomes. The following GRADE outcomes were not reported: uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes, serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death, and serious maternal morbidity or death. 80 mL versus 30 mL Foley catheter (one trial, 154 women): no clear difference between groups for the primary outcomes: vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.20, evidence graded moderate) and caesarean section (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.24, evidence graded moderate). However, more women induced using a 30 mL Foley catheter required oxytocin augmentation (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98). There were no clear differences between groups for other secondary outcomes reported. Several GRADE outcomes were not reported: uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes, serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death, and serious maternal morbidity or death. Vaginal PGE2 pessary versus vaginal PGE2 tablet (one trial, 200 women): no difference between groups for caesarean section (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.60, evidence graded very low), or any of the reported secondary outcomes. Several GRADE outcomes were not reported: vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours, uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes, serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death, and serious maternal morbidity or death.

Authors' Conclusions

RCT evidence on methods of induction of labour for women with a prior caesarean section is inadequate, and studies are underpowered to detect clinically relevant differences for many outcomes. Several studies reported few of our prespecified outcomes and reporting of infant outcomes was especially scarce. The GRADE level for quality of evidence was moderate to very low, due to imprecision and study design limitations. High-quality, adequately-powered RCTs would be the best approach to determine the optimal method for induction of labour in women with a prior caesarean birth. However, such trials are unlikely to be undertaken due to the very large numbers needed to investigate the risk of infrequent but serious adverse outcomes (e.g. uterine rupture). Observational studies (cohort studies), including different methods of cervical ripening, may be the best alternative. Studies could compare methods believed to provide effective induction of labour with low risk of serious harm, and report the outcomes listed in this review.

### Clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates: systematic review&meta-analysis [^d8cbfcfb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review evaluated clinical interventions for safe practice directed at increasing the rate of vaginal delivery among women with a prior CD but found low to very low certainty in the body of evidence for cervical ripening and/or labor induction techniques. There is insufficient high-quality evidence to inform on optimal clinical interventions/protocols for women considering to have a VBAC.

### Induction of labor for vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^f83b4c83]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

A recent population-based study of vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) attempts observed uterine rupture rates of 24.5 per 1,000 with prostaglandin-induced labor, while the uterine rupture rates with spontaneous labor and labor induced without prostaglandins were lower (5.2/1,000 and 7. 7/1,000 respectively). The authors did not confirm the diagnoses by examining individual medical records, so the actual incidence of uterine rupture may have been overstated. Despite this limitation, the Committee on Obstetric Practice concludes that the risk of uterine rupture during VBAC attempts is substantially increased with the use of various prostaglandin cervical ripening agents for the induction of labor, and their use for this purpose is discouraged.

Methods

Registration

This meta-analysis was pre-registered (PROSPERO Registered ID: CRD42025649820), and reported according to the PRISMA 2020 statement.

Search strategy

Two investigators (A.C. and S.S.) designed the search strategy. The search strategy was applied in the PubMed, Web of science, Embase, Google scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Library databases on Jan 25, 2025. Keywords included: "Prelabor rupture of membranes"; "Misoprostol"; and "Oxytocin". In addition, article references were manually searched to further identify literature that met the criteria.

Study selection

Study selection was conducted using Endnote (version 20; Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA). Two investigators (G.Z. and G.S.) performed the selection process. Individual studies from our retrieval were first screened based on titles and abstracts. If a judgment could not be made based on titles and abstracts, we proceeded to read the full text. Any discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved through discussion or consultation with the senior reviewers (J.L.).

Eligibility criteria

Original studies were eligible if they met the following criteria: (1) Population: pregnant women at or greater than 36 weeks of gestation with PROM. (2) Intervention: misoprostol for labor induction. (3) Comparison: oxytocin for labor induction. (4) Outcome: vaginal birth within 24 h; the induction to delivery interval; the duration of second stage of labor; the induction to active labor; the rate of cesarean section; other maternal and neonatal complications. (5) Study design: RCTs with full text in English.

Original studies were ineligible for the following reasons: (I) evidence of prior uterine surgery; (II) nonvertex presentation; (III) maternal contraindication to prostaglandin use or chorioamnionitis; (IV) spontaneous labor onset or fetal distress.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes were vaginal birth within 24 h and the induction to delivery interval. Secondary outcomes included the duration of second stage of labor, the induction to active labor, the rate of cesarean section, hyperstimulation, tachysystole, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), chorioamnionitis, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, Apgar score at 1 min, Apgar score at 5 min, cord pH, and meconium-stained liquor.

### Committee opinion. induction of labor for vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^19e5992c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

A recent population-based study of vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) attempts observed uterine rupture rates of 24.5 per 1,000 with prostaglandin-induced labor, while the uterine rupture rates with spontaneous labor and labor induced without prostaglandins were lower (5.2/1,000 and 7.71/1,000 respectively). The authors did not confirm the diagnoses by examining individual medical records, so the actual incidence of uterine rupture may have been overstated. Despite this limitation, the Committee on Obstetric Practice concludes that the risk of uterine rupture during VBAC attempts is substantially increased with the use of various prostaglandin cervical ripening agents for the induction of labor, and their use for this purpose is discouraged.

### Clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates: systematic review&meta-analysis [^cd365a6a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

This systematic review of clinical interventions for influencing VBAC rates encompassed a broad range of study designs and strategies for cervical ripening and/or labor induction. The nature of the labor process and difficulty blinding women or healthcare providers to interventions lends few studies to an RCT design. Unsurprisingly, nearly 80% of the studies were cohort designs. However, observational studies have inherent biases due to confounding and there were concerns among the included cohorts regarding comparability of population characteristics between groups. Few studies adequately reported maternal characteristics. Some studies included women with only one CD while others enrolled women with multiple cesarean deliveries, a documented risk of increased uterine rupture among women attempting a VBAC. Additionally, few studies reported parity, type of previous uterine incision, prior vaginal delivery, prior VBAC, or indication(s) for previous CD. The concept of spontaneous labor among most studies is erroneously represented in that women in a comparator group (as opposed to the intervention group) are often managed expectantly, where they may or may not then progress to spontaneous labor. Further, spontaneous onset of labor is often used synonymously with spontaneous delivery. One outcome of induction of labor (versus expectant management) is induction success (or failed induction) distinguished from VBAC success. Ambiguous operationalization of these concepts may result in important differences in outcomes. Among women who were induced, studies often did not provide data for the number of women whose labor was augmented. While VBAC was reported by all studies, other perinatal outcomes were unreported or undefined despite following up women to delivery. Four (14%) studies did not report whether there were cases of uterine ruptures in their study population. Among studies that reported on uterine ruptures and/or uterine dehiscence, authors defined these outcomes inconsistently (and without a cited reference) or they were not explicitly differentiated from each other, or they were undefined altogether. Contextual and mediating factors, such as induction-to-labor interval or co-interventions were sparsely reported for women in all study arms.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 205 — Induction versus expectant management for prior cesarean patients reports that, when compared with expectant management, induction is associated with lower odds of cesarean delivery at 39 weeks (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71–0.91), at 40 weeks (AOR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.66–0.79), and at 41 weeks (AOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.62–0.79), and that the rate of vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) was higher with induction at 39 weeks versus expectant management (73.8% versus 61.3%, P < .001). The document also cautions that prior comparisons to spontaneous labor are misleading because the true clinical alternative to induction is expectant management.

### Clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates: systematic review&meta-analysis [^0999a6c2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Overall, there is low to very low certainty of evidence for clinical interventions that influence rates of VBAC, owing to downgrading mainly for the GRADE domains of risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision. Many of the comparisons were based on single studies with small sample sizes and event rates. The interventions were heterogeneous and focused on pharmacologic and/or mechanical methods of induction. Most of the evidence showed no significant differences between groups on VBAC rates, with very low certainty of evidence. There was some evidence of higher VBAC rates among women who undergo spontaneous labor, when compared to women whose labors are induced, regardless of method or agent used for induction; however, there was very low certainty in this body of evidence.

Other systematic reviews of clinical interventions have been reported in the literature. Catling-Paull et al examined the effect of clinical interventions on the uptake or success of VBACs and found that inductions of labor by amniotomy, prostaglandins, or oxytocin (or a combination of these methods) were associated with lower rates of vaginal deliveries (six RCTs and 28 cohort studies). The review also examined prognostic criteria/factors and concluded that pelvimetry may adversely affect women's chances of a VBAC, scoring systems are not clinically useful, and there is lack of sufficient data to inform the value of assessing methods of cesarean closures for predicting successful vaginal deliveries. A Cochrane systematic review compared women (with a prior CD) undergoing cervical ripening and/or labor induction with placebo, no treatment or other methods, and found overall moderate to low certainty of evidence for the varied interventions represented among the small number of included studies, concluding insufficient availability and high-quality of evidence to determine the optimal method of labor induction.

### Birth after caesarean study – planned vaginal birth or planned elective repeat caesarean for women at term with a single previous caesarean birth: protocol for a patient preference study and randomised trial [^7a3ed00d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Planned Vaginal Birth After Caesarean Group

Women who plan to have a vaginal birth or are randomised to this care group will await the spontaneous onset of labour, whilst appropriate. At the time of onset of labour the woman should be reassessed as to her eligibility for a planned VBAC. If a complication arises necessitating caesarean section (eg fetal distress) or if exclusion criteria for a vaginal birth occur after study entry (eg malpresentation or suspected cephalopelvic disproportion due to increased fetal size) a caesarean should be undertaken. The guidelines for intrapartum care for women in the planned VBAC group are based on those recommended by the SOGC, ACOG, RCOG.) and NICE. Other aspects of care will follow the institutional guidelines at the hospital. Hospitals agreed to follow the following care recommendations.

Induction of labour

The need for induction of labour for medical or obstetric indications will be assessed and determined by the obstetrician caring for the woman. If induction is considered necessary, this will be performed according to the local hospital guidelines where the woman has planned to give birth. The judicious use of oxytocin is not contraindicated in the presence of a previous caesarean but requires close monitoring. The guidelines issued by the RCOG on induction of labour in women with a prior caesarean highlight a sparsity of data specifically reporting the use of prostaglandin preparations in women with a previous caesarean, thereby precluding an ability to make specific recommendations for clinical care.). The risk of uterine rupture is higher after an induced labour and highest after induction with prostaglandins. Prostaglandin E 2 gel for induction is therefore not recommended for use for women in this study.

Augmentation of labour

The judicious use of oxytocin for augmentation of labour is not contraindicated in the presence of a prior caesarean section but requires close monitoring.

Fetal heart rate monitoring

All women undergoing a planned VBAC are advised to have continuous fetal heart rate monitoring as recommended in the RCOG guidelines for the use of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring. The presence of a non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing will be managed by performing fetal scalp pH sampling when clinically possible, or emergency caesarean as appropriate.

Analgesia/Anaesthesia

Analgesia and anaesthesia should be available according to the woman's choice. Epidural analgesia may be used as requested.

### Misoprostol induction of labor among women with a history of cesarean delivery [^950f3485]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Several reports have appeared of uterine rupture among women with a history of cesarean delivery who received misoprostol for induction of labor. A recent review suggested a uterine rupture rate of almost 6%, but the experience at our institution did not seem to reflect this high complication rate. This study was undertaken to compare complications of labor induction with misoprostol between women with a history of cesarean delivery and women without uterine scarring.

Study Design

A computerized database was used to select women with a viable fetus who underwent induction of labor with misoprostol during the period from January 1996 through December 1998. Patients were given 50 microg misoprostol every 4 hours. Women with a history of cesarean delivery were retrospectively compared with those without uterine scarring.

Results

A total of 425 women were given misoprostol for induction of labor: 48 had a history of cesarean delivery and 377 did not. Women with a history of cesarean delivery were more likely to be delivered abdominally (56% vs 28%; P < .04). Among women with a history of cesarean delivery, women who had a history of vaginal birth after cesarean were more likely to be delivered vaginally (92% vs 42%; P = 0.003). There was no difference in the overall rate of complications (2% with scarring vs 3% without scarring). There were no uterine ruptures. However, the previous cesarean group was more likely than the unscarred group to have blood loss > 500 mL (38% vs 22%; P < .03). Although the incidences of fetal distress were similar, neonates born to women in the previous cesarean group were more likely to have an Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes (13% vs 5%; P < .04).

Conclusion

Misoprostol induction of labor in women with a history of cesarean resulted in a higher rate of cesarean delivery than was seen among women without uterine scarring but was not associated with a higher incidence of complications. There were no uterine ruptures in either group.

### Induction of labor using one dose vs multiple doses of misoprostol: a randomized controlled trial [^abc9a9dc]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Misoprostol is a common agent that is used to ripen the cervix and induce labor, yet there is no clear evidence of the optimal number of doses needed to achieve a higher rate of vaginal delivery.

Objective

Our primary objective was to compare the rate of vaginal delivery within 24 hours between a 1-dose and a multiple-dose regimen of misoprostol for the induction of labor.

Study Design

A randomized controlled trial was conducted from March 2016 to March 2017 that compared a single dose to up to 4 doses of misoprostol. Randomization was stratified by parity. Women with a singleton pregnancy ≥ 37 weeks gestation with intact membranes who had been admitted for labor induction with a Bishop score ≤ 6 were included. Our primary outcome was the rate of vaginal delivery within 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included time to vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery rate, and maternal and neonatal morbidity. Based on a power of 80%, an alpha of .05, and the assumption that 50% of women in the multiple-misoprostol group would deliver vaginally in 24 hours, a sample size of 220 patients was needed to detect a 20% increase in vaginal delivery rate within 24 hours in the 1-misoprostol group. Continuous variables were compared with the use of the Mann-Whitney test. Categoric variables were compared with the use of the Fisher's exact test. Probability values < .05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

Two hundred fifty women were assigned randomly. Demographics and clinical characteristics were similar between groups. In the univariate analysis, there was no difference in the rate of vaginal delivery within 24 hours between the 1-misoprostol group and the multiple-dose group (41.7% vs 44.7%, respectively; P = 0.698) or time to vaginal delivery (1187 min vs 1321 min, respectively; P = 0.202). The 1-misoprostol group had a greater cesarean delivery rate (35.8% vs 22.8%; P = 0.034). In a Poisson regression that controlled for Bishop score before the initiation of oxytocin, parity, gestational age, body mass index, estimated fetal weight, artificial rupture of membrane at < 6 cm, and Foley balloon placement, the treatment group was no longer associated with cesarean delivery rate. Instead, a Bishop score of < 4 before the initiation of oxytocin and nulliparity were associated significantly with cesarean delivery rate.

Conclusion

In this first randomized controlled trial in the literature to compare a single with a multiple dosing of misoprostol, we found that the 1-dose regimen is an acceptable alternative for the induction for labor, especially for multiparous women and for patients with a Bishop score > 4 after the first dose.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 205: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^e940dd3c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — Second-trimester delivery or fetal demise in prior cesarean — Women with a prior cesarean who undergo labor induction with prostaglandins (including misoprostol) have been shown to have outcomes similar to those with an unscarred uterus, and most series show that uterine rupture with labor induction in this setting is less than 1%. For these women, dilation and evacuation as well as labor induction with prostaglandins are reasonable options. In patients after 28 weeks of gestation with an intrauterine fetal demise and a prior cesarean scar, cervical ripening with a transcervical Foley catheter has been associated with uterine rupture rates comparable with spontaneous labor and may be a helpful adjunct with an unfavorable cervical examination.

### Induction of labor with vaginal misoprostol for second trimester termination of pregnancy in the scarred uterus [^1c53008b]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the safety of vaginal misoprostol for second trimester pregnancy termination in patients with a history of cesarean section.

Methods

A consecutive series of 593 women with pregnancies of 14–26 weeks were studied. A cohort of 56 cases had undergone previous cesarean section delivery. The 528 cases who had no history of prior uterine surgery served as the controls. The termination was carried out according to the regimen used at the time of enrollment, either 600 microg applied at every 6 or every 12 h, or 800 microg applied at every 12 h using the vaginal route.

Results

The median induction to abortion time in the previous cesarean section group (15.1 h) was not significantly different from that of the controls (15.8 h). The median total dosage of misoprostol used was the same for both groups (1200 microg). The rates of incomplete abortion and analgesia usage were significantly higher in the previous cesarean section group as compared with the controls.

Conclusions

Vaginal misoprostol was effective for the second trimester pregnancy termination but the safety of misoprostol in the scarred uterus cannot be assumed from this study. A large series is needed to reach the power to see the difference.

### Induction of labor at term with vaginal misoprostol or a prostaglandin E2 pessary: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial [^efcf644b]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Induction of labor is among the most common procedures for pregnant women. Only a few randomized clinical trials with relatively small samples have compared misoprostol with dinoprostone. Although their efficacy seems similar, their safety profiles have not been adequately evaluated, and economic data are sparse.

Objective

This study aimed to test the noninferiority of vaginal misoprostol (prostaglandin E1) (25 μg) to a slow-release dinoprostone (prostaglandin E2) pessary (10 μg) for induction of labor with an unfavorable cervix at term.

Study Design

This was an open-label multicenter randomized noninferiority trial at 4 university hospitals of the Research Group in Obstetrics and Gynecology between 2012 and 2015. We recruited women who underwent induction of labor for medical reasons, those with a Bishop score of ≤ 5 at ≥ 36 weeks' gestation, and those with a cephalic-presenting singleton pregnancy with no previous cesarean delivery. Women were randomly allocated to receive either vaginal misoprostol at 4-hour intervals (25 μg) or a 10-mg slow-release dinoprostone pessary. The primary outcome was the total cesarean delivery rate. Noninferiority was defined as a difference in the cesarean delivery rates between the groups of no more than 5%. Secondary outcomes included neonatal and maternal morbidity, vaginal delivery at < 24 hours after starting the induction of labor process, and maternal satisfaction.

Results

The study included 1674 randomized women. The per-protocol analysis included 790 women in each group. The total cesarean delivery rates were 22.1% (n = 175) in the misoprostol group and 19.9% (n = 157) in the dinoprostone group, a difference of 2.2% (with an upper-bound 95% confidence limit of 5.6%) (P = 0.092). Results in the intention-to-treat analysis were similar. Neonatal and maternal morbidity rates were similar between groups. Vaginal delivery within 24 hours was significantly higher in the misoprostol group (59.3% vs 45.7%; P < .001) as was maternal satisfaction, assessed in the postpartum period by a visual analog scale (mean score, 7.1 ± 2.4 vs 5.8 ± 3.1; P < .001).

Conclusion

The noninferiority of a 25-μg dose of vaginal misoprostol every 4 hours to the dinoprostone pessary for cesarean delivery rates after induction of labor at term could not be demonstrated, although the confidence limit of the difference barely exceeded the noninferiority margin. Nonetheless, given the small difference between these cesarean delivery rates and the similarity of neonatal and maternal morbidity rates in this large study, the clinical risk-to-benefit ratio justifies the use of both drugs.

### WHO recommendations for misoprostol use for obstetric and gynecologic indications [^a52c687e]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analog, stimulates uterine contractility and cervical ripening. A number of randomized trials and systematic reviews have evaluated its use in obstetric and gynecologic conditions. Misoprostol is inexpensive, stable at room temperature, and available in more than 80 countries, making it particularly useful in resource-poor settings. WHO recognizes the crucial role of misoprostol in reproductive health and has incorporated recommendations for its use into 4 reproductive health guidelines focused on induction of labor, prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage, and management of spontaneous and induced abortion.

Methods and Results

All guidelines were prepared in accordance with the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development. The process included: identification of priority questions and critical outcomes; retrieval of evidence; assessment and synthesis of evidence; formulation of recommendations; and planning for dissemination, implementation, impact evaluation, and updating. The present report summarizes recommendations for misoprostol use in line with each guideline.

Conclusion

The present comprehensive reference document was designed to enable clinicians and policy makers to quickly access and compare recommendations for the use of misoprostol in various reproductive health settings.

### Misoprostol (marketed as cytotec) information… [^07f5ead3]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

FDA ALERT – Risks of Use in Labor and Delivery This Patient Information Sheet is for pregnant women who may receive misoprostol to soften their cervix or induce contractions to begin labor. Misoprostol is sometimes used to decrease blood loss after delivery of a baby. These uses are not approved by the FDA. No company has sent the FDA scientific proof that misoprostol is safe and effective for these uses. There can be serious side effects, including a torn uterus, when misoprostol is used for labor and delivery. A torn uterus may result in severe bleeding, having the uterus removed, and death of the mother or baby. These side effects are more likely in women who have had previous uterine surgery, a previous Cesarean delivery, or several previous births. This information reflects FDA's preliminary analysis of data concerning this drug. FDA is considering, but has not reached a final conclusion about, this information.

### The efficacy and safety of 25 μ g or 50 μ g oral misoprostol versus 25 μ g vaginal misoprostol given at 4-or 6-hourly intervals for induction of labour in women at or beyond term with live singleton pregnancies: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3a671600]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Misoprostol is widely used for cervical ripening and labour induction as it is heat-stable and inexpensive. Oral misoprostol 25μg given 2-hourly is recommended over vaginal misoprostol 25μg given 6-hourly, but the need for 2-hourly fetal monitoring makes oral misoprostol impractical for routine use in high-volume obstetric units in resource-constrained settings.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of oral misoprostol initiated at 25 or 50μg versus 25μg vaginal misoprostol given at 4- to 6-hourly intervals for labor induction in women at or beyond term (≥ 37weeks) with a single viable fetus and an unscarred uterus.

Search Strategy

We identified eligible randomized, parallel-group, labor-induction trials from recent systematic reviews. We additionally searched PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Epistemonikos, and clinical trials registries from February 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022 without language restrictions. Database-specific keywords for cervical priming, labor induction, and misoprostol were used.

Selection Criteria

We excluded labor-induction trials exclusively in women with ruptured membranes, in the third trimester, and those that initiated misoprostol at doses not specified in the review's objectives. The primary outcomes were vaginal birth within 24h, cesarean section, perinatal mortality, neonatal morbidity, and maternal morbidity. The secondary outcomes were uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes, and oxytocin augmentation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two or more authors selected studies independently, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We derived pooled weighted risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome, subgrouping trials by the dose and frequency of misoprostol regimens. We used the I² statistic to quantify heterogeneity and the random-effects model for meta-analysis when appropriate. We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess certainty (confidence) in the effect estimates.

Main Results

Thirteen trials, from Canada, India, Iran, and the US, randomizing 2941 women at ≥ 37weeks of gestation with an unfavorable cervix (Bishop score < 6), met the eligibility criteria. Five misoprostol regimens were compared: 25μg oral versus 25μg vaginal, 4-hourly (three trials); 50μg oral versus 25μg vaginal, 4-hourly (five trials); 50μg followed by 100μg oral versus 25μg vaginal, 4-hourly (two trials); 50μg oral, 4-hourly versus 25μg vaginal, 6-hourly (one trial); and 50μg oral versus 25μg vaginal, 6-hourly (two trials). The overall certainty in the evidence ranged from moderate to very low, due to high risk of bias in 11/13 trials (affecting all outcomes), unexplained heterogeneity (1/7 outcomes), indirectness (1/7 outcomes), and imprecision (4/7 outcomes). Vaginal misoprostol probably increased vaginal deliveries within 24h compared with oral misoprostol (risk ratio [RR] 0.82, 95% CI 0.70–0.96; 11 trials, 2721 mothers; moderate-certainty evidence); this was more likely with 4-hourly than with 6-hourly vaginal regimens. The risk of cesarean sections did not appreciably differ (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80–1.26; 13 trials, 2941 mothers; very low-certainty evidence), although oral misoprostol 25μg 4-hourly probably increased this risk compared with 25μg vaginal misoprostol 4-hourly (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.21–2.36; three trials, 515 mothers). The risk of perinatal mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11–3.90; one trial, 196 participants; very low-certainty evidence), neonatal morbidity (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67–1.06; 13 trials, 2941 mothers; low-certainty evidence), and maternal morbidity (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.48–1.44; 6 trials; 1945 mothers; moderate-certainty evidence) did not differ appreciably. The risk of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes may be lower with oral misoprostol (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52–0.95; 10 trials, 2565 mothers; low-certainty evidence). Oxytocin augmentation was probably more frequent with oral compared with vaginal misoprostol (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10–1.51; 13 trials, 2941 mothers; moderate-certainty evidence).

Conclusions

Low-dose, 4- to 6-hourly vaginal misoprostol regimens probably result in more vaginal births within 24h and less frequent oxytocin use compared with low-dose, 4- to 6-hourly, oral misoprostol regimens. Vaginal misoprostol may increase the risk of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart changes compared with oral misoprostol, without increasing the risk of perinatal mortality, neonatal morbidity, or maternal morbidity. Indirect evidence indicates that 25μg vaginal misoprostol 4-hourly may be more effective and as safe as the recommended 6-hourly vaginal regimen. This evidence could inform clinical decisions in high-volume obstetric units in resource-constrained settings.

### Evidence summary… [^9238a10b]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer Low-dose intravaginal misoprostol appears to be safe and effective for cervical ripening in term pregnancy for patients without a history of cesarean section. Compared with other cervical ripening methods, misoprostol has an increased rate of vaginal delivery within 24 hours without significant differences in cesarean section rates or fetal outcomes. A 50-mcg dose of intravaginal misoprostol causes increased rates of uterine hyper-stimulation and may be associated with an increased cesarean section rate. Because of a potential increased risk of uterine rupture, use of misoprostol for labor induction in women with a previous cesarean section is relatively contraindicated.

A more recent, high-quality, prospective double-blind randomized controlled study 3 of 114 subjects comparing 25 versus 50 mcg of intravaginal misoprostol reported a significantly higher cesarean section rate with a 50-mcg dose of misoprostol. This primarily was caused by abnormal fetal heart rate patterns. 5 of more than 20, 000 births demonstrated that induction of labor with prostaglandins among women with a previous cesarean section delivery is associated with an increased risk of uterine rupture. The published data appear to indicate that intravaginal misoprostol is safe and effective. Cervical ripening and subsequent labor induction is probably more effective with the 50-mcg dose; however, the currently available information reveals conflicting data on whether the higher dose is as safe as the 25-mcg dose.

Vaginal misoprostol can be used effectively by family physicians either as a cervical ripening agent or for labor induction. Additionally, because vaginal misoprostol does not require connecting a patient to an intravenous line, patients may be more comfortable as they are able to move around more freely during labor. In summary, low-dose intravaginal misoprostol appears to be safe and effective for cervical ripening in term pregnancy for women without a history of cesarean section.

### Efficacy and safety of misoprostol versus oxytocin for labor induction in women with prelabor rupture of membranes: a meta-analysis [^776d67c0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Research gap

PROM is a unique indication for IOL, and a timely and appropriate intervention is need to manage PROM effectively, thereby reducing the risk of complications for both the mother and the fetus. Oxytocin is a widely used and effective agent for labor induction in PROM cases. However, the oxytocin route of administration was mainly intravenous, which restricts the mother's mobility. Therefore, to avoid the risk of uncontrolled oxytocin infusion and hyperstimulation, oxytocin administration required special medical monitoring. Misoprostol has gained attention due to its cost-effectiveness, ease of administration, and potential efficacy. However, existing studies comparing misoprostol and oxytocin for labor induction in PROM present conflicting results regarding efficacy and safety. Furthermore, methodologies, dosages, and outcome measures involved in these studies vary significantly. Our study attempts to synthesize existing evidence, standardize outcome measures, guide clinical practice, and identify research gaps. This comprehensive approach can lead to more informed and effective clinical decisions, ultimately improving maternal and neonatal health outcomes.

Summary of main results

As the results shown in the present study, misoprostol can be considered a viable alternative to oxytocin for labor induction in patients with PROM. The findings of our meta-analysis suggested that misoprostol was associated with significantly shorter induction to delivery interval and duration of second stage of labor, and lower risk of PPH. There were no differences in vaginal birth within 24 h, the rate of cesarean section, other maternal and neonatal outcomes between misoprostol and oxytocin.

Efficacy of misoprostol versus oxytocin on the duration of labor

The duration of labor is the most important factor and prolonged labor is indeed a significant cause contributing to maternal and neonatal morbidity. The finding of misoprostol on reducing induction to delivery interval is supported by pharmacokinetic studies. Misoprostol exerts its pharmacological actions at both the cervical and uterine levels while the effect of oxytocin predominantly targets the uterus. When attempting to induce labor using oxytocin in the situation where the cervix is unfavorable, it is analogous to attempting to drive a vehicle against a firmly shut gate. On the other hand, misoprostol has the ability to first prepare the cervix, metaphorically "opening the gate" before the subsequent stimulation of uterine contractions.

### Is there a role for oral misoprostol in labor induction for prelabor rupture of membranes at term? [^faf95b48]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Patients who undergo labor induction for PROM at term using oral Misoprostol exhibit a high chance of achieving vaginal delivery without any increased risks of maternal or neonatal morbidity. While this induction method may extend the delivery duration, it decreases the time spent in the labor ward, which has significant benefits for patients and their healthcare providers. This information should be integrated into patient counseling to support informed decision-making about labor induction options, enhancing the overall care and management for expectant mothers with PROM at term.

### Misoprostol for induction of labor [^b30b1881]. Seminars in Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Labor-induction rates have increased considerably in the United States as well as around the world. With up to half of all induced labors requiring cervical ripening, prostaglandins have been utilized to increase induction success and achieve vaginal delivery. Misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog has the ability to mimic the changes of spontaneous labor and has been used off label for over 30 years as a labor-induction agent. In the following article, cervical ripening and induction of labor with misoprostol will be discussed. The risks and benefits of misoprostol for ripening and induction and routes of administration will be reviewed, as well as future directions and new developments for its use.

### Efficacy and safety of misoprostol versus oxytocin for labor induction in women with prelabor rupture of membranes: a meta-analysis [^c48daf67]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) complicates 8% of pregnancies, often necessitating labor induction to prevent maternal and neonatal complications. Misoprostol, a cost-effective prostaglandin, has been proposed as an alternative to oxytocin for labor induction in PROM cases, but its efficacy and safety remain debated.

Methods

The PubMed, Web of science, Embase, Google scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Library databases were searched on January 25, 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing misoprostol and oxytocin for labor induction in term PROM were eligible. The primary outcomes were vaginal birth within 24 h and the induction to delivery interval. Secondary outcomes included the duration of second stage of labor, the induction to active labor, cesarean section, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), and other maternal/neonatal complications.

Results

Data from 20 RCTs involving 2,980 participants were analyzed. Misoprostol significantly reduced the induction-to-delivery interval and the duration of the second stage of labor compared to oxytocin (WMD = -62.82, 95% CI (-110.56, -15.08); WMD = -4.29, 95% CI (-8.05, -0.52), respectively). It also lowered the risk of PPH (OR = 0.63, 95% CI (0.41, 0.98)). However, no significant differences were found in other outcomes between misoprostol and oxytocin.

Conclusions

Misoprostol is a viable alternative to oxytocin for labor induction in PROM, offering shorter labor durations and reduced PPH risk without compromising maternal and neonatal outcomes. Further researches are needed to optimize dosing, administration routes, and assess maternal satisfaction.

### Vaginal misoprostol for second-trimester pregnancy termination after one previous cesarean delivery [^bcb72088]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the safety and efficacy of using misoprostol vaginally for second-trimester abortion in women with a single previous cesarean delivery.

Method

This prospective observational study was carried out at a university hospital in Egypt with 50 pregnant women with 1 previous cesarean delivery; a gestation of at least 16 weeks but less than 20 weeks (group 1) or 20 or more weeks (group 2); and a need to terminate the pregnancy. The regimen was 4 doses of 200 microg of misoprostol applied vaginally every 4 hours daily, with a 12-hour nightly rest from misoprostol applications, until contractions appeared but not for more than 72 hours. The primary outcome was the induction-to-abortion interval.

Results

There were no cases of uterine rupture. Abortion within the study protocol occurred in 45 of the 50 women, for a 90% success rate. There was no significant difference in the induction-to-abortion interval between the 2 groups.

Conclusion

Inducing abortion with lower misoprostol doses appear to be safe and effective throughout the second trimester in women with a single previous cesarean delivery. Larger randomized trials are needed to validate these results.

### Efficacy and safety of administering oral misoprostol by titration compared to vaginal misoprostol and dinoprostone for cervical ripening and induction of labour: study protocol for a randomised clinical trial [^448db3c4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods/design

Aim

The objective of this study is to assess which of the three options considered, vaginal dinoprostone or vaginal or oral misoprostol, achieves a higher rate of vaginal delivery within the first 24 h after drug administration in women who undergo elective induction of labour due to their pregnancy becoming prolonged.

Participants

This single-centre open-label randomised clinical trial will be carried out in Araba University Hospital (Spain), a tertiary hospital that conducts approximately 2600 deliveries per year. The study population consists of pregnant women at 41 weeks of pregnancy or more undergoing induction of labour who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.
Inclusion criteria: Women are required to be over 18 years old with a singleton pregnancy, cephalic presentation, intact membranes, a Bishop score of less than 6, and a cardiotocographic trace with a foetal heart rate pattern that is reactive with no decelerations, and provide written informed consent.
Exclusion criteria: To be eligible, women must not have an allergy or intolerance to any of the study drugs; a history of caesarean section or uterine surgery, or of stillbirth; high parity (four or more previous births); contraindications for vaginal birth, including placenta or vasa praevia; intrauterine growth restriction; gestational hypertension; suspected chorioamnionitis; or blood clotting disorders, epilepsy, liver or kidney disease, or moderate-to-severe heart disease.

### Sublingual versus vaginal misoprostol for labor induction… [^ee8cb386]. ClinicalTrials (2008). Low credibility.

The interval of induction to delivery
- Number of doses of misoprostol given
- Number of unsuccessful inductions
- Number of cesarean deliveries for fetal concerns. Misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog, has been given both orally and vaginally for induction of labor in the third trimester. 1 Vaginal misoprostol has been shown to be more efficacious than oral misoprostol in equivalent doses, 2 although there is the worry of uterine tachysystole and hyperstimulation with vaginal doses of 50 µg or higher. 2–4 The higher efficacy after vaginal administration may be explained by the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Since then and partly because of issues relating to patient preference, investigators started studying the sublingual route of administration of misoprostol.

In theory, the sublingual route could mimic vaginal administration pharmacokinetically, although there have been no such reported studies on this route of administration. Therefore, this study, when completed will provide evidence on the relative effect and safety profile of different routes of administration of misoprostol for labor induction. The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy of a 50-µg sublingual dose of misoprostol administered at 4-hour intervals with an equivalent dose regimen administered vaginally in women admitted for induction of labor for a medical or obstetric indication at term. In addition, we want to assess the safety profile and patient acceptability of the 2 modes of administration. The study hypothesis is that the sublingual route of administration of misoprostol is as effective as the vaginal route for induction of labor at term and is more acceptable to patients as compared to vaginal misoprostol.

Study Type
- Induction of Labor Drug: Misoprostol. Exclusion Criteria:

- Rupture of membranes
- Multiple gestation
- Malpresentation
- Previous cesarean delivery
- Known contraindications to the use of prostaglandins
- Grandmultiparity
- Significant fetal or maternal concerns that made induction necessary under continuous monitoring.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 205: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^78dd04d6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Stratification of candidates — trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) success rates and modifiers: most published series examining women attempting TOLAC have demonstrated a vaginal delivery rate of 60–80%. Women whose first cesarean delivery was performed because of an arrest of labor disorder are less likely to succeed in their attempt at vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) than those with a nonrecurring indication, and women who undergo labor induction or augmentation are less likely to achieve VBAC than women with fetuses of the same gestational age in spontaneous labor without augmentation. Additional negative factors include increasing maternal age, high body mass index (BMI), high birth weight, advanced gestational age at delivery (more than 40 weeks), a shorter interdelivery interval (less than 19 months), and preeclampsia at the time of delivery, whereas a prior vaginal delivery is associated with a higher likelihood of VBAC if TOLAC is undertaken.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 115: vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery [^f0ef0806]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Trial of labor after previous cesarean delivery (TOLAC)* provides women who desire a vaginal delivery with the possibility of achieving that goal — a vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC). In addition to fulfilling a patient's preference for vaginal delivery, at an individual level VBAC is associated with decreased maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies. At a population level, VBAC also is associated with a decrease in the overall cesarean delivery rate (1, 2). Although TOLAC is appropriate for many women with a history of a cesarean delivery, several factors increase the likelihood of a failed trial of labor, which compared with VBAC, is associated with increased maternal and perinatal morbidity (3–5). Assessment of individual risks and the likelihood of VBAC is, therefore, important in determining who are appropriate candidates for TOLAC. The purpose of this document is to review the risks and benefits of TOLAC in various clinical situations and provide practical guidelines for managing and counseling patients who will give birth after a previous cesarean delivery.

### Clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates: systematic review&meta-analysis [^6b57b84b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Induction of labor is the artificial stimulation of labor before its spontaneous onset to achieve vaginal delivery, taking into account the status/readiness of the cervix (termed "favorable" or "ripe") prior to initiating the labor process. Cervical ripening or induction of labor can be achieved using non-pharmacologic methods, pharmacologic agents, or some combination of both techniques, each with advantages and disadvantages. Mechanical and surgical methods are forms of non-pharmacologic induction, including membrane stripping, balloon catheters, or amniotomy (artificial rupture of membranes). Pharmacologic agents commonly used for cervical ripening or induction of labor include prostaglandin (PGE2 analog, in gel or pessary form), misoprostol (PGE1 analog), or mifepristone.

All studies examined some manner of cervical ripening and/or labor induction in the intervention group, usually compared to a group of women undergoing spontaneous labor or expectant pregnancy management.

Many cervical ripening and labor induction methods were represented by the included studies.

Twenty-six studies (90%) examined the effects of at least one pharmacologic agent on VBAC rates, including prostaglandins, oxytocin, mifepristone and epidural analgesia. Ten studies (34%) examined non-pharmacologic or mechanical methods (membrane sweeping, amniotomy, balloon devices) in at least one intervention arm.

Studies reported adverse maternal/neonatal outcomes, in addition to VBAC rates, including uterine rupture (10 studies; 34%), uterine dehiscence (four studies; 14%), and both uterine rupture and dehiscence (13 studies; 45%). Eleven (38%) studies provided definitions of uterine rupture, with indications of "disruption of previous scar", "separation", "tear" or "rupture" of the uterine wall or peritoneum, and/or extrusion of fetal parts.

Of the studies reporting rupture or dehiscence, three (10%) also reported uterine hyper-stimulation and three (10%) also reported uterine atony; these outcomes were not included in analyses as they were considered clinically-related but distinct from the review's outcomes of interest.

### Planning for labor and vaginal birth after cesarean delivery… [^9ae3b1f2]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Women who have had a previous vaginal birth have a high probability of VBAC; physicians should encourage these women to plan for LAC/VBAC unless specific contraindications exist.
- In women who have had a previous cesarean delivery and who are in the third trimester, misoprostol should not be used for cervical preparation or induction of labor. Because of the higher risk of uterine rupture, LAC/VBAC are not options for women who have had a vertical uterine incision or a vertical upward extension of a transverse incision, or women who have had transmural uterine surgery. Physicians caring for patients who have had a previous cesarean delivery should reevaluate the labor plan, including the decision for repeat cesarean delivery or VBAC, when patients present in labor; elements that can affect labor risks and the chance of delivering vaginally should be considered.

In women undergoing LAC/VBAC, physicians should continually assess and discuss with the patient any changes in status affecting labor risks or chances of delivering vaginally. The likelihood of successful VBAC is increased with more progression in labor and higher Bishop scores. The likelihood has been shown to be decreased when labor is induced using oxytocin, and in women with infants weighing at least 8 lb, 13 oz. Inducing labor is suitable for women who are planning a VBAC and who have indications. The method used affects the risk of uterine rupture. In women who have had a previous cesarean delivery and who are in the third trimester, misoprostol should not be used for cervical preparation or induction of labor. Although labor induction may be needed, it should be noted that it has been associated with uterine rupture. Risk differs depending on the method used. Rates have been shown to be as follows: Oxytocin:

1. 1%. Prostaglandin E2: 2% Misoprostol: 13% Studies have also found an association between misoprostol use in the third trimester and uterine rupture. The evidence regarding risk with mechanical induction methods is minimal, and no ruptures have been reported when using a Foley catheter for cervical ripening.

### New insights on vaginal birth after cesarean: can it be predicted? [^93481d42]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate existing vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) screening tools and to identify additional factors that may predict VBAC or failed trial of labor.

Data Sources

Relevant studies were identified through MEDLINE, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, and the Cochrane databases (1980-September 2009), and from recent systematic reviews, reference lists, reviews, editorials, web sites, and experts.

Methods Of Study Selection

Inclusion criteria limited studies to those of humans, written in English, studies conducted in the United States and developed countries, and those rated good or fair quality by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force criteria. Studies of individual predictors were combined using a random effects model when the estimated odds ratios were comparable across included studies.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

We identified 3,134 citations and reviewed 963 papers, of which 203 met inclusion criteria and were quality-rated. Twenty-eight provided evidence on predictors of VBAC and 16 presented information on scored models for predicting VBAC (or failed trial of labor). Six of the 11 scored models for predicting VBAC (or failed trial of labor) were validated by separated dataset, cross-validation, or both. Whereas accuracy remained high across all models for predicting VBAC, with predictive values ranging from 88% to 95%, accuracy for predicting failed trial of labor was low, ranging from 33% to 58%. Individual predictors including Hispanic ethnicity, African-American race, advanced maternal age, no previous vaginal birth history, birth weight heavier than 4 kg, and use of either augmentation or induction were all associated with reduced likelihood of VBAC.

Conclusion

Current scored models provide reasonable predictability for VBAC, but none provides consistent ability to identify women at risk for failed trial of labor. A scoring model is needed that incorporates known antepartum factors and can be adjusted for current obstetric factors and labor patterns if induction or augmentation is needed. This would allow women and clinicians to better determine individuals most likely to require repeat cesarean delivery.

### Methods of term labour induction for women with a previous caesarean section [^769776f7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Induction of labour is a common obstetric intervention, with between 20% and 30% of births reported to occur following induction of labour. Women with a prior caesarean delivery have an increased risk of uterine rupture, particularly when labour is induced. For women who have had a previous caesarean birth and who require induction of labour in a subsequent pregnancy, it is unclear which method of cervical ripening and labour induction is preferable.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms associated with different methods used to induce labour in women who have had a previous caesarean birth and require induction of labour in a subsequent pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2012) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing any method of third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction, with placebo/no treatment or other methods in women with prior caesarean section requiring labour induction in a subsequent pregnancy were included. Methods of cervical ripening or labour induction could include: prostaglandin medication (including oral or vaginal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and misoprostol); mifepristone; mechanical methods (including Foley catheters and double balloon catheters); oxytocin, or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and trial quality. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. Both review authors independently extracted data and data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

Two studies (involving a total of 80 women) were included. However, the two included studies used different methods and thus, meta-analysis was not appropriate. The two included studies compared 2.5 mg vaginal PGE2 inserts versus oxytocin (Taylor and colleagues) and misoprostol versus oxytocin (Wing and colleagues). Risk of bias in the included studies was judged 'low' and 'unclear' respectively. Vaginal PGE2 inserts versus oxytocin - Taylor and colleagues included 42 women, equally distributed over both groups. Baseline characteristics, and reasons for labour induction were comparable between the groups. There were no significant differences in any of the outcome measures reported (caesarean section, instrumental vaginal deliveries, epidural analgesia, Apgar score, perinatal death). One uterine rupture occurred in the prostaglandin group, after the use of prostaglandins and oxytocin, while no ruptures occurred in the oxytocin group (one study, 42 women; risk ratio (RR) 3.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 69.70). Misoprostol versus oxytocin - the study conducted by Wing and colleagues was stopped prematurely due to safety concerns after the inclusion of 38 women. Seventeen women had been included in the misoprostol group, and 21 women in the oxytocin group. There were no significant difference in the only outcome measure reported by the authors, uterine rupture, which occurred twice in the misoprostol group, and did not occur in the oxytocin group (one study; 38 women; RR 6.11, 95% CI 0.31 to 119.33).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient information available from randomised controlled trials on which to base clinical decisions regarding the optimal method of induction of labour in women with a prior caesarean birth.

### Maternal complications with vaginal birth after cesarean delivery: a multicenter study [^2f588012]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to determine incidence and risk factors for uterine rupture in women attempting vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) in a wide range of hospital settings.

Study Design

We performed a case-control study nested within a cohort of women who have had a prior cesarean to determine the incidence and risk factors for uterine rupture in women attempting VBAC.

Results

The incidence rate of uterine rupture in those who attempt VBAC was 9.8 per 1000. A prior vaginal delivery was associated with a lower risk of uterine rupture (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, 95% CI 0.20–0.81). Although prostaglandins alone were not associated with uterine rupture, sequential use of prostaglandin and pitocin was associated with uterine rupture (adjusted OR = 3.07, 95% CI 0.98–9.88).

Conclusion

Women with a prior cesarean should be offered VBAC, and women with a prior cesarean and prior vaginal delivery should be encouraged to VBAC. Although other studies have suggested that prostaglandins should be avoided, we suggest that inductions requiring sequential agents be avoided.

### Low-dose oral misoprostol for induction of labour [^96bf6247]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Misoprostol given orally is a commonly used labour induction method. Our Cochrane Review is restricted to studies with low-dose misoprostol (initially ≤ 50 µg), as higher doses pose unacceptably high risks of uterine hyperstimulation.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of low-dose oral misoprostol for labour induction in women with a viable fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (14 February 2021) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing low-dose oral misoprostol (initial dose ≤ 50 µg) versus placebo, vaginal dinoprostone, vaginal misoprostol, oxytocin, or mechanical methods; or comparing oral misoprostol protocols (one- to two-hourly versus four- to six-hourly; 20 µg to 25 µg versus 50 µg; or 20 µg hourly titrated versus 25 µg two-hourly static).

Data Collection and Analysis

Using Covidence, two review authors independently screened reports, extracted trial data, and performed quality assessments. Our primary outcomes were vaginal birth within 24 hours, caesarean section, and hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes.

Main Results

We included 61 trials involving 20,026 women. GRADE assessments ranged from moderate- to very low-certainty evidence, with downgrading decisions based on imprecision, inconsistency, and study limitations. Oral misoprostol versus placebo/no treatment (four trials; 594 women) Oral misoprostol may make little to no difference in the rate of caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.11; 4 trials; 594 women; moderate-certainty evidence), while its effect on uterine hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes is uncertain (RR 5.15, 95% CI 0.25 to 105.31; 3 trials; 495 women; very low-certainty evidence). Vaginal births within 24 hours was not reported. In all trials, oxytocin could be commenced after 12 to 24 hours and all women had pre-labour ruptured membranes. Oral misoprostol versus vaginal dinoprostone (13 trials; 9676 women) Oral misoprostol probably results in fewer caesarean sections (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.90; 13 trials, 9676 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis indicated that 10 µg to 25 µg (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.87; 9 trials; 8652 women) may differ from 50 µg (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.34; 4 trials; 1024 women) for caesarean section. Oral misoprostol may decrease vaginal births within 24 hours (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; 10 trials; 8983 women; low-certainty evidence) and hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.59; 11 trials; 9084 women; low-certainty evidence). Oral misoprostol versus vaginal misoprostol (33 trials; 6110 women) Oral use may result in fewer vaginal births within 24 hours (average RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95; 16 trials, 3451 women; low-certainty evidence), and less hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.92, 25 trials, 4857 women, low-certainty evidence), with subgroup analysis suggesting that 10 µg to 25 µg orally (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.57; 6 trials, 957 women) may be superior to 50 µg orally (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.11; 19 trials; 3900 women). Oral misoprostol probably does not increase caesarean sections overall (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16; 32 trials; 5914 women; low-certainty evidence) but likely results in fewer caesareans for foetal distress (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99; 24 trials, 4775 women). Oral misoprostol versus intravenous oxytocin (6 trials; 737 women, 200 with ruptured membranes) Misoprostol may make little or no difference to vaginal births within 24 hours (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33; 3 trials; 466 women; low-certainty evidence), but probably results in fewer caesarean sections (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 6 trials; 737 women; moderate-certainty evidence). The effect on hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes is uncertain (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.26; 3 trials, 331 women; very low-certainty evidence). Oral misoprostol versus mechanical methods (6 trials; 2993 women) Six trials compared oral misoprostol to transcervical Foley catheter. Misoprostol may increase vaginal birth within 24 hours (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.79; 4 trials; 1044 women; low-certainty evidence), and probably reduces the risk of caesarean section (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95; 6 trials; 2993 women; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.21; 4 trials; 2828 women; low-certainty evidence). Oral misoprostol one- to two-hourly versus four- to six-hourly (1 trial; 64 women) The evidence on hourly titration was very uncertain due to the low numbers reported. Oral misoprostol 20 µg hourly titrated versus 25 µg two-hourly static (2 trials; 296 women) The difference in regimen may have little or no effect on the rate of vaginal births in 24 hours (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.16; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is of very low certainty for all other reported outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-dose oral misoprostol is probably associated with fewer caesarean sections (and therefore more vaginal births) than vaginal dinoprostone, and lower rates of hyperstimulation with foetal heart rate changes. However, time to birth may be increased, as seen by a reduced number of vaginal births within 24 hours. Compared to transcervical Foley catheter, low-dose oral misoprostol is associated with fewer caesarean sections, but equivalent rates of hyperstimulation. Low-dose misoprostol given orally rather than vaginally is probably associated with similar rates of vaginal birth, although rates may be lower within the first 24 hours. However, there is likely less hyperstimulation with foetal heart changes, and fewer caesarean sections performed due to foetal distress. The best available evidence suggests that low-dose oral misoprostol probably has many benefits over other methods for labour induction. This review supports the use of low-dose oral misoprostol for induction of labour, and demonstrates the lower risks of hyperstimulation than when misoprostol is given vaginally. More trials are needed to establish the optimum oral misoprostol regimen, but these findings suggest that a starting dose of 25 µg may offer a good balance of efficacy and safety.

### Oral vs. vaginal misoprostol for the induction of labor… [^e133acce]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E 1 analog, can initiate uterine contractions and has been reported to effectively induce labor. Some studies have found that vaginally administered misoprostol resulted in a shorter time to delivery than orally administered misoprostol but was associated with tachysystole and hyperstimulation of the uterus, which theoretically could lead to increased risk of operative delivery and neonatal asphyxia. Bennett and colleagues compared the effectiveness and incidence of adverse effects of misoprostol administered orally with misoprostol given vaginally in the induction of labor in women who were of at least 37 weeks' gestation. Data were compared from 206 Canadian women who met the criteria for safe induction of labor for anticipated vaginal delivery. After screening and giving informed consent, patients were randomly assigned to receive misoprostol either orally or vaginally.

To ensure the double-blind nature of the study, each patient received either active oral misoprostol plus vaginal placebo or active vaginal misoprostol plus oral placebo every four hours until the occurrence of one of the following: at least three contractions every 10 minutes, spontaneous rupture of the membranes or delivery, or a concern about fetal heart rate or other complications. The management of labor and delivery was determined by attending physicians, and each patient was monitored throughout the process. Patient satisfaction was assessed by questionnaire following delivery. The mean time to delivery was significantly reduced in the 102 women treated vaginally compared with the 104 treated orally. The two groups did not differ in analgesia, epidural anesthetic or oxytocin use. The two groups also had similar patterns of delivery with no difference in the rate of cesarean section or assisted delivery.

The authors conclude that both oral and vaginally administered of misoprostol are safe and effective for induction of labor. Vaginal administration is associated with more rapid delivery, greater uterine activity and more frequent fetal heart rate graph abnormalities. This finding may reflect uncertainties about the optimal dosage of vaginal misoprostol. Until the optimal dosing interval for vaginal use is determined, the preferred route of misoprostol administration might be oral.

Number of previous cesarean sections

Whereas a history of two previous CSs is often regarded as an absolute contraindication to VBAC, more recent evidence suggests that women — in highly selected cases — with two prior CSs may be considered for an attempt at VBAC if there is appropriate emergency obstetric care immediately available, in a high‐resource setting, and where the woman herself has a strong conviction and is well‐informed about the associated risks.

A retrospective cohort study compared outcomes between 82 women with two prior CSs who attempted VBAC (including those with a previous vaginal birth) and 711 women with two prior CSs who underwent planned repeat CS. In the attempted VBAC group, 69.5% achieved a successful vaginal birth. In comparison to those who had an unsuccessful VBAC, women who had a successful VBAC had a lower mean BMI at admission (31.0 kg/m² vs. 34.5 kg/m²; P = 0.04), lower mean neonatal birth weight (3351 g vs. 3681 g; P = 0.01), and a higher likelihood of a previous vaginal birth and a previous successful VBAC. Induction or augmentation of labor was associated with a greater likelihood of unsuccessful VBAC. There was one case of uterine rupture in the VBAC group (1/82) and none in the planned repeat CS group (0/711). However, there was one unplanned hysterectomy in the planned repeat CS group. Maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality were not significantly different between the groups.

### Clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates: systematic review&meta-analysis [^e872a515]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Assisted versus unassisted vaginal deliveries

Several studies stratified VBAC rates according to assisted versus unassisted (spontaneous) vaginal delivery. Among the RCTs, there were no significant differences in one trial comparing PGE2 with spontaneous labor (assisted, RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.24 versus unassisted, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.26) and another trial comparing 30 mL Foley catheter with 80 mL Foley catheter (assisted, RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.32 versus unassisted, RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.44 to 5.11). No significant differences between groups were found in other RCTs and cohort studies (various comparisons) that stratified vaginal deliveries as assisted or unassisted (very low certainty of evidence).

Among five cohort studies reporting VBAC rates for women with and without a prior vaginal delivery, four that compared induction with no induction were pooled. Results showed increased rates of VBAC among women with a prior vaginal delivery whose labor was not induced (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.97; I² = 0%), and for women without a prior vaginal delivery whose labor was not induced (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81; I² = 35%).

Uterine rupture rates

Of the studies that reported on uterine rupture, most had zero cases among study arms. Effect estimates are summarized in Table 4. All comparisons for pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic, combined (pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic) induction methods provided low to very low certainty of evidence.

### Vaginal birth after cesarean section: risk of uterine rupture with labor induction [^1e653ee6]. American Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

We assessed the rate of uterine rupture in patients undergoing labor induction for attempted vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). A retrospective study was performed of data from a computerized database. Deliveries from January 1, 1998, to June 30, 2001, in the Southern California Kaiser Permanente system were reviewed and various perinatal characteristics analyzed. A total of 16,218 patients had a prior low transverse cesarean section. Of these, 6832 (42.1%) had a trial of labor. Successful VBAC occurred in 86% of patients with spontaneous onset of labor and 66% of patients with labor induction (p < 0.001). The uterine rupture rate was not different between patients with spontaneous or induced labor (1.0% versus 1.2%, p = 0.51). Similarly, there was no significant difference between oxytocin or prostaglandin E2 induction (1.4% versus 1.0%, p = 0.59). In our study, labor induction did not appear to increase the risk of uterine rupture in women attempting VBAC.

In a daily obstetric practice, individual care might lead to deviation from protocol. Thus, results from experimental studies are not always valid for obstetric care. The aim of the present study was to compare efficiency and safety of MVI versus MVT for labor induction in nulliparous women within a routine care setting. Our primary outcomes were time from drug administration to delivery and the rate of CS.

### Fetal death: expert consensus of the French college of obstetricians and gynecologists [^f1ead98f]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

7 5 — (TABLES S17–S22)

If there is no risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation or maternal morbidity, the woman's wishes should be considered when determining the time between diagnosis of fetal death and labor induction. Return home is possible if it is the woman's wish (expert opinion).

In all situations except maternal life‐threatening emergencies, the preferred delivery mode is vaginal, regardless of previous cesarean section history (expert opinion).

It is recommended to administer mifepristone 200 mg at least 24 h before induction. The woman should be informed about the possibility of labor with this treatment (low recommendation; low quality of evidence).

It is recommended that osmotic dilators and prostaglandins not be used concurrently (low recommendation; moderate quality of evidence). Data on their sequential use are insufficient to make a recommendation.

Regarding induction after mifepristone, and depending on the cesarean section history, the following are recommended (expert opinion),:

No previous cesarean section
GA weeks 14–31, induction with oral or vaginal misoprostol 400 μg every 4 h.
After 31 weeks GA, induction methods used with the live fetus are possible. For misoprostol induction, the maximum recommended dose is 200 μg every 4 h.

One previous cesarean section
In most cases, vaginal delivery is preferred, after discussing the risks and benefits of delivery methods with the patient.
Between GA weeks 14–31, induction with oral or vaginal misoprostol 200 μg every 4 h, not to exceed 600 μg in 24 h.
After 31 weeks GA, induction methods used with the live fetus are possible.

Two or more cesarean sections
Vaginal delivery is preferred in most cases.
If vaginal delivery is chosen, the protocol as described in the case of a history of one cesarean section can be followed.

In all cases, membranes should be ruptured as early as possible, to reduce the time between induction and delivery.

Perimedullary analgesia should be used at the start of induction, per the woman's wishes, or intravenous morphine analgesia if contraindicated (expert opinion).

Regarding management in the immediate postpartum period, it is recommended that cabergoline be prescribed to prevent lactation onset, regardless of GA at fetal death, after discussing treatment side effects with the patient (expert opinion). The length of hospital stay after delivery should be adjusted on a case‐by‐case basis according to the risk or occurrence of maternal complications (expert opinion). Postpartum consultation should be scheduled before discharge (expert opinion).

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 205: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^3cf88e3c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Trial of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC) refers to a planned attempt to deliver vaginally by a woman who has had a previous cesarean delivery, regardless of the outcome. This method provides women who desire a vaginal delivery the possibility of achieving that goal-a vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC). In addition to fulfilling a patient's preference for vaginal delivery, at an individual level, VBAC is associated with decreased maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies as well as a decrease in the overall cesarean delivery rate at the population level (). However, although TOLAC is appropriate for many women, several factors increase the likelihood of a failed trial of labor, which in turn is associated with increased maternal and perinatal morbidity when compared with a successful trial of labor (ie, VBAC) and elective repeat cesarean delivery (). Therefore, assessing the likelihood of VBAC as well as the individual risks is important when determining who is an appropriate candidate for TOLAC. Thus, the purpose of this document is to review the risks and benefits of TOLAC in various clinical situations and to provide practical guidelines for counseling and management of patients who will attempt to give birth vaginally after a previous cesarean delivery.

### Oral misoprostol for induction of labour [^bc634ad6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Misoprostol is an orally active prostaglandin. In most countries misoprostol is not licensed for labour induction, but its use is common because it is cheap and heat stable.

Objectives

To assess the use of oral misoprostol for labour induction in women with a viable fetus.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (17 January 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing oral misoprostol versus placebo or other methods, given to women with a viable fetus for labour induction.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial data, using centrally-designed data sheets.

Main Results

Overall there were 76 trials (14,412) women) which were of mixed quality. In nine trials comparing oral misoprostol with placebo (1109 women), women using oral misoprostol were more likely to give birth vaginally within 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.49; one trial; 96 women), need less oxytocin (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.49; seven trials; 933 women) and have a lower caesarean section rate (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.95; eight trials; 1029 women). In 12 trials comparing oral misoprostol with vaginal dinoprostone (3859 women), women given oral misoprostol were less likely to need a caesarean section (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99; 11 trials; 3592 women). There was some evidence that they had slower inductions, but there were no other statistically significant differences. Nine trials (1282 women) compared oral misoprostol with intravenous oxytocin. The caesarean section rate was significantly lower in women who received oral misoprostol (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98; nine trials; 1282 women), but they had increased rates of meconium-stained liquor (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.60; seven trials; 1172 women). Thirty-seven trials (6417 women) compared oral and vaginal misoprostol and found no statistically significant difference in the primary outcomes of serious neonatal morbidity/death or serious maternal morbidity or death. The results for vaginal birth not achieved in 24 hours, uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes, and caesarean section were highly heterogenous - for uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes this was related to dosage with lower rates in those with lower doses of oral misoprostol. However, there were fewer babies born with a low Apgar score in the oral group (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.82; 19 trials; 4009 babies) and a decrease in postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.95; 10 trials; 1478 women). However, the oral misoprostol group had an increase in meconium-stained liquor (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.44; 24 trials; 3634 women).

Authors' Conclusions

Oral misoprostol as an induction agent is effective at achieving vaginal birth. It is more effective than placebo, as effective as vaginal misoprostol and results in fewer caesarean sections than vaginal dinoprostone or oxytocin. Where misoprostol remains unlicensed for the induction of labour, many practitioners will prefer to use a licensed product like dinoprostone. If using oral misoprostol, the evidence suggests that the dose should be 20 to 25 mcg in solution. Given that safety is the primary concern, the evidence supports the use of oral regimens over vaginal regimens. This is especially important in situations where the risk of ascending infection is high and the lack of staff means that women cannot be intensely monitored.

### Low-dose oral misoprostol for induction of labor: a systematic review [^83f3dfa3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the efficacy and safety of low-dose oral misoprostol compared with dinoprostone (PGE2), vaginal misoprostol, and oxytocin for labor induction in women with a viable fetus.

Data Sources

We conducted electronic database searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for articles published before January 2008 using the keywords misoprostol, labor, induction, randomized controlled trials, dinoprostone, oxytocin, pregnancy, and maternal and fetal side effects.

Methods Of Study Selection

We included randomized controlled trials comparing 20–25 micrograms oral misoprostol with vaginal misoprostol, dinoprostone or oxytocin given to women at 32–42 weeks of gestation for labor induction. From 401 citations identified, results from nine studies were finally analyzed using the Review Manager software. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed and random-effects models.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Nine articles with 2,937 women met the inclusion criteria. The five trials comparing oral misoprostol and dinoprostone showed significantly fewer women requiring cesarean delivery in the misoprostol group (20% compared with 26%; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71–0.96). There were no statistically significant differences in risks of uterine hyperstimulation or need for oxytocin augmentation. Two trials compared oral with vaginal low-dose misoprostol. Women using oral misoprostol were significantly less likely to experience uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes (2% compared with 13%; RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08–0.46), but there were no significant differences in other outcomes.

Conclusion

Low-dose oral misoprostol solution (20 micrograms) administered every 2 hours seems at least as effective as both vaginal dinoprostone and vaginal misoprostol, with lower rates of cesarean delivery and uterine hyperstimulation, respectively.

### Induction of labor [^4dddbb2a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The rate of labor induction continues to rise significantly in the United States because of a growing use of labor induction for postterm pregnancies and elective induction of labor. Although different types and doses of prostaglandins used for cervical ripening often initiate uterine activity, the principal role of these agents is to soften the unripe cervix independent of uterine activity. Several systematic reviews with meta-analyses have shown that prostaglandins are superior to placebo and oxytocin alone in ripening of the cervix. Numerous studies and meta-analyses have assessed misoprostol's efficacy and safety as a labor induction agent. The most appropriate dose and route of administration has not yet been confirmed.

### Providers' perspectives on the vaginal birth after cesarean guidelines in Florida, United States: a qualitative study [^9af1cc30]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

The downward trend in VBAC began in 1996, following the publication of an article by McMahon and colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine. The McMahon study, which was conducted in Nova Scotia, Canada, reported that major obstetrical complications were nearly twice as likely in the trial of labor group as in those women who underwent an elective repeat cesarean. The concern that was generated by this study, along with increasing liability pressure on obstetricians, prompted ACOG to publish a revised set of guidelines in 1999. Although ACOG concluded that most women should continue to be counselled about VBAC and offered a trial of labor, the language regarding physician availability was changed from "readily available" to "immediately available throughout active labor" [, p. 198]. The ACOG guidelines also specified that "VBAC should be attempted in institutions equipped to respond to emergencies with physicians immediately available to provide emergency care" [p. 201]; this recommendation, however, was based primarily on consensus and expert opinion, rather than on research evidence.

After considering the potential impact of the guidelines on VBAC availability, particularly in community and rural hospitals, ACOG later clarified that the operational definition of "immediately available" was subject to interpretation by the local institution. This clarification did not stop the downward trend, however. In 2001, another influential article appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine, which further precipitated the decline in VBAC. Authored by Lydon-Rochelle et al, this article reported that the risk of uterine rupture was higher among those women with a previous cesarean whose labor was induced; moreover, induction with prostaglandins conferred a much higher relative risk of uterine rupture. Associated editorials and subsequent media attention following the publication of this article directed the focus toward the rare complication of uterine rupture instead of highlighting the potential benefits of VBAC and the risks of multiple cesareans. As a result, VBAC rates steadily declined over the next decade, to the current rate of 8.2% nationwide (Figure 1).

### Trial of labor after cesarean, vaginal birth after cesarean, and the risk of uterine rupture: an expert review [^d34977c4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

The decision to pursue a trial of labor after cesarean delivery is complex and depends on patient preference, the likelihood of successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, assessment of the risks vs benefits of trial of labor after cesarean delivery, and available resources to support safe trial of labor after cesarean delivery at the planned birthing center. The most feared complication of trial of labor after cesarean delivery is uterine rupture, which can have catastrophic consequences, including substantial maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Although the absolute risk of uterine rupture is low, several clinical, historical, obstetrical, and intrapartum factors have been associated with increased risk. It is therefore critical for clinicians managing patients during trial of labor after cesarean delivery to be aware of these risk factors to appropriately select candidates for trial of labor after cesarean delivery and maximize the safety and benefits while minimizing the risks. Caution is advised when considering labor augmentation and induction in patients with a previous cesarean delivery. With established hospital safety protocols that dictate close maternal and fetal monitoring, avoidance of prostaglandins, and careful titration of oxytocin infusion when induction agents are needed, spontaneous and induced trial of labor after cesarean delivery are safe and should be offered to most patients with 1 previous low transverse, low vertical, or unknown uterine incision after appropriate evaluation, counseling, planning, and shared decision-making. Future research should focus on clarifying true risk factors and identifying the optimal approach to intrapartum and induction management, tools for antenatal prediction, and strategies for prevention of uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery. A better understanding will facilitate patient counseling, support efforts to improve trial of labor after cesarean delivery and vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates, and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery.

### Clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates: systematic review&meta-analysis [^6f0d2d12]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Implications for practice

The ability for the maternity care provider to use this evidence to counsel women with a previous CD so they have the information to make the best choice for their situation is a goal of this systematic review. Ananth et al completed a population based study, in the USA, to show the impact of scheduled/repeat CD on the total number of unscheduled/emergency and scheduled/repeat CD. From 1979 to 2010, unscheduled and scheduled CD increased 68% (95% CI 67–69) and 178% (95% CI 176–179), respectively. For the total number of deliveries in 2010, 18.5 and 14.4% were unscheduled and scheduled CDs, respectively. Maternal factors attributed to the unscheduled cesarean increases were increased maternal age, obesity and chronic hypertension. Clinical impact for the scheduled CD group of 14.4% (likely higher in 2019) requires better VBAC information for maternal education and choice.

One of the aspects of this VBAC choice is that women cannot choose to be in spontaneous labor at any given gestational age. In their VBAC choice, women are faced with the choice of expectant pregnancy management (waiting for labor to start) or consider an induction of labor protocol acceptable for VBAC or having the scheduled CD. Cervical status/Bishop score is an important clinical factor for induction of labor. The induction of labor protocol for women with a prior uterine scar reports that oxytocin is the only induction agent that can be used other than mechanical methods. Oxytocin has limited effectiveness for cervical ripening. Adequate cervical dilatation allows for amniotomy and oxytocin use to assist in induction process. There are no 'real' expectant management VBAC cohorts. For non-VBAC cohorts, there are studies comparing risks of elective labor induction with expectant management. For multiparous women a large retrospective cohort study showed that induction of labor is associated with decreased pregnancy-related hypertension and increased time in labor and delivery. A Cochrane review compared induction of labor at or beyond term with expectant management in uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies, with no parity factor identified; they reported that induction was associated with lower risk of perinatal death, stillbirth and fewer cesarean section, but more operative vaginal birth and no change for perineal trauma, postpartum hemorrhage, stillbirth, low Apgar score, or neonatal distress.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 205: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^33076725]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 205 — Induction and augmentation of labor during trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) outline uterine rupture risks by labor method and oxytocin use. Reported rupture rates include 0.52% for spontaneous labor, 0.77% for labor induced without prostaglandins, and 2.24% for prostaglandin-induced labor. In a multicenter TOLAC cohort (n = 33,699), rupture risks were 1.4% for induction with prostaglandins with or without oxytocin, 1.1% for oxytocin alone, 0.9% for augmented labor, and 0.4% for spontaneous labor, and a secondary analysis of 11,788 women found increased rupture only among those induced without a prior vaginal delivery (1.5% versus 0.8%, P = 0.02). Uterine rupture was no more likely when induction occurred with an unfavorable cervix than with a favorable cervix. A separate analysis noted a dose–response effect between higher maximum oxytocin dose and increased rupture risk, yet studies have not identified a clear threshold for rupture and an upper limit for oxytocin dosage with TOLAC has not been established. Given that study results vary and the absolute magnitude of reported risk is small, oxytocin augmentation may be used in women attempting TOLAC.

### Induction of labor in women with a prior cesarean delivery [^d6ba8ad8]. Seminars in Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Given the historically high rates of cesarean delivery in the United States, obstetrical providers must often consider an induction of labor for women with a history of prior cesarean delivery versus repeat cesarean delivery. Clinical evaluation of this scenario involves weighing the benefits of a successful trial of labor after cesarean delivery against the risks associated with symptomatic uterine rupture. This article will review the uncommon but clinically important circumstance of labor induction following a cesarean delivery, including method of induction as well as induction in the setting of second trimester still birth and fetal anomalies.

### Vaginal compared with oral misoprostol induction at term: a cluster randomized controlled trial [^480e2130]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy in achieving vaginal delivery with a standardized vaginal compared with oral misoprostol regimen for labor induction at term.

Methods

In this single-center, cluster randomized trial, we randomized induction method by week among individuals with gestational age of 37 weeks or more, cervical dilation of 2 cm or less, intact membranes, and indication for delivery to either oral (100 micrograms every 4 hours for up to two doses), or vaginal (25 micrograms every 3 hours for up to five doses) misoprostol regimens, followed by a standardized oxytocin protocol. Individuals with an antepartum stillbirth, major fetal anomalies, malpresentation, ruptured membranes, nonreassuring fetal status, or contraindication to prostaglandin were excluded. The primary outcome was vaginal delivery at first induction attempt. Secondary outcomes included time to delivery, need for oxytocin, chorioamnionitis, and adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Outcomes were recorded at the individual level and adjusted for clustering, with analysis by intention to treat.

Results

Between May 24, 2021, to September 19, 2022, 1,322 women were randomized to vaginal misoprostol in 33 clusters and 1,224 to oral misoprostol in 37 clusters. Demographic characteristics or initial cervical dilation did not differ between groups. The primary outcome did not differ between induction regimens and occurred in 1,032 (78.1%) of the vaginal misoprostol arm and 945 (77.2%) of the oral misoprostol arm (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.01, 95% CI, 0.97–1.05). Tachysystole with fetal heart rate changes occurred less frequently with vaginal compared with oral misoprostol (3.5% vs 5.9%, adjusted RR 0.59, 95% CI, 0.40–0.87). Time to delivery did not differ between groups. Oxytocin was less frequently required before delivery in the vaginal misoprostol group (68.8% vs 78.4%, adjusted RR 0.88, 95% CI, 0.84–0.92).

Conclusion

Induction of labor with vaginal compared with oral misoprostol protocols did not increase the frequency of vaginal delivery at term but did reduce the need for oxytocin use before delivery.

### Misoprostol [^1183e9d6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Labor and delivery

Misoprostol can induce or augment uterine contractions. Vaginal administration of misoprostol, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony. A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of misoprostol is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes. Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting.

The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture.

The use of misoprostol outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery. Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol.

Misoprostol should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture. Misoprostol should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate.

The effect of misoprostol on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when misoprostol is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established. Information on misoprostol's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown.

The use of misoprostol for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions. These fevers were transient in nature. Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation.

### Single-balloon catheter with concomitant vaginal misoprostol is the most effective strategy for labor induction: a meta-review with network meta-analysis [^048a59f1]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been conducted to summarize the evidence for the efficacy of various labor induction agents. However, the most effective agents or strategies have not been conclusively determined. We aimed to perform a meta-review and network meta-analysis of published systematic reviews to determine the efficacy and safety of currently employed pharmacologic, mechanical, and combined methods of labor induction.

Data Sources

With the assistance of an experienced medical librarian, we performed a systematic search of the literature using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials. We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to May 31, 2021.

Study Eligibility Criteria

We considered systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials comparing different agents or methods for inpatient labor induction.

Methods

We conducted a frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis employing data from randomized controlled trials of published systematic reviews. We performed direct pairwise meta-analyses to compare the efficacy of the various labor induction agents and placebo or no treatment. We performed ranking to determine the best treatment using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. The main outcomes assessed were cesarean delivery, vaginal delivery within 24 hours, operative vaginal delivery, hyperstimulation, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and Apgar scores of < 7 at 5 minutes of birth.

Results

We included 11 systematic reviews and extracted data from 207 randomized controlled trials with a total of 40,854 participants. When assessing the efficacy of all agents and methods, the combination of a single-balloon catheter with misoprostol was the most effective in reducing the odds of cesarean delivery and vaginal birth > 24 hours (surface under the cumulative ranking curve of 0.9 for each). Among the pharmacologic agents, low-dose vaginal misoprostol was the most effective in reducing the odds of cesarean delivery, whereas high-dose vaginal misoprostol was the most effective in achieving vaginal delivery within 24 hours (surface under the cumulative ranking curve of 0.9 for each). Single-balloon catheter (surface under the cumulative ranking curve of 0.8) and double-balloon catheter (surface under the cumulative ranking curve of 0.9) were the most effective in reducing the odds of operative vaginal delivery and hyperstimulation. Buccal or sublingual misoprostol (surface under the cumulative ranking curve of 0.9) and the combination of single-balloon catheter and misoprostol (surface under the cumulative ranking curve of 0.9) most effectively reduced the odds of abnormal Apgar scores and neonatal intensive care unit admissions.

Conclusion

The combination of a single-balloon catheter with misoprostol was the most effective method in reducing the odds for cesarean delivery and prolonged time to vaginal delivery. This method was associated with a reduction in admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit.

Data sources The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Database of Trials (which incorporates the results of a broad generic search for all pregnancy and postpartum trials). Sources included are CENTRAL, Medline, Embase, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, CINAHL, relevant journals, conference proceedings, and registries of ongoing trials.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised clinical trials of prostaglandin or prostaglandin analogues used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction versus placebo or no treatment, alternative prostaglandin dose or administration, or a different type of prostaglandin. We included studies recruiting women with a viable fetus, but had no other restrictions relating to indication for labour induction or language of publication. Outcomes assessed were serious neonatal morbidity (trialist defined) or perinatal death; serious maternal morbidity (trialist defined) or death; vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours, caesarean section, and uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes.

Results 280 randomised clinical trials were included (48 068 women) in the review. Maternal and neonatal mortality and serious morbidity were rarely reported and are summarized narratively. Unresolved inconsistency was observed for the hyperstimulation outcome. Relative to placebo, the odds of failing to achieve a vaginal delivery were lowest for vaginal misoprostol (≥ 50 µg) (odds ratio 0.06 (95% credible interval 0.02 to 0.12)), with a 39% absolute probability of event (95% credible interval 1% to 94%). Compared with placebo, odds of caesarean section were lowest for titrated oral misoprostol solution (< 50 µg) (odds ratio 0.65 (0.49 to 0.83)), with an absolute probability of event of 15% (3% to 40%).

Conclusions Low dose(< 50 µg) titrated oral misoprostol solution had the lowest probability of caesarean section, whereas vaginal misprostol (≥ 50 µg) had the highest probability of achieving a vaginal delivery within 24 hours. These findings have important implications for a series of current national and international guidelines for induction of labour and future research in this area.

### Misoprostol-augmented induction of labour for third trimester fetal demise in a patient with prior hysterotomies [^904ab67b]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 31-year-old G3P2002 with history of two prior caesarean sections presented with influenza-like illness, requiring intubation secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Investigations revealed intrauterine fetal demise at 30-week gestation. She soon deteriorated with sepsis and multiple organs impacted. Risks of the gravid uterus impairing cardiopulmonary function appeared greater than risks of delivery, including that of uterine rupture. Vaginal birth after caesarean was achieved with misoprostol and critical care status rapidly improved. Current guidelines for management of fetal demise in patients with prior hysterotomies are mixed: although the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends standard obstetric protocols rather than misoprostol administration for labour augmentation, there is limited published data citing severe maternal morbidity associated with misoprostol use. This case report argues misoprostol-augmented induction of labour can be a reasonable option in a medically complex patient with fetal demise and prior hysterotomies.

### Labour induction with prostaglandins: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^8267a997]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

In terms of efficacy, we focused on the ability of prostaglandins to result in vaginal delivery within 24 hours. This definition of efficacy may be seen as controversial given that cervical ripening is often regarded as a distinctly different process from induction of labour. This view is reflected by the fact that cervical changes measured by the Bishop score are often the main measure of efficacy in included randomised trials. We argue that both women and clinicians view cervical ripening and labour induction as a seamless process, with the main aim being to achieve safe vaginal birth of a healthy baby in the shortest time possible. In this respect, misoprostol seems to be superior to other prostaglandins.

We anticipated that serious maternal and neonatal adverse events would be rare in cohorts of women recruited to randomised trials of labour induction. It was, nevertheless, disappointing how infrequently mortality and serious morbidity were adequately reported. We note that only 51 out of 280 trials reported that they had assessed perinatal death, and only 18 reported assessing maternal death (appendix 6). Where these outcomes were reported, they were rare: 30 out of 51 trials reporting perinatal death and 14 out of 18 trials that reported maternal death did not observe events in either arm of the trial. Assessment of safety was, therefore, limited to caesarean section. All prostaglandins, misoprostol in particular, even in low doses, are known to cause uterine rupture with possible catastrophic consequences, particularly in women with previous caesarean section. The efficacy of both high and low dose vaginal misoprostol has to be seen in this context.

### Obstetric care consensus # 10: management of Stillbirth: (replaces practice bulletin number 102, March 2009) [^26c36766]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Induction regimens by gestational age — Before 28 weeks of gestation, vaginal misoprostol appears to be the most efficient method of induction, although high-dose oxytocin infusion also is an acceptable choice. A meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials demonstrated that both vaginal and oral misoprostol regimens were 100% effective in achieving uterine evacuation within 48 hours. Based on limited evidence, before 28 weeks of gestation, typical dosages for misoprostol are 400–600 μg vaginally every 3–6 hours, and doses less than 400 μg have decreased efficacy. After 28 weeks of gestation, induction of labor should be managed according to usual obstetric protocols.

### Inducing labor after fetal demise: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of mifepristone and misoprostol combination versus misoprostol alone [^0385c0bf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The induction-to-delivery interval is a critical outcome in evaluating labor induction methods; however, the presence of publication bias poses a significant concern in interpreting this metric. Additionally, the assessment of bias in such trials is inherently challenging, as most studies in this area are limited by their design. These design limitations make it difficult to eliminate performance and detection bias entirely. This underscores the need for further investigations that prioritize transparency, comprehensiveness, and innovative approaches to minimize bias while maintaining ethical standards. Addressing these challenges is crucial to ensuring a more accurate understanding of the potential benefits and limitations of different induction strategies, ultimately informing better clinical decision-making and optimizing patient outcomes in labor induction practices.

The comparison of the number of misoprostol dosing was meticulously analyzed across various studies, primarily over a 24-h timeframe. However, the implications of dosing were also examined in studies that evaluated induction over an extended period of 36 to 48 h. These findings indicate that the pharmacokinetics of misoprostol and the timing of administration can play critical roles in determining the induction-to-delivery interval. In our study, we found that the total amount of misoprostol administered in the combination therapy with mifepristone was significantly lower than that used when misoprostol was given as a standalone treatment. This observation is noteworthy, as it suggests that the addition of mifepristone may enhance the efficacy of misoprostol, allowing for a reduction in dosage without compromising the effectiveness of labor induction. This reduction not only highlights the potential cost-effectiveness of the combination approach but also presents an opportunity to reduce the risk of side effects commonly associated with higher doses of misoprostol. Upon examining the methodologies and dosages of misoprostol employed in these studies, it becomes evident that the administration strategy must be tailored according to gestational age. Variations in gestational age may influence uterine responsiveness to misoprostol, thus impacting the overall induction outcomes. Lower doses may be particularly advantageous in certain populations, potentially facilitating a smoother labor induction process while minimizing the likelihood of adverse events such as hyperstimulation or gastrointestinal side effects. Future studies should aim to delineate the optimal dosing strategies tailored to specific clinical scenarios to maximize both maternal safety and therapeutic efficacy.

### Labor induction with 25 microg versus 50 microg intravaginal misoprostol: a systematic review [^8cd8fc92]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically review published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the safety and efficacy of 25 microg versus 50 microg of intravaginal misoprostol for cervical ripening and labor induction.

Data Sources

We supplemented a search of entries in electronic databases with references cited in original studies and review articles to identify RCTs of misoprostol for cervical ripening and labor induction, which compared repeated doses of 25 microg and 50 microg.

Study Selection

We evaluated, abstracted data, and assessed the quality of RCTs to compare the safety and efficacy of 25 microg versus 50 microg of intravaginal misoprostol for cervical ripening and labor induction.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Five RCTs met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each outcome (random- and fixed-effects models). In addition, we aggregated the results of two separate studies, permitting an indirect comparison of the two doses being analyzed. In the meta-analysis, tachysystole and hyperstimulation syndrome appear to occur less frequently among women who received 25 microg of misoprostol than with 50 microg. However, neonatal outcomes appear to be comparable with the two doses. Regarding efficacy, use of the 50-microg dose was associated with a shorter interval to vaginal delivery, greater proportion of deliveries within 24 hours, and less frequent need for oxytocin augmentation. The indirect comparison of two studies yielded similar results.

Conclusion

Published data indicate that intravaginal misoprostol at doses of 50 microg for cervical ripening and labor induction is more efficacious but it is unclear whether it is as safe as the 25-microg dose.

### Sublingual misoprostol for the induction of labor at term [^9046a412]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and patient acceptability of sublingual misoprostol compared with an equivalent dose administered orally for labor induction at term.

Study Design

One hundred women with medical or obstetric indications for induction of labor after 37 weeks of gestation and unfavorable cervices were randomized to receive 50 microg of misoprostol either orally or sublingually. The dose was repeated every 4 hours to a maximum of 5 doses if indicated. Previous cesarean delivery was a criteria for exclusion. Our primary outcome measure was the number of patients who went on to have a vaginal delivery within 24 hours of the induction. The need for oxytocin, mode of delivery, number of cesarean deliveries for fetal distress, uterine hyperstimulation rates, and neonatal outcomes were secondary outcome measures. Patient acceptability was assessed by questionnaires completed after delivery.

Results

Significantly more patients were delivered of infants within 24 hours (73.8% versus 45.7%; relative risk, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.4) and the induction to delivery intervals were significantly shorter (20 hours versus 28.3 hours; mean difference, 8.3 hours; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 15.4) in the sublingual group compared with the oral group. There was 1 case of uterine hyperstimulation in the sublingual group. There were no significant differences in the mode of delivery, interventions for fetal distress, or neonatal outcomes in the 2 groups. The satisfaction rates were 82.5% and 85.7% in the oral and sublingual groups respectively, and 9.5% of patients thought that the sublingual tablets did not dissolve completely.

Conclusion

There has been no previous report in the literature of misoprostol given sublingually for labor induction. Sublingual misoprostol seems to have better efficacy than oral misoprostol, seems to be acceptable to patients, and is an option to be considered to induce labor at term.

### Oral versus vaginal misoprostol for labor induction [^f4c649bb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the safety and effectiveness of vaginal with oral misoprostol for induction of labor.

Methods

A total of 107 women with clinical indication for induction were randomly assigned to receive oral or vaginal misoprostol. Doses of 100 microg of oral or 25 microg of vaginal misoprostol were given every 3–4 hours. If cervical ripening or active labor did not occur, repeated doses of oral (100–200 microg) or vaginal (25–50 microg) were given until labor was established.

Results

Fifty-nine women received oral misoprostol, and 48 received vaginal administration. Delivery time was similar for the vaginal and oral arms (1074 ± 488 minutes versus 930 ± 454 minutes, P = 0.11). Parity was significantly different (P = 0.04) for the vaginal and oral groups. The cesarean delivery rate was similar for the vaginal and oral arms (17% versus 15%, P = 0.72). The number of medication administrations was consistent between groups. Birth weight was not different for patients in the control and treatment groups (vaginal 3281 ± 507 g versus oral 3359 ± 541 g, P = 0.44). Chorioamnionitis and tachysystole were comparable for the oral and vaginal groups. There was no statistical difference in neonatal outcomes. Similar proportions of infants were admitted to the well baby nursery and intermediate care nursery.

Conclusion

These findings indicate that, in a closely supervised hospital setting with adequate monitoring, oral misoprostol has the potential to induce labor as safely and effectively as its vaginal analogue.

### Efficacy and safety of administering oral misoprostol by titration compared to vaginal misoprostol and dinoprostone for cervical ripening and induction of labour: study protocol for a randomised clinical trial [^7656345f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Among the various methods available, the administration of prostaglandins is the most effective for inducing labour in women with an unfavourable cervix. Recent studies have compared treatment with various titrated doses of oral misoprostol with vaginal misoprostol or dinoprostone, indicating that the use of an escalating dose of an oral misoprostol solution is associated with a lower rate of caesarean sections and a better safety profile. The objective of this study is to assess which of these three therapeutic options (oral or vaginal misoprostol or vaginal dinoprostone) achieves the highest rate of vaginal delivery within the first 24 h of drug administration.

Methods

An open-label randomised controlled trial will be conducted in Araba University Hospital (Spain). Women at ≥ 41 weeks of pregnancy requiring elective induction of labour who meet the selection criteria will be randomly allocated to one of three groups: 1) vaginal dinoprostone (delivered via a controlled-release vaginal insert containing 10 mg of dinoprostone, for up to 24 h); 2) vaginal misoprostol (25 μg of vaginal misoprostol every 4 h up to a maximum of 24 h); and 3) oral misoprostol (titrated doses of 20 to 60 μg of misoprostol following a 3 h on + 1 h off regimen up to a maximum of 24 h). Both intention-to-treat analysis and per-protocol analysis will be performed.

Discussion

The proposed study seeks to gather evidence on which of these three therapeutic options achieves the highest rate of vaginal delivery with the best safety profile, to enable obstetricians to use the most effective and safe option for their patients.

### Low-dose oral misoprostol vs. oxytocin in premature rupture of membranes at ≥ 36 weeks: a comparison of labor induction outcomes and postpartum hemorrhage risk [^6d3abb67]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) refers to the rupture of fetal membranes before the onset of labor. Term PROM occurs in about 8% of pregnancies and significantly increases the risk of intrauterine infection, which worsens the longer the membranes remain ruptured. Induction is generally preferred over expectant management for term PROM. Traditionally, "term" is defined as 37 to 41 weeks of gestation. However, because neonatal outcomes at 36 weeks and beyond are largely comparable, many clinical practices now consider the management of PROM to be equally important starting at 36 weeks' gestation.

The decision to induce labor relies on an assessment of cervical favorability, traditionally evaluated using the Bishop score. In cases where the cervix is deemed favorable (Bishop score ≥ 6), oxytocin is administered intravenously to initiate labor. Conversely, if the cervix is considered unfavorable (Bishop score < 6), prostaglandin or Foley's balloon are commonly employed for cervical ripening. However, in patients with PROM, vaginal manipulation such as Foley's balloon or vaginal administration of prostaglandin may increase the incidence of infection and potentially result in uterine hyperstimulation, fetal distress, and emergency Cesarean delivery.

Oxytocin is widely recognized as the most commonly employed labor induction agent worldwide and has been recommended as the preferred choice in cases of PROM by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), primarily due to its fewer contraindications and adverse effects. However, oxytocin's efficacy appears to be limited in term PROM patients with an unripened cervix.

Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 drug utilized for cervical ripening, demonstrates cost-effectiveness, high efficiency, and global accessibility. The primary contraindication of misoprostol is a history of cesarean delivery or other uterine scarring. In China, asthma and glaucoma are also considered contraindications for labor induction with this agent. The most common dose-dependent adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chills, shivering, and fever. Between 2006 and 2021, the Cochrane Collaboration conducted three systematic reviews evaluating the efficacy and safety of oral misoprostol for labor induction. Recent evidence suggests that low-dose oral misoprostol (less than 50 µg) exhibits superior rates of vaginal delivery compared to oxytocin, vaginal misoprostol, and dinoprostone PGE2 while also being associated with fewer instances of abnormal fetal heart rate changes and uterine tachysystole. Similar results were observed in patients with term PROM.

### Is vaginal birth after cesarean safe? Experience at a community hospital [^def9b7d4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of promoting a trial of labor after prior cesarean birth in a community hospital.

Study Design

A 4-year prospective cohort study was conducted of all patients who had prior cesarean births (N = 1481). A comparison of outcomes was performed between those who elected repeat cesarean delivery (n = 727) and those who attempted a trial of labor after previous cesarean(s) (n = 754).

Results

We found that the vaginal birth after cesarean attempt rate was 50.9% and declined significantly during the last 2 years of the study. The elective repeat cesarean rate was 49.1% and increased significantly during the last 2 years of the study. In addition, we found that neonatal outcomes were similar, with the exception of 2 neonatal deaths caused by uterine rupture. Twelve uterine ruptures occurred (1.6%), and 11 of the 12 ruptures involved either induction or augmentation of labor, or both.

Conclusions

A trial of vaginal birth after cesarean is safe provided that induction of labor is not used. The uterine rupture rate of 1.6% is higher than reported in the literature; this may reflect underreporting by community hospitals.

### High-dose vaginal misoprostol versus concentrated oxytocin plus low-dose vaginal misoprostol for midtrimester labor induction: a randomized trial [^a9aaef9f]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and side effects of a high-dose vaginal misoprostol regimen to concentrated intravenous oxytocin plus low-dose vaginal misoprostol for midtrimester labor induction.

Study Design

Women at 14 to 24 weeks, with obstetric or fetal indications for delivery and no prior cesarean, were randomly assigned to receive either vaginal misoprostol 600 microg x 1, then 400 microg every 4 hours x 5 (group 1) or escalating dose-concentrated oxytocin infusions (277–1667 mU/min) plus vaginal misoprostol 400 microg x 1, then 200 microg every 6 hours x 2, then 100 microg x 1 (group 2). Analysis was by intent to treat. Primary outcomes were live birth rate and induction-to-delivery interval.

Results

The intended sample size was 70 women per group; however, the trial was terminated at the initial interim analysis because of a highly significant difference in 1 of the primary study outcomes. Twenty women were assigned to group 1 and 18 were assigned to group 2. Median induction-to-delivery interval was significantly shorter in group 1 (12 hours, range 4–44 hours) versus group 2 (18 hours, range 7–36 hours; P = 0.01). Induction success rate at 12 hours was significantly higher in group 1 (60%) compared with group 2 (22%, P = 0.02). No significant difference was noted in the live birth rate between groups 1 and 2 (13%, 0%, P = 0.16). The incidence of retained placenta requiring curettage, chorioamnionitis, intrapartum fever, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea were similar between both groups.

Conclusion

Compared with concentrated oxytocin plus low-dose vaginal misoprostol, high-dose vaginal misoprostol significantly shortens midtrimester labor inductions.

### A comparison of misoprostol vaginal insert and misoprostol vaginal tablets for induction of labor in nulliparous women: a retrospective cohort study [^138c4a22]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this study among nulliparous women in a routine care setting we found 200 μg MVI to be a more efficient and safe labor induction agent compared to 25 μg MVT. The time from drug administration to delivery was significantly shorter and the CS rate reduced in women induced with MVI, compared with MVT. Future studies comparing methods for labor induction should acknowledge the particular status of nulliparous women.

### The misoPROM study: a multicenter randomized comparison of oral misoprostol and oxytocin for premature rupture of membranes at term [^e5e8d7e9]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to determine whether induction of labor with oral misoprostol will result in fewer cesarean deliveries than intravenous oxytocin in nulliparous women with premature rupture of membranes at term.

Study Design

Three hundred five women at 10 centers were randomly assigned to receive oral misoprostol, 100 microg every 6 hours to a maximum of two doses or intravenous oxytocin. The primary outcome measure was cesarean deliveries. Secondary outcomes were time from induction to vaginal delivery and measures of maternal and neonatal safety.

Results

The study was stopped prematurely because of recruitment difficulties. We present the results for the 305 enrolled women. There was no difference in the proportion of women who underwent cesarean delivery (20.1% in the misoprostol group, 19.9% in the oxytocin group). The time interval from induction to vaginal delivery was also similar (11.9 hours for the misoprostol group, and 11.8 hours for the oxytocin group). Maternal and neonatal safety outcomes were similar for the two treatments. More infants born to women in the misoprostol group received intravenous antibiotics in the neonatal period (16.4% vs 6.9%, P = 0.01), although there were no differences in chorioamnionitis or in proven neonatal infections. Women receiving misoprostol were less likely to have postpartum hemorrhage than those receiving oxytocin (1.9% vs 6.2%, P = 0.05).

Conclusion

Oral misoprostol does not offer any advantage in time from induction to vaginal delivery or risk of cesarean section.

### Labour induction with prostaglandins: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^88e5ec97]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

Network meta-analysis provides a unique opportunity to rank prostaglandin treatments in a coherent, methodologically robust manner, and allows comparisons to be made across outcomes (figs 3–5), to help guide clinicians and patients to make informed treatment choices. This network meta-analysis showed that misoprostol is likely to be superior to dinoprostone (prostaglandin E 2) for labour induction. On balance, if treatment rankings for vaginal delivery within 24 hours and caesarean section were informally combined, oral misoprostol solution < 50 µg would seem the most highly ranked treatment across the two outcomes, followed by high dose misoprostol vaginal tablets and then low dose vaginal misoprostol tablets. However, the width of the credible intervals around the posterior median ranks was considerable, and so we urge caution in the interpretation of rankings and the probability that treatments are "best". In particular, we note the uncertainty around sustained release vaginal misoprostol: there was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about its relative safety and efficacy compared with vaginal tablets, which have been examined in a larger number of trials (and are estimated with greater certainty).

Strengths and limitations of the study

We have made a considerable effort to include all relevant randomised controlled trials with no language or setting restrictions: 280 studies with data for 48 068 women were included in the systematic review, which is a particular strength of this study. We have started from the premise that all 12 treatment regimens would be suitable for all included women. This underlying assumption of "transitivity" is critically important for the network meta-analysis. To evaluate this, we extracted the data for six potential treatment modifiers (previous caesarean section, parity, status of amniotic membranes, Bishop score, gestational age, and singleton or multiple pregnancy) and found no clinically important differences between the 12 regimens (appendix 6, tables 1–3). We took the view that the trial's setting was not likely to be a critical treatment modifier because in the included trials intrapartum fetal monitoring and immediate access to caesarean section were available to most women. As this may not be the case in low resource settings, the findings from our analysis are more likely to be applicable to high resource settings.

### Failed induction of labor and associated factors among women undergoing induction at university of gondar specialized hospital, northwest Ethiopia [^1de03f85]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Induction of labor (IOL) is an artificial stimulation of uterine contraction at 28 or more weeks of gestation but before spontaneous onset of labor to achieve vaginal delivery and it is a common practice in current obstetrics. IOL is a life-saving obstetrical intervention indicated only when the benefits of discontinuing the pregnancy outweigh the risks of continuation. The failure or success of induction may depend on the choice of induction methods, such as the pharmacological, mechanical, or a combination of both. Oxytocin and Misoprostol from the pharmacologic; ARM and Balloon catheter from the mechanical method are among the commonly used methods of labor induction.

While there is a well-accepted definition of IOL, the definition of a failed induction of labor (FIOL) is less certain. Nevertheless, a variety of criteria such as mode of delivery (vaginal versus cesarean) and certain time intervals within which active phase of labor achieved or adequate number of uterine contractions achieved are among the suggested criteria for diagnosing FIOL. The Federal Ministry of Health of Ethiopia (FMoH), defined FIOL as an inability to achieve adequate uterine contractions (3-5C/10 min/ ≥ 40s) after 6 to 8 h of oxytocin infusion with the use of its maximum dose. Most other studies however defined FIOL as an inability to achieve vaginal delivery or birth through cesarean section (CS).

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 205: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^bf6ed2b8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — Counseling for trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) — Accordingly, potential risks and benefits of both TOLAC and elective repeat cesarean delivery should be discussed, and these discussions should be documented. Discussion should consider individual characteristics that affect the likelihood of complications so that a woman can choose her intended route of delivery based on personally relevant data, and a VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean) calculator may be used to provide more specific information about the chance of VBAC. If the type of previous uterine incision is in doubt, reasonable attempts should be made to obtain the patient's medical records. Counseling should address the resources available to support women electing TOLAC at their intended delivery site, and available data confirm that TOLAC may be safely attempted in both university and community hospitals and in facilities with or without residency programs. After counseling, the ultimate decision to undergo TOLAC or a repeat cesarean delivery should be made by the patient in consultation with her obstetrician or other obstetric care provider, and documentation of counseling and the management plan should be included in the medical record.

### Misoprostol for midtrimester termination of pregnancy in women with 1 or more prior cesarean deliveries [^c25ff3af]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of vaginal misoprostol for midtrimester termination of pregnancy (TOP) in women with 1 or more prior cesarean deliveries (CDs).

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted with 279 women undergoing TOP with vaginal misoprostol between 14 and 26 weeks of gestation. Of these, 193 had no uterine scars (group 1), 60 had 1 prior CD (group 2), and 26 had 2 or more prior CDs (group 3). The primary outcome was the success rate of TOP. Secondary outcomes were time from induction to abortion, total dose of misoprostol used, and occurrence of uterine rupture.

Results

The success rates were 96.4% in group 1, 81.7% in group 2, and 76.9% in group 3 (P = 0.001). Time from induction to abortion, total dose misoprostol, and duration of hospital stay differed significantly among the groups (P = 0.001 for all variables). There were 3 cases (11.5%) of uterine rupture in group 3, for an overall rate of 1.1%.

Conclusion

Misoprostol inserted vaginally was effective for midtrimester TOP but the safety of using misoprostol in women with 2 or more prior CDs cannot be confirmed from the present study. Misoprostol should be used carefully, particularly in women with 2 or more prior CDs.

### Elective induction of labor following prior cesarean delivery [^6cc42ebe]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Following the release of A Randomized Trial of Induction versus Expectant Management (ARRIVE) trial, the induction of labor at 39 weeks has increased in the United States. The risk of uterine rupture and optimal timing of elective induction in those patients with a prior cesarean delivery is not well-described, and they were not included in the original trial. We aimed to determine the risk of uterine rupture in those patients undergoing elective induction of labor with prior cesarean delivery.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort of participants with prior cesarean delivery from 1996 to 2000. Participants were included if they had two or more prior cesareans. Participants were excluded if they had a history of an unknown prior incision, a classical incision, gestational age < 39 weeks, any diabetes, chronic hypertension, twin gestation, collagen or vascular disease, or HIV. Those undergoing expectant management were compared with those undergoing elective induction with no medical or obstetrical indications for delivery. Analysis was performed at three gestational age groups: 39 weeks, 40 weeks, and 41 weeks. The primary outcomes were uterine rupture, rates of successful vaginal delivery, and a composite major morbidity risk. Multivariable logistic regression was performed.

Results

At 39 weeks, 618 (10.3%) elective inductions were compared with 5,365 (89.7%) undergoing expectant management; uterine rupture occurred more frequently (13 patients [2.1%] vs. 49 patients [0.9%]; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–4.6) with fewer successful vaginal birth after cesarean [VBAC; 66.8 vs. 75%; aOR, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.5–0.7]. The risk of uterine rupture was similar between groups at 40 weeks (5 patients [0.8%] vs. 21 patients [1.2%]; p = 0.387) and 41 weeks (7 patients [1.4%] vs. 2 patients (0.8%); p = 0.448).

Conclusion

Patients undergoing elective induction of labor with a prior cesarean scar had an increased risk of uterine rupture when compared with expectant management at 39 weeks, with fewer successful VBAC.

Key Points

· TOLAC elective induction at 39 weeks has an increased risk of uterine rupture. · TOLAC elective induction at 39 weeks has a less successful chance of vaginal delivery. · Awaiting spontaneous labor in this cohort does not increase the risk of uterine rupture.

### Oral misoprostol versus vaginal dinoprostone for labor induction in nulliparous women at term [^0fccb195]. Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of oral misoprostol to vaginal dinoprostone for labor induction in nulliparous women.

Study Design

Admissions for labor induction from January 2008 to December 2010 were reviewed. Patients receiving oral misoprostol were compared with those receiving vaginal dinoprostone. The primary outcome was time from induction agent administration to vaginal delivery. Secondary outcomes included vaginal delivery within 24h, mode of delivery and maternal and fetal outcomes.

Result

A total of 680 women were included: 483 (71%) received vaginal dinoprostone and 197 (29%) received oral misoprostol. Women who received oral misoprostol had a shorter interval to vaginal delivery (27.2 vs 21.9h, P < 0.0001) and were more likely to deliver vaginally in < 24h (47% vs 64%, P = 0.001). There was no increase in the rate of cesarean delivery or adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes.

Conclusion

Labor induction with oral misoprostol resulted in shorter time to vaginal delivery without increased adverse outcomes in nulliparous women.
