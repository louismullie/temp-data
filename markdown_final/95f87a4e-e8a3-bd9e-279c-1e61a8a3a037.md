## Question

Colchicine and aki

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether colchicine causes acute kidney injury and how to reconcile mechanistic, clinical, and guideline-level evidence to guide safe use, especially in patients with or at risk for AKI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and whether colchicine is inherently nephrotoxic. Then, I should verify mechanistic data on colchicine's anti-inflammatory effects that might even protect the kidney. Next, I will examine clinical evidence for AKI signals, including large trials and case reports. After that, I need to check guideline positions on dosing in CKD and AKI contexts. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach to use and monitoring, and state a clear conclusion with caveats.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and basic safety profile. Colchicine is not considered a direct nephrotoxin like aminoglycosides or cisplatin; its toxicity is typically gastrointestinal, hematologic, and neuromuscular, with renal failure more often a consequence of systemic toxicity rather than direct tubular injury, and it is metabolized by CYP3A4 and transported by P-glycoprotein, which becomes clinically important for drug–drug interactions and accumulation in renal impairment [^8b37aaa7] [^38227df9].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic angle before jumping to conclusions. Colchicine inhibits microtubule polymerization and can suppress inflammasome signaling, including NLRP3, which is implicated in sepsis-associated AKI and pyroptosis; theoretically, this could be renoprotective in inflammatory AKI phenotypes, although clinical translation remains uncertain and requires trials to confirm benefit in humans [^ab33fcb5].

> I will now examine the highest-quality clinical signal. In the RECOVERY platform trial of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, allocation to colchicine did not reduce mortality or progression to invasive ventilation or death, and notably, there were two serious adverse reactions attributed to colchicine: one severe AKI and one rhabdomyolysis; this is a critical safety signal, but I should be cautious not to over-attribute causality in a complex, multi-illness population without adjudication [^67c70739].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single trial. Observational COVID-19 cohorts suggest improved short- and long-term kidney function with colchicine, but these are retrospective, unblinded, and confounded by illness severity and care differences; thus, they cannot establish causality and should be viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive evidence of renal benefit or safety [^6baeab1d] [^4adf5e1f].

> Next, I should review case-level toxicity data to balance the picture. Multiple reports document severe colchicine toxicity including acute renal failure, often in the setting of overdose, intravenous administration, or impaired clearance; importantly, even standard oral doses can lead to accumulation and toxicity in advanced CKD or when interacting drugs are present, reinforcing the need for dose adjustment and vigilance [^0f7ba999] [^8b37aaa7].

> I need to check authoritative guidelines to anchor dosing and safety. KDIGO recommends low-dose colchicine as a preferred option for acute gout in CKD, with dose reduction in eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and particular caution in eGFR below 30, aligning with pharmacokinetic data showing marked reductions in clearance and increased exposure in CKD; transplant guidance similarly advises dose reduction and limited duration in reduced eGFR due to toxicity risk, and cardiology guidance advises avoiding use when eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^ad5ebc0e] [^1eb3048a] [^0120185e] [^38227df9].

> But wait, what if the patient is actively experiencing AKI rather than stable CKD. I should confirm that no major guideline endorses colchicine to treat or prevent AKI; indeed, KDIGO AKI guidance emphasizes supportive care, avoidance of nephrotoxins, and drug dose adjustment rather than any specific pharmacologic therapy for AKI, and there is no endorsement of colchicine for AKI prevention or treatment, which means use during active AKI should be minimized unless the indication is compelling and alternatives are inadequate [^a16b9cb9] [^d701cfc9].

> Let me synthesize the balance of evidence. Colchicine is not a classic direct nephrotoxin, but it can precipitate renal failure via systemic toxicity in overdose or accumulation, and rare AKI cases have been reported even at therapeutic doses in vulnerable patients; mechanistic anti-inflammatory effects may be theoretically beneficial in select AKI phenotypes, yet clinical proof is lacking and current data do not support routine use to treat or prevent AKI [^8b37aaa7] [^ab33fcb5] [^67c70739].

> I should double-check practical prescribing guardrails. In patients with eGFR above 60, standard low-dose regimens are generally acceptable with attention to interactions; in eGFR 30–59, reduce dose and frequency; in eGFR below 30 or active AKI, avoid if possible or use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with close monitoring; always screen for strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and P-gp inhibitors that raise colchicine levels, and monitor for GI intolerance, myopathy, cytopenias, and rising creatinine if therapy is continued during renal dysfunction [^ad5ebc0e] [^1eb3048a] [^38227df9].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is precise. Colchicine does not reliably cause AKI in patients with normal renal function when dosed appropriately, but it can contribute to renal failure in the setting of overdose, drug interactions, or significant renal impairment; rare AKI cases have been reported even with therapeutic dosing, and current evidence does not support using colchicine to treat or prevent AKI, so use the lowest effective dose, adjust for kidney function, avoid high-risk combinations, and monitor closely when renal function is unstable [^67c70739] [^8b37aaa7] [^ad5ebc0e] [^38227df9].

Colchicine is **not directly nephrotoxic** and does not typically cause AKI in patients with normal renal function [^notfound]. However, in patients with **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or those on dialysis**, colchicine clearance is reduced and toxicity risk rises, so dose reduction or avoidance is recommended [^1eb3048a] [^38227df9]. AKI has been reported in overdose or with interacting drugs (e.g. CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors), and rare cases occurred in large trials, but routine monitoring of renal function is advised in high-risk patients [^67c70739] [^8b37aaa7]. For AKI prevention, prioritize hydration, avoid nephrotoxins, and adjust colchicine dosing to renal function [^a16b9cb9] [^ad5ebc0e].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and renal clearance

- **Normal renal function**: colchicine is partially cleared by the kidneys (~20%), with hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion accounting for the rest [^notfound].

- **Reduced renal function**: in eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², renal clearance drops by ~44–65%, increasing exposure and toxicity risk [^1eb3048a].

- **Dialysis**: colchicine is not dialyzable, so dose adjustment is essential in renal failure [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence linking colchicine to AKI

- **Direct nephrotoxicity**: colchicine is not considered directly nephrotoxic; AKI is rare and usually secondary to systemic toxicity (e.g. rhabdomyolysis, sepsis, or multi-organ failure) [^notfound].

- **Clinical trials**: large RCTs (e.g. RECOVERY) reported rare AKI cases with colchicine, but causality is unclear and often confounded by concurrent illness or drugs [^67c70739].

- **Case reports**: AKI has been documented in overdose or with interacting drugs (e.g. clarithromycin, cyclosporine) that increase colchicine levels [^0f7ba999].

---

## Risk factors for colchicine-induced AKI

| **Risk factor** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|-|
| eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² | Reduced clearance, drug accumulation | Dose reduction or avoidance |
| Dialysis | Non-dialyzable drug accumulation | Dose adjustment required |
| CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, cyclosporine) | Increased colchicine levels | Avoid or use minimal dose |
| Overdose | Systemic toxicity, rhabdomyolysis | AKI risk increases with dose |
| Advanced age, comorbidities | Increased susceptibility | Use caution, monitor closely |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **KDIGO 2024**: for acute gout in CKD, prefer low-dose colchicine or glucocorticoids over NSAIDs; adjust dose if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^ad5ebc0e] [^ec5628dd].

- **Transplant guidance**: avoid prolonged use if eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²; limit to ≤ 0.6 mg/day if eGFR > 10 mL/min/1.73 m² and not on dialysis [^0120185e].

- **Cardiology guidance**: avoid use if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² due to toxicity risk [^38227df9].

---

## Preventive strategies and monitoring

- **Baseline assessment**: check eGFR and review interacting drugs before starting colchicine [^ad5ebc0e].

- **Dose adjustment**: reduce dose or avoid in eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or dialysis [^1eb3048a].

- **Monitoring**: recheck renal function within 48–72 hours of initiation or dose change, especially in high-risk patients [^notfound].

- **Hydration**: maintain adequate volume status to reduce AKI risk [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: avoid strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors when possible [^notfound].

---

## Management of colchicine-associated AKI

- **Immediate actions**: stop colchicine, treat underlying causes (e.g. rhabdomyolysis, sepsis), and provide supportive care [^a16b9cb9].

- **Dialysis**: colchicine is not dialyzable; supportive measures are the mainstay [^notfound].

- **Recovery**: most cases resolve with supportive care, but recovery may be delayed in severe toxicity [^notfound].

---

Colchicine is **not directly nephrotoxic**, but AKI risk rises with renal impairment, interacting drugs, or overdose. Use dose adjustment and monitoring in high-risk patients, and prioritize supportive care if AKI occurs.

Discussion

SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect multiple organs beyond the lungs, such as kidneys. Early prediction of kidney function trajectory in patients with COVID-19-associated AKI plays a crucial role in protecting morbidity and mortality rates. We sought to identify whether using Colchicine, in addition to standard care, was associated with short and long-term improved kidney function. This current study was the first to show Colchicine treatment had been associated with improved estimated glomerular filtration in COVID-19-infected patients.

An increased acute phase CRP levels and reduction in lymphocytes have been reported to reflect severe inflammation and the cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19. We observed that subjects in the Col (+) group showed an increased level of CRP compared to the Col (-) group within a few days of the following admission. Similarly, the maximum level of CRP was also significantly higher in the Col (+) group than in the Col (-) group. We observed that the ratio of patients required to use a reservoir O 2 mask in the Col (+) group was higher than that of the Col (-) group (Table 2). During this period of the epidemic, similar to other clinicians who used a low-dose Colchicine to treat cytokine storms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as an adjunct to different therapeutic agents.

In contrast to SARS, seen in 2003, AKI has been more frequently observed in COVID-19. Assessing renal function accurately and promptly is challenging and critically important to reduce morbidity and mortality. Renal problems have been considered one of the big problems in COVID-19 infection following discharge. AKI is relatively common following COVID-19 infection. AKI is most often observed in the 3 rt phase of the disease, even though it could occur at any stage. Management of AKI in COVID-19-infected patients would be a similar fashion to the other AKIs. It has been reported that a high incidence of AKI (28.4%) was associated with increased organ failure and high mortality in hospitalized COVID-19-infected patients. Another study by Fisher et al. compared the incidence of acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients with and without COVID-19 and showed an increased incidence of AKI in patients with COVID-19. A meta-analysis also reported that AKI was observed in 28–34% of inpatients and 46–77% of patients who were in intensive care units.

### Improved kidney function is associated with colchicine treatment in COVID-19 patients [^6baeab1d]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) has been a major cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been seen in COVID-19-infected subjects, and it has frequently resulted in an abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate. Colchicine, an immunomodulatory drug, was used in several studies in the early stages of the pandemic. Colchicine has been shown to prevent the development of renal failure in patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). It has also been reported to reduce fibrosis, which plays a role in chronic kidney disease. We, therefore, aimed to investigate whether using Colchicine, in addition to standard care, was associated with better renal function in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study comprised 118 out of 605 hospitalized COVID-19 subjects. Some of the subjects (n = 50) received oral Colchicine plus standard care, called the Col (+) group. The others (n = 68) received only the standard care, called the Col (-) group. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and other laboratory findings, including lymphocytes, D-dimer, and CRP, were analyzed.

Results

The D-dimer and serum creatine levels were significantly reduced in both groups. The number of lymphocytes showed a significant increase in both groups at discharge. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher in the Col (+) group than in the Col (-) group at admission. The reduction of SCr was considerably higher in the Col (+) group than in the Col (-) group. Similarly, the improvement of eGFR was higher in the Col (+) group than in the Col (-) group at discharge and 6–12 mounts follow-up.

Conclusion

Our findings indicated the use of Colchicine plus standard care was associated with improved renal function in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 infection.

### Improved kidney function is associated with colchicine treatment in COVID-19 patients [^16ef62f0]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 has a characteristic of high transmission and diverse clinical symptoms. The prognosis of the disease might be mild, moderate, severe, or critical. SARS-CoV-2-induced disease progression is presented in three stages: an early infection phase, infiltrating host cells; the pulmonary phase, lung tissue injury; and systemic hyperinflammation, called a cytokine storm. Cytokine storm is the acute overproduction and uncontrolled release of proinflammatory markers locally and systematically. Furthermore, the induction of IL-1β recruits large numbers of leukocytes from the marrow, which in turn undergo more cytokine production, including CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6. IL-1β and IL-6 are involved in priming neutrophils for activation by chemoattractant, resulting in neutrophil diapedesis and infiltration into the COVID-19-infected organs. Additionally, neutrophils are involved in platelet activation by releasing the serine protease neutrophils elastase, the most potent activator of platelets. Activated other leukocytes also contributed more platelet activation to exacerbate thrombosis.

Even though COVID-19 infection mostly has deteriorated pulmonary health, COVID-19 compromised the tubular structure of kidneys. Moreover, an abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and elevated level of proteinuria have been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with COVID-19 has been reported in 28% of hospitalized patients in Europe and the United States. Importantly, it has been shown that more than 45% of patients with AKI who required ICU care and 1 in 5 patients admitted to the ICU received kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Therefore, addressing or treating AKI would reduce the risk of KRT in patients with COVID-19. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathobiology of kidney damage in the COVID-19 infection, including severe proximal tubular injury, peritubular erythrocyte aggregation, glomerular fibrin thrombi, and/or collapsing glomerulopathy. COVID‐19 infection compromised kidney function through the immune system and cytokine storm by inducing sepsis, shock, hypoxia, or rhabdomyolysis.

### Pyroptosis in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury: mechanisms and therapeutic perspectives [^ab33fcb5]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic perspectives

Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) presents a daunting clinical challenge, marked by high rates of mortality and morbidity. At the heart of this crisis lies pyroptosis, a pro-inflammatory form of programmed cell death that significantly contributes to the development of S-AKI. Given its crucial role, targeting the key components of the pyroptosis pathway emerges as a promising strategy to alleviate kidney damage and enhance patient outcomes in the context of sepsis. This section will explore various therapeutic approaches, including the inhibition of inflammasomes, caspases, and Gasdermin D, along with anti-inflammatory therapies, antioxidant strategies, and innovative new treatments.

Inhibition of inflammasomes

The NLRP3 inflammasome is one of the most well-characterized inflammasomes and is closely associated with pyroptosis. Excessive activation of NLRP3 in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) is implicated in the pathophysiology of sepsis and AKI. Thus, inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome represents a potential therapeutic approach for S-AKI. One promising small molecule inhibitor is MCC950, which specifically targets NLRP3 activation. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that MCC950 effectively suppresses the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, reducing inflammation and kidney damage in experimental models of AKIly, colchicine, a drug traditionally used to treat gout, has been shown to inhibit NLRP3 and is currently being investigated for its anti-inflammatory properties in various conditions, including sepsis. By the NLRP3 inflammasome, these inhibitors could potentially mitigate pyroptosis, thereby reducing renal injury in sepsis patients. However, further clinical trials are necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these agents in S-AKI.

### Drug-induced acute kidney injury [^18b31ac3]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Medications are a common cause of AKI, especially for patients admitted to hospital wards and the intensive care unit. Although drug-related kidney injury occurs through different mechanisms, this review will focus on three specific types of tubulointerstitial injury. Direct acute tubular injury develops from several medications, which are toxic to various cellular functions. Their excretory pathways through the proximal tubules contribute further to AKI. Drug-induced AKI may also develop through induction of inflammation within the tubulointerstitium. Medications can elicit a T cell-mediated immune response that promotes the development of acute interstitial nephritis leading to AKI. Although less common, a third pathway to kidney injury results from the insolubility of drugs in the urine leading to their precipitation as crystals within distal tubular lumens, causing a crystalline-related AKI. Intratubular obstruction, direct tubular injury, and localized inflammation lead to AKI. Clinicians should be familiar with the pathogenesis and clinical-pathologic manifestations of these forms of kidney injury. Prevention and treatment of AKI relies on understanding the pathogenesis and judiciously using these agents in settings where AKI risk is high.

### New drugs for acute kidney injury [^d3208598]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Take-home message

AKI represents a major burden for both the patient and society, but a dedicated treatment is lacking so far, likely related to its multifactorial nature and our current inability to identify AKI-phenotypes. Nevertheless, with the recent advances in the understanding of its pathogenesis and progress in trial design, a spectrum of targeted therapeutic interventions is emerging that have potential to impact the prognosis of patients with AKI.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^ec5628dd]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — acute gout management in chronic kidney disease (CKD): For symptomatic treatment of acute gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral glucocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Administration early after symptom onset is encouraged. For colchicine, the US Food and Drug Administration–approved dosing is 1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing anti-inflammatory therapy until the flare has resolved; dose adjustment should be considered for CKD G5. NSAIDs can cause toxicity in CKD and need to be used cautiously, and short courses of oral glucocorticoids such as 30 mg prednisone orally for 3–5 days could be used as an alternative.

Figure 3
Effect of allocation to colchicine on 28-day mortality by baseline characteristics

Ethnicity, days since onset, and use of corticosteroids subgroups exclude those with missing data, but these patients are included in the overall summary.

The median time to discharge from hospital alive was 10 days (IQR 5 to > 28) in both groups, and there was no significant difference in the probability of being discharged alive within 28 days between the two groups (3901 [70%] patients in the colchicine group and 4032 (70%) usual care group; rate ratio 0.98 [95% CI 0.94 to 1.03]; p = 0.44; table 2). Of the patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, the number of patients progressing to the prespecified composite secondary outcome of invasive mechanical ventilation or death was similar in both groups (1344 [25%] in the colchicine group vs 1343 [25%] patients in the usual care group; risk ratio 1.02 [95% CI 0.96 to 1.09]; p = 0.47). Similar results were seen in all prespecified subgroups of patients (appendix pp 50–51).

Table 2
Effect of allocation to colchicine on key study outcomes

We found no significant differences in the prespecified subsidiary clinical outcomes of cause-specific mortality (appendix p 46), use of ventilation, successful cessation of invasive mechanical ventilation, or need for haemodialysis or haemofiltration (table 2). The incidence of new cardiac arrhythmias, bleeding events, and thrombotic events was also similar in the two groups (appendix p 47). There were two reports of a serious adverse reaction believed related to colchicine: one patient had severe acute kidney injury and one had rhabdomyolysis.

### Drug-induced acute kidney injury in the critically ill adult: recognition and prevention strategies [^f24858bf]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is common in critically ill patients, with an incidence of 20% to 30%. It has been associated with increased mortality, hospital length of stay, and total cost. A number of strategies may be beneficial in identifying at-risk patients. In addition, using preventive measures and avoiding nephrotoxic medications are paramount in reducing the overall incidence. Although multifactorial, drug-induced acute kidney injury may account for up to 25% of all cases of acute kidney injury in this population. This review focuses on the mechanisms of drug-induced acute kidney injury in critically ill adults and offers preventive strategies when appropriate.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) definition — small changes in serum creatinine: The AKIN definition was based on evidence that minor fluctuations in serum creatinine concentration were strongly associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized individuals, with the association remaining, albeit attenuated, after multivariate adjustment. Subsequent studies have identified small changes in serum creatinine to be prognostically important, and even a 0.1-mg/dL increase appears to be associated with increased risk compared to no change. However, whether these small changes reflect clinically meaningful kidney function fluctuations or are merely markers of underlying conditions remains unresolved, and an implicit assumption is that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in an individual is constant over time and not subject to physiologic fluctuation.

### Acute kidney injury [^3aed8928]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute kidney injury:

- **Definition**: AKI is a sudden decrease in kidney function resulting from structural or functional injury that is characterized by decreased GFR, increased serum creatinine, and oliguria.
- **Pathophysiology**: AKI has multiple possible causes, including renal hypoperfusion, intrinsic renal dysfunction (glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis), or obstruction to the emptying of the kidneys (post-renal AKI).
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of AKI in the US is estimated at 179–317 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Hypoperfusion of the kidneys with resultant ischemic injury represents the most important group of etiologies, mediating AKI through cellular injury caused by a mismatch between oxygen and nutrient delivery to the nephrons.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with AKI do not recover renal function by hospital discharge. In this group of patients, AKI is associated with 1-year age-adjusted mortality of approximately 60%, compared to approximately 10% in patients who recovered renal function within 7 days.

Preventing and mitigating drug-associated AKI

A number of strategies have emerged for preventing or mitigating drug-associated kidney injury or dysfunction. The most important of these is drug stewardship, with a primary goal of balancing the changing risks and benefits of drug utilization and dosing in AKI/AKD (Table 4). Specifically, it is critical to balance the risk of toxicity caused by excessive doses or drug/metabolite accumulation in AKI/AKD versus the risk of therapeutic failure caused by either overly conservative drug avoidance or under-dosing, or the risk of failing to adapt to renal recovery or use of renal replacement therapy (RRT).

Recent literature has demonstrated that certain drug combinations and overall drug burden are associated with AKI. These include the "triple whammy" of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, diuretics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and an increased AKI risk when patients receive 3 or more nephrotoxic drugs daily. A single center has utilized electronic health records to identify children exposed to 3 or more nephrotoxic drugs, and the approach has led to a sustained decrease in incidence of AKI.

Preventing and managing contrast-associated AKI

The only nephrotoxic agent addressed in any detail by the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline was iodinated radiocontrast media. The 2012 guideline included several recommendations to prevent contrast-induced AKI, including use of volume expansion with sodium bicarbonate solutions and oral N-acetylcysteine. Results of the Prevention of Serious Adverse Events Following Angiography (PRESERVE) and POSEIDON trials demonstrated lack of efficacy of these interventions (and instead found improvement using a personalized approach targeting cardiac filling pressures in POSEIDON). Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that the risks associated with i.v. contrast are far fewer with modern agents and practice patterns, and significant kidney injury is unusual in patients with normal or mildly reduced baseline kidney function. I.v. contrast should not be withheld owing to concern for AKI in life-threatening conditions in which the information gained from the contrast study could have important therapeutic implications.

### Colchicine use and the risk of CKD progression: a multicentre nested case-control study [^8305ab46]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Despite the preclinical evidence on protective effects of colchicine against kidney fibrosis, whether colchicine could delay the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in humans remains unknown. This study examined the association between long-term colchicine use and risk of adverse kidney outcome in patients with CKD who were treated for hyperuricaemia or chronic gout.

Methods

We conducted a multicentre, nested, case-control study in three Korean hospitals. Patients were aged ≥ 19years; had CKD G3-G4; and used drugs including colchicine, allopurinol and febuxostat for hyperuricaemia or chronic gout during the period from April 2000 to October 2020. Patients with CKD progression, which was defined as ≥ 40% decrease from the baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate or the onset of kidney failure with replacement therapy, were matched to controls based on follow-up time, age and sex.

Results

Overall, 3085 patients with CKD progression were matched to 11715 control patients. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis showed that patients with ≥ 90 cumulative daily colchicine doses were associated with a lower risk of CKD progression [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.96] than non-users. In the sensitivity analysis with matched CKD stages, the AOR was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.97). This association was more pronounced in patients without diabetes or hypertension, and in patients with CKD G3.

Conclusion

Colchicine use is associated with a lower risk of adverse kidney outcomes in CKD patients with hyperuricaemia, or chronic gout.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) recommendations — rating framework and implications are defined as follows: "Within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1, Level 2, or Not Graded, and the quality of the supporting evidence is shown as A, B, C, or D". Level 1 ("We recommend") implies for patients that "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and for policy that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 ("We suggest") implies for patients that "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", for clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and for policy that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". The additional category "Not Graded" "was used, typically, to provide guidance based on common sense or where the topic does not allow adequate application of evidence", and "are generally written as simple declarative statements, but are not meant to be interpreted as being stronger recommendations than Level 1 or 2 recommendations". Evidence quality meanings are: A (High) — "We are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect". B (Moderate) — "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different". C (Low) — "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect". D (Very low) — "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often will be far from the truth".

Living kidney donation — serum uric acid, hyperuricemia, and gout risk in donors are characterized by a 25% to 40% reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) after donation with associated higher serum uric acid; at 6 months after nephrectomy, donors had 8.2% higher serum uric acid with mean values of 5.3 ± 1.1 mg/dL vs 4.9 ± 1.2 mg/dL (P < 0.001), persisting over 36 months, and another study found 20% higher concentrations at a mean of 7 years after nephrectomy compared with predonation. In Ontario, 1988 donors followed for a median of 8.8 years (maximum, 20.8 years) were more likely to be diagnosed with gout than matched nondonors, with an absolute risk of 3.5 vs 2.1 events per 1000 person-years; at 8 years, cumulative incidence was 1.4% higher in donors (3.4% vs 2.0%), and risk increased with older age and was nearly 3-times higher in men; compared with matched nondonors without gout, donors with gout had more frequent diagnoses of acute kidney injury, CKD, and other kidney disorders. For management, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should probably be used cautiously in patients with decreased kidney function including living kidney donors, and the treatment of choice for acute gout is colchicine, however the dose of colchicine should be reduced in patients with decreased kidney function.

### Association between early recovery of kidney function after acute kidney injury and long-term clinical outcomes [^98e5d57b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the trajectory of kidney function within 72 hours after acute kidney injury associated with 5-year clinical outcomes, such as chronic kidney disease, dialysis, and death?

Findings

Among 1538 participants in this prospective multicenter cohort study, the early recovery pattern after acute kidney injury was associated with long-term outcomes. In adjusted analyses, patients with a nonresolving recovery pattern after acute kidney injury had a 51% greater risk for the composite kidney-specific clinical outcome compared with patients with a resolving acute kidney injury recovery pattern, independent of traditional criteria to risk stratify patients with acute kidney injury.

Meaning

This study's finding suggest that the acute recovery pattern after development of acute kidney injury should be considered in evaluating the risk of long-term clinical outcomes.

### An overview of drug-induced acute kidney injury [^63528737]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The complex nature of critical illness often necessitates the use of multiple therapeutic agents, many of which may individually or in combination have the potential to cause renal injury. The use of nephrotoxic drugs has been implicated as a causative factor in up to 25% of all cases of severe acute renal failure in critically ill patients. Acute tubular necrosis is the most common form of renal injury from nephrotoxin exposure, although other types of renal failure may be seen. Given that this is a preventable cause of a potentially devastating complication, a comprehensive strategy should be used to avoid nephrotoxicity in critically ill patients including: accurate estimation of pre-existing renal function using serum creatinine-based glomerular filtration rates, avoidance of nephrotoxins if possible, ongoing monitoring of renal function, and immediate discontinuation of suspected nephrotoxins in the event of renal dysfunction.

### Drug-associated renal dysfunction and injury [^ffb38cfb]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2006). Medium credibility.

Renal dysfunction and injury secondary to medications are common, and can present as subtle injury and/or overt renal failure. Some drugs perturb renal perfusion and induce loss of filtration capacity. Others directly injure vascular, tubular, glomerular and interstitial cells, such that specific loss of renal function leads to clinical findings, including microangiopathy, Fanconi syndrome, acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, obstruction, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, electrolyte abnormalities and chronic renal failure. Understanding the mechanisms involved, and recognizing the clinical presentations of renal dysfunction arising from use of commonly prescribed medications, are important if injury is to be detected early and prevented. This article reviews the clinical features and basic processes underlying renal injury related to the use of common drugs.

Conclusion

The finding that critically unwell patients with AKI who survive the index case continue to have increased morbidity and mortality long-term remains unexplained, but is significant. Future research should focus on these patients with targeted therapies assessed by measure of long-term outcomes.

A consensus agreement for defining renal recovery is warranted if we are to assess and extrapolate the efficacy of novel therapies. Currently available treatment strategies have the potential to improve patient outcome and provide considerable economic health savings provided they are adopted early in the course of the patient's illness with appropriate specialist follow-up to be recommended.

### Colchicine: an impressive effect on posttransplant capillary leak syndrome and renal failure [^220dbe02]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Capillary leak syndrome is a critical condition occasionally occurring posttransplant and is characterized by acute endothelial hyperpermeability leading to systemic protein-rich fluid extravasation and consequent hypovolemia, hypoperfusion, and acute kidney injury. Treatment is merely supportive and is based on osmotic drugs, diuretics, continuous renal replacement therapy, and surgical drainage. However, removal of the underlying inflammatory cause is mandatory to achieve stable resolution. Herein, we report the first successful treatment with colchicine in 2 life-threatening pediatric cases of capillary leak syndrome with renal failure occurring after transplant (heart and bone marrow) and unresponsive to any other line of therapy. Both cases were only palliated by supportive therapy and revealed an impressively rapid response to colchicine both in terms of diuresis and clinical condition recovery, allowing for the cessation of renal replacement therapy in a few hours. In both patients, colchicine was temporarily discontinued for transient leukopenia (attributed to an additive effect with mycophenolate mofetil), resulting in extravasation, and renal failure recurrence was restored only after colchicine reintroduction. Although the association of colchicine with an immunosuppressive drug was formerly contraindicated, no other adverse events were noted when using a minimized dose. Both patients are now maintaining a good renal function without recurrence of extravasation after 6 months of follow-up. In conclusion, this strikingly positive experience forces physicians to consider this old and cost-effective drug as a new, powerful rescue tool in such critical cases.

### The growth of acute kidney injury: a rising tide or just closer attention to detail? [^05f878a0]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

In an attempt to quantify the potential impact of some of the above-mentioned factors, Hsu et al. used regression modeling to potentially explain the continued growth of dialysis-requiring AKI. Adjusting for demographics, as well as hospitalizations involving sepsis, mechanical ventilation, congestive heart failure, and cardiac catheterization, the authors found that increases in these types of hospitalizations accounted for only 30% of the observed growth. Even considering potential shifts in inpatient case-mix to more complicated procedures such as major surgery, one would potentially expect these to be also captured by mechanical ventilation records, suggesting the importance of other contributors.

One increasingly recognized contributor includes patients with cancer. Improvements in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of malignancy have reduced cancer-related mortality by 20% over the past two decades. As patients with malignancy largely include the elderly with high comorbidity burden, this improved survival may also be increasing the number of survivors at risk for developing AKI. In addition, these welcome advances also carry inherent risks that can contribute to AKI. Recent data using creatinine-based definitions suggest that the incidence of AKI among hospitalized patients with cancer may be as high as 12%. The etiology of AKI varies widely in this population, but includes traditional risk factors such as volume depletion from vomiting and diarrhea, sepsis from immunosuppression, attendant antibiotic use (prophylaxis and treatment), and serial imaging. In addition, disease-associated factors including renal cancers, cast nephropathy, tumor lysis syndrome, hypercalcemia and hyperuricemia, glomerular disease, and obstruction are also important contributors. Finally, the spectrum of potentially nephrotoxic chemotherapies and myeloablative protocols have grown drastically, including, but not limited to, platinum-based therapies, methotrexate, calcineurin inhibitors, gemcitabine, cytokine therapies (for example, interleukin-2), and anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agents, and are detailed elsewhere. Enhancing our understanding of these adverse sequelae and their management (that is, 'Onco-nephrology') has been recently recognized by the American Society of Nephrology as a growing area of need.

Evidence review focused on four major topic areas — definition and classification, prevention, pharmacologic treatment, and renal replacement therapy (RRT) — with populations of interest at risk for AKI (including after intravascular contrast-media exposure, aminoglycosides, amphotericin) and those with or at risk for AKI (sepsis, trauma, critical care, or cardiothoracic surgery); studies on AKI from rhabdomyolysis, specific infections, and poisoning or drug overdose were excluded, and overall, 18 385 citations were screened. Outcomes were limited to those important for decision making, including development of AKI, need for or dependence on RRT, and all-cause mortality, with a "crucial" outcome selected as that weighing most heavily in assessing overall quality of evidence. Grading used the GRADE system with strength rated as level 1 meaning "strong" or level 2 meaning "weak" or discretionary, and each statement assigned evidence quality A (high), B (moderate), C (low), or D (very low); on topics not amenable to systematic review, the Work Group could issue statements that are not graded and felt these should not be viewed as weaker than graded recommendations.

Research

Research in the epidemiology of DIKD has been limited. The lack of consensus definitions has led to variability in the incidence of DIKD. Acute kidney injury is multifactorial and risk factors for AKI have been identified for different populations. Risk factors for DIKD vary by drug; however, it is very likely that we can determine common risk factors that identify vulnerable populations, such as older age or history of CKD. Establishing causality is challenging in DIKD; it requires attribution of risk to not only the suspect drug but also the relative contribution from each concurrent risk factor. Newly identified DIKD is often published as case reports or case series. In such reports, the attribution of risk from concurrent risk factors is lacking. Clinical trials and FDA surveillance programs provide some information, but post-marketing surveillance is voluntary and requires clinicians to identify the association of an AKI event with a drug. As accepted definitions of AKI are implemented in research and AKI awareness increases, the identification and outcomes of DIKD will be better characterized. The use of EMRs and decision support tools will facilitate electronic surveillance of DIKD, identifying the event and risk factors and directing clinicians on treatment options. However, more research is required in the area of causality assessment, risk score calculation and adjudication of cases. Electronic surveillance alone provides an initial step in case identification, however, without causality assessment, these tools lack validity and will lose their effectiveness in clinical practice.

Often, histologic confirmation of drug toxicity is lacking. The decision to biopsy a patient is a risk/benefit assessment and central is the question of whether a biopsy will change patient management? The majority of clinicians opt to discontinue a suspect drug rather than biopsy. However, given the lack of validated tools for causality assessment, we feel that biopsy information from cases series of drug toxicity will contribute significantly to this area of research. As our body of knowledge increases; risk score calculators, causality assessment tools coupled with information on outcomes of DIKD can lead to the development of predictive analytics which may identify individuals at risk of nephrotoxicity from a drug. Population based studies provide a large sample and aid in the identification of rare or previously unrecognized events such as antipsychotic associated AKI or drug interactions that lead to drug toxicity and AKI.

Purpose Of Review

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious problem. Understanding an individual patient's risk profile may offer opportunities for prevention or early intervention. The aim of this review is to describe novel nontraditional risk factors.

Recent Findings

The risk of AKI is determined by patient factors and nephrotoxic exposures. Hyperuricaemia, obesity, hypoalbuminaemia and certain genetic polymorphism have been found to be associated with an increased susceptibility to AKI, especially in surgical patients. However, there is no convincing evidence that albumin replacement or uric acid lowering ameliorates the risk. Genetic predisposition contributes to AKI in general and also drug-nephrotoxicity. The exact relationship between obesity and AKI has not been fully understood. Patients exposed to starches, chloride-rich fluids or mechanical ventilation have an increased risk of AKI. Starches in particular should be avoided in high-risk patients. Although chloride-rich fluids are associated with AKI based on observational studies, direct proof of harm is lacking.

Summary

Novel risk factors for AKI have been identified but more work is necessary to investigate the nature of the association. There is no evidence that correction of hyperuricaemia or hypoalbuminaemia is beneficial but high-risk exposures should be avoided in patients at risk of AKI.

### Diagnostic work-up and specific causes of acute kidney injury [^d190984b]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and associated with grim short- and long-term outcome. Although in the vast majority of cases AKI is multifactorial, with sepsis, shock and nephrotoxicity accounting for most episodes, specific causes of AKI are not uncommon. Despite remaining uncertainties regarding their prevalence in the ICU, prompt recognition of specific aetiologies of AKI is likely to ensure timely management, limit worsening of renal dysfunction, and ultimately limit renal and systemic consequences of AKI. The ability to recognize conditions that may be associated with specific aetiologies and the appropriate use of clinical imaging, biological and immunological tests, along with optimal assessment of the need for renal biopsies, should be part of routine ICU care. In this review, we summarize uncertainties, current knowledge and recent advances regarding specific types of AKI. We describe the most common specific causes as well as rare aetiologies requiring urgent management, and outline available tools that may be used during the diagnostic work-up along with their limitations.

Research recommendations include that RCTs with the rate of AKI as a primary or secondary end-point should be conducted to test whether liposomal amphotericin B is less nephrotoxic than amphotericin B lipid complex or amphotericin B colloidal dispersion; innovative formulation strategies in microvesicles, nanoparticles, or micelles should be undertaken to limit nephrotoxicity; and carefully selected combinations of antifungal therapies may limit toxicity and reduce costs and should be compared with standard dosing regimens. Additional recommendations state that markers of early nephrotoxicity and mechanisms to avoid nephrotoxicity need to be studied, and that a group monitored with novel AKI biomarkers should be compared to conventional monitoring to determine if early biomarkers add to standard clinical care in preventing drug-induced AKI.

CI-AKI risk stratification thresholds and use of eGFR: Pre-existing renal functional impairment is the most important risk factor above all other risk factors for developing CI-AKI and screening for both acute and chronic kidney disease is highly recommended, and both the KDOQI guideline and KDIGO recommended that, in stable patients, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be used. A CI-AKI Consensus Working Panel reported that the risk of CI-AKI becomes clinically important when the baseline serum creatinine (SCr) concentration is ≥ 1.3 mg/dl (≥ 115 μmol/l) in men and ≥ 1.0 mg/dl (≥ 88.4 μmol/l) in women, equivalent to an eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2; however, the incidence of "true" AKI became significant only from a baseline SCr concentration of > 1.8 mg/dl (> 159 μmol/l) onward. The CI-AKI Consensus Working Panel recommended that precautions to reduce the risk should be implemented in patients with a baseline eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and in light of more recent information, this threshold could probably be lowered to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2.

AKI is a critical concern in nephrology, inflicting considerable harm on both physical and mental health, while its elevated incidence and fatality rates place a tremendous strain on the healthcare system. The clinical diagnosis of AKI relies on changes in serum creatinine levels and urine output, lacking definitive methodologies. It is imperative to investigate the molecular pathways to create highly specific and readily observable diagnostic tools and to develop therapeutic agents targeting these mechanisms.

### Concurrent use of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of acute kidney injury: nested case-control study [^04c83df1]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first large population based study of patients (almost 500 000) using antihypertensive drugs to have investigated the association between the use of different combinations of antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers) with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the risk of acute kidney injury. Our results indicate that the use of a double therapy combination is not associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury, although the risk was modified by the duration of use of a diuretic-NSAID combination. On the other hand, the use of a triple therapy combination was associated with an overall 31% higher risk, which is driven by a nearly twofold increased risk in the first 30 days of use. Overall, these results remained consistent after several sensitivity analyses.

Comparisons with previous studies

The known risks associated with these double and triple therapy combinations are currently based on pharmacovigilance case series and a few epidemiological studies. These studies had several methodological shortcomings. The only study that specifically investigated the risk of acute kidney injury due to these double or triple therapy combinations was probably subject to confounding by indication and severity (heart failure can itself lead to acute kidney injury). On the other hand, in the others studies, the primary focus was on the association between NSAIDs and acute kidney injury, and interaction with diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and NSAIDs was a secondary outcome. These studies were not adequately powered to investigate the association between double and triple therapy combinations and the risk of acute kidney injury.

In one cross sectional study of 301 patients, the use of two or more drugs among diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers with NSAIDs was associated with an increased risk of renal impairment, compared with non-use. However, the authors adopted mean values of blood creatinine concentrations as the study outcome, without using a specific cut-off (such as creatinine concentration > 0.20 mmol/L) to define acute kidney injury. Thus, their outcome was not specific to identify acute kidney injury and also included subclinical renal impairments. Moreover, they were unable to adjust for potential confounders such as heart failure. The increased risk observed may thus have been partly affected by confounding by indication and severity.

### Drug use and nephrotoxicity in the intensive care unit [^4bba5b94]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Patients cared for in the intensive care unit (ICU) undergo multiple interventions to treat serious medical conditions. In addition to the acute illness being treated, underlying chronic conditions require ongoing drug therapy. As a result, these patients are exposed to numerous pharmaceutical agents, many of which have narrow therapeutic windows and toxic potential. Comorbid conditions, altered drug pharmacokinetics, and drug-drug interactions further enhance the risk for both drug overdosing and underdosing and adverse medication effects. Underdosing is complicated by reduced efficacy, whereas overdosing results in various end-organ toxicities. One such complication is acute kidney injury (AKI), a relatively common problem in the ICU, which results from multiple insults. Importantly, potentially nephrotoxic medications contribute significantly to the development of AKI. In view of these issues, it is crucial that clinicians caring for these patients use appropriate drug dosing based on the knowledge of altered pharmacokinetics, vigilant monitoring of drug efficacy and toxicity, recognition of drugs with nephrotoxic potential, and early identification of drug-induced AKI when it develops.

Colchicine for secondary prevention — In clinically stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, colchicine 0.5 mg daily reduced recurrent cardiovascular events, with the composite primary endpoint occurring in 6.8% in the colchicine group compared with 9.6% in the placebo group (P < 0.001), although the study showed a trend toward increased risk of death from noncardiovascular causes. In acute coronary syndrome, the COLCOT trial reported the primary endpoint occurred in 5.5% of patients treated with colchicine compared with 7.1% in the placebo group (P = 0.02), driven primarily by reductions in strokes and urgent hospitalizations for angina leading to coronary revascularization. Trials excluded patients with creatinine clearance of < 50 mL/min and were limited to a duration of just over 2 years; use should be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease (eGFR, < 30 mL/min/m2). Colchicine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and is a substrate for P-glycoprotein, necessitating careful evaluation for drug–drug interactions.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^0120185e]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) — colchicine dosing and safety by eGFR and concomitant CsA/tacrolimus: Colchicine levels may be increased in patients with reduced kidney function and in patients treated with CsA (and presumably tacrolimus), and life-threatening colchicine toxicity has been described in patients with reduced kidney function receiving colchicine 1 mg/day for only 5–8 days, with disabling myoneuropathy reported with long-term colchicine therapy. Therefore, prolonged use of colchicine should be avoided in patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; colchicine can be used at reduced doses for < 1 week in patients with eGFR > 10 mL/min/1.73 m2 not requiring dialysis, and in patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, avoid doses higher than 0.6 mg/day. Intraarticular or short-term systemic steroids have also been used if the above therapies are contraindicated or not tolerated.

### The 6R's of drug induced nephrotoxicity [^8b0b112b]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Recognition

Currently, there is no standard definition of DIKD and incidence of nephrotoxicity varies depending on the definition employed and the causal drug. The most common drugs that cause DIKD include antibiotics, anti-rejection medications, antiviral agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, anti-ulcer agents and chemotherapy.

Most studies have defined nephrotoxicity as 0.5 mg/dL or 50% rise in Scr over 24–72 h time frame and a minimum 24–48 h of drug exposure. However, these definitions pose challenges since a 50% increase in Scr may not have high specificity for DIKD since the underlying disease being treated as well as other AKI risk factors could be significant to the attribution of risk. In the setting of fluctuating renal function or those patients receiving renal replacement therapies, it is difficult to recognize DIKD. For example, if a critically ill patient develops AKI from sepsis, it may be difficult to recognize whether an antibiotic is causing additional injury to the susceptible kidney. Recognition is also complicated by the fact that the mechanism of kidney injury and time period for onset of injury varies by drug and some drugs cause injury by more than one mechanism. For instance, NSAIDS can result in AKI due to hemodynamic changes or acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), or nephrotic range proteinuria from glomerular injury.

In order to improve the recognition of DIKD in the literature, we convened an expert panel to develop consensus-based definitions. We propose that DIKD presents in one of four phenotypes: AKI, glomerular disorder, tubular disorder, or nephrolithiasis/crystalluria. The clinical presentation of each phenotype is based on primary and secondary criteria. We suggest that at least one primary criterion must be met for all drugs suspected of causing DIKD. For each phenotype definition, the following critical elements from the Bradford-Hill causal criteria must be met:
The drug exposure must be at least 24 h preceding the event.
There should be biological plausibility for the causal drug, based on known mechanism of drug effect; metabolism and immunogenicity.
Complete data (including but not limited to co-morbidities, additional nephrotoxic exposures, exposure to contrast agents, surgical procedures, blood pressure, urine output) surrounding the period of drug exposure is required to account for concomitant risks and exposures to other nephrotoxic agents.
The strength of the relationship between the attributable drug and phenotype should be based on drug exposure duration, extent of primary and secondary criteria met and the time course of the injury.

### Improved kidney function is associated with colchicine treatment in COVID-19 patients [^4adf5e1f]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Even though the effect of Colchicine on the treatment of COVID-19 is still controversial, its anti-inflammatory properties, favorable safety profile, and widespread availability have prompted the investigation of Colchicine for the treatment of kidney diseases. In the present study, the improved level of eGFR was higher in the Col (+) group than the Col (-) group in the short and long term (Table 4). Regarding kidney function, it has been reported that 47.7% of the severe patients showed a reduced level of eGFR (60–89 mL/min/1.73 m 2) in two years following COVID-19 infection. Similarly, it was found that 25% of patients had decreased eGFR (< 90 ml/min/1.73 m 2) at six months after hospital discharge of COVID-19-infected patients. As aforementioned, COVID-19 infection can deteriorate kidney function in the long term. We observed a complete renal recovery of 75%, which was relatively higher than in the other studies mentioned above. We also found that 11% and 24% of the patients showed reduced eGFR during the follow-up period in the Col (+) and Col (-) groups, respectively (Table 4). Compared to the studies above, our results suggested that using Colchicine and standard care could reduce the risk of diminished kidney function in patients with COVID-19 in the long term. Possible mechanisms of Colchicine to protect kidney function might include reducing inflammation through blocking inflammasome activation, disrupting tubulin polymerization and/or anti-fibrosis effect.

### Trends in hospitalizations for acute kidney injury-United States, 2000–2014 [^201c246a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury increases the risk of developing or exacerbating underlying chronic kidney disease (gradual loss of kidney function over time). National health (Healthy People 2020;) objectives call for renal evaluation of patients hospitalized for acute kidney injury 6 months after discharge to monitor kidney function and prevent or delay onset of chronic kidney disease. CDC's Chronic Kidney Disease Surveillance System monitors the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and its risk factors (including acute kidney injury) in the U.S. population and tracks progress in its prevention, management, and control.

Improving both patient and provider awareness that diabetes, hypertension, and advancing age are frequently associated with acute kidney injury is important for reversing these trends. Elderly persons have physiologically reduced kidney function and functional reserve with the appearance of global sclerosis, but also more comorbidity than do young adults, all of which heighten older persons' susceptibility to nephrotoxic medicines, dyes used for imaging, and even dehydration, all preventable risks for acute kidney injury. Better recognition of risk factors for acute kidney injury by health care providers might improve the effectiveness of treatment of underlying conditions and prevent or mitigate additional kidney insult to patients, particularly among those hospitalized or in long-term care.

### Relationship between acute kidney injury and mortality in poisoning-a systematic review and metanalysis [^fbcd3bd1]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Three consensus classifications of acute kidney injury have been published. These are RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease published by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative workgroup), AKIN (published by the Acute Kidney Injury Network) and KDIGO (published by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome workgroup). Acute kidney injury has been reported consistently as associated with worsened outcomes. However, toxicant-related acute kidney injury has been excluded from the studies used to validate the classifications of acute kidney injury.

Objective

To study whether poisoned patients who develop acute kidney injury, as defined by consensus definitions/classifications, have higher mortality compared to those who did not.

Methods

Databases were searched from 2004 to 2019 using the following keywords (KDIGO OR "Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes" OR "Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes" OR AKIN OR "AKI network" OR "Acute kidney Injury Network" OR ADQI OR RIFLE OR "Acute dialysis quality initiative") AND (intoxication OR poisoning OR overdose OR ingestion) AND (AKI OR kidney OR renal OR ARF). If data were available, we used a random-effects meta-analysis model and Fisher's exact test to compare mortality in patients according to kidney function definitions (acute kidney injury vs not) and stages (stages vs no acute kidney injury), respectively. If data were available, we assessed the correlation between mortality and renal function (no acute kidney injury, risk/stage 1, injury/stage 2 and failure/stage 3) using the Spearman correlation. If available, we collected the results of statistical analyses in studies that have used acute kidney injury to predict mortality.

Results

Study selection. Thirty-three relevant studies were found, 22/33 retrospective studies (67%) and 11/33 prospective studies (33%). Paraquat was the most frequent toxicant involved (13/33, 39%). We found a disparity between studies regarding the timeframe during which mortality was assessed, the temporality of the renal function considered to predict mortality (initial/worst) and the criteria used to define/grade acute kidney injury across studies. Univariate association between acute kidney injury definitions/stages and mortality. Consensus definitions/staging of acute kidney injury were associated with higher mortality, using univariate analyses, in twenty-eight (RIFLE = 7; AKIN = 12; KDIGO = 9) studies included but not in five (AKIN = 4, KDIGO = 1). When available data were pooled, RIFLE (5 studies), AKIN (16 studies) and KDIGO definitions (8 studies) of acute kidney injury were associated with a higher mortality (Log unadjusted Odds ratios [95%-confidence interval], 2.60 [2.23; 2.97], 2.02 [1.48; 2,52] and 3.22 [2,65; 3.78], respectively). However, we found high heterogeneity (I 2 = 54,7%) and publication bias among studies using AKIN. In ten studies with available data, the correlation between renal function (no acute kidney injury, risk/stage 1, injury/stage 2, failure/stage 3) and mortality was significant in 5 studies (RIFLE = 2; AKIN = 3), but not in five studies (RIFLE = 1; AKIN = 3; KDIGO = 1). Multivariate association between acute kidney injury definitions/stages and mortality. The definitions of acute kidney injury were associated with higher mortality in two studies (RIFLE = 2), but not in four studies (AKIN = 1 and KDIGO = 3. The stages of acute kidney injury (including one or more stages) were associated with higher mortality in four (RIFLE = 1, AKIN = 1 and KDIGO = 2).

Conclusions

All three consensus definitions/classifications were associated independently with increased mortality in poisoning but with disparity between studies reporting acute kidney injury.

### Deaths associated with inappropriate intravenous colchicine administration [^0f7ba999]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Intravenous (IV) colchicine is occasionally prescribed for the treatment of acute gouty arthritis. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently received a report of death in a patient that was associated with inappropriate IV dosing of colchicine. This report prompted further investigation of other deaths associated with IV colchicine use in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) and the medical literature. A total of 20 deaths were identified. Eight patients were females, 11 were males, and the gender was unknown in 1. In all cases, the recommended maximum cumulative dose of 2 to 4 mg during a course of therapy was exceeded. Dose reductions are recommended in patients with renal or hepatic disease and in the elderly. All reported adverse events were associated with colchicine toxicity, including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, acute renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Death occurred within 1 to 40 days after drug administration. Therapeutic guidelines exist for use of IV colchicine and these guidelines should be followed to prevent serious toxicities and death.
