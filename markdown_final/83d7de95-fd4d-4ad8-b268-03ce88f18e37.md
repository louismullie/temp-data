## Question

What is the recommended treatment for gout in the knee?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended treatment for gout in the knee. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and ruling out septic arthritis. Then, I should verify the optimal acute anti-inflammatory management for a large monoarticular flare in the knee. Next, I will consider adjunct non-pharmacologic measures, the indications and timing for initiating urate-lowering therapy, flare prophylaxis, and treat-to-target monitoring. Finally, I will address prosthetic knee scenarios, patient education, and follow-up or referral thresholds, ensuring alignment with major guidelines throughout [^113ZunYn] [^111ZX6nR].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not miss infection; knee monoarthritis can mimic gout but septic arthritis demands a different and urgent pathway, so I should prioritize joint aspiration for synovial fluid crystal analysis, Gram stain, and culture when feasible, especially given the knee's higher pretest probability for alternative etiologies compared with classic first MTP gout, and I should remember that validated clinical criteria and imaging can support the diagnosis when aspiration is not performed or not feasible, though aspiration remains the gold standard when diagnostic uncertainty is significant [^111NWXYW] [^111ZX6nR] [^1152rKQM].

> Wait, let me verify the role of imaging if aspiration is deferred; ultrasound identification of the double contour sign or dual-energy CT evidence of tophus can support a diagnosis without synovial fluid analysis in selected cases, but for the knee this may be less specific than for the first MTP, so I should remain cautious and favor aspiration when clinical stakes are high or features are atypical [^115sXLbA] [^111NWXYW].

> Hold on, I should verify the prosthetic knee scenario separately because crystal arthritis can closely mimic periprosthetic joint infection; in a prosthetic knee, aspiration is mandatory to assess for crystals and infection, and if monosodium urate crystals are present without culture or Gram stain evidence of infection and without component loosening, component retention with medical anti-inflammatory therapy is appropriate, whereas if infection cannot be excluded, management should proceed as suspected infection until proven otherwise, with recognition that chalky white or yellow deposits intraoperatively strongly suggest gout rather than infection [^1148tMm5].

> Next, I should initiate acute anti-inflammatory therapy as early as possible, ideally within 12–24 hours of flare onset, selecting among NSAIDs, low-dose colchicine, or glucocorticoids based on comorbidities and patient factors; for a large monoarticular knee flare, intra-articular glucocorticoid injection is an excellent option that can minimize systemic adverse effects, and when using NSAIDs in appropriate candidates, I should co-prescribe gastroprotection, while remembering that evidence does not show a clear pain advantage of NSAIDs over glucocorticoids and that low-dose colchicine is preferred over high-dose regimens for tolerability [^116D1smR] [^1139UKZq] [^116eZv8m] [^112iwfhS] [^113Cax1z] [^113ZunYn].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost defaulted to NSAIDs as the preferred first-line, but recent guidance emphasizes clinician choice among NSAIDs, colchicine, and steroids rather than a hierarchy; in severe renal impairment I should avoid NSAIDs and colchicine, and consider systemic or intra-articular corticosteroids instead, and if colchicine is chosen I must check for strong P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4 inhibitors to avoid toxicity, while IL-1 blockade can be considered in refractory or contraindicated cases with careful infection screening [^114JoBPf] [^114WSd67] [^112ZXcoP].

> I will now implement adjunctive non-pharmacologic measures while medical therapy takes effect; I need to ensure rest of the affected knee, leg elevation, local cooling with properly protected ice application, and use of a bed cage to keep bedding off the joint to reduce pain and swelling and to facilitate recovery alongside pharmacotherapy [^1167Wetv].

> Let me think about whether to initiate urate-lowering therapy during this encounter; after a first flare without high-risk features I should generally avoid starting long-term ULT, whereas patients with frequent flares, tophi, radiographic damage due to gout, CKD stage 3 or higher, serum urate above 9 mg/dL, or urolithiasis should be offered ULT, and I should acknowledge that some guidelines encourage earlier discussion of ULT even at first presentation while ACP advises against routine initiation after the first flare, so shared decision-making is key when risk is intermediate [^116D1smR] [^112dAtCQ] [^114VoGtr] [^1141dTky] [^1131DPMo] [^112AQChh] [^114GAxcx].

> I should double-check the choice and dosing if starting ULT; allopurinol is preferred first line including in CKD stage 3 or higher, starting low at 100 mg/day or lower in CKD with gradual titration, and even 50 mg/day in advanced CKD per older guidance, with careful monitoring for hypersensitivity and consideration of HLA-B✱5801 screening in high-risk populations, and I can start ULT during an acute flare if anti-inflammatory therapy is in place since this does not appear to prolong the flare in randomized trials, although evidence quality varies and dose titration should still be slow to minimize mobilization flares [^11323pWu] [^114mYfJc] [^113ao6x8] [^11232od9] [^1136WZY2] [^1168EXpt] [^1178sm23] [^116LFPLW].

> Next, I should review flare prophylaxis when initiating or uptitrating ULT; I need to ensure at least 3–6 months of concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis with low-dose colchicine or low-dose NSAIDs when appropriate, or low-dose corticosteroids if neither is suitable, and prolong prophylaxis if flares persist, all while checking renal function, drug interactions, and statin coadministration when using colchicine to mitigate neuromuscular toxicity risk [^113ZunYn] [^114EdBSE] [^111dWSet] [^112D3qBA] [^114o8nJD] [^117QyWfG].

> I will now examine treatment targets and monitoring; I should adopt a treat-to-target approach with serial serum urate measurement and titration to achieve and maintain less than 6 mg/dL for most patients, with a more stringent target of less than 5 mg/dL in those with tophi or severe disease until clinical remission, and I should monitor serum urate every 2–5 weeks during titration and then every 6 months once the target is reached to ensure crystal dissolution and sustained control [^113ZunYn] [^116z9DFQ] [^1161UGP6] [^114N8dyy] [^114Ny1jR] [^112yeJDc] [^116FEjYb] [^115GKEfs].

> Hold on, I should verify we address the prosthetic knee again in management; if aspiration confirms gout without infection in a prosthetic knee, I should treat with anti-inflammatories and retain components, whereas if infection cannot be excluded or if cultures are positive, management should prioritize infection control per arthroplasty protocols, and recognition of chalky tophaceous deposits intraoperatively should prompt polarized light histology to guide retention when infection evidence is absent [^1148tMm5].

> Let me consider patient education and lifestyle now; I need to explain that gout is a chronic crystal deposition disease with an effective strategy to prevent recurrences through sustained urate lowering, emphasize adherence to prophylaxis during ULT initiation, discuss weight loss, limiting alcohol and purine-rich foods, and align expectations with a treat-to-target program that may be supported by nurse- or pharmacist-led titration to optimize outcomes [^1128TALh] [^114Nm3Rq] [^113bRmD5].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and referral thresholds; I will reassess flare frequency, functional recovery, tophus burden, serum urate, and renal function at appropriate intervals, review for drug interactions such as colchicine with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors, and refer to rheumatology when the diagnosis is uncertain, disease is refractory, targets are hard to achieve, adverse events are significant, or comorbidities complicate management, keeping the evaluation thorough with targeted history and examination for tophi and synovitis [^1149vEW6] [^1136Wi1C] [^115GKEfs] [^114WSd67].

> But wait, to wrap up succinctly, I need to ensure the flow is consistent: confirm the diagnosis and exclude infection with aspiration when indicated, treat the acute knee flare promptly with an appropriate anti-inflammatory modality, use adjunctive rest and ice, decide on ULT based on risk and guideline criteria with shared decision-making, provide prophylaxis during ULT initiation, titrate to serum urate targets with regular monitoring, handle prosthetic knees with a high index of suspicion for infection but retain components when gout alone is confirmed, educate for adherence and lifestyle modification, and arrange follow-up or referral as needed, staying aligned with ACR 2020, ACP 2017, and BSR/EULAR recommendations throughout [^113ZunYn] [^111ZX6nR] [^1128TALh].

Treat gout in the knee by **confirming diagnosis with synovial fluid analysis** [^111NWXYW] and starting **NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids** [^111ZX6nR] promptly to control inflammation [^116D1smR]. Use intra-articular corticosteroids [^116eZv8m] if systemic therapy is contraindicated or ineffective. Initiate **urate-lowering therapy** (allopurinol first-line) in patients with ≥ 2 flares/year, tophi, or radiographic damage [^113ZunYn], and titrate to maintain serum urate < 6 mg/dL [^116z9DFQ] [^114Ny1jR]. Provide **lifestyle counseling** (weight loss, low-purine diet, limit alcohol) [^113AVMrk] and monitor serum urate regularly [^115GKEfs]; refer to rheumatology for refractory disease or diagnostic uncertainty [^1149vEW6].

---

## Diagnosis and initial assessment

- **Synovial fluid analysis**: Confirm diagnosis by identifying negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals [^111NWXYW].

- **Clinical evaluation**: Assess for acute monoarthritis [^116XCZDk], erythema, swelling, and severe pain [^1136Wi1C].

- **Imaging**: Use ultrasound or dual-energy CT if synovial fluid analysis is not feasible [^115sXLbA].

---

## Acute management

### Pharmacologic therapy

- **NSAIDs**: First-line therapy [^111ZX6nR]; use maximum recommended doses short-term [^113Cax1z].

- **Colchicine**: Effective at low doses [^111ZX6nR]; fewer gastrointestinal adverse events than high-dose [^1132ms2q].

- **Corticosteroids**: Oral or intra-articular options [^111ZX6nR] for patients intolerant to NSAIDs or colchicine [^1139UKZq].

- **IL-1 inhibitors**: Consider for refractory cases or contraindications to standard therapy [^112ZXcoP] [^114gt9LN].

---

### Non-pharmacologic therapy

Recommended measures include **rest, elevation, and ice** to reduce inflammation [^1167Wetv], and **lifestyle modifications** such as weight loss, a low-purine diet, limiting alcohol, and maintaining hydration [^113AVMrk].

---

## Chronic management and prevention

### Urate-lowering therapy (ULT)

- **Indications**: ≥ 2 flares/year, tophi, or radiographic damage [^1141dTky].

- **First-line therapy**: Allopurinol [^11323pWu], start low and titrate to serum urate < 6 mg/dL [^114mYfJc] [^114Ny1jR].

- **Alternative therapy**: Febuxostat [^11323pWu] if allopurinol is contraindicated or ineffective.

- **Uricosuric agents**: Probenecid for patients intolerant to xanthine oxidase inhibitors [^1132QA8x] [^11549yBk].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Key elements include **serum urate monitoring** every 2–5 weeks during titration, then every 6 months once at target [^115GKEfs] [^116FEjYb], and **patient education** emphasizing adherence and lifestyle changes to prevent flares [^113bRmD5] [^114Nm3Rq].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Rheumatology referral is indicated for **refractory disease** [^1149vEW6] with persistent symptoms despite optimal therapy [^113TXRhZ]. Referral is also appropriate for diagnostic uncertainty [^1149vEW6] due to unclear etiology or atypical presentation. Severe disease characterized by tophi, chronic arthropathy, or significant comorbidities [^1149vEW6] likewise warrants specialist evaluation.

---

## Potential complications if untreated

If untreated, **gout can lead to joint damage**, including chronic arthritis, tophi, and irreversible joint destruction [^114EJ7Xd]. Functional impairment with reduced mobility and quality of life is common [^111HAoku]. There is also an increased risk of total joint replacement [^114EJ7Xd].

---

Effective management of gout in the knee requires **prompt diagnosis**, acute inflammation control, and long-term urate lowering to prevent recurrence and joint damage [^116FEjYb] [^114EJ7Xd].

Are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) associated with better outcomes than cyclooxygenase inhibitors, glucocorticoids, IL-1 inhibitors, or placebo in the treatment of acute gout?

- **Bottom line**: NSAIDs are not significantly associated with a difference in pain reduction compared with cyclooxygenase inhibitors and glucocorticoids for treating acute gout. However, NSAIDs are associated with higher rates of adverse events and higher rates of withdrawal due to these adverse events compared with cyclooxygenase inhibitors.

### Gout-induced arthropathy after total knee arthroplasty: a report of two cases [^1148tMm5]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

Gout, although relatively rare in joint replacements, can present as an acute or chronic painful knee or hip arthroplasty. Differentiating between gout and an acute infection of a joint replacement can be challenging, as the physical examination and laboratory studies are often similar. Both conditions may present with rapid onset of joint pain, swelling, erythema, and constitutional symptoms, including fevers and malaise. Laboratory findings in both conditions often include elevated leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level.

Negatively birefringent, needle-shaped crystals in the synovial fluid confirm the diagnosis of gout. Misdiagnosing septic arthritis in a joint replacement with crystal-induced synovitis can lead to inappropriate open debridement or component removal. The study includes a review of the literature and presents two cases of gout after total knee arthroplasty. These cases suggest that in situations of suspected sepsis without synovial fluid crystals, operative intervention may be indicated with a presumed diagnosis of septic arthritis. However, the identification of chalky white or yellow deposits in the synovium or bone is highly suggestive of gout.

The definitive diagnosis is made by polarized light histologic evaluation of these tissues. If these deposits are present without a positive preoperative culture, positive Gram stain for bacteria, or component loosening, component retention is indicated.

### An appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for the management of gout [^1168EXpt]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for the management of gout.

- **Recent findings**: The ACR's first clinical practice guidelines for the management of gout emphasize recommendations for both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to hyperuricaemia, as well as the treatment and prophylaxis of acute gouty arthritis. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology was used to assess the risks and benefits of alternative treatments regarding efficacy, safety, and quality, but not cost-effectiveness. New recommendations include the use of either allopurinol or febuxostat as first-line urate-lowering drug therapy (ULT), screening for HLA-B✱5801 prior to initiating allopurinol in Asians at relatively high risk for allopurinol hypersensitivity, and the use of pegloticase for patients with severe, symptomatic, tophaceous gout who are refractory to, or intolerant of, appropriately dosed ULTs. Appraisal and comparison with other guidelines using Guidelines International Network and Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) criteria demonstrated good scores for scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, editorial independence, and overall quality, but not for applicability.

- **Summary**: The ACR guidelines offer comprehensive, up-to-date, good-quality, evidence-based expert consensus recommendations for managing gout in clinical practice but score poorly in terms of applicability. To enhance gout management in the community, a summary of key recommendations, criteria for audit, and standards is needed.

### Treatment of chronic gout. Can we determine when urate stores are depleted enough to prevent attacks of gout [^113MVkTw]? The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to determine if reducing serum uric acid (SUA) concentrations below 6 mg/dl, or maintaining this reduction for a longer duration, results in the depletion of urate crystals from the knee joints, thereby preventing further attacks of gout.

- **Methods**: A prospective study was initiated 10 years ago at Philadelphia VA Medical Center. The aim was to maintain SUA levels of patients with crystal-proven gout at 6 mg/dl. Group B consisted of patients with SUA levels maintained for 12 months. Nearly half of these patients had no gout attack for 2 or more years, with an average of 1 attack in the last year for the entire group. Among three patients with tophi, no major flares of gout occurred within the past year. Knee joint aspiration was performed on 16 asymptomatic patients, revealing that seven (44%) still had MSU crystals present in their knees.

### Interventions for tophi in gout [^115RUWgX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Tophi develop in untreated or uncontrolled gout. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014. The objectives were to assess the benefits and harms of non-surgical and surgical treatments for the management of tophi in gout.

- **Search methods**: We updated the search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase databases to 28 August 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials examining interventions for tophi in gout in adults.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included one trial in our original review and added four more trials (1796 participants) in this update. One had three arms: pegloticase infusion every two weeks (biweekly), monthly pegloticase infusion (pegloticase infusion alternating with placebo infusion every two weeks), and placebo. Two studies looked at lesinurad 200 mg or 400 mg in combination with allopurinol. One trial studied lesinurad 200 mg or 400 mg in combination with febuxostat. One trial compared febuxostat 80 mg and 120 mg to allopurinol. Two trials were at unclear risk of performance and detection bias due to lack of information on the blinding of participants and personnel. All other trials were at low risk of bias. Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision; one study; 79 participants) showed that biweekly pegloticase resolved tophi in 21/52 participants compared with 2/27 on placebo (risk ratio (RR) 5.45, 95% confidence interval [C…

### Diagnosis of acute gout: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111NWXYW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis of gout.

- **Methods**: This guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on gout diagnosis, identified using several databases, from database inception to February 2016. Evaluated outcomes included the accuracy of the test results; intermediate outcomes such as results of laboratory and radiographic tests — specifically serum urate and synovial fluid crystal analysis — and radiographic or ultrasonography changes. Other evaluated aspects included clinical decision-making, which considers additional testing and pharmacologic or dietary management, short-term clinical outcomes like pain and joint swelling and tenderness, and adverse effects of the tests. The guideline grades the evidence and recommendations using the ACP grading system, based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population comprises adults with joint inflammation suspected to be gout.

- **Recommendation**: ACP recommends that clinicians use synovial fluid analysis when clinical judgment indicates that diagnostic testing is necessary in patients with possible acute gout (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### New developments in gout [^116kwExV]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common type of inflammatory arthritis. This review summarizes the most recent studies on newer therapeutics, disease management strategies, and treatment recommendations.

- **Recent findings**: There are several new therapeutic agents being investigated for the management of acute gout symptoms, targeting interleukin-1β, as well as urate-lowering therapies including uricase and inhibitors of renal urate transporter proteins. Interventions led by pharmacists and nurses, which include patient education, lifestyle advice, monitoring, and titration of urate-lowering medications, have been implemented to improve gout management. Recently, the American College of Rheumatology has published guidelines for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapeutic approaches for hyperuricemia and acute gouty arthritis.

- **Summary**: New therapeutic agents targeting the mechanism of inflammation (IL-1β) are under investigation. In addition, new urate-lowering medications to be used alone or in combination with allopurinol are undergoing rigorous evaluation for patients not responding to or unable to take other therapies. There is also increasing interest in redesigning clinical care to improve patient education, self-management training, and urate-lowering medication titration. Although we await the results of these investigations, the American College of Rheumatology treatment guidelines provide a framework for clinicians to offer optimal gout care.

### Treating to target: A strategy to cure gout [^114Pzu3i]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute gout attacks and the long-term complications of gout are associated with the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) monohydrate crystals in the joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. The aim of long-term treatment is to reduce the serum urate (sUA) level to 6 mg/dl (≤ 360 micromol/l), below the saturation point of MSU, so that new crystals cannot form and existing crystals are dissolved. Serial joint aspiration studies confirmed the disappearance of crystals with effective urate-lowering therapy. There is good evidence that achieving sUA < 6 mg/dl (360 micromol/l) results in freedom from acute gout attacks, and shrinkage and eventual disappearance of tophi.

Gout patients must be informed about their diagnosis and educated about gout management, including the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Patients starting urate-lowering therapy need to understand the importance of prophylactic therapy with colchicine or NSAIDs to reduce the risk of 'mobilization flares' in the first few months. In the long term, reduction in the sUA below the target level will result in gout being effectively cured.

- **Monoarticular involvement**: Especially in a foot (focusing on the first metatarsophalangeal) or ankle joint.
- **Previous similar acute arthritis episodes**: A history relevant to the diagnosis.
- **Rapid onset of severe pain and swelling**: Pain and swelling reaching their peak severity in less than 24 hours.
- **Erythema**: A notable clinical feature.
- **Hyperuricemia**: Elevated uric acid levels.
- **Associated cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)**: A pattern associated with gout.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^1178vY6y]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Gout is a common arthritic condition resulting from monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Urate-lowering treatment (ULT) is essential for patients with gout. Previous guidelines have provided conflicting recommendations on whether ULT could be initiated during an acute gout flare. Generally, ULT should be initiated after an acute flare has resolved to avoid prolongation of symptoms. The incidence of gout flares has been positively correlated with the reduction of serum uric acid (sUA) levels in the first few months after initiating ULT.

ULT could be initiated during an acute flare to reduce the number of outpatient treatment visits required and hence increase patient compliance. The 2016 EULAR Gout Management Recommendations have not provided clear guidance on this. Additionally, the 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the management of gout have conditionally recommended that pharmacological urate-lowering therapy could be initiated during an acute gout flare based on anti-inflammatory treatment. However, this recommendation was graded moderate based on two small randomized clinical trials and an observational study.

Two small randomized clinical trials observed that initiating allopurinol treatment during an acute gout flare did not prolong painful gout flares. Febuxostat (40 mg/day) had a superior urate-lowering effect compared with limited allopurinol doses (maximum 200–300 mg/day). At present, no studies have been published regarding the initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flares.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^1132ms2q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

This is an updated Cochrane Review, first published in 2006 and updated in 2014. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

- **Objectives**: To update the available evidence of the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

- **Search methods**: We updated the search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP registries to 28 August 2020. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled trials (quasi-RCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (placebo or active) in acute gout. Low-dose colchicine at clinically relevant doses compared with placebo was the primary comparison. The major outcomes were pain, participant global assessment of treatment success (proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours), reduction of inflammation, function of target joint, serious adverse events, total adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane in this review update.

- **Main results**: We included four trials (803 randomized participants), including two new trials, in this updated review. One three-arm trial compared high-dose colchicine (52 participants) and low-dose colchicine (74 participants).

Regarding the medical management of gout, particularly in the context of acute flares, the BSR 2017 guidelines recommend considering joint aspiration and the administration of an intra-articular corticosteroid for patients with acute monoarticular gout. For patients who are unable to tolerate NSAIDs or colchicine, or if an intra-articular injection is not feasible, consider administering a short course of oral corticosteroids or a single injection of intramuscular corticosteroids as alternatives. Systemic therapy should also be considered for patients experiencing oligo- or polyarticular attacks of gout.

### Gout [^111HAoku]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Low credibility.

Gout affects about 5% of men and 1% of women, with up to 80% of people experiencing a re-attack within 3 years.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute gout? What are the effects of xanthine oxidase inhibitors to prevent gout in people with prior acute episodes? We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harm alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 21 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: colchicine, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and xanthine oxidase inhibitors.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^116qMxjN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid and other tissues. The natural history of articular gout is generally characterized by three periods: asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, episodes of acute gout, and chronic gouty arthritis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs), are commonly used to treat acute gout. Published guidelines recommend their use to treat acute attacks, employing maximum recommended doses for a short duration.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefit and safety of NSAIDs (including COXIBs) for acute gout.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE for studies up to 7 October 2013, as well as the 2010 and 2011 ACR and EULAR abstracts. Additionally, we performed a hand search of reference lists of articles. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trial register and ClinicalTrials.gov, applying no date or language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered all published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled clinical trials that compared NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy (including non-pharmacological therapies) for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain (proportion with 50% or more reduction in pain or mean pain when the dichotomous outcome was unavailable), inflammation (e.g. measured by joint swelling/erythema/tenderness), function of the target joint, participant's global assessment of treatment success, and health-related quality of life.

### Management of gout: A systematic review in support of an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1135h9gE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis observed in patients by primary care physicians. The purpose of this systematic review is to assess evidence related to the treatment of acute gout attacks, management of hyperuricemia for prevention, and the discontinuation of medications for chronic gout in adults.

- **Data sources**: Evidence was gathered from multiple electronic databases spanning January 2010 to March 2016, including reference mining and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

- **Study selection**: The review considered studies involving drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, commonly prescribed by primary care physicians, randomized trials for therapeutic effectiveness, and trials alongside observational studies for adverse events.

- **Data extraction**: One reviewer conducted data extraction, verified by a second reviewer. Two independent reviewers assessed study quality, while the strength-of-evidence was determined through group discussion.

- **Data synthesis**: Analysis revealed high-strength evidence from 28 trials, only 3 of which were placebo-controlled, indicating that colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids effectively reduce pain in patients experiencing acute gout. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that low-dose colchicine is comparably effective to high-dose regimens, with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Additionally, moderate-strength evidence shows that urate-lowering therapies, such as allopurinol or febuxostat, diminish the long-term risk of acute gout attacks after one year or more. High-strength evidence supports that daily prophylaxis with colchicine or NSAIDs reduces the risk of acute gout attacks by at least half for patients initiating urate-lowering therapy.

### Joint nociceptor nerve activity and pain in an animal model of acute gout and its modulation by intra-articular hyaluronan [^115TTA2A]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, we describe for the first time in mammals that the injection of MSU crystals in the rat knee joint evokes an augmented joint nociceptor activity. This activity evolves in parallel with the local inflammation and behavioral signs of pain, closely resembling those observed in human gouty attacks. This observation suggests its potential as a useful animal model for gout arthritis. Our data further show that the intra-articular injection of sodium hyaluronate of high molecular weight (HMW) reduces joint nociceptor impulse activity elicited by movements likely causing joint pain. This demonstrates that the analgesic action of HMW-HA, previously observed in osteoarthritis, also occurs in gouty arthritis.

- **Mechanisms for augmented joint nociceptor activity, local inflammation, and pain induced by monosodium urate crystals**: In human gout and pseudogout arthritis, it has been proposed that the deposition of MSU or calcium pyrophosphate crystals in joint synovial fluid and tissues mechanically harms joint surfaces, contributing to acute inflammation and pain. Several other mechanisms could determine the reaction to intra-articular crystals, with ample evidence supporting the central role of immune cell activation as the main triggering mechanism. Our observation in rats that larger, needle-shaped MSU crystals were not more effective than small, amorphous ones in causing inflammation, nocifensive behavior, and enhancement of joint nociceptor activity argues against direct mechanical injury by crystals as the mechanism for the stimulation of sensory nerve terminals in gout pain. This confirms previous clinical findings.

### New ACR guidelines for gout management hold some surprises [^114cd7ap]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2013). High credibility.

Despite exciting progress in the understanding and treatment of gout, management of this condition remains suboptimal. In the face of this inadequacy, new guidelines provide recommendations both for therapeutic approaches to hyperuricaemia and for the management and anti-inflammatory prophylaxis of acute gouty arthritis.

### Optimizing current treatment of gout [^113bRmD5]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and effectively 'cure' the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practices, barriers to effective care, and how these barriers might be overcome.

To optimize the management of gout, healthcare professionals must know not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy against a specific target level of serum uric acid that is below the saturation point for crystal formation. Perspectives are shifting towards much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of first diagnosis of gout.

Holistic assessment and patient education are essential to address patient-specific risk factors and ensure adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

### What makes gouty inflammation so variable [^115mVtZi]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The intersecting effects of therapeutics on gouty inflammation are evident. The mechanisms of action of the primary treatment options for prophylaxis and treatment of acute gout clearly intersect with many of the novel inflammation-mediating pathways cited above. Specifically, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and certain other NSAIDs activate PPAR-γ. Corticosteroids, which inhibit transcription of many inflammatory genes, also regulate annexin A1. However, corticosteroids also paradoxically induce NLRP3, which may contribute to rebound flares of acute gout after steroid therapy is stopped. Low doses of colchicine suppress not simply neutrophil and endothelial function, but also multiple inflammatory effects in macrophages, transduced in large part by colchicine-induced activation of AMPK.

In terms of investigational agents, randomized clinical trials of the IL-1β-specific monoclonal antibody canakinumab have demonstrated superiority compared to a single dose of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide in reducing pain in acute gout and delaying time to the next acute gout flare. Canakinumab is approved in Europe as an option for acute gout therapy. Multiple retrospective case series have reported on the efficacy of anakinra (recombinant IL-1ra) in acute gout in many but not all patients. Failure in acute gout (but not for anti-inflammatory flare prophylaxis) of the IL-1 blocker rilonacept may have been due to binding of rilonacept to IL-1ra. Finally, the partial PPAR-γ agonist arhalofenate, which is uricosuric, has been reported to be associated with a decreased frequency of acute gout flares in comparison.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116D1smR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017).

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

- **Methods**: Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

- **Recommendation 1**: ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 2**: ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 3**: ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients following a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 4**: ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy.

### Remembering the forgotten non-communicable diseases [^111N3yZt]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The epidemiology, diagnosis, and optimal management of gout present significant challenges. Diagnosing gout correctly is often difficult. In the early phase of the disease, gout manifests as intermittent monarticular acute arthritis. In later years, it progresses to chronic polyarthritis with intermittent flares. Arthritis may be accompanied by tophi and renal stones.

The rates of joint fluid aspirate-proven diagnosis of gout are low. Given the common involvement of the great toe and other lower extremity joints in osteoarthritis and pseudogout, a presumptive diagnosis of gout based solely on a history of big toe pain and a borderline high or higher than normal serum urate level is problematic. Documentation of additional clinical features, such as acute synovitis, radiographic signs of overhanging margins, and punched-out erosions typical of gout, as well as attention to features of differential diagnoses like osteoarthritis, pseudogout, and rheumatoid arthritis, often aids in a correct diagnosis.

The 1977 American Rheumatism Association (ARA) preliminary criteria for the classification of acute gouty arthritis are commonly used for clinical diagnosis but are inadequate for in-office diagnosis in about 21% of cases. It is essential to aspirate joint, bursa, or tophus and confirm the diagnosis, as documenting urate crystals in synovial fluid confirms gout as a single test. This is crucial given that the treatment for gout is often lifelong.

### We can make gout management more successful now [^112N9Jrm]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this editorial review is to identify and comment on factors contributing to the less-than-optimal state of gout management, and to emphasize immediate opportunities to improve management practices affecting many patients with gout.

Numerous publications document deficits in the management and clinical outcomes of gout, despite a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder, the ability to establish the diagnosis with certainty, and the likely effectiveness, for most patients, of available lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Among impediments to successful gout management are diagnostic inaccuracy; a paucity of validated management recommendations to guide care providers; incomplete patient education about gout and the aims and modalities of management; suboptimal patient adherence, even to demonstrably effective therapeutic recommendations; comorbidities and drug interferences that complicate treatment of gout; patient groups at special risk for progression to chronic tophaceous gout; and limited urate-lowering alternatives.

Recent publication of evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of gout and the impending availability of new urate-lowering agents suggest that this is an opportune time to initiate professional and patient education efforts toward improved management of this increasingly common disorder.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^1135R2x9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases from inception to April 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism (2010 until 2013) and reference lists of identified studies. Additionally, we searched the clinical trials register clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials register.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (active or placebo) in acute gout. The primary benefit outcome of interest was pain, defined as a proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain, and the primary harm outcome was study participants' withdrawal due to adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently screened search results for relevant studies, extracted data into a standardized form, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We pooled data if deemed to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous.

### Interleukin-1 inhibitors for acute gout [^114gt9LN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Acute gout flares cause significant pain and disability; thus, it is important to provide quick and effective pain relief. Traditional options for managing acute flares include colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and glucocorticoids.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of interleukin-1 inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab, rilonacept) in acute gout.

- **Search methods**: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE on 19 June 2013. We applied no date or language restrictions and performed a handsearch of the abstracts from the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) (2009 to 2012) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) (2009 to 2011) conferences as well as the references of all included trials. We also screened the Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization and the US National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised clinical trials (controlled clinical trials (CCTs)) assessing an interleukin-1 inhibitor (anakinra, canakinumab, or rilonacept) against placebo or another active treatment (colchicine, paracetamol, NSAIDs, glucocorticoids (systemic or intra-articular), adrenocorticotropin hormone, a different interleukin-1 blocking agent, or a combination of any of the above) in adults with acute gout.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted the data. If appropriate, we pooled data in a meta-analysis.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: A systematic review [^116ZEH7Y]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Gout is characterized by reoccurring flares of joint pain and swelling, which can necessitate hospital admission when severe. Highly effective, low-cost medications are available for the treatment of gout flares, including colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids. Flares can be prevented by urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), of which allopurinol is the most widely used. The British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and EULAR guidelines recommend offering ULT to all patients with gout, with up-titration to achieve serum urate (SU) levels of 300–360 micromol/l (5–6 mg/dl) to facilitate crystal dissolution. The ACR gout management guideline was recently updated to conditionally recommend the initiation of ULT during flares, rather than delayed initiation of ULT after flare resolution.

Despite effective treatments, hospitalizations for gout flares have increased dramatically: doubling in the United States between 1993 and 2011, from 4.4 to 8.8 admissions per 100,000 adults; doubling in Canada between 2000 and 2011, from 3.8 to 7.6 admissions per 100,000 adults; and increasing by 58.4% in England between 2006 and 2017, from 7.9 to 12.5 admissions per 100,000 adults. This contrasts with the decline in hospitalizations from RA. There are multiple contributing factors to the epidemic of gout hospitalizations: the prevalence of gout has increased in Western countries in recent years on the backdrop of an aging population with rising prevalences of obesity and metabolic syndrome; the management of gout is frequently suboptimal in primary care, rheumatology clinics, and inpatient settings.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^116LFPLW]. Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

The response rate of patients with gout is about 80% within 7 days of using traditional non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with the maximum 'days to resolution' being 28 days. Hence, diclofenac was continued for 4 weeks in this study. We found that initiation of febuxostat administration during an acute gout flare did not prolong acute flares, and the rate of 'treat to target' was higher in the febuxostat group. This may increase patient compliance.

Two randomized clinical trials demonstrated that initiating allopurinol treatment during an acute gout flare did not prolong painful gout flares. In one of the trials, allopurinol was initiated at 100 mg daily for the first 14 days and then increased to 200 mg daily for the next 14 days. The investigators observed that the days to resolution were 15.4 days for the allopurinol group and 13.4 days for the placebo group (P = 0.05). However, the sample cohort used in the study was small (17 in the placebo and 14 in the allopurinol group), and the type of anti-inflammatory drugs used in the study increased the experimental uncertainty. In addition, the days to resolution coincided with the time it takes to spontaneously resolve inflammation during typical gout flares. In another published study, patients presenting within the first 7 days of onset of an acute gout flare were evaluated. The mean daily visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores did not differ significantly between the study groups at any point between days 1–10. However, allopurinol was initiated at 300 mg daily, which was not consistent with the standard dosage recommendations.

### Evolution of management of gout: a comparison of recent guidelines [^114JoBPf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

There have been several guidelines on the management of gout over the last decade; however, inconsistencies between them create confusion for practitioners. This review highlights areas of agreement between guidelines and discusses data where disagreements exist.

- **Recent findings**: For acute gout, the guidelines agree that anti-inflammatory treatment should start as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours. Older guidelines preferred NSAIDs or colchicine over steroids, but newer ones leave the choice of agent to the physician. For colchicine, all guidelines recommend using a low dose. Intra-articular, oral, or intramuscular steroids are all described as effective.

	- For management of hyperuricemia, indications for initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) have become more inclusive over the years by requiring a lower burden of disease severity or including patient comorbidities. Probenecid has fallen out of favor, with most guidelines favoring allopurinol over febuxostat. Although there is a disagreement about the timing of initiation for ULT, guidelines recommend treating to a target of serum urate (sUA) less than 6 mg/dl, and less than 5 mg/dl for patients with more severe disease. Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis has gained strong support over the years.

- **Summary**: Most guidelines are in agreement with recommendations for management of gout, and most changes have been directional and evolutionary.

### Initiation of allopurinol at first medical contact for acute attacks of gout: A randomized clinical trial [^111kgTxe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Streamlining the initiation of allopurinol could result in a cost benefit for a common medical problem and obviate the perception that no treatment is required once acute attacks have resolved. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in patient daily pain or subsequent attacks with early versus delayed initiation of allopurinol for an acute gout attack.

- **Methods**: A total of 57 men with crystal-proven gout were randomized to allopurinol 300 mg daily or matching placebo for 10 days. All subjects received indomethacin 50 mg three times per day for 10 days, a prophylactic dose of colchicine 0.6 mg two times per day for 90 days, and open-label allopurinol starting at day 11. Primary outcome measures were pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) for the primary joint on days 1 to 10 and self-reported flares in any joint through day 30.

- **Results**: On the basis of 51 evaluable subjects (allopurinol in 26, placebo in 25), mean daily VAS pain scores did not differ significantly between study groups at any point between days 1 and 10. Initial VAS pain scores for allopurinol and placebo arms were 6.72 versus 6.28 (P = 0.37), declining to 0.18 versus 0.27 (P = 0.54) at day 10, with neither group consistently having more daily pain. Subsequent flares occurred in two subjects taking allopurinol and three subjects taking placebo (P = 0.60). Although urate levels decreased rapidly in the allopurinol group (from 7.8 mg/dL at baseline to 5.9 mg/dL at day 3), sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels did not differ between groups at any point.

### Updates in the management of gout [^115dzN3p]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with gout are cared for by primary care physicians. Although both the physician and patient may easily recognize the acute arthritis of gout, errors in selecting the most appropriate medication and proper dose are common. The clinical stages of gout include asymptomatic hyperuricemia, intermittent gouty arthritis, and chronic tophaceous gout. Treatment of gout is usually considered after the first attack of arthritis, typically podagra. The aims of treatment are to alleviate the pain and inflammation associated with acute attacks, prevent future attacks, and decrease uric acid levels. Confusion frequently arises because certain medications, such as colchicine, may have dual purposes: to treat an acute attack and to suppress future attacks. The purpose of this management update is to provide practical advice about prescribing the proper medication, considering both treatment goals and patient comorbidities.

### Prophylaxis for acute gout flares after initiation of urate-lowering therapy [^113UXfU7]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

This review summarizes evidence relating to prophylaxis for gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT). We searched MEDLINE via PubMed for articles published in English from 1963 to 2013 using MEsH terms covering all aspects of prophylaxis for flares. Dispersion of monosodium urate crystals during the initial phase of deposit dissolution with ULT exposes the patient to an increased rate of acute flares that could contribute to poor treatment adherence. Slow titration of ULT might decrease the risk of flares. According to the most recent international recommendation, the two first-line options for prophylaxis are low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice a day) or low-dose NSAIDs such as naproxen 250 mg orally twice a day. They can be given for up to 6 months. If these drugs are contraindicated, not tolerated, or ineffective, low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) might be used. Recently, reports for four trials described the efficacy of canakinumab and rilonacept, two IL-1 inhibitors, for preventing flares during the initiation of allopurinol therapy. Prophylaxis for flares induced by ULT is an important consideration in gout management. Low-dose colchicine and low-dose NSAIDs are the recommended first-line therapies. Although no IL-1 blockers are approved as prophylactic treatment, this class of drug could become an interesting option for patients with gout with intolerance or contraindication to colchicine, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^113Cax1z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis resulting from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in and around joints. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. This paper updates a Cochrane Review first published in 2014.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs), for acute gout.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase databases were searched for studies up to 28 August 2020. No date or language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy for acute gout were considered. Major outcomes assessed included pain, inflammation, function, participant-reported global assessment, quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events, and total adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane were employed.

- **Main results**: The update includes 28 trials with a total of 3406 participants, featuring 5 new trials. One trial (30 participants) compared NSAIDs to placebo; six trials (1244 participants) compared non-selective NSAIDs to selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs); five trials (712 participants) compared NSAIDs to glucocorticoids; thirteen trials (633 participants) compared one NSAID to another NSAID. Single trials compared NSAIDs to rilonacept (225 participants), acupuncture (163 participants), and colchicine (399 participants). Most trials were at risk of selection bias.

### Effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of acute and prevention of recurrent gout — a systematic review [^113sgmdg]. Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

To determine the evidence for the effectiveness of treatments for acute gout and the prevention of recurrent gout, seven electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of treatments for gout from their inception to the end of 2004. No language restrictions were applied. All randomized controlled trials of treatments routinely available for the treatment of gout were included. Trials of the prevention of recurrence were included only if patients who previously had gout and had at least six months of follow-up were studied.

We found 13 randomized controlled trials of treatment for acute gout, two of which were placebo-controlled. Colchicine was found to be effective in one study; however, the entire colchicine group developed toxicity. The only robust conclusion from studies of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is that pain relief from indometacin and etoricoxib is equivalent. We found one randomized controlled trial, reported only as a conference abstract, of recurrent gout prevention.

The shortage of robust data to inform the management of a common problem such as gout is surprising. All of the drugs used to treat gout can have serious side effects. The incidence of gout is highest in the elderly population. It is in this group, who are at a high risk of serious adverse events, that we are using drugs of known toxicity. The balance of risks and benefits for the drug treatment of gout needs to be reassessed.

### Evaluation and treatment of knee pain: A review [^117KwPXg]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Knee pain may arise from various causes, including tendinitis, acute bursitis, knee osteoarthritis, and knee injury. Additionally, conditions such as gout, rheumatic fever, ruptured Baker's cyst, and Osgood-Schlatter disease are potential contributors. Other causes include infrapatellar fat pad syndrome, patellar tendinitis, and osteochondritis dissecans. Meniscal pathology and chondromalacia patellae are also relevant conditions. Additionally, diseases like Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease, rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis should be considered. Lyme disease, hemarthrosis, and calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease can also lead to knee pain.

- **Oncology and systemic disorders**: Synovial sarcoma, osteosarcoma, patellofemoral pain syndrome, and osteonecrosis are critical diagnoses to rule out. Iliotibial band syndrome, fibromyalgia, and systemic lupus erythematosus are additional systemic conditions that can manifest as knee pain. Neuropathic arthropathy of the knee and tenosynovial giant cell tumor are also important considerations.

### The impact of gout guidelines [^115xVoQq]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

This review discusses the impact of recent treatment guidelines for the management of gout and the barriers to treating gout patients.

- **Recent findings**: Multiple guidelines for both the treatment and prevention of gout have been put forth in the last decade, including those from the British Rheumatism Society, the European League Against Rheumatism, the Multinational Evidence, Expertise, Exchange Initiative, the Japanese Society of Gout and Nucleic Acid Metabolism, and the American College of Rheumatology. These guidelines are designed to facilitate the management of gout by providers with key recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia, which is the greatest risk factor for developing gout. However, despite the existing guidelines, overall adherence to recommendations has been slow, and the initiation of urate-lowering therapy, titration of dosing, and monitoring of serum urate is infrequent. Greater education in proper management and increased awareness of new treatment strategies appear to be primary reasons for this gap and offer avenues for improvement in management, as well as areas for further research.

- **Summary**: Gout remains a treatment challenge for both acute and chronic disease. Despite the availability of management guidelines, primary care providers are struggling with appropriate disease management. More research tools and strategies are needed to improve overall outcomes and quality of care.

### Urate-lowering treatment and risk of total joint replacement in patients with gout [^114EJ7Xd]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Clinically, gout is characterized by acute attacks of synovitis, chronic arthritis, subcutaneous urate crystal concretions (tophi), and an increased risk of urolithiasis. It is also associated with higher mortality and many co-morbidities. Gout results from chronic hyperuricaemia, which leads to the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, mainly in and around peripheral joints, that can damage joints irreversibly.

As with osteoarthritis (OA) and other arthropathies, gout may result in the need for total joint replacement (TJR) to restore function and reduce pain. Mechanistic explanations for the irreversible joint damage associated with gout primarily focus on the interaction between MSU crystals and joint tissues, especially cartilage, bone, and synovium. However, few studies have investigated the association between irreversible joint damage in gout, which may result in an increased need for total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR).

One previous study reported the co-localization of joints affected by acute attacks of gout and OA. We recently examined the risk of co-morbidities associated with gout and found a higher prevalence of OA in people with gout. The positive association between gout and OA, the single most important risk factor for TJR, could potentially lead to an increased risk of TJR in patients with gout.

Effective urate-lowering treatment (ULT) reverses hyperuricaemia and may help dissolve away MSU crystals, which theoretically may retard the progression of joint damage and subsequently reduce the risk of TJR in patients.

### Gout: will the "king of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured [^111dUatd]? BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines for gout have been recently published by both the ACR in 2012 and the EULAR in 2016. Several key aspects of appropriate management are addressed in these treatment guidelines, which should be helpful to providers since gout care is critically suboptimal. A controversial recommendation to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease by adjusting to creatinine clearance in EULAR guidelines has been challenged since the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with allopurinol seems to be related to the starting dose, not the maximal dose. Therefore, there is currently no rationale to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease.

Treat-to-target (T2T) serum urate (sUA) is not a new concept in gout, but one that has been brought to center stage by the leading treatment recommendations in the ACR and the EULAR guidelines, as well as by a recent consensus statement about T2T. The rheumatology community considers the existing evidence regarding T2T to a goal of sUA less than 6 mg/dL in gout as sufficient based on three key correlates for achieving sUA less than 6 mg/dL: (1) associated benefits of reduction of gout flares, tophi, and medical care costs by achieving and maintaining this target; (2) the fact that this sUA target is below the solubility threshold of urate, which prevents its crystallization in body fluids at 6.8 mg/dL; and (3) the use of this sUA threshold as a primary outcome.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^113ZunYn]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). High credibility.

The objective of this guideline is to provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

- **Methods**: Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed. This was followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses. The available evidence was rated according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, with patient input also considered. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

- **Results**: Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included the initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For the management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^113AVMrk]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The goal of medical treatment of gout is to acutely control inflammation from flares and chronically to lower uric acid levels. Gout flares are usually treated with NSAIDs (naproxen, indomethacin, or selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors), colchicine, and oral or intra-articular corticosteroids, either individually or in combination. Patients whose gout flares are refractory to these traditional treatments or have medical contraindications may be considered for monoclonal antibodies against IL1 or adrenocorticotropic hormone.

The first-line treatment for lowering uric acid is with xanthine oxidase inhibitors, which stop the synthesis of uric acid from hypoxanthine and include allopurinol and febuxostat. Consideration is also given to medications that promote uric acid excretion (uricosuric), such as probenecid, and those that promote uric acid degradation, such as pegloticase, an intravenously administered recombinant uricase. Newer therapeutics include arhalofenate, which has been shown to have both uricosuric and anti-inflammatory effects in clinical trials, and oral recombinant uricases. Lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss and limiting the intake of purine-rich foods, should also be recommended in addition to medications for decreasing inflammation and uric acid levels.

- **Surgical treatment**: Surgical treatment for gout is generally reserved for cases of damage to the surrounding soft tissue, concomitant septic arthritis, and other complications.
