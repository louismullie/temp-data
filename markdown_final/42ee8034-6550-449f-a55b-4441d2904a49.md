## Question

acne management

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acne management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify acne severity and why that matters. Then, I should verify first-line topical strategies for mild disease. Next, I will examine escalation to combination therapy for moderate disease and the role of oral antibiotics. After that, I need to check indications, dosing, and monitoring for isotretinoin in severe or refractory cases. I will then consider hormonal therapies for females, maintenance strategies, and special populations. Finally, I should review physical therapies, adherence and cost-effectiveness, and synthesize a practical algorithm with key takeaways, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the importance of severity classification because treatment selection hinges on it. Most contemporary guidance stratifies acne into mild, moderate, and severe based on lesion type and count, anatomic distribution, and presence of scarring or psychosocial burden, and while no universal grading system is mandated, consistent use of a validated scale like the Investigator Global Assessment helps track response and guide escalation, so I should explicitly anchor decisions to severity and scar risk rather than age alone [^112yp3ej] [^112CYLLY] [^113kKKqz].

> For mild acne, I need to ensure I start with topical monotherapy or a fixed-dose combination targeting multiple pathogenic pathways. Topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and azelaic acid are appropriate first-line options, and fixed-dose combinations such as adapalene 0.1% with benzoyl peroxide 2.5% or clindamycin 1% with benzoyl peroxide 2.5–5% are reasonable to simplify regimens and improve adherence, with the caveat that topical antibiotics should not be used as monotherapy due to resistance risk, so I should pair any antibiotic with benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid when used [^112B4FxB] [^111BjA6g] [^115VPeci].

> Wait, let me verify onset and tolerability counseling because adherence often fails here. Patients need to know that visible improvement typically takes 6–8 weeks, and irritation can be mitigated by starting slowly, using short-contact application, and layering with moisturizers, which materially affects persistence and outcomes, so I should build this into the initial plan and follow-up [^111sXWYh] [^116Z9EP4].

> For moderate acne, I should confirm that combination therapy is preferred and that oral antibiotics, when used, are paired with non-antibiotic topicals. Topical retinoid plus benzoyl peroxide with or without a topical antibiotic is a solid foundation, and adding an oral tetracycline such as doxycycline or lymecycline improves inflammatory control, but I must limit antibiotic duration to about 3 months and avoid monotherapy to mitigate resistance, with topical maintenance continued after the oral course ends [^113ZdjTj] [^111sXWYh] [^116Z9EP4].

> Hold on, I should verify the comparative effectiveness signals. Network meta-analyses suggest that for moderate-to-severe disease, topical combinations and oral antibiotics combined with topicals perform well, and a triple fixed-dose combination of clindamycin, adapalene, and benzoyl peroxide has shown strong efficacy, while combined retinoid plus lincosamide topicals also rank highly, though I need to balance this with tolerability and access considerations in shared decision-making [^113wwKFP] [^114iXepC] [^113Dgat7].

> For severe nodulocystic acne or acne causing scarring or marked psychosocial distress, I need to check that isotretinoin is indicated and how to dose it. Conventional dosing at 0.5–1 mg/kg/day with a cumulative target of 120–150 mg/kg is standard, low-dose regimens at 0.25–0.4 mg/kg/day can be effective with fewer adverse effects, and intermittent dosing is not recommended due to higher relapse, with baseline and on-treatment labs for lipids and liver enzymes and participation in iPLEDGE for teratogenicity risk mitigation [^115sg9Qn] [^116FkXmK] [^112hjL4h] [^116eoULC].

> Let me consider female-specific options because hormonal drivers are common. Combined oral contraceptives reduce androgen-mediated acne and are reasonable alternatives or adjuncts, particularly when antibiotics are undesirable, and spironolactone 50–100 mg/day is increasingly used off-label for persistent inflammatory acne in adult women, though I should counsel on menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and rare hyperkalemia and avoid use in pregnancy [^113kKKqz] [^111sXWYh] [^116Z9EP4].

> Next, I should review maintenance therapy because acne is chronic and relapses are common. Topical retinoids are the cornerstone of maintenance, with benzoyl peroxide or azelaic acid as adjuncts depending on tolerability and phenotype, and I need to ensure patients continue these after oral antibiotics or isotretinoin to sustain remission and reduce recurrence [^116TrUiV] [^113FseuU] [^112JvwJq].

> I will now examine special populations. In preadolescents, topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide are safe and effective, in pregnancy I should avoid systemic retinoids and tetracyclines and favor topical azelaic acid or benzoyl peroxide, and in patients with skin of color I should anticipate postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and consider azelaic acid or niacinamide-containing regimens while monitoring for irritation that can worsen dyspigmentation [^112B4FxB] [^113ZdjTj] [^113zmRRv].

> But wait, what about physical therapies? I initially thought photodynamic therapy might be broadly effective, but I should double-check the evidence quality. Cochrane and subsequent reviews suggest limited and inconsistent benefit for light-based modalities, with MAL-PDT showing small, often clinically insignificant effects and substantial heterogeneity, so I should position these as adjuncts or when conventional therapies are contraindicated rather than first-line [^1153NjFm] [^113XjTKK].

> I need to ensure adherence strategies are explicit because poor persistence undermines even effective regimens. Simplifying to fixed-dose combinations, providing written instructions on application order and irritation mitigation, and setting expectations for a delayed onset improve adherence, and from a systems perspective, cost-effectiveness analyses support fixed topical combinations for mild-to-moderate disease and topical combinations or oral antibiotics plus topicals for moderate-to-severe acne within NHS cost structures, reinforcing the clinical choices I make at the bedside [^111sXWYh] [^114HRmY5] [^112WB78f].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. For mild disease, start with benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid or a fixed combination and escalate if inadequate after 6–8 weeks, for moderate disease initiate a topical retinoid plus benzoyl peroxide with or without a topical antibiotic and consider adding an oral tetracycline for 3 months if response is suboptimal, and for severe or scarring acne proceed to isotretinoin or use oral antibiotic plus topical combination as a bridge while arranging isotretinoin, all with maintenance topicals thereafter, which aligns with AAD, AAFP, and NICE-informed pathways [^117B1Tyi] [^115z6PDJ] [^113Dgat7].

> Key takeaway, and I should confirm this is consistent with the evidence: treat early to prevent scarring and psychosocial sequelae, use combination therapy to target multiple pathogenic pathways, minimize antibiotic monotherapy and duration, individualize based on severity, phenotype, and patient preference, and maintain remission with topical retinoids, which together reflect the most reliable, guideline-concordant approach to acne care [^113kKKqz] [^111sXWYh] [^115osGxh].

---

Acne management should be **severity-based and mechanism-targeted**, with **topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide as first-line therapy** for mild-to-moderate disease and escalation to oral antibiotics or isotretinoin for moderate-to-severe or refractory cases [^115z6PDJ] [^115sg9Qn]. Combination therapy is superior to monotherapy, and **antibiotics must always be paired with benzoyl peroxide** to limit resistance [^112B4FxB] [^113ZdjTj]. Hormonal therapy (COCs, spironolactone) is appropriate for women with persistent acne, and isotretinoin is indicated for severe, scarring, or refractory disease with structured monitoring [^113kKKqz] [^116eoULC]. Maintenance therapy with topical retinoids prevents relapse, and patient education on adherence, tolerability, and realistic timelines is essential [^116TrUiV] [^111sXWYh].

---

## Classification and severity assessment

Classification is based on lesion type, count, and scarring; **severity guides therapy** [^112yp3ej]. Mild disease is characterized by comedones with minimal papules/pustules, moderate by papules/pustules with scarring risk, and severe by nodules/cysts with scarring and significant psychosocial impact [^115sg9Qn].

---

## General principles of acne management

- **Severity-based therapy**: Tailor treatment to severity, lesion type, and patient factors [^112MYvUh].
- **Combination therapy**: Use multiple mechanisms for faster, greater clearance [^1151Czj9].
- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Limit duration, avoid monotherapy, and pair with benzoyl peroxide [^113ZdjTj].
- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence, tolerability, and 6–8 week onset [^111sXWYh].

## Topical therapies

### First-line topical agents

| **Agent** | **Mechanism** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Benzoyl peroxide | Antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory | Mild-to-moderate; cornerstone of therapy |
| Topical retinoids (adapalene, tretinoin, tazarotene) | Comedolytic, anti-inflammatory | Mild-to-moderate; maintenance |
| Topical antibiotics (clindamycin, erythromycin) | Antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory | Moderate; never monotherapy |
| Azelaic acid | Antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory | Mild-to-moderate; sensitive skin |

---

### Combination topical therapy

Fixed-dose combinations (adapalene/BPO, clindamycin/BPO) are **more effective than monotherapy** and simplify regimens [^111BjA6g]. Triple therapy (clindamycin/adapalene/BPO) is highly effective for moderate-to-severe acne [^113wwKFP].

---

## Systemic therapies

### Oral antibiotics

- **Indication**: Moderate-to-severe inflammatory acne or topical-resistant disease [^113ZdjTj].
- **Agents**: Doxycycline, minocycline, sarecycline, lymecycline.
- **Duration**: 3–4 months; reassess and taper [^113ZdjTj].
- **Resistance prevention**: Always combine with benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid [^113ZdjTj].

---

### Hormonal therapies

Hormonal therapies include **combined oral contraceptives (COCs)** — effective for women with menstrual-related or persistent acne — and **spironolactone** (50–100 mg/day), useful for women with hyperandrogenism or persistent acne [^113kKKqz].

---

### Oral isotretinoin

- **Indication**: Severe nodulocystic, scarring, or refractory acne [^115sg9Qn].
- **Dosing**: 0.5–1 mg/kg/day; cumulative 120–150 mg/kg [^112hjL4h].
- **Monitoring**: Baseline and periodic LFTs, lipids, pregnancy tests; iPLEDGE [^116eoULC] [^115EQi2a].
- **Adverse effects**: Teratogenicity, mood changes, IBD, hyperlipidemia, dry mucosa [^116eoULC] [^112sqJw4].

---

## Physical and procedural therapies

- **Chemical peels**: Salicylic, glycolic, mandelic acids for mild-to-moderate acne [^114iXepC].
- **Light therapies**: Limited, inconsistent evidence; consider if conventional therapy fails [^1153NjFm].
- **Intralesional corticosteroids**: Rapid resolution of large inflammatory lesions, scarring prevention [^112i5wLe].

---

## Maintenance therapy

Maintenance therapy centers on **topical retinoids** (adapalene, tretinoin, tazarotene) to prevent relapse [^116TrUiV]. Benzoyl peroxide may be continued for its antimicrobial effect and to reduce resistance risk [^112B4FxB].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid retinoids, isotretinoin, tetracyclines; use azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics [^113ZdjTj].
- **Pediatrics**: Topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide are safe; avoid oral antibiotics under 8 years [^112B4FxB].
- **Skin of color**: Address hyperpigmentation with azelaic acid, niacinamide, gentle skincare [^113zmRRv].

---

## Patient adherence and quality of life

Adherence is improved with **education, simplified regimens, and tolerability counseling** [^115SANvA]. Quality of life is significantly impacted; early, effective treatment reduces psychosocial burden and scarring [^113kKKqz].

---

## Emerging therapies

Clascoterone is a topical anti-androgen for **moderate-to-severe acne**, particularly in women [^115r98L1]. Research into microbiome modulation, sebum-targeting agents, and novel retinoids is ongoing [^notfound].

---

Acne management is **severity-based**, combining topical and systemic therapies with adherence support and maintenance to prevent relapse.

Treatment options and guidelines

International guidelines recommend either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid (mainly adapalene) as first line treatments, but with differences regarding prescribing products individually or as combination products. The NICE guideline on acne, based on systematic review and network meta-analysis comparisons of acne treatments, acknowledged uncertainty in the evidence base and recommended the options in table 2 as first-line treatments.

Topical treatments

First-line treatments for mild or moderate acne are fixed combination topical preparations containing retinoids, benzoyl peroxide or topical antibiotics, as outlined in table 2. It is important that patients understand that these have a delayed onset of action (6–8 weeks) and are aware of how to avoid skin irritation when starting treatment (table 1).

Oral antibiotic treatments

The NICE guideline recommends limiting oral antibiotics to 3–6 months, while other guidelines suggest a maximum duration 3 months in order to avoid emergence of antibiotic resistance. First-line oral antibiotic recommendations are lymecycline or doxycycline. If these are not tolerated or are contraindicated, the NICE guideline recommends that trimethoprim or an oral macrolide may be considered. However, clinicians report barriers to discontinuing oral antibiotics once they have been started including patients' understandable concerns about acne relapse. Monotherapy with an oral or topical antibiotic should not be used, because there is good evidence that antimicrobial resistance is significantly reduced by coprescribing benzoyl peroxide. Consensus from clinical guidelines is that continuing topical treatments as maintenance therapy after discontinuing oral antibiotics is important in reducing the risk of relapse.

Hormonal treatments

Hormonal treatments are an alternative for women with acne. Except for co-cyprindiol, hormonal treatments (combined oral contraceptives [COCs] or spironolactone) have an advantage over oral antibiotics and isotretinoin in that they can be continued for longer courses.

Combined oral contraceptives

COCs remain an option for women ('off-label' use in acne). Although inferior to oral antibiotics at 3 months, COCs are equivalent to antibiotics at reducing acne at 6 months. There is no firm evidence to support the use of any one COC over another in terms of acne.

Co-cyprindiol

Co-cyprindiol 2000/35 (cyproterone acetate 2 mg, ethinylestradiol 35 µg) is licensed as a second-line treatment for women with severe acne, but is not recommended for long-term use due to safety concerns about rare, but cumulative dose-dependent, increased risk of meningioma.

### Light therapies for acne [^113XjTKK]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

Are light therapies effective and safe for treating acne?

Bottom Line

The evidence for all light therapies remains weak and inconclusive. Red-light methyl aminolevulinate-photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT) was the only treatment associated with a small though clinically insignificant reduction in the number of inflamed lesions and in global improvement as assessed by an investigator in moderate to severe acne. Red-light MAL-PDT was not associated with higher rates of severe adverse effects than placebo or no treatment. Owing to inadequate reporting of adverse effects such as scarring or blistering, the safety of all light therapies remains uncertain.

### Treatment of acne scarring [^113oYyuS]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Acne scarring is a common and expected result of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. Given the clinical variety of acne scars and the plethora of treatment options available, management of cutaneous scarring from acne can be challenging and confusing. This article discusses the pathophysiology of acne and acne scarring to better understand its biologic and structural nature. A simple, yet practical classification schema is presented, allowing caregivers to better organize their assessment of acne scarring and develop useful management strategies from this model. This article highlights the various useful laser options that are available for the treatment of acne scarring.

### Expert committee recommendations for acne management [^1151Czj9]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

In 2003, an international committee of physicians and researchers in the field of acne, working together as the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne, developed consensus guidelines for the treatment of acne. These guidelines were evidence based when possible but also included the extensive clinical experience of this group of international dermatologists. As a result of the evaluation of available data and the experience, significant changes occurred in the management routines for acne. The greatest change arose on the basis of improved understanding of acne pathophysiology. The recommendation now is that acne treatments should be combined to target as many pathogenic factors as possible. A topical retinoid should be the foundation of treatment for most patients with acne, because retinoids target the microcomedo, the precursor to all acne lesions. Retinoids also are comedolytic and have intrinsic antiinflammatory effects, thus targeting 2 pathogenic factors in acne. Combining a topical retinoid with an antimicrobial agent targets 3 pathogenic factors, and clinical trials have shown that combination therapy results in significantly faster and greater clearing as opposed to antimicrobial therapy alone. Oral antibiotics should be used only in moderate-to-severe acne, should not be used as monotherapy, and should be discontinued as soon as possible (usually within 8–12 weeks). Because of their effect on the microcomedo, topical retinoids also are recommended as an important facet of maintenance therapy.

### Oral antibacterial therapy for acne vulgaris: an evidence-based review [^115Vfmg9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

To some degree, acne vulgaris affects nearly every individual worldwide. Oral antibiotic therapy is routinely prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne; however, long-term use of oral antibiotics for acne may have unintended consequences.

Objective

The aim of this study was to provide a systematic evaluation of the scientific evidence on the efficacy and appropriate use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of acne.

Methods

A systematic search of MEDLINE was conducted to identify randomized controlled clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses evaluating the efficacy of oral antibiotics for acne. Overall, 41 articles that examined oral antibiotics compared with placebo, another oral therapy, topical therapy, alternate dose, or duration were included in this study.

Results

Tetracyclines, macrolides, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are effective and safe in the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne. Superior efficacy of one type or class of antibiotic could not be determined, therefore the choice of antibiotic is generally based on the side-effect profile. Although different dosing regimens have been studied, there is a lack of standardized comparator trials to determine optimal dosing and duration of each oral antibiotic used in acne. The combination of oral antibiotics with a topical therapy is superior to oral antibiotics alone.

Conclusion

This article provides a systematic evaluation of the scientific evidence of the efficacy of oral antibiotics for acne. Due to heterogeneity in the design of the trials, there is insufficient evidence to support one type, dose, or duration of oral antibiotic over another in terms of efficacy; however, due to increasing resistance to antibiotics, dermatologists should heed consensus guidelines for their appropriate use.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^111kckqj]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations should reduce variation in practice, as a number of commonly used treatments showed evidence of low or no efficacy after adjusting for potential bias (e.g. some topical pharmacological monotherapies, oral antibiotic monotherapies in mild‐to‐moderate acne, hormonal contraceptives) and were thus not recommended as first‐line acne treatments. However, hormonal contraceptives were considered as options for people with acne vulgaris and PCOS, if their chosen first‐line treatment was not effective, based on available evidence specific to this population.

Further research was recommended for chemical peels, photochemical and photodynamic therapies (for which the evidence was promising but limited), for hormone‐modifying agents, e.g. metformin and spironolactone (for which no evidence was identified), and for oral isotretinoin in reduced dosage (< 0.5 mg kg −1 per day) or reduced‐dose regime (e.g. weekly or biweekly), to explore whether it is an effective, safer and better‐tolerated alternative to standard‐dose oral isotretinoin (0.5–1 mg kg −1 per day).

In conclusion, this NMA allowed evidence synthesis from a wide range of treatments for acne vulgaris stratified by severity level. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy appeared to be most effective for mild‐to‐moderate acne. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical pharmacological treatments, oral isotretinoin, and photodynamic therapy appeared to be most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Further research is warranted for chemical peels and for photochemical and photodynamic therapies for which evidence was more limited and uncertain.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^113HZAsS]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globally, affecting over 0.5 billion people. Acne can have a detrimental physical, psychological and social impact. Acne severity may be determined by clinical presentation (number and type of lesions), secondary sequelae (scarring, pigmentation), and its psychological and social impact on the patient. Uncertainty around acne treatment effectiveness may be a barrier to treatment. Various topical, oral and physical acne treatments are available, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness, especially in relation to acne severity.

Network meta‐analysis (NMA) allows simultaneous estimation of relative effects for any number of treatments, even if some have not been directly compared in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), provided that treatments create a 'network of evidence' where every treatment is linked to at least another treatment through direct comparisons.,

Two NMAs assessing the effectiveness of treatments for acne vulgaris have been published to date, both focusing on mild‐to‐moderate acne. Therefore, our study examined the relative effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments separately for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, as determined by clinician‐assessed morphological features, to identify suitable first‐line treatments.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^115a8gUu]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is very common and can have significant negative impact on people. While sometimes a transient problem, acne may persist for many years and often leads to permanent scars or pigment changes. Guidelines unanimously advise topical treatments as first-line, although differ in recommending either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid (mainly adapalene) alone or in combination. Guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advises counselling patients regarding avoidance of skin irritation when starting topical treatments and promoting adherence (treatments take 6–8 weeks to work). Oral antibiotics are currently overprescribed for acne but have a role when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment. Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are also effective and there is growing evidence for the use of spironolactone for women with persistent acne. Recent guidance from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency regarding isotretinoin has implications for specialist prescribing and monitoring, and increasing public awareness of potential risks of mental health problems and sexual dysfunction. Although acne is associated with psychiatric disorder, the mental health effects of isotretinoin remain controversial.

### Practical considerations in acne treatment and the clinical impact of topical combination therapy [^113jUK2G]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a highly prevalent, multifactorial disease process affecting the pilosebaceous units of the dermis. The effects of acne are profound both physically and psychosocially across all age groups and ethnicities; therefore, prompt recognition and appropriate treatment are critical. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches range from simple monotherapy to multimodal treatments with a variety of topical and systemic agents. Optimal patient outcomes in acne management, however, are based both on treatment efficacy as well as overall patient satisfaction. In an effort to comprehensively address these key clinical considerations in acne management, we examine the diverse nature of acne patients, the factors in optimizing treatment outcomes, and the clinical impact of current medications, particularly topical combination therapy.

### Treatments for moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113wwKFP]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple treatment options exist for the management of moderate-to-severe acne. However, the comparative effectiveness (efficacy/safety) of moderate-to-severe acne treatments has not been systematically examined.

Methods

A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials of ≥4 weeks of treatment (topical, oral, physical, or combinations) for moderate-to-severe facial acne in patients aged ≥9 years. Efficacy outcomes included: percentage of patients achieving ≥2-grade reduction from baseline and &ldquo; clear&rdquo; or &ldquo; almost clear&rdquo; for global severity score (treatment success); absolute change in inflammatory (ILs reduction); and noninflammatory lesion counts (NILs reduction). A random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted for the efficacy outcomes. Treatments were ranked with posterior rank plots and surface under cumulative ranking values.&nbsp; Results: Eighty-five studies were included in the SLR/NMA. Topical triple-agent fixed-dose combination (FDC) gel (clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/adapalene 0.15%/benzoyl peroxide 3.1%) and combinations of double-agent fixed-dose topical treatments with oral antibiotics (TOA3) consistently ranked in the top 3 treatments. Topical triple-agent FDC gel was numerically superior to TOA3 for treatment success (log-odds ratios: 1.84 [95% credible interval (CrI) 1.36 to 2.29]) and 1.69 (95% CrI: 1.01 to 2.32) vs placebo/vehicle). TOA3 was numerically superior to topical triple-agent FDC gel for reduction of ILs (mean difference: -8.21 [-10.33 to -6.13]) and -10.40 [-13.44 to -7.14] vs placebo/vehicle) and NILs (mean difference: -13.41 [-16.69 to -10.32] and -17.74 [-22.56 to -12.85] vs placebo/vehicle).

Conclusions

Based on this SLR/NMA, topical triple-agent FDC gel was the most efficacious and safe treatment for moderate-to-severe acne. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(4):&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.8148.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^115SANvA]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris (hereafter referred to as acne) is extremely common, affecting over 90% of teenagers. Among people with acne, approximately 40%–60% have acne persisting into their twenties and it leads to some degree of scarring in approximately 20% of the population. Acne can cause significant distress, decreased self-confidence and increased rates of depression and suicidal thoughts, particularly among women and people identifying as non-white.

As well as limiting quality of life, acne makes a major contribution to antibiotic use among young people: long courses of oral antibiotics are common and acne accounts for the majority of antibiotic exposure among people aged 11–21 years in England. There is high-quality evidence supporting use of topical treatments for acne, which are recommended as first line treatment for mild-to-moderate acne. However, treatment adherence is low and barriers to effective self-management include people discontinuing treatment early due to skin irritation or not seeing early treatment effects, and not differentiating between effective topical treatments and ineffective cosmetic products. Healthcare professionals need to promote treatment adherence by advising about delayed onset of action and how to avoid skin irritation. Providing information to patients is therefore crucial and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) guideline provides a list of information that should be provided for people with acne (see table 1). This may be difficult to cover in brief consultations, highlighting the need for signposting patients towards evidence-based resources, such as those listed in box 1.

Importance

Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit of the skin that primarily involves the face and trunk and affects approximately 9% of the population worldwide (approximately 85% of individuals aged 12–24 years, and approximately 50% of patients aged 20–29 years). Acne vulgaris can cause permanent physical scarring, negatively affect quality of life and self-image, and has been associated with increased rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.

Observations

Acne vulgaris is classified based on patient age, lesion morphology (comedonal, inflammatory, mixed, nodulocystic), distribution (location on face, trunk, or both), and severity (extent, presence or absence of scarring, postinflammatory erythema, or hyperpigmentation). Although most acne does not require specific medical evaluation, medical workup is sometimes warranted. Topical therapies such as retinoids (eg, tretinoin, adapalene), benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and/or combinations of topical agents are first-line treatments. When prescribed as a single therapy in a randomized trial of 207 patients, treatment with tretinoin 0.025% gel reduced acne lesion counts at 12 weeks by 63% compared with baseline. Combinations of topical agents with systemic agents (oral antibiotics such as doxycycline and minocycline, hormonal therapies such as combination oral contraception [COC] or spironolactone, or isotretinoin) are recommended for more severe disease. In a meta-analysis of 32 randomized clinical trials, COC was associated with reductions in inflammatory lesions by 62%, placebo was associated with a 26% reduction, and oral antibiotics were associated with a 58% reduction at 6-month follow-up. Isotretinoin is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne but is often used to treat resistant or persistent moderate to severe acne, as well as acne that produces scarring or significant psychosocial distress.

Conclusions and Relevance

Acne vulgaris affects approximately 9% of the population worldwide and approximately 85% of those aged 12 to 24 years. First-line therapies are topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, or combinations of topicals. For more severe disease, oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or minocycline, hormonal therapies such as combination oral conceptive agents or spironolactone, or isotretinoin are most effective.

### Management of severe acne vulgaris with topical therapy [^115pSDMt]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris (acne) is the most common skin disease we see in dermatology practice. Although rare in childhood, severe acne can affect up to 12% of the adolescent population. A chronic disease, it requires both aggressive management and effective maintenance strategies. Oral antibiotics, in combination with topical agents are recommended for treatment, with topical agents being continued as maintenance therapy to minimize resistance and recurrence. However, concerns with systemic side effects have recently resulted in a greater focus on the potential of fixed combination topical therapies to treat severe acne. Here we review the available clinical evidence. There are no studies investigating the use of fixed combination topical therapy exclusively in severe acne. However, studies assessing the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne include subpopulation data in severe patients. Adapalene 0.3%-benzoyl peroxide (BP) 2.5% was found to be effective in patients with severe acne, whereas the fixed combination with a lower concentration of adapalene (0.1%) was no more effective than vehicle. Clindamycin-BP 1.2%/3.75% gel and clindamycin-BP 1.2%/2.5% gel were both found to be effective in severe acne with an apparent BP-dose response. Clindamycin phosphate 1.2%-tretinoin 0.025% demonstrated similar efficacy in severe acne, but with little benefit over individual monads. Realistic topical treatment options now exist for the management of severe acne where patient and physician preference can impact positive outcomes. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(11):1134–1138. </em>.

### Moderate and severe inflammatory acne vulgaris effectively treated with single-agent therapy by a new fixed-dose combination adapalene 0.3% / benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel: a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled study [^115WGumd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Indeed, 0.3% A/BPO may fill a gap as a single-agent treatment for moderate to severe inflammatory acne. Pediatric guidelines recommend that an oral antibiotic be started concomitantly with topical combination therapy (i.e. topical retinoid and BPO) promptly to prevent scarring in severe acne, when there is evidence of scarring even in moderate acne, or as a step-up regimen if initial therapeutic response with topical therapy is not adequate. European guidance suggests that for moderate acne, an oral antibiotic should be initiated upon the presentation of more widespread disease. Therefore, 0.3% A/BPO may be able to substitute antibiotics in the interest of minimizing antibiotic resistance in cases where the addition of systemic antibiotic therapy is considered, particularly as its mechanism of action includes prevention of microcomedone formation. International guidelines for acne management stipulate that oral isotretinoin remains the gold standard for severe acne treatment. Recent guidance for the pediatric population suggests that oral isotretinoin is no longer indicated as first-line treatment, but instead only after inadequate response with initial treatment using combination therapy (topical treatment associated with oral antibiotic). Therefore, 0.3% A/BPO may be an appropriate treatment, alone or in combination with other therapies, prior to the potential need for step-up treatment to oral isotretinoin, or while enrolling the patient in the required programs to obtain access to oral isotretinoin. Furthermore, 0.3% A/BPO may be seen as a replacement for existing topical combination therapies used with oral antibiotics in not only moderate acne but also in severe inflammatory non-nodulocystic acne (although, perhaps not exclusively).

### Acne vulgaris: diagnosis and treatment [^112sqJw4]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most prevalent chronic skin disease in the United States, affecting nearly 50 million people per year, mostly adolescents and young adults. Potential sequelae of acne, such as scarring, dyspigmentation, and low self-esteem, may result in significant morbidity. Typical acne lesions involve the pilosebaceous follicles and the interrelated processes of sebum production, Cutibacterium acnes (previously called Propionibacterium acnes) colonization, and inflammation. Acne may be classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the number and type of skin lesions. Multiple treatment agents and formulations are available, with each agent targeting a specific area within acne pathogenesis. Treatment selection is based on disease severity, patient preference, and tolerability. Topical retinoids are indicated for acne of any severity and for maintenance therapy. Systemic and topical antibiotics should be used only in combination with benzoyl peroxide and retinoids and for a maximum of 12 weeks. Isotretinoin is used for severe, recalcitrant acne. Because of the risk of teratogenicity, patients, pharmacists, and prescribers must register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated risk management program, iPledge, before implementing isotretinoin therapy. There is limited evidence for physical modalities (e.g., laser therapy, light therapy, chemical peels) and complementary therapies (e.g., purified bee venom, low-glycemic-load diet, tea tree oil); therefore, further study is required.

Clinical features and diagnosis

The diagnosis of acne is made on the clinical history and examination. There are no diagnostic criteria and the skin lesions seen are open comedones (whiteheads), closed comedones (blackheads), papules/nodules, cysts and scarring. There is no strong evidence base for different treatments for different acne subtypes (comedonal vs inflammatory), and NICE and most other guidelines provide different guidance on the basis of severity rather than acne subtypes. While classifications vary, the majority of acne is mild, with moderate or severe acne combined making up less than 15% of cases of acne. See table 2 for severity classifications and linked treatment choices.

### Therapeutic update: acne [^112MYvUh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a multi-factorial disease affecting a significant proportion of the population. A patient-centered approach is most effective for the treatment of acne, focusing both on life style interventions as well as pharmacologic therapy. Lifestyle modifications include dietary counseling, as a link between dietary choices and acne continues to grow. Pharmacologic regimens must account for the severity of disease, emergence of resistant bacterial strains and ease of patient compliance. Combination topical therapy is often required for patients with mixed inflammatory and comedonal acne, while oral medications are frequently needed for severe cases or those involving large surface areas such as the chest or back. With or without a photosensitizer, light based treatments present an alternative or adjuvant to traditional pharmacologic therapy. Novel formulations of existing medications in addition to original compounds continue in development, expanding therapeutic possibilities for the future. With the emergence of antibiotic resistance, we are forced to prescribe antibiotics more responsibly, while exploring alternatives to this longstanding standard of care. This article discusses current and emerging therapies for the treatment of acne.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^1148gW8P]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Assessment of model fit, inconsistency and bias

Model fit statistics suggested that there was insufficient information to differentiate effects across treatments within each class, therefore fixed class effects models were used across analyses (i.e. all treatments within each class were assumed to have equal effects). The selected study‐specific treatment effects models (fixed or random) for each analysis are reported in Appendix S11 (see Supporting Information). Although there were no meaningful differences between the selected consistency and inconsistency models (Appendix S11), some evidence of local‐level inconsistency was identified across all analyses (Appendix S12; see Supporting Information).

Of the 112 RCTs for mild‐to‐moderate acne, 52 were at high overall risk of bias, and for 60 RCTs there were some concerns about bias. Of the 67 RCTs for moderate‐to‐severe acne, 36 RCTs were at high overall risk of bias, and for 31 RCTs there were some concerns about bias (Appendix S13; see Supporting Information). Overall, the quality of included RCTs was judged to be moderate to very low.

Evidence of bias was identified in the following analyses (Appendix S14; see Supporting Information):
Mild‐to‐moderate acne, efficacy (%CFB): evidence of small‐study bias
Moderate‐to‐severe acne, discontinuation owing to side‐effects: evidence of bias in Domain 4 of the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool [outcome measurement (efficacy)].

Thus, for these two analyses we considered results from bias‐adjusted models.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^114HRmY5]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition that may cause psychosocial distress. There is evidence that topical treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) are effective for mild-to-moderate acne, while topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy are most effective for moderate-to-severe acne. Effective treatments have varying costs. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England considers cost-effectiveness when producing national clinical, public health and social care guidance.

Aim

To assess the cost-effectiveness of treatments for mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe acne to inform relevant NICE guidance.

Methods

A decision-analytical model compared costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of effective topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe acne, from the perspective of the National Health Service in England. Effectiveness data were derived from a network meta-analysis. Other model input parameters were based on published sources, supplemented by expert opinion.

Results

All of the assessed treatments were more cost-effective than treatment with placebo (general practitioner visits without active treatment). For mild-to-moderate acne, topical treatment combinations and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) were most cost-effective. For moderate-to-severe acne, topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, and oral isotretinoin were the most cost-effective. Results showed uncertainty, as reflected in the wide confidence intervals around mean treatment rankings.

Conclusion

A range of treatments are cost-effective for the management of acne. Well-conducted studies are needed to examine the long-term clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the full range of acne treatments.

Key Points for Practice
- First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications including topical antibiotics.
- Tetracyclines are the preferred oral antibiotic, and doxycycline and minocycline have been shown to be more effective than tetracycline. First-line and Alternative Treatment Options First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications consisting of benzoyl peroxide and an antibiotic, retinoid, or both. An alternative treatment would include the addition of a topical retinoid or benzoyl peroxide if not already prescribed; a different retinoid; or topical dapsone.

First-line treatment for moderate acne vulgaris includes a combination of benzoyl peroxide and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both; benzoyl peroxide, an oral antibiotic, and topical retinoid; or benzoyl peroxide, oral and topical antibiotics, and a topical retinoid. Alternative treatments to be considered include a different combination of medications; changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or oral isotretinoin. First-line treatment for severe acne vulgaris includes an oral antibiotic, benzoyl peroxide, and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both. Oral isotretinoin can also be considered as a first-line option. Alternative treatment options to consider include changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or starting oral isotretinoin.

Inflammatory acne can be treated with topical dapsone 5% gel, especially in women. Azelaic acid can be used to manage dyspigmentation that occurs with inflammatory acne. For acne in children who have not reached adolescence, topical adapalene, tretinoin, and benzoyl peroxide are safe to use. In the short term, adding an oral corticosteroid when initiating the usual acne therapy in persons with severe inflammatory acne can be beneficial. Low-dose oral corticosteroids are recommended for persons with adrenal hyperandrogenism.

### South-east Asia study alliance guidelines on the management of acne vulgaris in south-east Asian patients [^116t5ATM]. The Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The management of acne in South-East Asia is unique, as Asian skin and local variables require a clinical approach unlike that utilized in other parts of the world. There are different treatment guidelines per country in the region, and a group of leading dermatologists from these countries convened to review these guidelines, discuss current practices and recent advances, and formulate consensus guidelines to harmonize the management of acne vulgaris in the region. Emphasis has been placed on formulating recommendations to impede the development of antibiotic resistance in Propionibacterium acnes. The group adopted the Acne Consensus Conference system for grading acne severity. The group recommends that patients may be treated with topical medications including retinoids, benzoyl peroxide (BPO), salicylic acid, a combination of retinoid and BPO, or a combination of retinoids and BPO with or without antibiotics for mild acne; topical retinoid with topical BPO and a oral antibiotic for moderate acne; and oral isotretinoin if the patient fails first-line treatment (a 6- or 8-week trial of combined oral antibiotics and topical retinoids with BPO) for severe acne. Maintenance acne treatment using topical retinoids with or without BPO is recommended. To prevent the development of antibiotic resistance, topical antibiotics should not be used as monotherapy or used simultaneously with oral antibiotics. Skin care, comprised of cleansing, moisturizing and sun protection, is likewise recommended. Patient education and good communication is recommended to improve adherence, and advice should be given about the characteristics of the skin care products patients should use.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^1162UVfh]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris commonly affects adults, adolescents, and preadolescents aged 9 years or older.

Objective

The objective of this study was to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of acne.

Methods

A work group conducted a systematic review and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and formulating and grading recommendations.

Results

This guideline presents 18 evidence-based recommendations and 5 good practice statements. Strong recommendations are made for benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, topical antibiotics, and oral doxycycline. Oral isotretinoin is strongly recommended for acne that is severe, causing psychosocial burden or scarring, or failing standard oral or topical therapy. Conditional recommendations are made for topical clascoterone, salicylic acid, and azelaic acid, as well as for oral minocycline, sarecycline, combined oral contraceptive pills, and spironolactone. Combining topical therapies with multiple mechanisms of action, limiting systemic antibiotic use, combining systemic antibiotics with topical therapies, and adding intralesional corticosteroid injections for larger acne lesions are recommended as good practice statements.

Limitations

Analysis is based on the best available evidence at the time of the systematic review.

Conclusions

These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of acne vulgaris.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^111r6sup]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Various treatments for acne vulgaris exist, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness in relation to acne severity.

Objectives

To identify best treatments for mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe acne, as determined by clinician-assessed morphological features.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe acne, published up to May 2020. Outcomes included percentage change in total lesion count from baseline, treatment discontinuation for any reason, and discontinuation owing to side-effects. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and bias adjustment models. Effects for treatments with ≥ 50 observations each compared with placebo are reported below.

Results

We included 179 RCTs with approximately 35000 observations across 49 treatment classes. For mild-to-moderate acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological - combined retinoid with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) [mean difference 26.16%, 95% credible interval (CrI) 16.75–35.36%]; physical - chemical peels, e.g. salicylic or mandelic acid (39.70%, 95% CrI 12.54–66.78%) and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) (35.36%, 95% CrI 17.75–53.08%). Oral pharmacological treatments (e.g. antibiotics, hormonal contraceptives) did not appear to be effective after bias adjustment. BPO and topical retinoids were less well tolerated than placebo. For moderate-to-severe acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological - combined retinoid with lincosamide (clindamycin) (44.43%, 95% CrI 29.20–60.02%); oral pharmacological - isotretinoin of total cumulative dose ≥ 120 mg kg⁻¹ per single course (58.09%, 95% CrI 36.99–79.29%); physical - photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) (40.45%, 95% CrI 26.17–54.11%); combined - BPO with topical retinoid and oral tetracycline (43.53%, 95% CrI 29.49–57.70%). Topical retinoids and oral tetracyclines were less well tolerated than placebo. The quality of included RCTs was moderate to very low, with evidence of inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence. Uncertainty in findings was high, in particular for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy. However, conclusions were robust to potential bias in the evidence.

Conclusions

Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy were most effective for mild-to-moderate acne. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical pharmacological treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy were most effective for moderate-to-severe acne. Further research is warranted for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy for which evidence was more limited. What is already known about this topic? Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globally. Several topical, oral, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris exist. Network meta-analysis (NMA) synthesizes direct and indirect evidence and allows simultaneous inference for all treatments forming an evidence network. Previous NMAs have assessed a limited range of treatments for acne vulgaris and have not evaluated effectiveness of treatments for moderate-to-severe acne. What does this study add? For mild-to-moderate acne, topical treatment combinations, chemical peels, and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light; blue light) are most effective. For moderate-to-severe acne, topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) are most effective. Based on these findings, along with further clinical and cost-effectiveness considerations, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends, as first-line treatments, fixed topical treatment combinations for mild-to-moderate acne and fixed topical treatment combinations, or oral tetracyclines combined with topical treatments, for moderate-to-severe acne.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^113zmRRv]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

All analyses showed some inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence, possibly reflecting heterogeneity in populations (e.g. regarding age or definition of acne severity), treatments (e.g. regarding treatment regime), or study design (e.g. parallel vs. split‐face) across RCTs included in the NMAs. There was insufficient evidence to explore age as a potential effect modifier. We did not identify any imbalance in the study samples' age ranges in RCTs of moderate‐to‐severe acne, but some variation was observed in RCTs of mild‐to‐moderate acne and this may have affected the estimates for this population. To analyse discontinuation outcomes we used a continuity correction for studies with zero events in some – but not all – arms that performs well with 1: 1 randomization, which was the case in the majority of studies; however, there may be a small bias for the few studies that were unbalanced. Our findings were based on evidence from RCTs of moderate to very low quality and were overall characterized by uncertainty. Results for some types of treatments (chemical peels, photochemical and photodynamic therapies) were based on rather limited evidence and informed through limited network connections. Nevertheless, threshold analysis on the efficacy outcome supported the robustness of our conclusions. For discontinuation outcomes, results suggested similar effects across the vast majority of treatment classes with largely overlapping 95% CrIs, suggesting a high degree of uncertainty in the optimal intervention. Therefore threshold analysis was not considered informative and was thus not attempted for discontinuation outcomes.

NMA results were interpreted in light of further clinical considerations when formulating recommendations, including practicality in use of fixed topical treatment combinations relative to nonfixed combinations, concerns about antibiotic resistance relating to antibiotic monotherapies, current regulations and safety concerns regarding oral isotretinoin, limited availability and use of physical treatments and topical antifungals for acne management in the British National Health Service, and concerns about the long‐term harms of chemical peel use outside of specialist settings (e.g. risk for significant skin damage from inappropriate strength or type of peel). Despite its more limited evidence base, azelaic acid combined with an oral tetracycline was considered a good alternative for people with moderate‐to‐severe acne who have irritation to topical retinoids; moreover, azelaic acid has a possible effect in reducing the risk of hyperpigmentation in people with darker skin and acne.

### Oral antibiotics for acne [^116b7tvs]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral antibiotics are integral for treating inflammatory acne based on what is understood about the pathogenesis as well as the role of Cutibacterium acnes. However, rising concerns of antibiotic resistance and the perception of "antibiotic phobia" create potential limitations on their integration in an acne treatment regimen. When prescribing oral antibiotics, dermatologists need to consider dosage, duration, and frequency, and to avoid their use as monotherapy. These considerations are important, along with the use of newer strategies and compounds, to reduce adverse-event profiles, antibiotic resistance, and to optimize outcomes. Aside from concomitant medications, allergies, and disease severity, costs and patient demographics can influence variability in prescribing plans. There are multiple published guidelines and consensus statements for the USA and Europe to promote safe antibiotic use by dermatologists. However, there is a lack of head-to-head studies and evidence for comparative superiority of any individual antibiotic, as well as any evidence to support the use of agents other than tetracyclines. Although oral antibiotics are one of the main options for moderate to severe acne, non-antibiotic therapy such as isotretinoin and hormonal therapies should be considered. As newer therapies and more outcomes data emerge, so will improved management of antibiotic therapy to foster patient safety.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^111u9x2K]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

A strength of our review and NMA was the inclusion of a wide range of acne treatments and, subsequently, a much larger number of RCTs (112 for mild‐to‐moderate and 67 for moderate‐to‐severe acne) than either of the two previously published NMAs. Furthermore, our NMA assessed treatments for moderate‐to‐severe acne. The NMA results informed national clinical guidance. Our methodology enabled evidence synthesis from direct and indirect treatment comparisons and allowed simultaneous inference on all treatments. Our NMA employed class models to gain precision on the effects of treatments within the same class and to connect networks disconnected at the treatment level, thus allowing consideration of a wider evidence base. We measured efficacy using the percentage change in total acne lesion count from baseline, as this is commonly reported across RCTs or can often be estimated using other available data, which allowed inclusion of a large evidence base in the respective analyses. Another validated efficacy measure, the Investigator Global Assessment scale, recommended by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the assessment of effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of acne vulgaris, was used by fewer studies in our dataset; therefore, had we selected this outcome to measure efficacy, we would have limited our evidence base.

Dietary interventions (e.g. milk‐free diet, low glycaemic load diet), which may have an effect on acne vulgaris and its response to treatment, were not included in this review but were assessed in another review conducted to inform the NICE guideline. Although we searched for treatments for acne vulgaris at any body site, the majority of the RCTs included in our review focused on facial acne. This is a limitation of the evidence base and not of the review per se. Another potential limitation of our review was its focus on evidence published in the English language, following NICE guidance. On the other hand, evidence suggests that use of language restrictions in systematic review‐based meta‐analyses in conventional medicine does not introduce systematic bias. Furthermore, as the purpose of our NMA was to inform national guidance in England, we focused on pharmacological treatments that are available in the UK. This resulted in the exclusion of a number of potentially effective drug treatments for acne from the NMA, as they were not licensed in the UK at the time of the analysis (e.g. topical dapsone, topical tetracyclines). Final searches for evidence were conducted in May 2020, and it is possible that new evidence (and new treatments) have emerged since.

Key Points for Practice
- First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications including topical antibiotics.
- Tetracyclines are the preferred oral antibiotic, and doxycycline and minocycline have been shown to be more effective than tetracycline. First-line and Alternative Treatment Options First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications consisting of benzoyl peroxide and an antibiotic, retinoid, or both. An alternative treatment would include the addition of a topical retinoid or benzoyl peroxide if not already prescribed; a different retinoid; or topical dapsone.

First-line treatment for moderate acne vulgaris includes a combination of benzoyl peroxide and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both; benzoyl peroxide, an oral antibiotic, and topical retinoid; or benzoyl peroxide, oral and topical antibiotics, and a topical retinoid. Alternative treatments to be considered include a different combination of medications; changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or oral isotretinoin. First-line treatment for severe acne vulgaris includes an oral antibiotic, benzoyl peroxide, and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both. Oral isotretinoin can also be considered as a first-line option. Alternative treatment options to consider include changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or starting oral isotretinoin.

Inflammatory acne can be treated with topical dapsone 5% gel, especially in women. Azelaic acid can be used to manage dyspigmentation that occurs with inflammatory acne. For acne in children who have not reached adolescence, topical adapalene, tretinoin, and benzoyl peroxide are safe to use. ROLE OF DIET Specific changes in diet are not recommended to treat acne, but developing information indicates that acne may be related to a high glycemic index and limited data indicate that some dairy, especially skim milk, can worsen acne. There is insufficient evidence to endorse recommendations related to antioxidants, probiotics, and fish oil.

KEY POINTS FOR PRACTICE
- Topical benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid, alone or in combination with a topical antibiotic, is effective treatment.
- For moderate to severe acne, oral doxycycline is recommended. Systemic antibiotics should not be used as monotherapy and should be combined with topical benzoyl peroxide and other topical drugs.
- Oral isotretinoin is strongly recommended for severe, scarring, or refractory acne or failure of other treatment.
- Intralesional corticosteroid injections should be considered for larger acne lesions, rapid resolution, or to minimize scarring. From the AFP Editors Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory condition of pilosebaceous units of the skin affecting more than 50 million people in the United States, including 85% of adolescents. Risk factors include adolescent age, family history of acne, and oily skin type. The American Academy of Dermatology released updated guidelines for the management of acne.

### Recent advances in acne pathogenesis: implications for therapy [^114pLNGA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Acne pathogenesis is a multifactorial process that occurs at the level of the pilosebaceous unit. While acne was previously perceived as an infectious disease, recent data have clarified it as an inflammatory process in which Propionibacterium acnes and innate immunity play critical roles in propagating abnormal hyperkeratinization and inflammation. Alterations in sebum composition, and increased sensitivity to androgens, also play roles in the inflammatory process. A stepwise approach to acne management utilizes topical agents for mild to moderate acne (topical retinoid as mainstay ± topical antibiotics) and escalation to oral agents for more resistant cases (oral antibiotics or hormonal agents in conjunction with a topical retinoid or oral isotretinoin alone for severe acne). Concerns over antibiotic resistance and the safety issues associated with isotretinoin have prompted further research into alternative medications and devices for the treatment of acne. Radiofrequency, laser, and light treatments have demonstrated modest improvement for inflammatory acne (with blue-light photodynamic therapy being the only US FDA-approved treatment). However, limitations in study design and patient follow-up render these modalities as adjuncts rather than standalone options. This review will update readers on the latest advancements in our understanding of acne pathogenesis and treatment, with emphasis on emerging treatment options that can help improve patient outcomes.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^116WCbmE]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The analyses presented here informed national guidance for the management of acne vulgaris in England, published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), who worked with the British Association of Dermatologists for this purpose. The guideline was developed by a committee of academics, health professionals and service users with expertise and experience in acne vulgaris.

Search strategy

Searches for RCTs of treatments for acne vulgaris were conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) from inception, using relevant medical subject headings, free‐text terms and study‐type filters where appropriate. The search was undertaken in August 2019 and reruns were performed in May 2020 (Appendix S1; see Supporting Information).

Selection criteria for the systematic review and the network meta‐analysis

A systematic review of RCTs of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne vulgaris was undertaken according to PRISMA guidelines. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020154100) and is provided in full in Appendix S2 (see Supporting Information).

The review included people with acne vulgaris of all ages (except neonatal acne) and severity levels. Populations with postinflammatory dyspigmentation, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), refractory acne or receiving maintenance treatment were excluded. Separate analyses were conducted for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne. Reported severity levels in each study were used for study categorization into mild‐to‐moderate or moderate‐to‐severe acne. Based on the committee's expert advice, if severity was unclear or reported as 'moderate', the study was categorized as mild‐to‐moderate acne if each participant had only noninflammatory lesions, or < 35 inflammatory lesions, or if the average number of inflammatory lesions per study participant was ≤ 30, whereas the study was categorized as moderate‐to‐severe acne if each participant had ≥ 3 nodules (regardless of the number of other inflammatory lesions), or ≥ 35 inflammatory lesions, or if the average number of inflammatory lesions per study participant was ≥ 40. If this information could not be obtained or the mean number of inflammatory lesions per study participant was 31–39, the study was excluded from the review.

Methods

Population

The study population comprised people with mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne presenting to primary care services. Separate analyses were conducted for males and females with moderate‐to‐severe acne because (i) the intervention cost of oral isotretinoin is higher for females due to pregnancy tests and increased monitoring visits, and (ii) sex‐specific discontinuation data were available for moderate‐to‐severe acne.

Interventions

We included treatment classes showing evidence of efficacy vs. placebo [indicated by 95% credible intervals (CrI) around the effects not crossing the 'no effect' line] in the NMA that informed the NICE guideline (the source NMA). We considered only treatment classes with ≥ 50 observations across randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in the efficacy NMA, as this was deemed the minimum adequate evidence base to enable robust conclusions on clinical and cost‐effectiveness.

One intervention from each treatment class was selected as representative for costing purposes. All interventions were assumed to be delivered within the NHS. Selection of interventions assessed in the economic analysis (Table 1) was based on their availability and usage in the UK, practicalities of use (e.g. fixed topical treatment combinations were preferred to nonfixed formulations), the size of their evidence base and their risk of side effects relative to other interventions within the class.

Table 1
Types of treatment, classes and interventions assessed in the economic analysis for each level of acne severity.

Economic model structure

A decision tree was constructed to estimate total NHS costs and quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) for each treatment over 1 year (Fig. 1). This time horizon, determined by the available follow‐up data, was deemed adequate to capture longer‐term outcomes and costs of acne treatment without significant extrapolation. Patients were modelled as having excellent, good, moderate or no perceived improvement following treatment (Supplementary Data S1 provides full details of the model).

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^113ZdjTj]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — systemic antibiotic recommendations — Systemic antibiotics are recommended in the management of moderate and severe acne and forms of inflammatory acne that are resistant to topical treatments. Doxycycline and minocycline are more effective than tetracycline, but neither is superior to each other. Although oral erythromycin and azithromycin can be effective in treating acne, its use should be limited to those who cannot use the tetracyclines (ie, pregnant women or children < 8 years of age), and erythromycin use should be restricted because of its increased risk of bacterial resistance. Use of systemic antibiotics, other than the tetracyclines and macrolides, is discouraged; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim use should be restricted to patients who are unable to tolerate tetracyclines or in treatment-resistant patients. Systemic antibiotic use should be limited to the shortest possible duration. Re-evaluate at 3–4 months to minimize the development of bacterial resistance, and monotherapy with systemic antibiotics is not recommended. Concomitant topical therapy with benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid should be used with systemic antibiotics and for maintenance after completion of systemic antibiotic therapy.

### Moderate and severe inflammatory acne vulgaris effectively treated with single-agent therapy by a new fixed-dose combination adapalene 0.3% / benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel: a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled study [^113erMje]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A need exists for topical treatments in managing more severe inflammatory acne.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adapalene 0.3%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5% (0.3% A/BPO) topical gel in subjects with moderate and severe inflammatory acne.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. Randomization was stratified by acne severity (50% moderate and 50% severe). Subjects received 0.3% A/BPO, 0.1% A/BPO (benchmark), or vehicle (comparator) once daily for 12 weeks. Co-primary efficacy endpoints were success rate at week 12 (the percentage of subjects rated 'clear' or 'almost clear' with at least a 2-grade improvement on Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA]) and change in inflammatory (IN) and noninflammatory (NIN) lesion counts from baseline to week 12. Secondary efficacy endpoints were percent changes in IN and NIN lesion counts. Safety endpoints were incidence of adverse events (AEs) and local tolerability signs/symptoms.

Results

A total of 503 subjects were randomized: 217, 217, and 69 subjects in the 0.3% A/BPO, 0.1% A/BPO, and vehicle groups, respectively. For success rate (subjects rated 'clear' or 'almost clear' with ≥ 2-grade improvement in IGA), 0.3% A/BPO was superior to vehicle, with a treatment difference of 22.7% (33.7 vs. 11.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.8–32.6, p < 0.001). At week 12, 0.3% A/BPO was superior to vehicle for mean reduction from baseline in IN (27.0 vs. 14.4) and NIN lesion counts (40.2 vs. 18.5), as well as for percentage reduction from baseline in IN (68.7 vs. 39.2%) and NIN lesion counts (68.3 vs. 37.4%) (all p < 0.001). Among subjects with severe inflammatory acne (IGA = 4), 0.1% A/BPO did not reach statistical significance for success rate compared with vehicle (p = 0.443), whereas 0.3% A/BPO demonstrated significantly greater efficacy (p = 0.029, requiring ≥ 3-point IGA improvement). Additionally, 0.3% A/BPO was safe and well-tolerated.

Conclusions

Results of this clinical trial demonstrate the significantly greater efficacy of adapalene 0.3% A/BPO topical gel compared with vehicle as well as a good safety profile in the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory non-nodulocystic acne, which increases patients' treatment options.

### Moderate and severe inflammatory acne vulgaris effectively treated with single-agent therapy by a new fixed-dose combination adapalene 0.3% / benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel: a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled study [^112ZcqgA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acne represents a substantial disease burden, and thus effective treatment is crucial. The Global Burden of Disease study covering 187 countries found acne to be among the top ten most prevalent diseases worldwide in 2010, and skin conditions were one of the top causes of years lived with disability. There is growing evidence that acne negatively affects quality of life. Early, effective treatment of acne is essential and is important to avoid later complications, including scarring and psychosocial issues.

A need exists for topical treatments in the management of patients with more severe inflammatory acne. A variety of topical therapies already exist for the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris, and a variety of treatments are used in combination. The efficacy and safety of adapalene 0.1% gel has been demonstrated in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A higher concentration of the formulation, adapalene 0.3% gel, expanded treatment options and, in phase III studies, demonstrated superior efficacy and a safety profile similar to that of adapalene 0.1% gel and its vehicle. Its long-term safety and efficacy have been shown over 12 months. Moreover, noninferior efficacy and superior tolerability were found compared with tazarotene 0.1% gel.

The rationale for combination therapy with a topical retinoid and antimicrobial agent is well-documented, particularly for adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide (BPO) 2.5% fixed-dose combination gel (hereafter, 0.1% A/BPO, Epiduo ®, Galderma Laboratories, LP, Fort Worth, TX, USA), in the interests of limiting antibiotic resistance and simplifying therapy by targeting several etiopathogenic factors of acne. BPO is the gold standard bactericidal agent and is not associated with antibiotic resistance. Adapalene exerts comedolytic, anti-comedogenic effects (the microcomedo being the precursor lesion targeted by retinoids), and demonstrates anti-inflammatory properties in both in vitro and in vivo research as well as clinical studies. Moreover, adapalene has been found to down-regulate the expression of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2), a receptor involved in the pathogenesis of acne lesions through Propionibacterium acnes -mediated activation, which subsequently induces proinflammatory cytokines.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^114iXepC]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Various treatments for acne vulgaris exist, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness in relation to acne severity.

Objectives

To identify best treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, as determined by clinician‐assessed morphological features.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review and network meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, published up to May 2020. Outcomes included percentage change in total lesion count from baseline, treatment discontinuation for any reason, and discontinuation owing to side‐effects. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool and bias adjustment models. Effects for treatments with ≥ 50 observations each compared with placebo are reported below.

Results

We included 179 RCTs with approximately 35 000 observations across 49 treatment classes. For mild‐to‐moderate acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological – combined retinoid with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) [mean difference 26.16%, 95% credible interval (CrI) 16.75–35.36%]; physical – chemical peels, e.g. salicylic or mandelic acid (39.70%, 95% CrI 12.54–66.78%) and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) (35.36%, 95% CrI 17.75–53.08%). Oral pharmacological treatments (e.g. antibiotics, hormonal contraceptives) did not appear to be effective after bias adjustment. BPO and topical retinoids were less well tolerated than placebo. For moderate‐to‐severe acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological – combined retinoid with lincosamide (clindamycin) (44.43%, 95% CrI 29.20–60.02%); oral pharmacological – isotretinoin of total cumulative dose ≥ 120 mg kg⁻¹ per single course (58.09%, 95% CrI 36.99–79.29%); physical – photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) (40.45%, 95% CrI 26.17–54.11%); combined – BPO with topical retinoid and oral tetracycline (43.53%, 95% CrI 29.49–57.70%). Topical retinoids and oral tetracyclines were less well tolerated than placebo. The quality of included RCTs was moderate to very low, with evidence of inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence. Uncertainty in findings was high, in particular for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy. However, conclusions were robust to potential bias in the evidence.

Conclusions

Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy were most effective for mild‐to‐moderate acne. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical pharmacological treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy were most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Further research is warranted for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy for which evidence was more limited.

What is already known about this topic?
Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globally.
Several topical, oral, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris exist.
Network meta‐analysis (NMA) synthesizes direct and indirect evidence and allows simultaneous inference for all treatments forming an evidence network.
Previous NMAs have assessed a limited range of treatments for acne vulgaris and have not evaluated effectiveness of treatments for moderate‐to‐severe acne.

What does this study add?
For mild‐to‐moderate acne, topical treatment combinations, chemical peels, and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light; blue light) are most effective.
For moderate‐to‐severe acne, topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) are most effective.
Based on these findings, along with further clinical and cost‐effectiveness considerations, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends, as first‐line treatments, fixed topical treatment combinations for mild‐to‐moderate acne and fixed topical treatment combinations, or oral tetracyclines combined with topical treatments, for moderate‐to‐severe acne.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^11722LS1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Early effective treatment for acne improves patient well-being and may prevent permanent scars or pigment changes. Initial management includes a range of topical treatments, with the option of adding oral antibiotics for patients with more severe acne. There are significant opportunities for reducing oral antibiotic prescribing in acne. These include: promoting effective use of topical treatments; avoiding prolonged courses of oral antibiotics; coprescribing topical treatments alongside oral antibiotics; continuing topical treatments as maintenance treatment and considering alternatives, such as the combined contraceptive pill and spironolactone in primary care. When acne is unresponsive to these measures, timely referral for consideration of isotretinoin should be initiated.

### Management of acne vulgaris: an evidence-based update [^114f59ic]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

This review summarizes clinically important findings from 3 systematic reviews, 1 updated guideline and a selection from the 62 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between February 2007 and January 2009 on the topic of acne vulgaris. Low glycaemic-load diets might reduce acne severity but this remains unproven. Written patient information leaflets have not been surpassed by other communication methods. New combination topical treatments have not shown convincing advantages over current combination products such as clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide. Topical dapsone is superior to placebo but has yet to be compared with standard topical treatments. Long-term topical tretinoin to prevent nonmelanoma skin cancer in elderly men was associated with higher all-cause mortality, but there is currently no evidence of increased mortality for topical retinoid use when treating acne. All oral tetracyclines have similar efficacy, yet minocycline is the most costly. Oral isotretinoin monotherapy remains the gold-standard treatment for severe acne. Flutamide plus the oral contraceptive pill is beneficial for acne associated with polycystic ovary syndrome. Photodynamic therapy, phototherapy and laser therapy cannot be recommended universally for acne until minimal postinflammatory pigmentation and longer-term benefit can be shown, especially with current high costs. Development of non-antibiotic therapies is preferable to minimize the risk of community antibiotic resistance. Future trials should use active comparators at optimum doses and avoid noninferiority comparisons unless appropriately powered. Trials need to shift from using multiple, unvalidated outcome measures to including patient-reported and quality-of-life outcomes, and all trials should be registered on a public clinical-trials database.

Acne is a very common skin disease; frequently seen in adolescents and often persisting or occurring into adulthood. Topical therapy is very effective in mild to moderate disease, and is used as maintenance therapy. Fixed combination products have been studied in moderately severe disease. Combinations of benzoyl peroxide and either clindamycin or adapalene appear very effective. When utilizing a topical retinoid alone or in combination, it is essential to incorporate an appropriate skin care regimen to minimize local irritation. In the absence of direct comparative clinical trials, this review provides timely guidance for clinicians on the use of these agents, and their benefits in special populations.

### Making the case for early treatment of acne [^116LMfvF]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Early acne can be defined as the occurrence of acne at its onset, primarily in preteens, or as acne at its earliest severity (ie, mild to moderate). Although the majority of patients with acne are treated by dermatologists, most, particularly mild to moderate cases, could be successfully managed by primary care physicians. Therefore, it is important for physicians to understand the benefits of treating all types of acne, not just the most severe. Awareness of the emotional impact of acne, particularly in adolescence, as well as recognition of possible scarring are important considerations. To achieve optimal results, physicians should be familiar with classification and severity grading of acne. Also, in-depth knowledge of available acne medications will streamline and optimize treatment regimens. Recognizing, treating, and monitoring the progress of early acne may lead to quicker, better clinical outcomes and improved quality of life.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^113Dgat7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Based on the NMA findings, the above considerations and cost‐effectiveness findings 36 the NICE guideline on acne vulgaris management recommends, as first‐line treatments, fixed topical treatment combinations (adapalene with BPO, clindamycin with BPO, or tretinoin with clindamycin) for mild‐to‐moderate acne, and fixed topical treatment combinations (adapalene with BPO, tretinoin with clindamycin) or oral tetracyclines (doxycycline or lymecycline) combined with topical treatments (fixed combination of adapalene with BPO; or azelaic acid) for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Where oral lymecycline or doxycycline are not tolerated or are contraindicated, alternative oral antibiotics such as trimethoprim or an oral macrolide (e.g. erythromycin) might be considered. Choice should be determined following shared decision making with the person with acne, taking into account their values and preferences on the benefits, risks and other characteristics of each treatment, their history of previous therapy and scarring, their risk of future scarring and the psychosocial burden imposed by acne. BPO alone may be considered as an option across all acne severity levels if other recommended first‐line treatments are contraindicated (e.g. during pregnancy) or there is a patient preference against their use. Topical retinoids and BPO should be initiated with alternate‐day or short‐contact application because of their increased risk of discontinuation owing to side‐effects. Photodynamic therapy may be considered as an option for adults with moderate‐to‐severe acne if other treatments are ineffective, not tolerated or contraindicated.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^116eoULC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Isotretinoin — recommendations for acne vulgaris: Oral isotretinoin is recommended for the treatment of severe nodular acne, and oral isotretinoin is appropriate for the treatment of moderate acne that is treatment-resistant or for the management of acne that is producing physical scarring or psychosocial distress. Low-dose isotretinoin can be used to effectively treat acne and reduce the frequency and severity of medication-related side effects; intermittent dosing of isotretinoin is not recommended. Routine monitoring of liver function tests, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides at baseline and again until response to treatment is established is recommended, whereas routine monitoring of complete blood count is not recommended. All patients treated with isotretinoin must adhere to the iPLEDGE risk management program, and females of child-bearing potential taking isotretinoin should be counseled regarding various contraceptive methods including user-independent forms. Prescribing physicians also should monitor their patients for any indication of inflammatory bowel disease and depressive symptoms and educate their patients about the potential risks with isotretinoin.

### Unmet needs in the management of acne vulgaris: a consensus statement [^115r98L1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most common skin condition in the US, affecting up to 50 million Americans. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) guidelines on acne treatment were developed to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, grading, and treatment of acne in adolescents and adults to support clinicians in their therapeutic decision-making process. The most recent acne guidelines were published in 2016, and the approach to care and the therapeutic landscape of acne have evolved since that time. The Acne Management Consensus Roundtable was convened in 2022 to discuss unmet needs in the management of acne. The main focus of the meeting was the role of androgens in acne pathology; the evaluation of clascoterone, the first topical anti-androgen that specifically addresses sebum production in acne; and the identification of the place of clascoterone in therapy. Clascoterone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acne in patients 12 years and older in 2020. This report aims to highlight important limitations of the 2016 AAD treatment guidelines and to familiarize practitioners with clascoterone and its indication, efficacy and safety profile, and potential use across diverse patient populations. With its new mechanism of action, clascoterone may be able to fulfill important unmet needs in acne treatment. Baldwin H, Farberg AS, Frey C, et al.

The Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne published recommendations for the management of acne as a supplement to the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology in 2003. The recommendations incorporated evidence-based strategies when possible and the collective clinical experience of the group when evidence was lacking. This update reviews new information about acne pathophysiology and treatment-such as lasers and light therapy-and relevant topics where published data were sparse in 2003 but are now available including combination therapy, revision of acne scarring, and maintenance therapy. The update also includes a new way of looking at acne as a chronic disease, a discussion of the changing role of antibiotics in acne management as a result of concerns about microbial resistance, and factors that affect adherence to acne treatments. Summary statements and recommendations are provided throughout the update along with an indication of the level of evidence that currently supports each finding. As in the original supplement, the authors have based recommendations on published evidence as much as possible.

### Light therapies for acne [^1153NjFm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a very common skin problem that presents with blackheads, whiteheads, and inflamed spots. It frequently results in physical scarring and may cause psychological distress. The use of oral and topical treatments can be limited in some people due to ineffectiveness, inconvenience, poor tolerability or side-effects. Some studies have suggested promising results for light therapies.

Objectives

To explore the effects of light treatment of different wavelengths for acne.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to September 2015: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We searched ISI Web of Science and Dissertation Abstracts International (from inception). We also searched five trials registers, and grey literature sources. We checked the reference lists of studies and reviews and consulted study authors and other experts in the field to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We updated these searches in July 2016 but these results have not yet been incorporated into the review.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of light for treatment of acne vulgaris, regardless of language or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 71 studies, randomising a total of 4211 participants. Most studies were small (median 31 participants) and included participants with mild to moderate acne of both sexes and with a mean age of 20 to 30 years. Light interventions differed greatly in wavelength, dose, active substances used in photodynamic therapy (PDT), and comparator interventions (most commonly no treatment, placebo, another light intervention, or various topical treatments). Numbers of light sessions varied from one to 112 (most commonly two to four). Frequency of application varied from twice daily to once monthly. Selection and performance bias were unclear in the majority of studies. Detection bias was unclear for participant-assessed outcomes and low for investigator-assessed outcomes in the majority of studies. Attrition and reporting bias were low in over half of the studies and unclear or high in the rest. Two thirds of studies were industry-sponsored; study authors either reported conflict of interest, or such information was not declared, so we judged the risk of bias as unclear. Comparisons of most interventions for our first primary outcome 'Participant's global assessment of improvement' were not possible due to the variation in the interventions and the way the studies' outcomes were measured. We did not combine the effect estimates but rated the quality of the evidence as very low for the comparison of light therapies, including PDT to placebo, no treatment, topical treatment or other comparators for this outcome. One study which included 266 participants with moderate to severe acne showed little or no difference in effectiveness for this outcome between 20% aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT (activated by blue light) versus vehicle plus blue light (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.04, low-quality evidence). A study (n = 180) of a comparison of ALA-PDT (activated by red light) concentrations showed 20% ALA was no more effective than 15% (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15) but better than 10% ALA (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.42) and 5% ALA (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.81). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 6 (95% CI 3 to 19) and 4 (95% CI 2 to 6) for the comparison of 20% ALA with 10% and 5% ALA, respectively. For our second primary outcome 'Investigator-assessed changes in lesion counts', we combined three RCTs, with 360 participants with moderate to severe acne and found methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) PDT (activated by red light) was no different to placebo cream plus red light with regard to change in inflamed lesions (ILs) (mean difference (MD) -2.85, 95% CI -7.51 to 1.81), percentage change in ILs (MD -10.09, 95% CI -20.25 to 0.06), change in non-inflamed lesions (NILs) (MD -2.01, 95% CI -7.07 to 3.05), or in percentage change in NILs (MD -8.09, 95% CI -21.51 to 5.32). We assessed the evidence as moderate quality for these outcomes meaning that there is little or no clinical difference between these two interventions for lesion counts. Studies comparing the effects of other interventions were inconsistent or had small samples and high risk of bias. We performed only narrative synthesis for the results of the remaining trials, due to great variation in many aspects of the studies, poor reporting, and failure to obtain necessary data. Several studies compared yellow light to placebo or no treatment, infrared light to no treatment, gold microparticle suspension to vehicle, and clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide combined with pulsed dye laser to clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide alone. There were also several other studies comparing MAL-PDT to light-only treatment, to adapalene and in combination with long-pulsed dye laser to long-pulsed dye laser alone. None of these showed any clinically significant effects. Our third primary outcome was 'Investigator-assessed severe adverse effects'. Most studies reported adverse effects, but not adequately with scarring reported as absent, and blistering reported only in studies on intense pulsed light, infrared light and photodynamic therapies. We rated the quality of the evidence as very low, meaning we were uncertain of the adverse effects of the light therapies. Although our primary endpoint was long-term outcomes, less than half of the studies performed assessments later than eight weeks after final treatment. Only a few studies assessed outcomes at more than three months after final treatment, and longer-term assessments are mostly not covered in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

High-quality evidence on the use of light therapies for people with acne is lacking. There is low certainty of the usefulness of MAL-PDT (red light) or ALA-PDT (blue light) as standard therapies for people with moderate to severe acne. Carefully planned studies, using standardised outcome measures, comparing the effectiveness of common acne treatments with light therapies would be welcomed, together with adherence to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.

### An algorithm integrating acneceuticals into the management of acne vulgaris [^116PVRne]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common, chronic cutaneous disorder with numerous efficacious prescription and procedural treatments. Therapy, however, is hampered by medication intolerability and compromised by non-adherence. The use of acneceuticals is an effective way to improve patient outcomes.

Methods

A panel of 5 dermatologists met for a consensus conference in October 2023 to identify a practical acne treatment and maintenance algorithm integrating acneceuticals with prescription medications and procedures.

Results

The algorithm stratifies the use of acneceuticals first as monotherapy, adjunctive therapy, or maintenance therapy and then further diverges by skin phenotype (oily or dry/sensitive) and primary lesion morphology (comedonal or inflammatory). Finally, specific acneceuticals are recommended for each phenotypic description.

Conclusion

The algorithm is intended to serve as a guideline for integrating active nonprescription skin care into prescription acne therapy, improving efficacy, tolerability, and adherence, resulting in superior patient outcomes. J Drugs Dermatol. 2025;24(4):376–380. doi:10.36849/JDD.8887.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^114HLtTy]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globallyand a common presentation to dermatologists. Acne may have a detrimental physical, psychological and social impact. A network meta‐analysis (NMA), assessing topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments, found that topical treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) are effective treatments for mild‐to‐moderate acne, while topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Effective treatments have varying treatment costs, including drug acquisition, time of the healthcare professional [HCP; general practitioner (GP) or specialist dermatologist] and special equipment. Evidence on the cost‐effectiveness of acne treatments is currently lacking. Thus, our study objective was to examine the cost‐effectiveness of effective treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in England, using decision–analytical economic modelling.

This economic analysis informed the development of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for the management of acne in England.NICE considers cost‐effectiveness when producing national guidance for health and social care services. The guideline was developed by a committee of clinical academics, HCPs and service users with expertise and experience in acne. The committee contributed to the development of the economic model by providing advice on the natural history of acne and its treatment patterns in England, and on model assumptions where evidence was lacking.

Abstract

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition that may cause psychosocial distress. There is evidence that topical treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) are effective for mild‐to‐moderate acne, while topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy are most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Effective treatments have varying costs. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England considers cost‐effectiveness when producing national clinical, public health and social care guidance.

Aim

To assess the cost‐effectiveness of treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne to inform relevant NICE guidance.

Methods

A decision–analytical model compared costs and quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) of effective topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, from the perspective of the National Health Service in England. Effectiveness data were derived from a network meta‐analysis. Other model input parameters were based on published sources, supplemented by expert opinion.

Results

All of the assessed treatments were more cost‐effective than treatment with placebo (general practitioner visits without active treatment). For mild‐to‐moderate acne, topical treatment combinations and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) were most cost‐effective. For moderate‐to‐severe acne, topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, and oral isotretinoin were the most cost‐effective. Results showed uncertainty, as reflected in the wide confidence intervals around mean treatment rankings.

Conclusion

A range of treatments are cost‐effective for the management of acne. Well‐conducted studies are needed to examine the long‐term clinical efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of the full range of acne treatments.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^111sXWYh]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Key learning points

Early effective treatment for acne may prevent scarring and pigment changes.
Topical treatments are first line for mild/moderate acne but patients need information on how to avoid adverse effects and advice that treatments take 6–8 weeks to work.
Oral antibiotics can be used as second-line treatment, or for moderate or severe acne, when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment.
Most guidelines suggest that duration of oral antibiotics for acne should be limited to 3 months, although National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests up to 6 months.
Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are an alternative treatment for women but can take 3–6 months to work.
There is a growing evidence for use of spironolactone in women with persistent acne (off-label use at present), which is also likely to take 3–6 months to work.
Maintenance topical treatment should be continued when discontinuing oral treatments.

Treatment outcomes

Efficacy of each treatment class relative to placebo is shown in Table 1 for mild‐to‐moderate acne and Table 2 for moderate‐to‐severe acne. In each analysis, treatment classes have been ordered from best to worst using their mean ranking for females. For mild‐to‐moderate acne, bias‐adjusted results are presented, as there was indication of bias owing to small study size in this evidence; base‐case results (before bias adjustment) are shown in Appendix S15 (see Supporting Information). Large uncertainty in the results for most treatments was indicated by wide 95% CrIs around mean effects and rankings.

Table 2
Network meta‐analysis: treatment efficacy (percentage change in total acne lesion count from baseline) in moderate‐to‐severe acne: treatment class effects vs. placebo and rankings

No evidence of effect on treatment discontinuation for any reason was found for any treatment class compared with placebo at either acne severity level. In mild‐to‐moderate acne, topical retinoids, BPO and their combination showed higher discontinuation owing to side‐effects compared with placebo; in moderate‐to‐severe acne (bias‐adjusted analysis), topical retinoids alone or combined with an oral tetracycline, oral cocyprindiol alone or combined with an oral tetracycline, and oral tetracycline alone showed higher discontinuation owing to side‐effects compared with placebo (Appendix S15).

Relative effects between all pairs of treatment classes (including results from indirect and available head‐to‐head comparisons) are reported in Appendix S16 (see Supporting Information).

Threshold analysis

After excluding antibiotic monotherapies, physical treatments and oral isotretinoin, which the committee considered unsuitable first‐line treatments owing to associated potential harms or lack of routine availability and use, threshold analysis suggested that conclusions for mild‐to‐moderate acne were fairly robust to changes in the evidence. In moderate‐to‐severe acne, a moderate change in the evidence would lead to BPO entering the top four efficacious treatments that were eligible for a recommendation (Appendix S17; see Supporting Information).

Results

Table 4 shows the results of the economic analysis for treatments for mild‐to‐moderate acne (same for both sexes) and for moderate‐to‐severe acne in females. Results for treatments for moderate‐to‐severe acne in males (Supplementary Table S1) differed from those for females only in the ranking of oral isotretinoin, which was higher for males and is attributable to its lower intervention cost due to less intensive monitoring compared with females. The results are characterized by uncertainty, reflected in the wide 95% CIs around mean rankings.

The cost‐effectiveness plane (Fig. 2) depicts the mean incremental costs and QALYs of all treatments vs. treatment with placebo (placed at the origin) in each analysis, ordered by magnitude of clinical benefits (QALYs). The cost‐effectiveness acceptability frontier(Fig. 3) shows the most cost‐effective treatments for a range of values of WTP for a QALY (between £0 and £40 000 per QALY) and the probability of each treatment being cost‐effective.

Cost‐effectiveness planes. Results for 1000 people with acne vulgaris. In each graph, the points for each treatment show its incremental quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) (horizontal axis) and costs (vertical axis) vs. treatment with placebo, which is placed at the origin. The slope of the dotted line indicates the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence lower cost‐effectiveness threshold of £20 000/QALY. Moving towards the right of the horizontal axis, treatments result in more QALYs. For both acne severity levels, all treatments produce more QALYs compared with treatment with placebo. Moving towards the top of the vertical axis, treatments become more costly. For both acne severity levels, all treatments are more costly than treatment with placebo, with the exception of BPO in mild‐to‐moderate acne, and with the exception of BPO, topical clindamycin, combined topical tretinoin with clindamycin, oral lymecycline, and azelaic acid combined with oral lymecycline in moderate‐to‐severe acne. In all three graphs, treatments lie on the right side of the dotted line, suggesting that in all three analyses all assessed treatments are cost‐effective compared with treatment with placebo.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^114D7zTx]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our analysis explored the relative cost‐effectiveness of a wide range of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne stratified by severity level. All treatments were more cost‐effective than treatment with placebo (modelled as GP visits without active treatment). For mild‐to‐moderate acne, the most cost‐effective treatments included topical treatment combinations and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light). For moderate‐to‐severe acne, the most cost‐effective treatments included topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, and oral isotretinoin.

To our knowledge, this is the first analysis exploring the relative cost‐effectiveness of a wide range of treatment options for acne from a healthcare perspective, considering, in addition to drug acquisition costs, HCP resource use, including costs associated with inadequate response to treatment or relapse. Previous economic studies (identified through a systematic search conducted to inform the NICE guideline)made limited comparisons of acne treatments, and the majority considered exclusively drug acquisition costs. A number of studies were simple cost analyses and most of them were characterized by important methodological limitations (Supplementary Data S10). Therefore, no robust conclusions can be drawn from the existing economic literature.

In our analysis, we used efficacy and discontinuation data derived from a large systematic review and NMA. This approach combines direct (i.e. head‐to‐head comparisons) and indirect evidence (e.g. comparisons through a common comparator) and allows simultaneous comparisons across all options while preserving randomization. There was some inconsistency between the direct and indirect evidence synthesized in the NMA, possibly reflecting heterogeneity in populations, treatments or study design across the included RCTs. However, NMA conclusions were robust to potential bias in the evidence. The RCTs included in the NMAs were of moderate to very low quality. The strengths and limitations of the source NMA and included RCTs should be considered when interpreting the cost‐effectiveness results.

The size of the evidence differed considerably across the examined treatments. Topical treatments had the largest evidence base on efficacy (several topical treatments had > 500 observations each), followed by oral treatments alone or combined with topical treatments, whereas the evidence for physical therapies (chemical peels, photochemical therapies, PDT) was based on < 300 observations for each treatment class.

### Antibiotic resistance: shifting the paradigm in topical acne treatment [^117XuaDy]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Multiple topical therapies are available for mild to moderate acne vulgaris. The role of antibiotics and their resistance in the treatment of acne was reviewed by an expert panel of dermatologists who practice in Canada.

Methods

Prior to the consensus meeting, the panel members filled out a survey on their current practice using topical treatment for acne. A literature review was carried out using information obtained from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline, and EMBASE. During a consensus meeting organized at the Spring Dermatology Update on April 27, 2014 in Toronto, ON, the panel had a blind vote on the issues at hand.

Results

The panel reached consensus on: 1) Antibiotics are an integral part of acne treatment not only due to their antibiotic effect but also by their anti-inflammatory action. 2) Oral antibiotics should be used for a short period of time if possible. 3) Topical antibiotics should not be used in monotherapy. 4) Retinoids are effective in reducing antibiotic resistance. 5) A benzoyl peroxide wash is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide in reducing antibiotic resistance. 6) Therapy needs to be re-evaluated in 6–8 weeks versus 12 weeks. The recommendations given by the panel are to be disseminated to both general practitioners and dermatologists.

Conclusion

For mild to moderate acne treatment, topical antibiotics in monotherapy are not to be used but may be combined with a retinoid or BPO to safely achieve more successful outcomes.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^111smCSK]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Resource use and cost data

The analysis included intervention costs for people who completed a course of treatment and those who discontinued early and the costs of average acne care (AAC), which comprises a mixture of care currently received by people with acne in the NHS, which may include GP consultations, specialist dermatologist care, drug treatment or no treatment. AAC represented NHS care provided to people with acne following early treatment discontinuation, completion of a course of physical treatment, inadequate improvement or relapse. Costs were estimated by combining resource use with respective unit costs.

Intervention resource use was based on relevant descriptions from RCTs included in the source NMA, modified to reflect optimal routine practice in the UK. This incorporated (as relevant) the drug dosage and optimal duration, time of the HCP (GP and/or specialist care), laboratory testing for people receiving oral isotretinoin and any equipment used. Resource use related to AAC was obtained from UK primary care consultation and prescription data, supplemented with expert opinion and further assumptions, particularly regarding specialist care received by a proportion of people with acne. Unit costs were obtained from national sources, and other published literature. Intervention costs are summarized in Table 3, with full details on methods used for their estimation reported in Supplementary Data S6. Details of the estimation of the AAC cost are shown in Supplementary Data S7.

Acne vulgaris — topical therapy recommendations (Table V) state that benzoyl peroxide (BP) or combinations with erythromycin or clindamycin are effective acne treatments and are recommended as monotherapy for mild acne or with a topical retinoid or systemic antibiotic therapy for moderate to severe acne; BP is effective in the prevention of bacterial resistance and is recommended for patients on topical or systemic antibiotic therapy; topical antibiotics (eg, erythromycin and clindamycin) are effective but are not recommended as monotherapy because of the risk of bacterial resistance; topical retinoids are recommended as monotherapy in primarily comedonal acne or in combination with topical or oral antimicrobials in patients with mixed or primarily inflammatory acne lesions; using multiple topical agents that affect different aspects of acne pathogenesis can be useful and combination therapy should be used in the majority of patients; topical adapalene, tretinoin, and BP can be safely used in the management of preadolescent acne in children; topical dapsone 5% gel is recommended for inflammatory acne, particularly in adult females with acne; and there is limited evidence to support recommendations for sulfur, nicotinamide, resorcinol, sodium sulfacetamide, aluminum chloride, and zinc in the treatment of acne.
