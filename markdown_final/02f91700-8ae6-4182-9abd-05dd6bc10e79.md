## Question

Utility of carrier testing for pediatric strep pharyngitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the utility of routine "carrier testing" for group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis in children, particularly when children are asymptomatic or have clear viral features. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "carrier" is defined and how common it is. Then, I should verify what the major guidelines recommend for testing in asymptomatic or low pretest probability scenarios. Next, I will examine the clinical implications of detecting carriage, including transmission and complication risks. After that, I need to review diagnostic test performance and how molecular assays alter detection. Finally, I will apply pretest probability reasoning to quantify potential harms, consider any legitimate exceptions, and synthesize practical recommendations consistent with evidence and guidelines [^114zxNZD] [^1135UNVK].

> Let me first confirm the definition and baseline epidemiology. "Asymptomatic GAS carriage" denotes the presence of GAS in the pharynx without signs or symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis, a state distinct from acute infection; longitudinal cohorts show repeated recovery of GAS over months without illness, supporting a true colonization state rather than transient contamination [^114zxNZD] [^114ZQdQf]. I should double-check prevalence estimates; a pediatric meta-analysis places asymptomatic carriage at roughly 12% in healthy children, which is high enough that indiscriminate testing will frequently detect carriage rather than disease [^1172rVPn].

> Next, I should review guideline positions on testing carriers. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to ensure I'm citing the right indications. The IDSA 2012 guideline explicitly advises against attempting to identify or treat asymptomatic carriers and recommends not testing patients with acute pharyngitis when overt viral features are present, given the low likelihood of true GAS pharyngitis in those contexts [^114zxNZD] [^1127DBRg]. ESCMID similarly recommends avoiding routine RADT or culture in low Centor/McIsaac probability settings, reinforcing a "do not test" approach when clinical features suggest a viral illness or low pretest probability [^111KKU5m] [^111FYQze]. I should confirm pediatric nuances: AAFP guidance about culture back-up applies to symptomatic children with negative RADT, not to carrier screening, which remains outside recommended practice [^114jnFcB].

> I will now examine the consequences of detecting carriage. Wait, let me verify the key risks. The IDSA rationale is that carriers rarely transmit GAS and have little to no risk of suppurative or nonsuppurative complications such as acute rheumatic fever, so detecting them does not alter management in a beneficial way [^114zxNZD]. I should confirm the background risk of ARF to calibrate benefit; in the US it is very uncommon, approximately 1 per 100,000 children per year, which means the absolute prevention benefit from identifying and treating carriers is negligible [^116hTazC]. Hold on, I should also consider downstream effects — labeling a carrier as "strep throat" can drive unnecessary antibiotics and follow-up without preventing complications or meaningfully reducing transmission [^113bY21x].

> Next, I should review diagnostic test performance with attention to carriage detection. RADTs are rapid and specific, but neither RADT nor culture can distinguish colonization from true infection; highly sensitive molecular assays further increase detection of low-burden carriage that would have been missed by less sensitive methods, inflating apparent "positivity" in low-probability populations [^114ZQdQf] [^115Dwz6Z]. Hmm, wait a minute — I almost said RADTs are "nearly 100% specific"; that's not precise. Although atypical false positives can occur, many RADT culture-negative positives are PCR-positive for GAS, suggesting specificity is high but not perfect, and still none of these methods can differentiate infection from carriage at the point of care [^113ZCJA1] [^1154aa6p]. Molecular NAATs show excellent sensitivity and strong NPV and are increasingly used, but their heightened sensitivity makes them especially prone to detecting carriage when pretest probability is low [^112jDH1v] [^116vY5au].

> Let me think about pretest probability and how it shifts interpretation. In symptomatic pediatric pharyngitis, GAS prevalence is commonly around 20–40%, but among asymptomatic children the carriage prevalence is roughly 12%, and when viral features are present, the likelihood of true GAS pharyngitis drops substantially, placing many encounters into a low pretest probability zone [^1154aa6p] [^1172rVPn] [^114jnFcB]. I should double-check the Bayesian implications: with NAAT sensitivity around 95–100% and specificity roughly 90–99%, the positive predictive value falls sharply as prevalence drops; in low-prevalence settings a substantial fraction of "positives" represent carriage rather than acute infection, meaning a positive test can mislead clinicians toward unnecessary antibiotics [^112jDH1v] [^1154aa6p]. This aligns with observational data that overtesting in low-probability presentations increases detection of colonization and can drive inappropriate prescribing [^113bY21x] [^117SJ74v].

> Now, I should weigh harms and benefits explicitly. Hold on, I should verify whether any measurable benefit exists for treating carriers — guidelines and epidemiology indicate no reduction in ARF risk and minimal impact on transmission, so benefits are effectively absent in routine clinical care [^114zxNZD]. The harms include unnecessary antibiotic exposure, adverse effects, costs, and contribution to antimicrobial resistance; trials and reviews show rapid test strategies can reduce antibiotic use when appropriately targeted, but using those tests indiscriminately in low-pretest settings reverses that stewardship benefit by converting carriage into "disease" on paper [^113bY21x]. I need to ensure that the stewardship signal is anchored to appropriate testing criteria, not universal screening [^114jnFcB].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions where testing carriers could help? Let me reconsider. IDSA advises against routine testing of asymptomatic household contacts and generally discourages testing in children under 3 years because ARF is rare and classic GAS pharyngitis is uncommon, though selected high-risk situations may warrant individualized consideration; even then, this is not standard practice and is typically reserved for public health or outbreak contexts rather than routine care [^111Dfgup] [^114oTdcC]. I should confirm that no major guideline endorses routine carrier screening outside of outbreak investigations, and that remains the case [^111KKU5m].

> Next, I should translate this into practical clinic-facing recommendations. Use clinical features and validated rules to estimate pretest probability; in children with compatible symptoms and adequate probability, test with RADT or NAAT and, if RADT is negative, confirm with culture per pediatric guidance; if viral features are prominent or the pretest probability is low, do not test, which avoids converting carriage into a diagnosis and prevents unnecessary antibiotics [^1121sGnA] [^117FtXKa] [^111KKU5m]. Let me first confirm the pediatric backup step: AAFP and IDSA recommend culture confirmation of negative RADT in children, which applies only when testing is indicated by symptoms and risk, not in asymptomatic or overtly viral presentations [^114jnFcB] [^116zaEou]. In a low-probability child who is nonetheless tested and returns positive, I should explain the high likelihood of carriage and withhold antibiotics while providing safety-net follow-up, because therapy does not benefit carriers and exposes them to harm [^114zxNZD].

> Finally, I need to address laboratory strategy so we don't over-detect carriage. Highly sensitive POC NAATs can improve timely management for appropriately selected symptomatic patients but will increase detection of low-level colonization if used indiscriminately; aligning test ordering with guideline indications preserves the benefits of rapid, accurate methods while minimizing harm from overtreatment of carriers [^112jDH1v] [^115Dwz6Z]. Hold on, I should verify workflow caveats — operator performance can affect RADT sensitivity, and institutional protocols should ensure quality, but even perfect execution cannot make any current test distinguish infection from carriage; that distinction rests on pretest probability and clinical context, not a different assay readout [^1116EfXR] [^114ZQdQf].

> Bottom line, after double-checking guidelines, epidemiology, test characteristics, and stewardship data, routine testing to identify pediatric GAS carriers — whether in asymptomatic children or in those with clear viral symptoms — does not provide clinical benefit and creates net harm through unnecessary antibiotics and resource use; appropriate testing should be reserved for symptomatic children with a meaningful pretest probability of true GAS pharyngitis, consistent with IDSA, ESCMID, and AAFP recommendations [^114zxNZD] [^111KKU5m] [^114jnFcB].

Carrier testing for pediatric strep pharyngitis is **not recommended** [^113QZa4G] because it cannot distinguish colonization from acute infection [^115NEpL2], leading to unnecessary antibiotics and increased resistance [^112jVCiP]. Carriers are at **low risk of complications** [^114zxNZD] and unlikely to transmit GAS, so testing and treatment should be avoided [^113QZa4G]. Diagnosis should **rely** on clinical assessment plus RADT [^1135UNVK] with culture backup for negatives [^114jnFcB], and molecular tests should be interpreted cautiously [^115Dwz6Z] due to high sensitivity detecting colonization [^112jDH1v]. Carrier testing is only considered in rare, recurrent outbreaks after standard measures fail [^113QZa4G].

---

## Definition and prevalence of GAS carriage

GAS carriage is the presence of GAS in the oropharynx without symptoms or an immune response [^113QZa4G] and is **common in children** [^115YiFKH]. The prevalence of asymptomatic GAS carriage is **approximately 12%** in children (95% CI: 9%-14%) [^1172rVPn].

---

## Clinical significance of GAS carriage

Carriers are at **little or no risk** of suppurative or non-suppurative complications, such as acute rheumatic fever [^113QZa4G], and are **unlikely to transmit** group A streptococcal pharyngitis to close contacts [^114zxNZD].

---

## Diagnostic challenges in distinguishing carriage from acute infection

Laboratory methods **cannot reliably distinguish** acute infection from colonization [^115NEpL2], and clinical features alone are **insufficient** to differentiate GAS from viral pharyngitis [^1135UNVK] [^111RUTM1].

---

## Current diagnostic guidelines for pediatric GAS pharyngitis

- **IDSA guidelines** recommend RADT for symptomatic patients, with culture backup for negative RADTs in children and adolescents [^1135UNVK] [^117FtXKa].
- **AAFP 2024 guidelines** recommend throat culture after negative RADT in pediatric patients [^114jnFcB].
- **ESCMID guidelines** do not recommend routine throat culture after negative RADT [^114hZBTx] [^111FYQze].

---

## Utility of carrier testing in clinical practice

In routine clinical practice, carrier testing is **not recommended** [^113QZa4G] because it cannot distinguish colonization from acute infection [^115NEpL2]; testing asymptomatic household contacts is also **not recommended** [^111Dfgup].

---

## Impact of carrier testing on antibiotic prescribing and resistance

Carrier testing may lead to **unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions**, thereby contributing to resistance [^113bY21x], and antibiotic treatment of carriers **does not significantly reduce** transmission or complications [^113QZa4G].

---

## Clinical scenarios where carrier testing may be considered

Carrier testing may be considered **only in rare recurrent outbreaks** after standard infection control measures have failed [^114zxNZD].

---

## Alternative diagnostic approaches

Clinical assessment combined with RADT, with culture backup, remains the **standard approach** [^1135UNVK] [^117FtXKa], while molecular tests (PCR) are **highly sensitive** [^115Dwz6Z] but may detect colonization, leading to false positives [^112jDH1v].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- Carrier testing for pediatric strep pharyngitis is **not recommended** due to inability to distinguish colonization from acute infection, risk of unnecessary antibiotic use, and lack of clinical benefit [^113QZa4G].
- **Diagnosis should rely** on clinical assessment, RADT, and culture backup [^114jnFcB].
- Carrier testing should **only be considered in rare recurrent outbreaks** after standard measures have failed [^114zxNZD].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, specifically with respect to the rapid antigen detection test, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining a rapid antigen detection test for GAS pharyngitis in most patients with symptoms of acute pharyngitis. This is advised because clinical features alone do not reliably discriminate between group A streptococcal and viral pharyngitis, except when overt viral features such as rhinorrhea, cough, oral ulcers, and/or hoarseness are present.

Among throat swabs processed in the microbiology laboratory as backup for negative rapid antigen detection test results, we found a significant increase in the proportion that tested positive for group A streptococci after changing from throat culture to a molecular test. For group A streptococcus testing, our hospital laboratory replaced throat cultures with a standalone molecular diagnostic test that takes no more than 1 hour to perform. The prevalence of positive laboratory test results increased significantly (P < .0001) after the change to molecular testing, probably because of the extreme sensitivity of the molecular test.

### Rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus in children with pharyngitis [^1154aa6p]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) accounts for 20% to 40% of cases of pharyngitis in children; the remaining cases are caused by viruses. Compared with throat culture, rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) offer diagnosis at the point of care within five to ten minutes.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of RADTs for diagnosing GAS in children with pharyngitis and to assess the relative diagnostic accuracy of the two major types of RADTs, enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and optical immunoassays (OIA), through indirect and direct comparison.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CDSR, DARE, MEDION, and TRIP from January 1980 to July 2015. We also conducted related citations tracking via PubMed, handsearched reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles, and screened all articles citing included studies via Google Scholar.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies that compared RADT for GAS pharyngitis with throat culture on a blood agar plate in a microbiology laboratory in children seen in ambulatory care.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance, assessed full texts for inclusion, and carried out data extraction and quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. We used bivariate meta-analysis to estimate summary sensitivity and specificity and to investigate heterogeneity across studies. We compared the accuracy of EIA and OIA tests using indirect and direct evidence.

- **Main results**: We included 98 unique studies in the review, encompassing 116 test evaluations.

Samples were subsequently frozen, and laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and sequencing were conducted on the thawed specimens later that same winter. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and percentage agreement between the different testing methods, along with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) achieved via the Clopper–Pearson exact method, were calculated.

A minimum enrollment requirement of 60 patients positive for group A Streptococcus (GAS) was set, with the condition that the lower 95% CI for sensitivity and specificity should exceed 90%. This cutoff was based on the reported 98.3% sensitivity and 94.2% specificity of the cobas Liat Strep A test and the 97.1% sensitivity and 60.5% specificity of the QuickVue Strep A test, as seen in the clinical site validation study (data on file). These benchmarks were used to demonstrate a statistically significant performance difference between the two tests.

- **Testing procedures and outcomes**: Samples with discordant results were re-tested using the cobas Liat Strep A system. This approach was chosen due to the additional pre-analytic steps required for the reference method, which increase the likelihood of detecting GAS when present in low amounts. Low-positive results were monitored by noting the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold values. Samples with conflicting results between the initial cobas Liat Strep A test and the retest were analyzed separately.

Initially, bacterial culture was defined as the reference method for assay comparison. However, due to unexpectedly low sensitivity rates observed during the study, routine laboratory NAATs were initiated for all samples in addition to the culture.

- **Evaluation of clinical management of GAS using different assays**: This evaluation highlights the need for accurate diagnostic tools to guide effective treatment strategies in clinical settings.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of Group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: Impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^115RyYmj]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the use of the POC PCR cobas Liat Strep A test in a large pediatric clinic increased the rates of accurately diagnosing GAS pharyngitis, provided results at the time of the clinic visit, and reduced inappropriate antibiotic prescribing compared with the recommended treatment paradigm of RADT plus reflex culture. The American Society for Microbiology has recommended that clinics redesign their office workflow to incorporate POC testing. Additionally, PCR-based GAS pharyngitis testing, while not currently recommended in treatment guidelines, may produce results on par with gold standard laboratory testing; incorporation of PCR-based methods into practice guidelines could inform providers of the benefits of these methods and encourage their use. Thus, the use of POC PCR to diagnose GAS pharyngitis should be considered to improve patient care and office/provider efficiency.

### Multicenter clinical evaluation of the automated Aries Group A Strep PCR assay from throat swabs [^116vY5au]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is one of the leading causes of bacterial pharyngitis. Early GAS diagnosis is critical for appropriate antibiotic administration, which reduces the risk of GAS sequelae and limits the spread of the infection. The Aries Group A Strep (GAS) assay (Luminex, Austin, TX) is a fully automated PCR assay for the direct detection of GAS in throat swab specimens in less than two hours with minimal hands-on time.

This multicenter prospective study evaluated the clinical performance of the Aries GAS assay compared to Streptococcus pyogenes culture. Subjects with symptoms consistent with pharyngitis were enrolled across four sites in the United States, and a throat swab in liquid Amies medium was obtained. Aries and reference testing were performed within 72 and 48 hours after sample collection, respectively. Of 623 throat swab specimens from patients with pharyngitis (93.6% under 18 years old, 54.3% female), the reference method yielded valid results for 618 specimens.

- **Aries assay results**: Reference and Aries assay testing showed GAS-positive results for 160 (25.9%) and 166 (26.9%) specimens, respectively. Compared to the reference method, Aries assay sensitivity was 97.5% (95% confidence interval, 93.7% to 99.0%), specificity was 97.8% (95% CI, 96.0% to 98.8%), positive predictive value was 94.0% (95% CI, 89.3% to 96.7%), and negative predictive value was 99.1% (95% CI, 97.7% to 99.7%). There were 10 false-positive and four false-negative detections with the Aries assay.

- **Discrepant analysis**: Discrepant analysis with bidirectional sequencing yielded concordant results with the Aries assay for nine of 14 discordant cases.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: A retrospective study [^117SJ74v]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial etiology of pharyngitis but is difficult to distinguish clinically from viral pharyngitis. Early antibacterial treatment of GAS pharyngitis offers benefits, but administering antibiotics to children with viral pharyngitis is ineffective and costly. We evaluated adherence to guidelines developed to help clinicians distinguish between viral and GAS pharyngitis and guide management.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cohort study of patients ages 3–18 who had a rapid streptococcal test and/or throat culture performed in an outpatient setting. We collected data on documentation of components of the McIsaac score and classified tests as indicated if the score was ≥ 2. Based on the McIsaac score and GAS test results, we determined whether each antibiotic course prescribed was indicated according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline.

- **Results**: Among 291 eligible children, 87 (30%) had all five components of the McIsaac score documented. There was sufficient data to classify the score as either < 2 or ≥ 2 in 234 (80%); among these, 96% of tests were indicated. Twenty-nine patients (10%) were prescribed antibiotics. Eight (28%) of these prescriptions were not indicated according to guidelines.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of GAS tests in children with pharyngitis are indicated, although providers do not regularly document all elements of a validated pharyngitis scoring tool. Over one-quarter of children prescribed antibiotics for pharyngitis did not require antibiotics according to guidelines.

Regarding preventative measures for rheumatic fever, especially concerning primary prevention, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining a rapid antigen detection test for GAS pharyngitis in most patients with symptoms of acute pharyngitis. This is because clinical features alone do not reliably differentiate between group A streptococcal and viral pharyngitis, except when overt viral features such as rhinorrhea, cough, oral ulcers, and/or hoarseness are present.

### Patient demographics are associated with testing for group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children [^111gMEco]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Low credibility.

Racial disparities in pediatric healthcare, including in antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI), have been reported. Pharyngitis is among the top three diagnoses associated with antibiotic prescribing in pediatric outpatients. A rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antigen test to evaluate for Group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis is the most common diagnostic test administered to children presenting with ARTI symptoms in our institution (unpublished local data). However, there is great variation in GAS testing rates at the levels of clinician, clinic, and clinic type, which can drive differences in antibiotic prescribing. In prior studies, baseline inappropriate pediatric GAS testing rates ranged from 39% to 64%, and prescriptions for patients with a negative GAS test ranged from 8% to 59%.

Common reasons to test and treat GAS pharyngitis include reducing symptom duration and severity, preventing local and disseminated infection and complications such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and reducing transmission. However, in areas with low rates of ARF, like the United States, overutilization of GAS testing in patients with clear viral symptoms leads to the frequent detection of streptococcal colonization rather than GAS pharyngitis, which, in turn, can lead to inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for viral pharyngitis.

It is unclear whether racial or other demographic differences exist in diagnostic testing rates for GAS pharyngitis. While the quantity and quality of antibiotic prescribing have been shown to vary according to the clinician.

### Prevalence of streptococcal pharyngitis and streptococcal carriage in children: a meta-analysis [^1172rVPn]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Prevalence estimates can help clinicians make informed decisions regarding diagnostic testing of children who present with symptoms of pharyngitis. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of streptococcal infection among children who presented with a sore throat and the prevalence of streptococcal carriage among asymptomatic children.

- **Methods**: We searched Medline for articles on pediatric streptococcal pharyngitis, including articles with data on the prevalence of group A Streptococcus (GAS) from pharyngeal specimens in children younger than 18 years. Two evaluators independently reviewed, rated, and abstracted data from each article. Prevalence estimates were pooled in a meta-analysis and stratified according to age group.

- **Results**: Of the 266 articles retrieved, 29 met all inclusion criteria. Among children of all ages who present with a sore throat, the pooled prevalence of GAS was 37% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 32%-43%). Children younger than 5 years had a lower prevalence of GAS (24% [95% CI: 21%-26%]). The prevalence of GAS carriage among well children with no signs or symptoms of pharyngitis was 12% (95% CI: 9%-14%).

- **Conclusions**: Prevalence rates of GAS disease and carriage varied by age; children who were younger than 5 years had lower rates of throat cultures that were positive for GAS.

### Molecular and clinical diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children [^1132UnBh]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis is a very common condition causing significant morbidity in children. Accurate diagnosis followed by appropriate antimicrobial therapy is recommended to prevent postinfectious sequelae. The diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis by a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) or culture, in the absence of discriminating clinical findings, remains challenging. Therefore, validation of new sensitive rapid diagnostic tests is a priority.

The performance of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay (illumigene assay) for the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis was compared with that of a RADT and standard culture in 361 pediatric throat swab samples. Discrepant results were resolved using an alternate molecular assay. Test results were correlated with clinical presentations in patients positive by either method. The closest estimate of the true prevalence of GAS pharyngitis was 19.7% (71/361 samples). The illumigene assay alone detected 70/71 GAS-positive samples; RADT and culture detected 35/71 and 55/71 samples, respectively. RADT followed by culture confirmation of RADT-negative specimens detected 58/71 cases.

The illumigene assay increased identification among children eligible for testing by American College of Physicians (ACP)/American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) criteria from 31 to 39 positive cases, five of which were false positives. Analysis of clinical data in GAS-positive patients indicated that a significantly greater proportion of children with McIsaac scores of ≥ 4 tested positive by the illumigene assay versus RADT and culture.

### Extrapharyngeal group A Streptococcus infection: Diagnostic accuracy and utility of rapid antigen testing [^114Pu95k]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Antigen tests have been well-studied and are widely used in pediatric practice for rapid detection of group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections in the throat, but they have not been examined sufficiently for the detection of infection of skin sites, such as the perineal region or impetiginous lesions.

- **Methods**: During the 3-year period from 1999 to 2002, we evaluated 239 patients with suspected GAS skin infection in five pediatric practices, using three Dacron swabs for each site. The first swab was tested in the pediatric office laboratory with an antigen detection kit. For the first 91 patients, the Abbott Test Pack Plus antigen detection test (ADT) was used, followed by the Abbott Signify Strep A ADT for subsequent patients. The second swab was tested with BD Directigen 1–2–3 ADT in the hospital laboratory. The third swab was placed in modified Stuart's transport medium for comparison of the recovery of GAS from culture in broth or on agar. A positive culture served as the reference standard. Test performance and test accuracy were determined for each ADT.

- **Results**: Of the 247 ADTs and cultures performed on 239 patients, 91 with suspected skin infection were tested with the Test Pack Plus test, 149 with the Signify Strep A test, and 247 with the Directigen test. Eighty-six (35%) cultures were positive, 73 from perineal sites (54 rectal, 13 vaginal, 6 penile) and 13 from impetiginous lesions. There was 100% concordance for the 86 cultures positive for GAS in a comparison between dry Dacron swabs and swabs that had been placed in modified Stuart's transport medium.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis: 2012 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114Md5zD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). High credibility.

The 2012 IDSA guidelines recommend swabbing the throat and testing for GAS pharyngitis by rapid antigen detection test (RADT) and/or culture for primary prevention of rheumatic fever. This is crucial because clinical features alone do not reliably differentiate between GAS and viral pharyngitis, except when there are overt viral features such as rhinorrhea, cough, oral ulcers, and/or hoarseness. Among children and adolescents, it is advised that negative RADT results be confirmed with a throat culture.

### Efficacy and safety of rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat [^113bY21x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Sore throat is a common condition caused by viruses or bacteria and is a leading cause of antibiotic prescription in primary care. The most common bacterial species causing sore throat is group A streptococcus, also known as 'strep throat'. Despite the majority of pharyngitis cases being viral in origin, antibiotics are prescribed in 50% to 70% of cases. A strategy to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use involves employing rapid tests for group A streptococcus to guide prescriptions. These tests can be used independently or alongside a clinical scoring system.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of strategies based on rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat in primary care settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS, as well as the trial registries ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP on 5 June 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid tests with management based on clinical grounds to guide the prescription of antibiotics for people with a sore throat in ambulatory care settings. Trials included were those that randomised individuals, as well as cluster-RCTs where individual practitioners, practices, or emergency departments were randomized.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data on the primary outcomes, including the number of participants provided with an antibiotic prescription and the number of participants with an antibiotic dispensed. Secondary outcomes included the duration of sore throat symptoms, the duration of other symptoms, and the quality of life measures.

### Inappropriate testing of streptococcal pharyngitis in children aged below 3 years: Application of statistical process control [^116EnqZt]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Group A strep tests in patients aged below 3 years are not recommended unless the patient has appropriate symptoms and a positive contact or signs of complications. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to increase the percentage of appropriately ordered strep tests among providers. Data were collected retrospectively and prospectively from 1,163 patient visits. Providers were exposed to educational interventions, an electronic medical record order change, and provider feedback.

Proportional control charts characterized the providers' behaviors and determined significant improvement among testing. The result was an increase in appropriate tests from 13.7% to 37.8%, and the control charts showed sustainable results over time. This project demonstrates the efficacy of these methods to encourage antibiotic stewardship among providers. Furthermore, the interventions used here can be applied to other areas with low-value diagnostic testing. Future studies should investigate whether parental anxiety and educational programs influence testing and evaluate the efficacy of certain strategies.

### A longitudinal study of group A streptococcal colonization and pharyngitis in US children [^115tHjyv]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). High credibility.

- **Study design**: This 2-year longitudinal, prospective cohort study assessed GAS throat colonization and pharyngitis incidence in US children at 9 clinical sites following the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from all parents/legal guardians (with the child's assent as applicable) prior to study enrollment, following local Institutional Review Board approval of study documents.

- **Study participants**: Eligible participants were healthy children 3–12 years old at enrollment. Children with a history of culture-confirmed invasive streptococcal disease, RHD, glomerulonephritis, confirmed streptococcal pharyngitis, or impetigo within the preceding month, a bleeding disorder, a known or suspected immunodeficiency condition, or receipt of immunoglobulins within the past year were ineligible.

- **Assessments**: At study entry, a physical examination was performed, and a pharyngeal swab and a blood sample were taken.

- **GAS pharyngeal carriage**: At healthy visits (months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24), a pharyngeal swab for microbiological culture was obtained. Healthy visits could not occur until ≥ 6 weeks after any sick visit.

- **GAS pharyngitis**: An episode of sore throat triggered sick visit 1, which was followed by 2 subsequent sick visits (sick visits 2 and 3), depending on the initial evaluation (Fig. 1 A).

- **FIGURE 1**: A: Sequence of sick visits and assessments following a sore throat episode. B: Subject disposition. ICF indicates informed consent form.

Sick visit 1 included physical examination, temperature recording, and examination.

### Performance and practicality of a rapid molecular test for the diagnosis of Strep A pharyngitis in a remote Australian setting [^116hcG8a]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Over five days, 120 schoolchildren from two schools in the remote Kimberley region of Australia were screened for Strep A pharyngitis. Molecular point-of-care testing identified Strep A pharyngitis in 13 out of 18 (72.2%) symptomatic children. The portability and feasibility of molecular point-of-care testing were highly practical for remote settings.

### Impact of rapid streptococcal test on antibiotic use in a pediatric emergency department [^112jVCiP]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Acute pharyngitis is commonly seen in children. Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus is the most common bacterial cause and accounts for approximately 15% to 30% of cases in children, but this condition is generally overdiagnosed and overtreated. The availability of rapid streptococcal tests (RSTs) has simplified the diagnosis and reduced the use of antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics can lead to drug-resistant bacterial strains, thus limiting the number of antibiotic prescriptions for upper respiratory tract infections has been strongly recommended to curb bacterial resistance.

- **Objective**: To assess the impact of RSTs on antibiotic prescriptions in children with pharyngitis in the emergency department.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted from September 2005 to September 2007, involving all patients (aged 3–18 years) who presented to the pediatric emergency department with sore throat as the chief complaint or suspected clinically of having acute pharyngitis, and who underwent an RST. Patients with a negative RST result had a culture performed. Data on patients diagnosed with pharyngitis during a 2-year control period before the introduction of the test were also collected. Additionally, antibiotic prescriptions for these patients were recorded.

- **Results**: A total of 8,280 patients were included in the study. In the pre-RST phase, throat culture results of 1,723 patients were reviewed. During the post-RST phase, 6,557 children underwent RST, with the RST results being positive.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: Impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^116djfEt]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Cost pressures on primary care providers continue to increase as reimbursement decreases and payers increasingly value cost-effective considerations when making reimbursement decisions. NAAT and, therefore, PCR accuracy provides increased value to clinical care and health systems. As a result, it is reimbursed at a higher rate compared to RADT. In the US, for example, fee-for-service rates are $43.33 for NAAT, $16.81 for RADT, and $8.18 for culture. The ability to provide patients and providers with definitive results at the time of the clinic visit, without the need for a culture and the resultant delay in confirmatory results or inappropriate antibiotic use relying on RADT, should provide a direct cost savings to both clinics and patients/parents. These benefits could also provide savings for health systems reliant on fixed reimbursement amounts for a healthcare episode, such as accountable care organizations in the US. Additional pharmacoeconomic research could help to show these benefits through direct costing and health analyses.

### Review: Current laboratory and point-of-care pharyngitis diagnostic testing and knowledge gaps [^112jDH1v]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

A 2019 study compared the sensitivity and specificity of the recommended 2-step RADT plus throat swab culture test algorithm against a POC NAAT (cobas Liat Strep A; Roche Diagnostics) in 110 GAS-positive pediatric patients with pharyngitis. POC NAAT had higher sensitivity than both the RADT and throat swab culture tests and higher specificity than RADT. It was concluded that under real-world clinical conditions, RADT results were less specific and throat swab culture results were less sensitive than stated in the literature. POC NAAT resulted in significantly improved appropriate antibiotic use when compared with RADT in this study (97.1% vs 87.5%).

When compared to throat swab culture, the performance of a rapid GAS NAAT (Xpert Xpress Strep A; Cepheid) had sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 100%, 90.4%, 62.2%, and 100%, respectively (n = 205). Due to the rapid turnaround time and excellent negative predictive value, the authors concluded that NAAT could be safely introduced as a first-line test for GAS in a high-incidence acute rheumatic fever population. Previously, laboratory scientists evaluating three US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared NAATs (cobas Liat Strep A; Xpert Xpress Strep A; Aries Group A, Luminex) also noted the high sensitivities of these tests compared to throat swab culture and concluded: "These tests can be considered as reliable POC tests for the diagnosis of GAS, replacing the need for back-up culture". The FDA has subsequently approved several POC NAAT tests for GAS without the need for confirmatory culture.

### Comparison of Alere i Strep A rapid molecular assay with rapid antigen testing and culture in a pediatric outpatient setting [^1113YzmS]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study focus on Group A Streptococcus (GAS), the most common bacterial cause of pediatric acute pharyngitis, highlighting the significance of its rapid identification for subsequent treatment. We sought to determine whether molecular GAS-based testing can successfully replace GAS antigen testing and subsequent culture in a pediatric urgent care center.

- **Methods**: We tested 160 patient oropharyngeal samples using a rapid antigen GAS test, the Alere i Strep A test, and throat culture within a pediatric urgent care setting. Basic statistical metrics were calculated.

- **Results**: The sensitivity and specificity of the molecular test were 98% and 100%, respectively, compared with culture. There was a 9% false-positive rate with the rapid antigen-based testing.

- **Conclusions**: The Alere test is sufficiently sensitive and specific for definitive GAS testing in a pediatric urgent care setting. This implementation has enabled us to provide definitive patient results at the time of each patient encounter.

### Streptococcus A in paediatric accident and emergency: Are rapid streptococcal tests and clinical examination of any help [^117TseuJ]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Rapid streptococcal tests (RSTs) for streptococcal pharyngitis have made diagnosis at once simpler and more complicated. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all RSTs be confirmed by a follow-up throat culture unless local validation has proved the RST to be equally sensitive.

- **Aims**: To evaluate (a) RST as a single diagnostic tool, compared with RST with or without throat culture; (b) clinical diagnosis and the relative contribution of different symptoms.

- **Methods**: The study included 213 patients with clinical signs of pharyngitis. Throat swabs were analyzed using the QuickVue+ Strep A Test; negative RSTs were backed up by throat culture. Thirteen clinical features commonly associated with strep throat were analyzed using backward stepwise logistic regression.

- **Results**: Positive results (RST or throat culture) were obtained in 33 patients; RST correctly identified 21. Eleven samples were false negative on RST. At a strep throat prevalence of 15.9%, sensitivity of RST was 65.6% (95% CI, 46.8% to 81.4%) and specificity 99.4% (96.7% to 99.9%). Sensitivity of clinical diagnosis alone was 57% (34% to 78%) and specificity 71% (61% to 80%). Clinically, only history of sore throat, rash, and pyrexia contributed to the diagnosis of strep throat (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: The high specificity of RST facilitates early diagnosis of strep throat. However, the low sensitivity of RST does not support its use as a single diagnostic tool. The sensitivity in the present study is markedly different from that reported by the manufacturer. Clinical examination is of limited value.

### Use of host response to refine the diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^115pk3SB]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2022). Low credibility.

Diagnostic tests for pharyngitis do not distinguish between symptomatic group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection and asymptomatic colonization, resulting in over-diagnosis and unnecessary use of antibiotics. We assessed whether measures of host response could make this distinction.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 18 children with pharyngitis having Centor scores of 4 or 5 and 21 controls without pharyngitis or other acute infections. Both groups underwent throat cultures, molecular tests for GAS and respiratory viruses, and IgM serology for Epstein-Barr virus. Host response was evaluated with white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and sequencing of RNA from peripheral blood leukocytes.

- **Results**: Of 18 cases, 11 had GAS pharyngitis, 3 had adenovirus pharyngitis, and 4 had other pharyngitis. Among asymptomatic controls, 5 were positive for GAS. WBC, CRP, and PCT were higher in subjects with pharyngitis compared to asymptomatic controls, including those with GAS. Transcriptional profiles from children with symptomatic GAS were clearly distinct from those of children in all other groups. The levels of two genes, CD177 and TLR5, each individually accurately distinguished between symptomatic and asymptomatic GAS. Optimal diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were achieved by the combination of CRP and PCT, and by each of the two gene markers.

In this exploratory study, we showed that traditional measures of inflammation and markers of host gene expression distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic GAS. These results point to significant implications for improving diagnosis.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis: 2012 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114oTdcC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). High credibility.

The 2012 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend that diagnostic studies for group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis are not indicated for children under 3 years old. This recommendation is due to the rarity of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) in this age group, and the uncommon incidence and presentation of streptococcal pharyngitis. However, selected children under 3 years old with other risk factors, such as having an older sibling with a GAS infection, may be considered for testing.

### Patient demographics are associated with testing for group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children [^1116tgA2]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Low credibility.

Among a retrospective cohort of 65,786 outpatient encounters for children older than 3 years with acute respiratory tract infection at an academic institution in 2023, 38,790 (59%) had a rapid group A streptococcal (GAS) test ordered. Testing rates differed significantly by race, ethnicity, insurance type, social vulnerability index, visit location, and clinician type; children in historically underserved and socially vulnerable groups were less likely to undergo GAS testing compared to their social counterparts.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: a retrospective study [^116vPzYt]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial etiology of pharyngitis but is difficult to distinguish clinically from viral pharyngitis. There are benefits to early antibacterial treatment of GAS pharyngitis, but administering antibiotics to children with viral pharyngitis is ineffective and costly. We evaluated adherence to guidelines that were developed to help clinicians distinguish between viral and GAS pharyngitis and guide management.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cohort study of patients ages 3–18 who had a rapid streptococcal test and/or throat culture performed in an outpatient setting. We collected data on the documentation of components of the McIsaac score and classified tests as indicated if the score was ≥ 2. Based on the McIsaac score and GAS test results, we determined whether each antibiotic course prescribed was indicated according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America's guideline.

- **Results**: Among 291 eligible children, 87 (30%) had all five components of the McIsaac score documented. There was sufficient data to classify the score as either < 2 or ≥ 2 in 234 (80%); among these, 96% of tests were indicated. Twenty-nine patients (10%) were prescribed antibiotics; eight (28%) of these prescriptions were not indicated according to guidelines.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of GAS tests in children with pharyngitis are indicated, although providers do not regularly document all elements of a validated pharyngitis scoring tool. Over one-quarter of children prescribed antibiotics for pharyngitis did not require antibiotics according to guidelines.

### Evaluating the American Academy of Pediatrics diagnostic standard for Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis: Backup culture versus repeat rapid antigen testing [^116WBVHf]. Pediatrics (2003). High credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all negative rapid diagnostic tests for Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis be backed up by culture. This recommendation creates a dilemma for clinicians who must make treatment decisions without complete diagnostic information at the time of the visit. The use of a follow-up serial rapid antigen test instead of a follow-up culture would provide a more timely result.

Two swabs were collected from children suspected of having S. pyogenes pharyngitis. Each swab was used for a culture and an OSOM Ultra Strep A Test rapid antigen test. The gold standard of comparison was defined as the identification of S. pyogenes on either of the two culture plates. Three diagnostic strategies were evaluated: a single rapid antigen test, a rapid antigen test with follow-up rapid antigen test (rapid-rapid), and a rapid antigen test with follow-up culture (rapid-culture).

A total of 210 (23.7%) of 887 throat cultures with matched data were identified with S. pyogenes. A single rapid antigen test had a sensitivity of 87.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83.2%-92.1%), the sensitivity of the rapid-rapid follow-up was 91.4% (95% CI: 87.6%-95.2%), and the sensitivity of the rapid-culture follow-up was 95.7% (95% CI: 93.0%-98.5%), which was significantly higher than the others. As shown in Figure 1, when these test strategies were evaluated on a subgroup with clinical symptoms commonly associated with S. pyogenes pharyngitis, the sensitivities all increased and were no longer significantly different. None of the strategies reliably exceeded the others in terms of sensitivity.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: Impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^1143xGmQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

This prospective, open-label study was conducted from September 2016 to January 2017 at a large primary pediatric care clinic within the Baylor Scott and White integrated system, located in the suburbs of Austin, TX (Scott and White Round Rock Clinic). The clinic included seven providers and typically saw 100 to 150 patients per day. Pediatric patients aged 3–18 years with clinical signs and symptoms of GAS pharyngitis, defined as the presence of a sore throat and at least one other symptom (such as redness of the posterior pharyngeal wall, pharyngeal or tonsillar exudate, tonsillar swelling, tender cervical lymphadenopathy, and/or a fever greater than 100°F), were eligible for inclusion in the study. Subjects currently being treated with antibiotics or who had been treated within the previous seven days were excluded. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects or their guardians to participate in the study, and the study protocol and informed consent form were approved by the Baylor Scott and White Institutional Review Board (Temple, TX) prior to study initiation.

### A longitudinal study of group A streptococcal colonization and pharyngitis in US children [^114w2e2V]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). High credibility.

The second approach to improving GAS case definition specificity involved the inclusion of bacterial infection signs and symptoms, which also led to much lower measured incidence estimates. Unfortunately, no reference standard exists to allow calculation of GAS pharyngitis case definition sensitivity and specificity. Thus, it is unclear whether the addition of serological responses or signs and symptoms of bacterial infection would improve the specificity of GAS pharyngitis case definitions over RADT/culture, but it does not seem likely.

Overall, the utility of expanding the case definition for GAS pharyngitis to include serological endpoints is not expected to better discriminate true GAS pharyngitis from carriage due to high baseline titers in children over 5 years. Additional clinical endpoints, such as those indicated in Miller et al, may better discriminate true GAS pharyngitis from GAS carriage plus non-GAS pharyngitis. One limitation of the study is that only United States sites were included, with a predominance of White children. Also, testing for alternate pharyngitis-causing pathogens was not included to determine if pharyngitis was associated with a non-GAS pathogen, and the design of sampling timepoints did not allow for detailed GAS carriage kinetics assessment.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: Impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^116Ug2YT]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

To compare the sensitivity and specificity of the recommended two-step rapid antigen detection test (RADT) with confirmatory culture vs. the point-of-care (POC) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Roche cobas® Liat® Strep A test for detection of group A Streptococcus (GAS) in pediatric patients with pharyngitis, and to investigate the impact of these tests on antibiotic use in a large pediatric clinic.

- **Methods**: This prospective, open-label study was conducted at a single site during fall/winter 2016–2017. A total of 275 patients aged 3 to 18 years with symptoms of pharyngitis had a throat-swab specimen analyzed using RADT, POC PCR, and culture. The sensitivity, specificity, and percentage agreement (95% CI) between assays and a laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification test were calculated. DNA sequencing was used to adjudicate discrepancies. The RADT or POC PCR result was provided to clinicians on alternating weeks to compare the impact on antibiotic use.

- **Results**: A total of 255 samples were evaluated; 110 (43.1%) were GAS positive. Sensitivities (95% CI) for POC PCR, RADT, and culture were 95.5% (89.7–98.5%), 85.5% (77.5–91.5%), and 71.8% (62.4–80.0%), respectively. Specificities (95% CI) for POC PCR, RADT, and culture were 99.3% (96.2–99.98%), 93.7% (88.5–97.1%), and 100% (97.5–100%), respectively. Compared with RADT, POC PCR resulted in significantly greater appropriate antibiotic use (97.1% vs. 87.5%; p = 0.0065).

- **Conclusion**: Under real-world conditions, RADT results were less specific and culture results were less sensitive than found in established literature.

### A longitudinal study of group A streptococcal colonization and pharyngitis in US children [^114ZQdQf]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). High credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis, especially in the context of severe outbreaks of highly pathogenic GAS, is essential for the prevention of suppurative and nonsuppurative complications of infection, including rheumatic fever and RHD, as well as preventing the spread of infection. However, signs and symptoms of GAS and viral pharyngitis broadly overlap, rendering diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis on clinical grounds alone difficult. Diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis is further complicated by asymptomatic GAS carriage; therefore, detection of GAS in the throat by culture-positive pharyngeal swab or rapid test is not necessarily pathognomonic of GAS pharyngitis.

Measurements of GAS-specific antibody responses have been employed to evaluate GAS infection, but increases in titer only occur after infection, so cannot reliably inform acute treatment decisions. Indeed, antistreptolysin O (ASO) titers peak 3–5 weeks after infection, while antideoxyribonuclease B (anti-DNaseB) titers peak 4–6 weeks after infection and may remain elevated for months. Even so, studies have prospectively examined rises in ASO, anti-DNaseB, and antistreptococcal C5a peptidase (anti-SCP) antibody titers associated with episodes of GAS pharyngitis in children, with a suggestion that these measurements might improve diagnostic specificity.

No licensed vaccine is available to prevent GAS-mediated infections. While the low frequency of PSS would require a large efficacy study, GAS pharyngitis is both common and a precursor to PSS. A GAS pharyngitis vaccine efficacy trial requires an appropriate case definition.

### Performance of rapid streptococcal antigen testing varies by personnel [^1116EfXR]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Rapid carbohydrate antigen tests are frequently used to diagnose group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis. Despite evidence of modest sensitivity in medical settings, rapid antigen tests are available to the public for self-testing. We sought to determine if the personnel performing a rapid streptococcal antigen test influence the test's performance characteristics. Throat swabs of pediatric patients performed for GAS pharyngitis in a tertiary-care children's hospital network were included during two study periods in 2004 and 2005.

The performance characteristics of a rapid carbohydrate antigen test were evaluated in three clinical settings against a nucleic acid probe test method according to the personnel performing the test (laboratory technologist versus nonlaboratory personnel). Between the study periods, nonlaboratory personnel from one site underwent retraining. Subsequently, the performance characteristics of the rapid antigen test were reassessed. The sensitivity of the rapid antigen test varied widely among the different testing sites (56 to 90%). Notably, test sensitivity was consistently greater when the test was performed by laboratory technologists than when it was performed by nonlaboratory personnel (P < 0.0001). Although the rapid antigen test sensitivity significantly improved after nonlaboratory personnel at one testing site were retrained (sensitivity before versus after retraining; P < 0.0001), the sensitivity remained greater in the laboratory technologist cohort (P < 0.0001).

These data confirm the important relationship of the operator performing a rapid streptococcal antigen test with the test's performance characteristics.

### Rapid-antigen detection tests for group A streptococcal pharyngitis: Revisiting false-positive results using polymerase chain reaction testing [^113ZCJA1]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

We investigated mechanisms of the false-positive test results on rapid-antigen detection tests (RADTs) for group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis. Most RADT false-positives (76%) were associated with polymerase chain reaction-positive GAS results, suggesting that RADT specificity could be considered close to 100%. Finding that 61% of GAS culture-negative but RADT-positive cases were positive on both GAS polymerase chain reaction and Staphylococcus aureus testing, we posit bacterial inhibition as causative.

### New developments in rapid diagnostic testing for children [^113n55BJ]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The advent of new diagnostic assays for Group A Streptococcus, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus now provides rapid results with increased sensitivity and specificity. Molecular testing is no longer confined to the walls of the laboratory but is moving to the patient in the form of point-of-care tests. In addition, multiplex syndromic panels allow broad testing of pathogens associated with a single clinical presentation. This article focuses specifically on rapid diagnostic tests for pathogens most affecting children. Rapid and accurate pathogen detection in children may result in decreased time to optimal antimicrobial treatment and improved patient outcomes.

### Patient demographics are associated with testing for group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children [^117HCyVv]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Low credibility.

The primary outcome of the study was the percentage of encounters in which a rapid GAS test (antigen or PCR) was ordered. While the type of rapid GAS test (antigen or PCR) varied by clinic type, both test types were included in the analysis. We compared differences in the primary outcome by clinician type, clinic type, age as a categorical variable (3–5 years, 6–10 years, or 11–18 years), ethnicity, race, preferred language, insurance type, and SVI.

We additionally performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify factors that were independently associated with GAS testing after adjusting for other factors. Covariates included age category, sex, race, ethnicity, preferred language, insurance type, SVI category, clinician type, and clinic type. Frequency and percentage are presented for categorical variables, while mean (SD) and median (IQR) are presented for continuous variables. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the regression analysis by each ARTI diagnosis. Chi-square tests were used to test the association between the GAS testing and factors of interest.

### Empirical validation of guidelines for the management of pharyngitis in children and adults [^111RUTM1]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for the management of pharyngitis vary in their recommendations concerning empirical antibiotic treatment and the need for laboratory confirmation of group A streptococcus (GAS). The objective of this study was to assess the impact of guideline recommendations and alternative approaches on the identification and treatment of GAS pharyngitis in children and adults.

Throat cultures and rapid antigen tests were performed on 787 children and adults aged 3 to 69 years with acute sore throat attending a family medicine clinic in Calgary, Alberta, from September 1999 to August 2002. Recommendations from two guidelines — those of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine/American Academy of Family Physicians/US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — were compared with rapid testing alone, a clinical prediction rule (i.e. the modified Centor score), and a criterion standard of treatment for positive throat culture results only.

- **Main outcomes measured**: Sensitivity and specificity of each strategy for identifying GAS pharyngitis, total antibiotics recommended, and unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.

In children, sensitivity for streptococcal infection ranged from 85.8% (133/155; 95% confidence interval, 79.3%-90.0%) for rapid testing to 100% for culturing all. In adults, sensitivity ranged from 76.7% (56/73; 95% CI, 65.4%-85.8%) for rapid testing without culture confirmation of negative results to 100% for culturing all.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for group A streptococcal pharyngitis: A meta-analysis [^115Zdgvd]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Effective management of group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis is hindered by the impractical nature of the gold standard diagnostic test: throat culture. Rapid antigen diagnostic tests (RADTs) are a promising alternative, although concerns about their sensitivity and specificity, as well as variation between test methodologies, have limited their clinical use. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review with a meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of RADTs for GAS pharyngitis.

- **Methods**: Medline and Embase from 1996 to 2013 were used as data sources. Of 159 identified studies, 48 studies of diagnostic accuracy of GAS RADTs using throat culture on blood agar as a reference standard were selected. Bivariate random-effects regression was used to estimate sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Additional meta-analyses were performed for pediatric data.

- **Results**: A total of 60 pairs of sensitivity and specificity from 48 studies were included. Overall summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity of RADTs were 0.86 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.88) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.94 to 0.97), respectively, and estimates for pediatric data were similar. Molecular-based RADTs had the best diagnostic accuracy. Considerable variability exists in methodology between studies. There were insufficient studies to allow meta-regression/subgroup analysis within each test type.

- **Conclusions**: RADTs can be used for accurate diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis to streamline management of sore throat in primary care. RADTs may not require culture backup for negative results.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines regarding group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis advise against routine testing for patients younger than 3 years, patients without pharyngitis, and patients with symptoms suggesting a viral infection. Group A streptococcal testing may be overused in some clinical settings; thus, we conducted this study to evaluate compliance with the IDSA guidelines in a pediatric emergency department (ED) setting.

This retrospective cohort study describes patients younger than 18 years presenting to two urban pediatric EDs in 2016 who underwent rapid antigen detection testing for GAS pharyngitis. Testing was classified as noncompliant with the IDSA guidelines if the chief complaint was not indicative of GAS infection and/or the patient's age was younger than 3 years. Appropriate nonparametric tests compared groups by IDSA testing compliance status.

A total of 13,585 patient encounters met inclusion criteria; 5255 (39%) were noncompliant with the IDSA testing guidelines, the majority due to a chief complaint inconsistent with GAS pharyngitis (67%) and secondarily due to the age of younger than 3 years (48%). Among the patients with noncompliant testing, 51% were prescribed an antibiotic, and return encounters were more likely to occur (13% vs 10%, P < 0.001). Return encounters more commonly resulted in respiratory diagnoses in those with noncompliant GAS testing (60% vs 45%, P < 0.001).

Nearly 40% of all pediatric ED encounters with GAS testing were noncompliant with the IDSA guidelines.

### Clinical features of group A Streptococcus in children with pharyngitis: Carriers versus acute infection [^115NEpL2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Among children with pharyngitis who test positive for group A Streptococcus (GAS), 10%-25% are GAS carriers. Laboratory methods cannot distinguish between acute infection and colonization.

- **Methods**: We examined two separate longitudinal studies of children with symptomatic pharyngitis associated with a positive GAS throat culture. In cohort 1, children presented with pharyngitis symptoms to a clinician and had follow-up cultures at regular intervals. In cohort 2, throat cultures were performed at regular intervals and during pharyngitis symptoms. Illness cultures were categorized as acute infection or carrier based on follow-up culture results. In cohort 2, carriers were further categorized as a GAS carrier with a new emm-type or a GAS carrier with a previous emm-type based on typing data from prior culture results. For each cohort, symptoms were compared at the time of illness culture between carriers and those with acute infections.

- **Results**: In cohort 1 (N = 75 illness cultures), 87% of the children were classified as acutely infected versus 13% as carriers. Carriers were more likely to have upper respiratory (URI) symptoms (odds ratio [OR]: 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4–22.1), headache (OR: 6.0; 95% CI: 1.2–40.5), or vomiting (OR: 5.5; 95% CI: 1.2–24.5). In cohort 2 (N = 122 illness cultures), 79% were acutely infected and 21% were carriers. Children determined to be carriers with a previously detected emm-type were more likely to have URI symptoms compared with those who acquired a new emm-type.

### Reflexive culture in adolescents and adults with group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^115WSrmn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Guidelines currently provide conflicting recommendations regarding the diagnosis of group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis in adults. Clinical guidelines state that negative rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) do not require confirmation by a backup method in adults, whereas laboratory-based guidelines mandate confirmation of a negative RADT in patients of all ages. The objective of this study was to assess the utility of reflexive culture following a negative RADT in adolescents and adults with suspected GAS pharyngitis.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis of 726 patients, aged ≥ 13 years, with negative RADTs and positive GAS throat cultures, was performed between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2011, at two academic medical centers in Seattle, Washington. Complication rates, treatment, modified Centor score, and bacterial burden in patients with negative RADTs and positive GAS throat cultures were assessed.

- **Results**: Modified Centor scores ≥ 2 were observed in 55% of patients with a negative RADT and positive GAS culture. Of these, 77% of patients had a moderate or heavy bacterial burden (≥ 2+). RADTs failed to detect some patients who presented with serious complications of GAS pharyngitis: 29 (4.0%) had peritonsillar abscesses and 2 (0.28%) were diagnosed with acute rheumatic fever. Providers found culture results to be useful for initiating antibiotic therapy or confirming a clinical diagnosis. Antibiotic treatment was prescribed in 68.7% of patients, with culture-directed initiation of therapy documented in 43.5%.

- **Conclusions**: Reflexive GAS culture is clinically significant and valuable in guiding the diagnosis and treatment of suspected GAS pharyngitis in adolescents and adults.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis: 2012 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116KcaXp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, and specifically with respect to the rapid antigen detection test, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend not testing for GAS pharyngitis in pediatric patients under 3 years old. This is because acute rheumatic fever is rare in this age group, and the incidence and classic presentation of streptococcal pharyngitis are uncommon. Testing should be considered for selected patients of this age group in the presence of risk factors, such as an older sibling with a group A streptococcal infection.

### Improving guideline-based streptococcal pharyngitis testing: A quality improvement initiative [^1132zBfv]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Acute pharyngitis is a common diagnosis in ambulatory pediatrics. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis recommends strict criteria for GAS testing to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment of children who are colonized with group A Streptococcus. We sought to improve adherence to the IDSA guideline for testing and treatment of GAS pharyngitis in a large community pediatrics practice.

- **Methods**: The Model for Improvement was used, and iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles were completed. The quality improvement project was approved for American Board of Pediatrics Part 4 Maintenance of Certification credit. Interventions included provider education, modification of existing office procedure, communication strategies, and patient and family education. Outcomes were assessed by using statistical process control charts.

- **Results**: An absolute reduction in unnecessary GAS testing of 23.5% (from 64% to 40.5%) was observed during the project. Presence of viral symptoms was the primary reason for unnecessary testing. Appropriate antibiotic use for GAS pharyngitis did not significantly change during the project, although inappropriate use was primarily related to unnecessary testing. At the end of the intervention period, the majority of providers perceived an improvement in their ability to communicate with families about the need for GAS pharyngitis testing and about antibiotic use.

### Implementation of a highly accurate rapid point-of-care test for group A Streptococcus detection at a large pediatric emergency department in South London [^111WeUdw]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Rapid group A Streptococcus point-of-care testing is not currently used in the United Kingdom for the management of acute tonsillitis. This prospective, observational study describes a strong association between a molecular-based point-of-care testing result and outpatient antibiotic prescribing (odds ratio = 48; P < 0.001) in 339 children seen at our center. It highlights the challenges in implementing new rapid diagnostics.

### The Cape Town clinical decision rule for streptococcal pharyngitis in children [^116Pfcoc]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Existing clinical decision rules (CDRs) to diagnose group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis have not been validated in sub-Saharan Africa. We developed a locally applicable CDR while evaluating existing CDRs for diagnosing GAS pharyngitis in South African children.

We conducted a prospective cohort study and enrolled 997 children aged 3–15 years who presented to primary care clinics with a complaint of sore throat, and whose parents provided consent. The main outcome measures were signs and symptoms of pharyngitis and a positive GAS culture from a throat swab. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were employed to develop the CDR. Additionally, the diagnostic effectiveness of six existing rules for predicting a positive culture in our cohort was assessed.

A total of 206 out of 982 children (21%) had a positive GAS culture. Tonsillar swelling, tonsillar exudates, tender or enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes, absence of cough, and absence of rhinorrhea were associated with positive cultures in bivariate and multivariate analyses. Four variables (tonsillar swelling and one of tonsillar exudate, no rhinorrhea, no cough), when used in a cumulative score, showed 83.7% sensitivity and 32.2% specificity for GAS pharyngitis. Among the existing rules tested, the rule by McIsaac et al. had the highest positive predictive value (28%), but missed 49% of the culture-positive children who should have been treated.

The new four-variable CDR for GAS pharyngitis (i.e. tonsillar swelling and one of tonsillar exudate, no rhinorrhea, no cough) outperformed existing rules for G.

### Sensitivity and specificity of rapid antigen detection testing for diagnosing pharyngitis in the emergency department [^114zrpEh]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Acute pharyngitis in adults is primarily a viral infection; only about 10% of cases are of bacterial etiology. Most cases of bacterial pharyngitis are caused by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS). One laboratory method for the diagnosis of GABHS is rapid antigen diagnostic testing (RADT), which can be processed during an emergency department visit and has become a popular alternative to throat swab cultures.

We conducted a study to define the sensitivity and specificity of RADT, using throat culture results as the gold standard, in 100 emergency department patients who presented with symptoms consistent with streptococcal pharyngitis. We found that RADT had a sensitivity of 68.2% (15 of 22), a specificity of 89.7% (70 of 78), a positive predictive value of 65.2% (15 of 23), and a negative predictive value of 90.9% (70 of 77). We conclude that RADT is useful in the emergency department when the clinical suspicion is GABHS, but results should be confirmed with a throat culture in patients whose RADT results are negative.

### Molecular point-of-care testing in the emergency department for group A Streptococcus pharyngitis: A randomized trial [^116hTzqP]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). High credibility.

The study aimed to compare clinical and health systems outcomes of rapid molecular testing versus throat culture recovery for managing group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis in a pediatric emergency department (PED).

- **Methods**: We conducted a single-center randomized trial of children (3–17 years) presenting to a PED with suspected GAS pharyngitis. A single dual-headed throat swab was collected, and participants were randomized to one of two parallel treatment groups with 1:1 allocation: point-of-care (POC) nucleic acid amplification testing or standard throat culture. The primary outcomes were time to throat pain plus/minus fever resolution. Secondary outcomes included absenteeism, length of stay, return visits to care, and antibiotic prescriptions and utilization.

- **Results**: A total of 227 children were randomly assigned to culture (n = 115) or POC (n = 112) testing. Antibiotics were initiated earlier in the POC group by approximately one day (95% confidence interval, -0.40 to -1.58). No associated difference in time to throat pain or fever resolution was observed between groups. There was a decrease in the proportion of prescribed antibiotics in the POC group (0.35) compared with the culture group (0.79; P < 0.001). Otherwise, no significant differences in secondary outcomes were observed.

- **Conclusions**: Establishing a POC nucleic acid amplification testing program for GAS in a PED facilitates earlier treatment and fewer antibiotic prescriptions. Although this did not translate to improved clinical and health systems outcomes in our study, it may serve as an important tool amid evolving practice standards in pediatric emergency care.

### Sensitivity of a rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococci in a private pediatric office setting: Answering the Red Book's request for validation [^114pYwaM]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

In the office laboratory of our private practice, the sensitivity of a single rapid antigen detection (RAD) test for group A streptococci was examined over three winter periods compared to a backup throat culture. When cultures were held for only 24 hours, the sensitivity was 92%. In the second period, when cultures were held for 48 hours, the sensitivity declined significantly to 86%. When the cultures were read without knowledge of the RAD test result, the sensitivity was 85%. As the Red Book Committee has suggested, physician office laboratories should validate the sensitivity of their RAD test against culture onto blood agar before abandoning the backup throat culture.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, particularly concerning throat culture, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining a throat culture in pediatric and adolescent patients if the rapid antigen detection test is negative. Do not obtain throat cultures if the rapid antigen detection test is positive.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: A retrospective study [^116hTazC]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

GAS testing was indicated in the majority of patients in our study, including those inappropriately prescribed an antibiotic, suggesting that unnecessary testing does not drive excessive prescribing. Instead, clinicians may prescribe antibiotics despite negative testing when they have a strong clinical impression that a patient has a GAS infection. In some cases, such deviations from guidelines may be appropriate, as there are rare false-negative results even with the combination of RADT and throat culture. Throat culture has been described as having a sensitivity of 90–95% based on evaluations of replicate cultures and comparison to antibody levels. However, this sensitivity may be lower if the throat swab is not collected using optimal technique.

It is worth noting that for patients aged 3–14, who receive a point for age, only one additional criterion is required to reach a McIsaac score of 2. Thus, education regarding the importance of proper sample acquisition and the high sensitivity of a combination of RADT and throat culture performed on such a sample would likely be an important aspect of prescriber education. It is also notable that ARF is very uncommon in most developed countries, with an estimated annual incidence of 1 case per 100,000 children; it is less common in teenagers. Clinicians who are inclined to prescribe antibiotics for presumed GAS infection despite a negative test because they fear missing the opportunity to prevent a case of ARF may feel more comfortable accepting a negative result and forgoing treatment following education on the rarity of this condition.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: Impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^117N2iVj]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Infection with Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci; GAS) is the most common bacterial cause of acute pharyngitis and is responsible for an estimated 20–30% of sore throat cases in children. In the United States, the societal cost of GAS pharyngitis is estimated to range from $224 to $539 million per year, with children missing an average of 1.9 days of school/daycare, and 42% of parents missing a mean of 1.8 days of work.

The timely initiation of antibiotics can effectively treat GAS pharyngitis, prevent the spread of infection to close contacts, reduce the duration of symptoms, and limit rare long-term complications. Acute pharyngitis can be a result of either bacterial or viral pathogens; as such, clinical guidelines encourage the use of antibiotics only for confirmed cases of GAS. Despite these recommendations, and overall rates of documented GAS infections (5–30% of sore throat visits), antibiotics are often prescribed in as many as 60% of patient visits for sore throat. Greater awareness of the development of bacterial resistance resulting from the overprescribing of antibiotics is increasing the urgency to move away from empiric antibiotic treatment for common respiratory infections.

### High diagnostic accuracy of automated rapid Strep A test reduces antibiotic prescriptions for children in the United Arab Emirates [^113oFnqx]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Diagnosis of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis in children is hindered by the variable sensitivity of clinical criteria and rapid Strep A tests (SAT), resulting in reliance on throat cultures as the gold standard for diagnosis. Delays while awaiting culture reports result in unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions among children, contributing to the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

- **Methods**: Diagnostic accuracy study of an automated SAT (A-SAT) in children up to 16 years of age presenting to an emergency room with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis between March and June 2019. Paired throat swabs for A-SAT and culture were collected. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for A-SAT were calculated.

- **Results**: Two hundred and ninety-one children were included in this study. Of these, 168 (57.7%) were boys, and the mean age was 4.2 years. A-SAT was positive in 94 (32.3%) and throat culture was positive in 90 (30.9%) children. A-SAT and throat culture results showed a high level of consistency in our cohort. Only 6 (2%) children had inconsistent results, demonstrating that the A-SAT has a high sensitivity (98.9%), specificity (97.5%), PPV (94.7%), and NPV (99.5%) for the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis in children. Only 92 (32%) children were prescribed antibiotics, while the vast majority (68%) were not.

- **Conclusions**: A-SAT is a quick and reliable test with diagnostic accuracy comparable to throat culture. Its widespread clinical use can help limit antibiotic prescriptions to children presenting with pharyngitis, thus lowering antimicrobial resistance.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: Impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^113LMohf]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

A total of 275 samples were collected, of which 255 (92.7%) were evaluable for performance testing. Fourteen out of 275 (5.1%) samples were analyzed separately due to inconsistent point-of-care (POC) PCR results, and results from all testing methods were not available for 6 out of 275 (2.2%) samples. During the study period, 152 (59.6%) and 103 (40.4%) patients had POC RADT and POC PCR assay results, respectively, that were available to the clinician at the time of clinical assessment. A total of 110 samples were determined to be positive for group A streptococcus (GAS), with an overall incidence of 43.1%: 46.1% (70/152) in the RADT arm and 38.8% (40/103) in the POC PCR arm.

### A longitudinal study of group A streptococcal colonization and pharyngitis in US children [^115YiFKH]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). High credibility.

High rates of GAS carriage raise the question of whether GAS detected by RADT or culture in the presence of pharyngitis is causally related or coincidental. Improved case definition specificity could reduce unnecessary antibiotic use but would also impact efficacy study design for GAS vaccines. Two approaches were taken to attempt to increase case definition specificity.

- **Exploratory case definition**: Antibody responses to GAS antigens (ASO, DNaseB, and/or SCP) were evaluated for their ability to discriminate GAS infection from carriage.
- **Revised case definition**: Limited the GAS pharyngitis case definition to subjects with bacterial infection signs and symptoms.

Inclusion of antibody responses as a marker of GAS infection reduced measured incidence rates (Fig. 2 A), consistent with previous findings with ASO and anti-DNaseB titers. Healthy children in the study had baseline antibody titers to streptolysin O, DNaseB, and SCP that increased with age, as observed previously for SCP. In a previous study evaluating ASO and DNaseB as markers of GAS pharyngitis, a 0.2 log rise in ASO or anti-DNaseB titers occurred in 54% and 45% of subjects. A 15% rise in anti-SCP titer was seen in 67% of subjects with confirmed GAS pharyngitis, and 69% of subjects had a rise in titer for at least one of the antigens. During GAS pharyngitis episodes in this study, ASO, anti-DNaseB, and anti-SCP geometric mean titers did not change dramatically from baseline through the sick visits, although modest increases were seen, primarily in the youngest children.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: Impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^115qy5XD]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Point-of-care (POC) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can provide highly accurate results for patients at the time of the office visit, eliminating the need for follow-up confirmatory testing of negative results and for empiric treatment. Providers in this busy pediatric clinic believed that the increased wait time and decreased room availability were offset by more appropriate antibiotic use, the potential for fewer missed days of school/work for patients and their parents, and less staff and provider time and resources while awaiting confirmatory culture results. In addition, workflow efficiencies can also be realized by minimizing the need for patient follow-up after laboratory results are received days later, which is even more important in these days of limited operating processes.

Studies support a 15–20% rate of Streptococcus pyogenes carriage among asymptomatic school-aged children and 25% among asymptomatic household contacts of children. A potential limitation of PCR is that the high sensitivity will increase detection of group A Streptococcus (GAS) colonization in patients who do not require treatment. In this study, 13 patients were negative for GAS by POC PCR; however, GAS was detected in these samples after further pre-analytic steps allowing for continued bacterial replication before laboratory nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) was performed. High PCR cycle threshold values confirm these samples had low bacterial loads. Evaluation of clinical management data indicated no negative consequences for these patients, who did not receive antibiotic treatment.

In the context of the physician's office, utilizing a more sensitive POC PCR method has the potential advantage of providing more accurate diagnoses.
