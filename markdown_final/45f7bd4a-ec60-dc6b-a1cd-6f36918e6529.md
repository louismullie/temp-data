## Question

where can we use topical skin adhesive

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking where topical skin adhesive (cyanoacrylate) can be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core indications and FDA labeling. Then, I should verify the best-supported clinical settings and wound characteristics. Next, I will examine special populations and anatomic sites. After that, I need to check limitations, contraindications, and comparative effectiveness versus sutures. Finally, I will integrate emerging or controversial uses and synthesize a practical, prioritized list of where adhesives are appropriate, making sure I anchor each point to the best available evidence and correct myself if I overstate anything.

> Let me first confirm the core indication and regulatory status. Topical cyanoacrylate adhesives are indicated for topical approximation of skin edges in surgical incisions, including laparoscopic port sites, and in simple traumatic lacerations with easily approximated edges; they are not a substitute for deep dermal closure and should be used on thoroughly cleansed wounds, which aligns with FDA special controls and contemporary guidance documents [^115pr8Z7] [^117RF8pf].

> Next, I should review the best-supported clinical settings. Emergency departments routinely use tissue adhesives for simple lacerations, and observational data show they are used frequently in children and for facial lacerations, with shorter ED length of stay when adhesives are used compared with sutures or staples; randomized and systematic reviews in children and adults show comparable cosmetic outcomes, less pain, and faster application, albeit with a small increase in dehiscence risk that must be weighed in tension-prone areas [^1139eCJD] [^1133Cd7P] [^117UGwy9] [^113rsQ7X].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surgical wards. I initially thought adhesives were broadly established for operative incisions, but I should double-check the strength of evidence. Prospective randomized data in pediatrics show no clear superiority of adhesive adjuncts over sutures alone for surgical wounds, and Cochrane reviews indicate sutures outperform adhesives for minimizing dehiscence, though infection rates are similar; thus, adhesives can be considered in select operative closures when edges are well approximated and tension is low, but they are not a universal replacement for sutures in the OR [^112gSG6n] [^114YyMH4] [^112ry6X2].

> I will now examine special populations and anatomic sites. In children, adhesives are particularly attractive due to reduced pain and avoidance of needlesticks, with pediatric RCTs and meta-analyses supporting their safety and acceptable cosmesis; on the face, adhesives are commonly used given favorable cosmetic results and patient comfort, and in the scalp, the hair apposition technique with cyanoacrylate is validated for small, low-tension wounds; for fingertips, recent primary care guidance includes topical glue as an acceptable alternative for simple nail bed lacerations when the nail plate is already avulsed, which I should note as a niche but practical indication [^112gSG6n] [^113rsQ7X] [^1133Cd7P] [^113rg7fs] [^113WTfKz] [^113WTfKz].

> Wait, let me verify limitations and contraindications so I don't overgeneralize. Adhesives should not be used in the presence of infection, ongoing bleeding, or incomplete debridement, and they are not appropriate for mucosal surfaces or hair-bearing areas where approximation is difficult; they also perform poorly under high tension or in wounds with poor edge approximation, and they should not be used as a substitute for deep dermal sutures when structural support is needed; additionally, petrolatum-based products interfere with adhesion and should be avoided on intended application sites [^117RF8pf] [^115pr8Z7] [^1125Bj76].

> Next, I should review comparative effectiveness and safety signals. Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show that while adhesives reduce pain and procedure time, sutures are superior for preventing dehiscence, with a number needed to harm around 25 in some analyses; infection rates are generally similar, and patient satisfaction can be high with adhesives when appropriately selected, but surgeons should individualize based on tension, location, and patient factors; real-world arthroplasty data also suggest fewer wound complications with adhesives versus staples, though this is observational and should be interpreted cautiously [^114BWQU6] [^114YyMH4] [^1173L7m8].

> Let me consider emerging or controversial applications so I don't miss nuance. There is growing interest in using cyanoacrylate as a microbial barrier over surgical incisions or even as a preoperative skin sealant to reduce SSI, but high-quality evidence remains limited and mixed; consensus statements in colorectal surgery deem evidence insufficient to recommend adhesives solely to reduce SSI, so these uses should be considered investigational or selectively applied in specific contexts rather than standard of care [^115pmkkT] [^113d4vrr].

> I should also confirm device-specific performance differences because they can matter clinically. Among cyanoacrylate formulations, octyl-2-cyanoacrylate products like Dermabond Advanced demonstrate greater tensile strength and flexibility compared with butyl-cyanoacrylates in ex vivo and in vivo models, and hybrid systems incorporating a polyester mesh (e.g. Prineo) can improve edge apposition and time efficiency in arthroplasty, though these advantages must be balanced against cost and the need for deep sutures in higher-tension wounds [^111MtCY2] [^114uubhe] [^116yAZNj].

> Putting this together, I should prioritize where adhesives are most appropriate. First-line settings include simple, low-tension traumatic lacerations in the ED, especially in children and on the face or scalp, where speed, comfort, and cosmesis align with evidence; adjunctive or alternative use is reasonable for select surgical incisions with excellent edge approximation and low tension, recognizing that deep dermal support with sutures is often still indicated; niche uses such as nail bed repairs when the nail plate is avulsed and certain device securement scenarios are acceptable when standard precautions are followed; avoid adhesives in high-tension wounds, contaminated or infected sites, mucosa, or when edges cannot be adequately approximated [^1139eCJD] [^114BWQU6] [^113rg7fs] [^114xs6ae] [^117RF8pf].

---

Topical skin adhesive (cyanoacrylate) is best used for **low-tension wounds with well-approximated edges** [^115pr8Z7], such as simple lacerations, surgical incisions, and pediatric wounds, especially on the face and scalp [^1133Cd7P] [^113rg7fs]. It is **not recommended for high-tension areas** (joints, hands, feet, groin), infected or heavily contaminated wounds, or when precise alignment is needed [^114YyMH4] [^117RF8pf]. Adhesives offer faster application, less pain, and no need for removal, but have a higher risk of dehiscence than sutures in some settings [^114BWQU6] [^114YyMH4]. Use is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to cyanoacrylate or in the presence of active infection or poor perfusion [^117RF8pf].

---

## Indications for topical skin adhesive

Topical skin adhesive is indicated for **low-tension wounds with well-approximated edges**, including:

- **Simple lacerations**: Linear, low-tension wounds in pediatric and adult patients [^114BWQU6] [^113rg7fs].

- **Surgical incisions**: Superficial closure of surgical wounds, including laparoscopic port sites [^1148NGoR] [^115pr8Z7].

- **Pediatric wounds**: Facial and scalp lacerations, where cosmetic outcomes and patient comfort are priorities [^1133Cd7P] [^113rg7fs].

- **Hair apposition technique**: Scalp lacerations where hair can be used to approximate wound edges [^113rg7fs].

---

## Contraindications and limitations

Topical skin adhesive should be avoided in the following situations:

- **High-tension wounds**: Areas subject to significant movement or tension, such as joints, hands, feet, and groin [^114YyMH4] [^113rg7fs].

- **Infected or heavily contaminated wounds**: Risk of impaired healing and complications [^117RF8pf].

- **Poor perfusion**: Ischemic or necrotic tissue [^notfound].

- **Hypersensitivity**: Known allergy to cyanoacrylate compounds [^notfound].

---

## Advantages and disadvantages

| **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|
| Rapid application and reduced procedure time [^114BWQU6] | Higher risk of wound dehiscence compared to sutures in some settings [^114YyMH4] |
| Less pain and anxiety, especially in pediatric patients [^114BWQU6] | Not suitable for high-tension wounds or complex lacerations [^113rg7fs] |
| No need for suture removal, improving patient compliance [^114BWQU6] | Potential for allergic reactions or skin irritation [^1173L7m8] |
| Waterproof and flexible, allowing early mobilization [^1125Bj76] | Higher cost compared to traditional sutures [^1125Bj76] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting use

Multiple studies and reviews support the use of topical skin adhesive in appropriate clinical scenarios:

- **Pediatric lacerations**: Comparable cosmetic outcomes and lower pain scores compared to sutures [^113rsQ7X] [^114BWQU6].

- **Surgical incisions**: Similar infection rates and patient satisfaction compared to traditional closure methods [^1148NGoR] [^116yAZNj].

- **Emergency department**: Shorter length of stay and improved patient satisfaction [^1139eCJD] [^114BWQU6].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Adhesives are particularly beneficial due to reduced pain and anxiety, and avoidance of suture removal [^114BWQU6] [^1133Cd7P].

- **Cosmetic outcomes**: Adhesives provide excellent cosmetic results in facial lacerations and surgical incisions [^1148NGoR] [^116yAZNj].

- **Infection risk**: No significant difference in infection rates compared to traditional closure methods when used appropriately [^114BWQU6] [^113d4vrr].

---

Topical skin adhesive is a valuable tool for closing low-tension wounds with well-approximated edges, offering advantages in speed, comfort, and cosmetic outcomes. It is **not suitable for high-tension wounds, infected or contaminated wounds, or when precise alignment is required**.

Each year there are over 7 million lacerations requiring wound closure in the emergency department. Traditionally, most lacerations have been closed with sutures. Topical cyanoacrylate skin adhesives offer many advantages over traditional wound closure devices. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reclassified the topical skin adhesives. As a result, new topical skin adhesives are expected to enter the market in the near future. This article will review the structure and function of cyanoacrylates as well as their advantages, indications, and usage.

Adhesives for skin closure — cyanoacrylate evidence and guidance: Cyanoacrylate glue is the most common topical adhesive for skin closure and has been used in addition to or as a replacement for sutures or staples; in a multicenter randomized trial comparing OCA with standard wound closure methods there was no difference in infection rates at 1 week postoperatively, and two prospective non-randomized cohort studies (plastic and spine surgery) showed reduced SSI with adhesives versus sutures or staples; since none of these studies noted increased SSI with topical adhesives, we recommend selectively using topical adhesives for skin closure (in addition to or for replacement of traditional dermal closure) when approximation of the wound edges is feasible and for patients at higher risk for SSI; however, a Cochrane review stated that sutures were preferred to adhesives with regard to wound dehiscence and that there was no difference in SSI, and the International Conference on Orthopedic Infections did not recommend topical adhesives because they can be associated with hypersensitivity reactions and do not lower SSI rates in orthopedic procedures.

### Fibrin sealant: past, present, and future: a brief review [^116vHBhz]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Fibrin sealant is a two-component topical hemostat, sealant, and tissue adhesive consisting of fibrinogen and thrombin that has been used in the United States as a blood bank- or laboratory-derived product since the 1980s and has been commercially available since 1998.

Methods/Results

Initially, surgeons employed hospital-based materials because of the lack of availability of a commercially produced agent. At present, there are five U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved forms including products derived from pooled or autologous human plasma as well as bovine plasma. On-label indications include hemostasis, colonic sealing, and skin graft attachment. Recent clinical and experimental uses include tissue or mesh attachment, fistula closure, lymphatic sealing, adhesion prevention, drug delivery, and tissue engineering.

Conclusions

The modern literature on fibrin sealant now exceeds 3000 articles and continues to expand. This brief review presents the history of this material, its present clinical use, and its future applications.

### Barbed sutures and skin adhesives improve wound closure in hip and knee arthroplasty [^115zf6ME]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to formulate evidence-based recommendations for optimising wound management in hip and knee arthroplasty by exploring alternative methods such as barbed sutures and skin adhesives.

Methods

A Delphi panel, comprising seven orthopaedic surgeons, one musculoskeletal infectious disease specialist, and one health economics expert, was convened to evaluate the use of barbed sutures and skin adhesives for wound closure in hip and knee arthroplasty. Two systematic reviews informed the development of questionnaires, with panelists ranking their agreement on statements using a 5-point Likert scale. Consensus was achieved if ≥ 75% agreement. Unresolved statements were revisited in a second round.

Results

Consensus was reached on 11 statements, providing evidence-based recommendations. The expert panel advocates for a multilayer watertight technique using barbed sutures to prevent surgical site infections (SSI), reduce complications, shorten surgical times, optimise resources and improve cosmetic appearance. For skin closure, the panel recommends topical adhesives to decrease wound dehiscence, enhance cosmetic appearance, promote patient compliance, prevent SSIs, and optimise resources.

Conclusion

The Delphi consensus by Italian total joint arthroplasty experts underscores the pivotal role of barbed sutures and skin adhesives in optimising outcomes. While guiding clinical decision-making, these recommendations are not prescriptive and should be adapted to local practices. The study encourages further research to enhance current evidence.

Level Of Evidence

### The use of silicone adhesives for scar reduction [^114egSBo]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Significance: This article discusses the history and developments of silicone gel sheeting (SGS) scar therapy. Furthermore, we review a breadth of literature to gain an insight into how and why topical silicone gels remain the favored treatment of medical experts in scar management. We also analyze an ever increasing number of alternative therapies claiming to provide enhanced scar reduction performance. Recent Advances: Topical silicone gel treatments seem to remain the first point of clinical recommendation in scar management. SGS has been used in scar therapy for over 30 years, during which its efficacy has been the subject of numerous clinical evaluations. Critical Issues: While the exact mechanisms by which SGS improves hypertrophic scars, keloid development and recovery are yet to be fully agreed upon, its ability to do so remains largely undisputed at present. However, there still is ongoing deliberation over the exact mechanism of action of silicone in improving a scar. At present it is likely that through occlusion of the scar site and hydration of the wound bed, the overactivity of scar-related cells is suppressed, and their activity normalized. Future Direction: The clinical support of topical silicone gel products, relative to all alternative scar therapies, is considered the internationally recommended first-line form of scar management, and favored by consensus among healthcare professionals. However, there still remains the need for further clinical evidence and a better understanding of the mechanism behind the benefit of silicone gel for use in the prevention of abnormal scarring.

### Testing the effects of topical skin care products on tumor treating fields (TTFields) adhesiveness of arrays and delivery of electric currents [^112GWtDy]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, prophylaxis for skin care has the potential to prevent or reduce TTFields device-related skin AEs. When skin AEs do occur, they should be managed to prevent exacerbation to more severe forms of skin AEs, using topical skin care products carefully selected so they will not compromise TTFields delivery. Implementing proactive measures for skin care with an appropriate agent are necessary to maintain patient QoL and increase device usage for better treatment effectiveness. Our study examined the feasibility of using commercially available topical skin care products during TTFields delivery. The concordance between the clinical and preclinical results confirms the use of the high throughput preclinical approach to extrapolate the feasibility of using topical skin care products that have not yet been tested on humans. The next step will be to test these topical skin care products on patients receiving TTFields therapy, to offer insights into the prevention of skin AEs.

### Patterns of use of topical skin adhesives in the emergency department [^1133Cd7P]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to determine patterns of use of topical skin adhesives (TSA) for laceration repair. The authors hypothesized that TSA use would be more common in children and facial lacerations.

Methods

This was a structured retrospective chart review. The setting was a suburban, university-based emergency department (ED) with an emergency medicine (EM) residency; the annual census is 85,000 visits. Charts from consecutive patients presenting with lacerations in the summer of 2008 (June 2008 through August 2008) were reviewed. Demographic, clinical, and wound characteristics were extracted from electronic medical records by trained investigators using structured data collection forms. Characteristics of lacerations repaired with TSA or other closure devices were compared with bivariate and multivariate analyses using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

A total of 755 patients presented to the ED with lacerations over the study period, of whom primary closure was used in 667; nine were excluded because the method of closure was unknown. The most common methods of laceration closure were sutures (485), adhesives (88), and staples (86). Adhesives were used to close 27% of facial lacerations, compared to 4% of all other body locations (difference = 23%, 95% CI = 18% to 29%), and in 20% of pediatric versus 8% of adult lacerations (difference = 13%, 95% CI = 7% to 18%). Adjustment for other potential patient and wound characteristics showed that adhesives were more likely to be used to close facial lacerations (OR = 10.0 CI, 95% CI = 5.5 to 18.0) and lacerations in children (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1 to 3.0) and less likely to be used as laceration length increased (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4 to 0.8). Adhesive use was not statistically associated with patient sex or race, laceration edges or shape, or the need for deep sutures. Forty-three percent of adhesive wounds were closed with no anesthetic, and a topical agent was used in another 48%. In contrast, a local anesthetic agent was injected in 87% of sutured wounds (p < 0.001) and 73% of stapled wounds (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Topical skin adhesives are used more often for children, facial lacerations, and short lacerations. Use of adhesives may improve patient comfort as need for injecting a local anesthetic is reduced.

### Open-label adhesion performance studies of a new lidocaine topical system 1.8% versus lidocaine patches 5% and lidocaine medicated plaster 5% in healthy subjects [^1161N7Q7]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Adhesion is a critical attribute of a topical system, in addition to efficacy and safety, and it is important that the product maintains adhesion throughout the indicated wear period. The lidocaine topical system 1.8% met this standard in three different studies and performed better than comparator products with the same indications and wear time (12 hours). This was attributed to its unique drug-in-adhesive nonaqueous polymer system specifically formulated to maintain tackiness over time while delivering comparable levels of the drug to the lidocaine patch 5% and generic product. To our knowledge, Studies 2 and 3 reported here are the first adhesion performance studies to directly compare four prescription products currently available for the topical delivery of lidocaine. The high degree of adhesion (≥ 90%) observed in more than 90% of subjects at the end of 12 hours of product administration in Study 1 is a benchmark performance attribute for this product type.

Despite the fact that topical and transdermal drug delivery systems have been in clinical use for several decades, concerns about product adhesion to skin and how this may affect drug dosing persist. The effective dose absorbed from a topical or transdermal system can be affected by many factors, including characteristics related to the product's adhesion performance, the total surface area of application (which may be affected by partial lifting), and the duration of application (affected by total product loss). Using the parameter of actual percent adhesion, these results demonstrate significant superiority of adhesion performance over 12 hours for the lidocaine topical system 1.8% versus all 3 comparator products: lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine medicated plaster 5%, and generic lidocaine patch 5%. Given the improvement in adhesion performance using percent adhesion, the use of percent adhesion assessments in addition to, or in replacement of, the FDA 5-point scale should be considered, especially in comparative studies where the FDA scale may not have sufficient sensitivity to discern meaningful differences in adhesion performance.

Box 1
Problems and Issues Related to Adhesion of Transdermal and Topical Formulations

Adhesion data is generally unavailable or unpublished for most existing patch systems. Experts and regulatory authorities have called for the inclusion of adhesion studies in Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs). European guidelines for generic patch systems require a demonstration of non-inferior in vivo adhesion performance.FDA is addressing this issue and has issued a Draft Guidance to Industry on Adhesion with Transdermal and Topical Delivery Systems for ANDAs. The draft guidance recommends human in vivo testing of adhesion using a scoring system of 0–4. Patches are applied to skin and adhesion is scored at various time points. A score of 0 equals 90% or greater adhesion (essentially no lifting) over the testing period, score of 1 equals 75–90% adherence, a score of 2 equals 50–75% adherence, a score of 3 equals less than 50% adherence but the patch has not fallen off and a score of 4 is given for detached patches. The scores are measured at various times after the application up to and including the maximum time the patch is to be applied. In these tests, the new patch is to be compared to the existing approved reference patch and the new patch should have adherence at least comparable to the reference patch. To our knowledge, only the most recently approved DIA patch system, the 1.8% lidocaine patch, reports on these adhesion studies in its prescribing information.

### Testing the effects of topical skin care products on tumor treating fields (TTFields) adhesiveness of arrays and delivery of electric currents [^115PXrvD]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We tested commercially available topical skin care products, suggested for treating TTFields device-related skin AEs, for their effect on arrays adhesiveness and the delivery of the electric current. While several publications have presented guidance for management of device-related AEs based on the authors' clinical experience, the current study aimed to identify skin care products that can be used without compromising treatment effectiveness. We developed two high-throughput screening methods of topical skin care products in rats and then validated the results in humans for a few selected compounds.

We tested topical skin care products that had different medical uses and that are frequently recommended by dermatologists as prophylactic measures or for the treatment of device-related skin irritation. These products included topical antimicrobials, topical corticosteroids, anti-eczema/anti-itching products, skin barriers/wound healing agents, and moisturizers. Of note, we categorized the different examined compounds into five major groups based on the primary medical use of each. However, some of the compounds have more than one use and hence may also belong to another medical use group. Most of the compounds we tested were creams, as these are most convenient for patient use; however, we also tested a few compounds with other application methods, mainly gels, sprays, and ointments.

The preclinical tests identified products that did not interfere with TTFields treatment in each of the medical use groups. Topical skin care products that significantly reduced array adhesiveness and electrical currents contained an electrical insulator/lipid component (e.g. zinc oxide, aluminum-magnesium oxide, polymerized siloxane, mineral/seed oil, glycerol, paraffin, Vaseline, or petrolatum) as the major ingredient. Accordingly, ointments were most associated with a reduction in peeling force and electrical currents, as these are mainly based on hydrophobic vehicle components, whereas creams are an emulsion of oil and water, and gels and sprays are mainly water-based. However, this does not mean that such ingredients should be avoided altogether. Skin products may not interfere with TTFields delivery when these ingredients are not the dominant component.

The goal of this study was to examine the effects of commercially available topical skin care products on the adhesiveness of TTFields arrays and delivery of TTFields electric current, and to determine which may be considered by the treating physician to alleviate device-related skin irritation without compromising treatment effectiveness. An animal-based model was used for initial screening of a large group of compounds, and subsequent human studies validated the findings for a few selected products.

### Comprehensive review of tissue adhesives [^1125Bj76]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cyanoacrylates, also known as tissue adhesives or skin glues, are commonly used as sealants for lacerations and incisions and have found utility in excisional and cosmetic surgeries in both outpatient and operating room settings.

Objective

To review the surgical literature on the utilities, advantages, disadvantages, and special uses of cyanoacrylates applicable to dermatology.

Materials and Methods

PubMed was reviewed for relevant articles related to cyanoacrylates and their use in skin closures. Articles unrelated to cutaneous closures were excluded.

Results

Tissue adhesives polymerize to a water resistant, pliable film after application to approximated wound edges and have antibacterial properties. Adhesives slowly slough off as the wound heals, typically after 5 days. Compared with 5–0 nonabsorbable suture, adhesives provide similar tensile strength and similar patient and surgeon satisfaction. Although slightly more expensive than sutures, tissue adhesives obviate the need for wound dressings and suture removal. They do not perform as well as sutures for wounds under higher tension or in the setting of moisture and inadequate hemostasis.

Conclusion

Cyanoacrylates serve as a safe and effective suture alternative in appropriate dermatologic surgeries and procedures.

### A comparative study of the surgically relevant mechanical characteristics of the topical skin adhesives [^111MtCY2]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Topical skin adhesives (TSAs) offer a noninvasive alternative to sutures. The growing trend is to use them in addition to sutures and staples to add strength and provide a microbial barrier. The authors compared the mechanical characteristics of recently approved TSAs that are most likely to be of surgical relevance in the emergency department.

Methods

Linear incisions were made on anesthetized swine and the wounds were approximated with one of six commercially available TSAs. Three-dimensional bursting strength was measured with a BTC-2000TM device. Tensile failure force was measured ex vivo using TSA-approximated porcine skin strips with a tensionometer. Resistance to cyclic loading was measured by subjecting approximated skin strips to repetitive cycles of rotational torque and linear tension. Viscosity was measured with a viscometer and setting times were measured by periodically dabbing the adhesive applied to skin strips with a cotton swab to determine whether it was dry.

Results

Dermabond Advanced TSA provided significantly (p < 0.00001) greater acute in vivo wound bursting strength and ex vivo tensile force, greater mean number of normal tensile loading cycles to failure (while under continuous torsional cycling), and longest time to failure, and the mean setting time was the shortest.

Conclusions

Of all the TSAs tested in this study, Dermabond Advanced was the strongest and most flexible, set in the shortest time, and was a fairly viscous adhesive, all of which are clinically desirable characteristics.

### Delphi consensus on intraoperative technical / surgical aspects to prevent surgical site infection after colorectal surgery [^115pmkkT]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Sutures compared with staples

Statement 10: There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of staples or subcuticular sutures for skin closure to reduce SSIs.

It is uncertain whether the use of sutured or stapled skin closure impacts SSI risk after CRS. Three RCTs found that intracutaneous/subcuticular sutures were associated with similar SSI rates after elective gastrointestinal (GI) surgery, open laparotomy, and elective CRS. - One RCT has reported that subcuticular sutures were associated with significantly lower SSIs compared with staples in a subgroup of patients undergoing lower GI surgery, but this difference was not observed in the overall SSI rate after elective open GI surgery. A propensity score analysis in elective colorectal resection also noted that subcuticular sutures were associated with significantly lower incisional SSI rates. However, the use of subcuticular sutures may be a proxy for surgical procedures in which there is less contamination, shorter incisions, and fewer unexpected findings, which are associated with lower SSI rates. Based on the available evidence, it is difficult to recommend one approach over another for CRS.

There are various other considerations, beyond an SSI risk, when choosing between sutures or staples. Staples and interrupted sutures are easy to remove when an SSI has developed to allow for free drainage and so may be advantageous in high-risk patients, although this was contested by some panel members. Alternatively, subcuticular absorbable sutures do not hinder local opening of an infected incision for drainage of localized pus. Furthermore, metal staples typically require removal at a later outpatient encounter, which may increase postoperative healthcare use and hospital visits. This may be particularly important in the era of COVID-19, where limiting hospital exposure is paramount. If cosmetic aspects are also considered, patients may prefer subcuticular sutures.

Topical skin adhesives

Statement 11: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical skin adhesives for superficial closure in reducing SSI.

Topical skin adhesives, also known as skin glues, are used in superficial skin closure to approximate wound edges of a surgical incision and have been shown to limit microbial penetration in a preclinical study. The potential benefits of topical skin adhesives in reduction of SSI has been noted in plastic and orthopedic surgery; however, further studies are required to understand the potential benefit in CRS.

### Preventive skin care [^11199jWw]. NPIAP (2025). High credibility.

Preventive skin care — leave-on topical skin products recommendation: We make no recommendation on the routine use of leave-on topical skin products to prevent pressure injuries. (Very low certainty of evidence) The Guideline Governance Group noted the desirable and undesirable effects, and the very low certainty of the evidence, and due to the lack of evidence that fully elucidated any mechanism by which leave-on topical skin products could influence PI development, the Guideline Governance Group determined that no recommendation could be made about the use of leave-on topical skin products for preventing PIs.

### Testing the effects of topical skin care products on tumor treating fields (TTFields) adhesiveness of arrays and delivery of electric currents [^1158TygX]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Importantly, identification of topical skin care products that do not interfere with TTFields delivery across medical use groups provides flexibility in prescribing a wide selection of treatments tailored to the management of TTFields device-related skin AEs. Importantly, while it is advised to avoid the use of specific compounds that may reduce treatment effectiveness during the course of TTFields delivery, such compounds may still be applied during treatment breaks as long as they are removed before array placement. Previously, the benefit of a fractionated schema protocol introducing intentional treatment breaks to allow active preventing approaches with topical skin care products was described. However, care should be given to the amount of time off treatment since survival benefit from TTFields increases with duration-of-use.

The work described in this study has a few limitations. First, TTFields delivery was evaluated at a frequency of 200 kHz, while 150 kHz is also clinically relevant. As TTFields frequency does not affect array adhesiveness nor electric currents, the outcomes are not expected to change for a different TTFields treatment frequency. Additionally, incidence of skin AEs in clinical studies was independent of the applied frequency, supporting the extrapolation of results at 200 kHz into other frequencies. Secondly, testing of the topical skin care products in humans was performed on the thighs for practical reasons, whereas TTFields are applied to the scalp, thorax, or abdomen in the therapeutic setting. While array adhesiveness and currents may be different on different body parts, the percentage changes are likely generalizable. Thirdly, although a broad panel of 34 topical products was tested, some clinically relevant agents (such as hydrocortisone) were not included, and should be tested in future work. Finally, testing was performed in healthy volunteers under short-term TTFields exposure, which may not fully reflect patients with TTFields device-related skin reactions or the effects of repeated, long-term use. Of note, the study was designed to examine technical endpoints of array adhesion and current delivery, without assessing clinical outcomes such as skin tolerability, adverse event severity, patient adherence, or skin care product effectiveness. Future studies in patients receiving TTFields therapy are warranted to confirm whether the findings translate to improved skin management and tolerability in the clinical setting.

### Laceration management [^111h4Grk]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Traumatic lacerations to the skin represent a fairly common reason for seeking emergency department care. Although the incidence of lacerations has decreased over the past decades, traumatic cutaneous lacerations remain a common reason for patients to seek emergency department care.

Objective

Innovations in laceration management have the potential to improve patient experience with this common presentation.

Discussion

Studies have confirmed that delays in wound closure rarely confer increased rates of infection, although comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic renal failure, obesity, human immunodeficiency virus, smoking, and cancer should be considered. Antibiotics should be reserved for high-risk wounds, such as those with comorbidities, gross contamination, involvement of deeper structures, stellate wounds, and selected bite wounds. Topical anesthetics, which are painless to apply, have a role in select populations. In most studies, absorbable sutures perform similarly to nonabsorbable sutures and do not require revisit for removal. Novel atraumatic closure devices and expanded use of tissue adhesives for wounds under tension further erode the primacy of regular sutures in wound closure. Maintaining a moist wound environment with occlusive dressings is more important than previously thought. Most topical wound agents are of limited benefit.

Conclusions

Recent innovations in wound closure are allowing emergency physicians to shift toward painless, atraumatic, and rapid closure of lacerations.

### Testing the effects of topical skin care products on tumor treating fields (TTFields) adhesiveness of arrays and delivery of electric currents [^114TTwrZ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy is an approved cancer treatment, delivered to patients continuously via arrays applied to the skin surrounding the tumor region. The delivery of treatment by skin-adherent arrays creates an inherent risk of skin irritation. Implementing proactive measures for skin care with appropriate agents is necessary to maintain patient quality-of-life and increase device usage for better treatment effectiveness. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of commercially available skin care products on array adhesiveness and electric current delivery, to determine which may be used to alleviate device-related skin irritation without compromising treatment effectiveness.

Methods

We tested skin care products that are customary for the treatment of skin adverse events (AEs), including skin barriers, topical corticosteroids, anti-itching products, wound healing agents, and topical antimicrobials. We also tested moisturizers, recommended for preserving good skin health. We performed a wide screen on 34 compounds in animal models, and then validated the results in humans for 8 of the compounds.

Results

The preclinical tests identified 24 compounds that did not interfere with TTFields delivery, coming from the various medical use groups. Those that significantly reduced array adhesiveness and electrical conduction contained an electrical insulator/lipid component as the major ingredient. The results from the human study were in concordance with the preclinical results.

Conclusions

This study identified, under controlled conditions, a selection of commercially available skin care products that do not compromise TTFields delivery and hence may serve as candidates for managing skin AEs in TTFields-treated patients.

### Open-label adhesion performance studies of a new lidocaine topical system 1.8% versus lidocaine patches 5% and lidocaine medicated plaster 5% in healthy subjects [^115EH7N4]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The lidocaine topical system 1.8% was well tolerated throughout the studies, with no unacceptable skin irritation necessitating early removal. The mild irritation observed in Studies 1 and 3 shortly after product removal spontaneously resolved within 2 hours, suggesting that this is a transient effect, most likely associated with mechanical removal of the product and improved adhesion. The results confirm the safety and tolerability profile of lidocaine topical patch products. These qualities make lidocaine topical products an attractive option for treating frail and elderly patients with PHN. The superior adhesion of the lidocaine topical system 1.8% compared with three comparator lidocaine products may offer patients' advantages with regard to effective drug delivery, safety, and convenience — especially for older individuals with mobility or physical limitations — with the potential to increase patient compliance.

Assessment every 3 hours during the 12-hour periods of product wear throughout these adhesion performance studies is consistent with best practices in FDA guidance and represents a strength of the study design. The uniform spacing of observations over time is recommended to avoid a disproportionate weighting of adhesion at early time points (when adhesion might be relatively better) and is a key factor for an accurate assessment.

Several limitations of these adhesion performance studies should be mentioned. The volunteer subjects in these studies ranged in age from 18 to 64 (median ages of 47 and 32 years in Studies 2 and 3, respectively) and were younger than the patient population most often diagnosed with PHN — individuals over the age of 60. These older patients may have distinct skin properties (texture, thickness, moisture, etc.) that could affect adhesion in a real-world setting. Unlike patients for whom these topical products are indicated, the healthy study subjects did not have or were not recovering from herpes zoster rash. The products studied here were applied to the lower, middle, or upper back, such placement was selected as a standardized area of administration and convenience for frequent assessments. It is not known whether their adhesive capacity can be extrapolated to other anatomical sites.

### A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-masked, multi-center clinical trial of medical adhesives for the closure of laparoscopic incisions [^1148NGoR]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To compare LiquiBand Surgical S (LB) (Advanced Medical Solutions Ltd, Plymouth, UK) with High Viscosity Dermabond (DB) (Ethicon Inc, Kirkland, Scotland) for the closure of laparoscopic wounds.

Design

Prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification I).

Setting

Multiple district hospitals.

Participants

A total of 433 subjects were enrolled between 2006 and 2009 at 4 investigational sites.

Interventions

In this study, LB, an octyl/butyl cyanoacrylate blend, and DB, an octyl-based cyanoacrylate, were compared for topical skin closure of laparoscopic port sites (www.clinicaltrials.gov; study identifier NCT00762905).

Main Results

High dermal apposition and cosmesis scores resulted from the use of both adhesives along with low rates of wound dehiscence and suspected infections. Masked evaluators and patients favored DB in the healing of the incisions (98.3% DB vs 93.9% LB, p < .05) and (97.2% DB vs 89.4% LB, p < .05). However, there was no difference in the overall satisfaction of the appearance of the wounds. LB was found to be significantly (p < .05) faster (LB = 32.1 seconds; DB, 50.3 seconds) and easier to use than DB, and surgical users were significantly more satisfied with using LB for wound closure.

Conclusion

The results of this trial show the efficacy of LB for the closure of topical skin incisions; LB was significantly faster, easier to use, and resulted in greater user satisfaction compared with DB.

### Testing the effects of topical skin care products on tumor treating fields (TTFields) adhesiveness of arrays and delivery of electric currents [^116WjPmQ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

The delivery of prolonged continuous treatment by skin-adherent arrays creates an inherent risk of skin irritation due to poor ventilation and excessive sweating underneath the arrays, the repeated shaving and adhesive tape tearing from the skin upon array replacements, and due to pressure and friction from the device during daily body movement.

Indeed, the main TTFields device-related adverse events (AEs) reported in clinical trials and real-world evidence has been mild to moderate skin irritation under the arrays. Early skin AEs do not impose significant treatment disturbance. However, in rare cases, improper monitoring and management can lead to exacerbation, which negatively impacts patient's quality-of-life (QoL) and compromises patient adherence to treatment. Severe forms of skin irritation may require treatment interruptions until resolution or even treatment discontinuation, reducing device usage time. The skin AEs may also affect practical aspects of treatment delivery, such as adhesion of the arrays to the skin.

Prophylactic strategies for preventing TTFields device-related skin AEs include maintaining skin health using moisturizers to ensure hydration and skin barriers to prevent damage, leaving the skin uncovered, and repositioning the arrays upon replacements. Management strategies for preventing exacerbation include regular monitoring with dermatologic care as needed, including skin barriers, topical corticosteroids, anti-itching products, wound healing agents, antiseptic solutions, or anti-microbials.

Since the electric fields of TTFields therapy are delivered into the body through the array–skin interface, special attention should be given to compounds applied topically at the location of the arrays to avoid compromising treatment effectiveness. Of note, TTFields application may cause heating under the arrays, hence the device is designed to measure the temperature and respond to prevent overheating. Device responses may include adjustments to reduce applied currents or even the complete cessation of current delivery (i.e. treatment break). Since treatment effectiveness is dependent on field intensity (i.e. electric current) and device usage (i.e. daily time on treatment), topical skin care products that introduce high resistance to the array–skin interface may cause excessive temperature elevation, potentially interfering with treatment effectiveness. Overall, skin AEs should be managed to preserve patient QoL and allow continued treatment; however, attention should be given to avoid topical skin care products that may compromise treatment effectiveness.

### Device evaluation, treatment, and explantation recommendations (DETER): review and best practices for managing neuromodulation device infections [^1152Quvp]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

However, it is crucial to distinguish superficial wound infection from an inflammatory reaction to skin glue or adhesive, suture allergy, and superficial skin irritation. The former may require antibiotics or explantation. In contrast, the latter will require the removal of the triggering agent and possibly the application of a topical steroid. Diagnostic imaging, such as ultrasound, is not necessarily recommended for superficial SSI, but can assist with determining whether there is deeper tissue involvement (see Figure 3). If a deep SSI is suspected, advanced imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be indicated (the latter if the neuromodulation system is MRI conditional).

### Expanded applications for octyl-2-cyanoacrylate as a tissue adhesive [^113PX4Jm]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The commercial introduction of octyl-2-cyanoacrylate as a medical-grade tissue adhesive was intended to be a rapid, painless, suture-free method for closure of simple lacerations and surgical wounds. The efficiency and therefore potential economic advantage of this material has led to further investigations of other possible indications. This glue has now been used in more than 100 different occasions for "off-label" applications including nailbed repair, skin graft fixation, temporary otoplasty, wound sealant, and other forms of wound closure. Complications are virtually nonexistent, and there has been no evidence of histotoxicity. The role of this material as an important reconstructive tool has not yet been delineated completely, but it appears to have no contraindications if used sensibly.

### Tape stripping: investigational, diagnostic, and therapeutic uses in dermatology [^112541vz]. Clinics in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Adhesive tape has been used in the scientific study of human skin for more than 90 years. Use of the tape stripping method in dermatology has aided the research and diagnosing of different skin diseases. Basic science, identification, and therapeutic interventions in skin diseases, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and melanoma, have been studied using this technique. Among many promising applications that will be discussed throughout this contribution, the pigmented lesion assay will be discussed in depth in relation to melanoma. This product carries considerable and significant research toward early detection of melanoma. Tape stripping is unique and advantageous in its ability to provide a nonsurgical approach to evaluating the human epidermis. The cellular and molecular components of the skin are used to diagnose different skin conditions without invasive skin biopsy.

### Characteristics of analgesic patch formulations [^112m4TPT]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Topical Analgesic Patch Systems

Analgesics used in prescription topical analgesic patch systems include lidocaine, lidocaine plus tetracaine, lidocaine plus prilocaine, capsaicin, and diclofenac. These systems are designed to deliver the drug locally, minimizing systemic exposure.

Prescription Lidocaine Patch Systems

Lidocaine blocks voltage-gated sodium channels involved in the propagation of action potentials. Lidocaine patch systems target these channels are expressed on A delta and C fibers, some of which are found in or just under the skin. Blockage reduces ectopic discharges thought to underlie certain aspects of persistent pain.

Lidocaine patch systems are indicated for the relief of pain associated with PHN. Clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of prescription lidocaine patch systems in PHN. There are also studies that show that topical lidocaine patch systems may be effective in relieving pain associated with other painful conditions such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, lower back pain, and osteoarthritis. These findings warrant further study. Lidocaine patches are generally regarded to have limited safety concerns. Application site reactions occur with the most common being skin irritation that is usually mild and transient.,

There are seven lidocaine patch systems marketed in the United States, the original 5% lidocaine patch and six others approved through the ANDA and 505(b)(2) pathways (Table 1). All seven are of the DIA design and are indicated for the treatment of pain associated with PHN. Lidocaine patch systems are applied for a 12-hour dosing period followed by a 12-hour off/rest period. A maximum of three patches can be applied at a time and they may be cut into smaller pieces.

Table 1
Characteristics and Composition of Prescription Lidocaine Topical Formulations

There are three patch types available (Table 1). The original 5% patch system and four generics have similar compositions, use acrylic-based PSAs, and each contains 700 mg of lidocaine in 14 g of adhesive mix. Another 5% patch differs in that it uses a PBI-based PSA adhesive and contains 140 mg of lidocaine in 2.8 g of adhesive. The remaining patch is a 1.8% lidocaine patch system. All are the same size (10 × 14 cm), although the last two patch systems described are considerably thinner than the others (Table 1).

### Triamcinolone acetonide cream kit (sanaDermRx SKin repair) [^111vMpNc]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients.

Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.

Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of any potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests, and for impairment of thermal homeostasis. If HPA axis suppression or elevation of the body temperature occurs, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, substitute a less potent steroid, or use a sequential approach when utilizing the occlusive technique.

Recovery of HPA axis function and thermal homeostasis are generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Occasionally, a patient may develop a sensitivity reaction to a particular occlusive dressing material or adhesive and a substitute material may be necessary.

Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).

If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.

These preparations are not for ophthalmic use.

### Characteristics of analgesic patch formulations [^112b4iGs]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Topical and transdermal formulations are a common means of pharmaceutical drug delivery. If a drug is able to penetrate transcutaneously, the skin is an ideal site for the delivery of medications for both local (topical) and systemic (transdermal) effects. The administration of analgesics through the skin poses several potential advantages to those administered orally including compliance, the ability to deliver a drug to a peripheral target site and more stable and sustained plasma levels. One method of drug delivery is with the use of patch formulations - also known as patch systems. Typically, transdermal patches deliver medications intended to reach the systemic circulation, whereas topical patches are designed to keep medication localized for targeted delivery in proximity to the application site. There are a variety of technologies and materials utilized in patches, as well as penetration and formulation enhancers that ultimately affect the performance, efficacy and safety of the patch system. The degree of adherence to the skin is also of critical importance in drug delivery. Patches that lift up or fall off before the prescribed time period may represent a therapeutic failure and must be replaced, increasing patch utilization and cost to the healthcare system or to the patient. The added risk from accidental exposure makes poor patch adhesion a safety issue as well. A variety of analgesics are currently available as patch formulations including local anesthetics, capsaicin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. This review will highlight each of those patch delivery systems and introduce newer patch technologies that lend towards improved adhesion and compliance. Understanding the designs, limitations and benefits of patch systems will allow clinicians to select between these therapies when appropriate for their patients.

### Tissue adhesives for closure of surgical incisions [^114YyMH4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Sutures (stitches), staples and adhesive tapes have been used for many years as methods of wound closure, but tissue adhesives have entered clinical practice more recently. Closure of wounds with sutures enables the closure to be meticulous, but the sutures may show tissue reactivity and can require removal. Tissue adhesives offer the advantages of an absence of risk of needlestick injury and no requirement to remove sutures later. Initially, tissue adhesives were used primarily in emergency room settings, but this review looks at the use of tissue adhesives in the operating room/theatre where surgeons are using them increasingly for the closure of surgical skin incisions.

Objectives

To determine the effects of various tissue adhesives compared with conventional skin closure techniques for the closure of surgical wounds.

Search Methods

In March 2014 for this second update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. We did not restrict the search and study selection with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We conducted screening of eligible studies, data extraction and risk of bias assessment independently and in duplicate. We expressed results as random-effects models using mean difference for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We investigated heterogeneity, including both clinical and methodological factors.

Main Results

This second update of the review identified 19 additional eligible trials resulting in a total of 33 studies (2793 participants) that met the inclusion criteria. There was low quality evidence that sutures were significantly better than tissue adhesives for reducing the risk of wound breakdown (dehiscence; RR 3.35; 95% CI 1.53 to 7.33; 10 trials, 736 participants that contributed data to the meta-analysis). The number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome was calculated as 43. For all other outcomes - infection, patient and operator satisfaction and cost - there was no evidence of a difference for either sutures or tissue adhesives. No evidence of differences was found between tissue adhesives and tapes for minimising dehiscence, infection, patients' assessment of cosmetic appearance, patient satisfaction or surgeon satisfaction. However there was evidence in favour of using tape for surgeons' assessment of cosmetic appearance (mean difference (VAS 0 to 100) 9.56 (95% CI 4.74 to 14.37; 2 trials, 139 participants). One trial compared tissue adhesives with a variety of methods of wound closure and found both patients and clinicians were significantly more satisfied with the alternative closure methods than the adhesives. There appeared to be little difference in outcome for different types of tissue adhesives. One study that compared high viscosity with low viscosity adhesives found that high viscosity adhesives were less time-consuming to use than low viscosity tissue adhesives, but the time difference was small.

Authors' Conclusions

Sutures are significantly better than tissue adhesives for minimising dehiscence. In some cases tissue adhesives may be quicker to apply than sutures. Although surgeons may consider the use of tissue adhesives as an alternative to other methods of surgical site closure in the operating theatre, they need to be aware that sutures minimise dehiscence. There is a need for more well designed randomised controlled trials comparing tissue adhesives with alternative methods of closure. These trials should include people whose health may interfere with wound healing and surgical sites of high tension.

### Characteristics of analgesic patch formulations [^117GLaEP]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Poor adhesion is a commonly reported issue with lidocaine patch systems; approximately 70% of the concerns about lidocaine patch systems reported to the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System are in regard to poor product adhesion. Other patch system products such as buprenorphine, fentanyl or nicotine patch systems have much lower rates of concerns about adhesion. Online consumer complaint threads are filled with comments and reports about poor adhesion of some prescription lidocaine patch systems.–Adhesion studies, using the human in vivo adhesion testing protocols described above, demonstrate that the 1.8% lidocaine patch has superior adhesion compared to the original reference 5% patch and the 5% lidocaine PBI-based patch.

Lidocaine Patch Systems in Combination with Tetracaine or Prilocaine

These patches containing multiple local anesthetics are indicated to provide local dermal analgesia for superficial venous access, injections and superficial dermatological procedures such as excision, electrodesiccation and shave biopsy of skin lesions.

The lidocaine/tetracaine topical patch contains 70 mg of lidocaine and 70 mg of tetracaine. It is applied for short times, 20–30 minutes, before removal and starting the procedure. This patch system is reported to contain metal in the backing material and must be removed before the patient undergoes an MRI.

A patch with similar indications and uses containing 25 mg prilocaine and 25 mg lidocaine is available is many countries outside of the USA. The patch is applied for 1–5 hours, depending upon the depth of analgesia desired. This patch has no warnings about removal before undergoing an MRI.

### Tissue adhesive, adhesive tape, and sutures for skin closure of paediatric surgical wounds: prospective randomized clinical trial [^111ZFGbd]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Skin closure of surgical wounds has traditionally been achieved using sutures. Tissue adhesive and adhesive tape are frequently used alternatives for skin closure in paediatric surgical and emergency settings because of their ease of application and rapid wound closure. Tissue adhesives, or adhesive glue, comprise a liquid cyanoacrylate compound that polymerizes on contact with moisture to form a flexible, haemostatic, and waterproof film, which seals the wound edges together. Adhesive tape can be used to approximate wound edges, traditionally in low-tension wounds. Although both tissue adhesive and adhesive tape are used for primary skin closure, they are often applied as an adjunct to subcuticular or dermal sutures, reinforcing the wound and acting as a dressing. Whilst tissue adhesive and adhesive tape are viable and established alternatives to sutures for wound closure in children, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that there is a paucity of evidence comparing tissue adhesive with adhesive tape, and these techniques have not been directly compared with sutures. Furthermore, the use of tissue adhesive and adhesive tape as an adjunct to sutures in children is supported by limited evidence, and this combination closure has not been compared directly with suturing alone.

The aim of this study was to compare three common skin closure techniques in children undergoing elective surgical procedures in a prospective RCT. These included sutures with tissue adhesive, sutures with adhesive tape, and sutures alone. It was hypothesized that there would be no difference between the three intervention arms for evaluated endpoints.

### ASRA pain medicine consensus practice infection control guidelines for regional anesthesia and pain medicine [^113nv3CV]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Skin closure materials — synthetic, monofilament sutures have the lowest risk of harboring bacteria and this may contribute to a reduced risk of infection (Level of certainty: high). For skin closure in wounds at high risk for dehiscence, sutures are better than tissue adhesives for minimizing wound dehiscence (Level of certainty: low), and well-approximated wound edges during skin closure may decrease SSI (Level of certainty: moderate). Monofilament sutures should be considered instead of multifilament sutures for superficial skin closure, and if the risk of dehiscence is low, monofilament sutures may also be used for deep closure of contaminated wounds and in deep regions considered at high risk for infection (Evidence: grade C). The use of sutures or staples for skin closure does not appear to alter infection rates (Evidence: grade C). Selective use of tissue adhesives for skin closure, in the presence of optimal skin edge approximation, may be considered; however, it is unclear at present if there is an impact on SSI with the use of tissue adhesives, and if wound dehiscence is a concern, sutures would be the first option. Triclosan-coated sutures can be considered in patients at highest risk for SSI (Evidence: grade C).

Patch System Attributes

Attributes of specific patch systems affect their product performance. Patch liners, drug layers, backing and adhesive components all play a role in effective drug delivery by the patch.

Adhesion – A Safety, Efficacy, and Quality Attribute of Patch Systems

Whether or not the system adheres to the skin is critical for the efficacy and safety of all topical and transdermal patch systems. The adhesive material must be non-irritating and non-sensitizing to the skin. Three related fundamental attributes of patch adhesion are tack, shear and peel. Tack is the ability of the patch to adhere quickly and with light pressure to all types of skin on initial contact. Manufacturers therefore describe the adhesives in patch systems as "pressure-sensitive adhesives" (PSAs). Patch systems must also exhibit shear adhesion or holding power. The PSA must allow the patch to adhere strongly to the skin for the prescribed application period while resisting tangential shear stress and environmental factors. Prescription analgesic patch systems have prescribed application times ranging from 30 minutes to 7 days. Skin and body movements, along with clothes or other wearables (eg backpack, pocketbook) rubbing the patch, exert shear stress on the patch and can affect its adhesion, as can environmental factors like sweating, moisture, temperature, and bathing. Another attribute of concern is peel adhesion; when the patch is to be removed, it must be readily detachable without trauma to the skin while leaving a minimal amount of residue on the skin. The adhesive material must also be minimally irritating and non-sensitizing to the skin.

### Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives for skin closure in the outpatient setting [^111b74Rt]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Cyanoacrylate and fibrin tissue adhesives can aid the facial plastic surgeon performing surgery in the outpatient setting. Octyl-2-cyanoacrylate is ideal for superficial skin closure and eliminates the need for suture removal. Subcutaneous sutures are needed in most cases to provide the best cosmetic outcomes. Fibrin tissue adhesives can be used to aid in attaining hemostasis or to seal or fixate tissues. Cyanoacrylate and fibrin-based adhesives can simplify office-based facial plastic surgery.

### Preventive skin care [^1142PKFY]. NPIAP (2025). High credibility.

Preventive skin care — evidence gaps and research needs include that there is limited evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of preventive dressings used over time and on their incorporation into prevention plans over longer durations (e.g., more than six to eight weeks). There is limited recent evidence on low friction fabrics, including their use with topical skin products and preventive dressings, and more exploration of potential benefits, risks, and incorporation into care pathways is required. There is an overall paucity of research co-designed with consumers or that focusses on patient reported outcome measures, and a paucity of evidence for neonates and children. For leave-on topical products, there is limited evidence based on prespecified mechanisms of action; explanative proof-of-concept studies are warranted. The Guideline Governance Group noted there was no comparative evidence addressing the effectiveness of a hydrocolloid dressing used for preventing PIs versus no preventive dressing, or the effectiveness of a multilayered soft silicone foam dressing versus any other preventive dressing for anatomical locations other than the heel and sacrum. The Guideline Governance Group noted difficulties in evaluating leave-on topical skin products, citing discrepancies in product description/classification, no strong evidence on the mechanism by which a leave-on topical skin product prevents PI, and the need for future research, a transparent product classification system, and well-conducted clinical studies using clinically relevant head-to-head comparisons of major and widespread topical products.

### Should we be advising patients to use topical silicone gel for wound care following facial laceration suturing in the emergency department? [^112ssXxC]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

A short systematic review was undertaken to assess whether silicone gel improves cosmetic and symptomatic outcomes of scars following the suturing of traumatic facial lacerations in ED. A systematic keyword search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases returned two papers. The author, year, country, patient characteristics, study type, key outcomes and weaknesses were tabulated. The results indicate that silicone gel improves cosmetic and symptomatic outcomes when used for at least one month. However, the limited patient characteristics and short follow-up period indicate that larger studies are needed to provide further recommendations.

There was no significant difference in the frequency with each suture type was used for fascial closure between the three groups (P = 0.598) (Table 1).

Interim analysis

The interim analysis was conducted in 2017 with 82 patients and 95 wounds: 24 patients (26 wounds) in the tissue adhesive group, 28 patients (34 wounds) in the adhesive tape group, and 30 patients (35 wounds) in the sutures-alone group. There was no significant difference between groups for all evaluated outcomes.

Topical Capsaicin Patch System

Capsaicin is a phytochemical derived from hot chili peppers native to the Americas. It causes persistent activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptor, a calcium channel expressed in polymodal nociceptive fibers, mainly the C and A delta fibers. Activation of these channels leads to massive influx of Ca 2+ ions which triggers Ca-dependent proteases causing cytoskeletal breakdown, microtubule depolymerization, inhibition of electron-chain transport and mitochondrial dysfunction in these nerve fibers. This causes a loss of cellular integrity and "defunctionalization" of nociceptor fibers. The nerve fibers retract and this results in a highly localized loss of nerve fibers in the epidermis and dermis. Capsaicin lasts for a long-time, weeks, in skin. When it disappears, nerve regeneration takes weeks; thus, the effect on loss of nerves in skin lasts for an extended period of many weeks.

Capsaicin is available by prescription as an 8% patch that is indicated for the management of neuropathic pain associated with PHN in the USA and for broad neuropathic indication including DPN in Europe. The sponsor has recently filed for approval for the treatment of DPN in the US. This filing was mainly based upon a Phase III trial in patients with DPN. Data from a meta-analysis suggested that this high-dose topical capsaicin patch was effective for the treatment of both PHN and HIV-associated neuropathy compared to a low-dose control patch.

The patch systems are of a DIA design, 14 × 20 cm, and contain 179 mg of capsaicin and it uses a silicone-based PSA. The capsaicin patch is applied to the skin for a short time (1 hr) in a clinical setting, and can yield long-term pain relief. If the pain returns and requires treatment, reapplication can be repeated every 3 months. Requirements for the patch are good adhesion for 1 hr with minimal residue left behind after removal as capsaicin is a major skin irritant. It is recommended that the treatment area be pretreated with a topical anesthetic before the application of the patch. Common adverse events (AEs) occur at the application site and include erythema, pain, edema, and pruritus, with 75–96% of patients having application-site reactions. These application site effects are usually transient and resolve in 1–3 days.

### Effectiveness of securing central venous catheters with topical tissue adhesive in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a randomized controlled pilot study [^117UGwy9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The Dermabond dressing was firmly adherent but easily peeled off when the catheter needed to be removed. There have been some reports of abrasion, especially when the catheter is removed soon after administration. There have also been infrequent reports that topical tissue adhesives were associated with allergic contact dermatitis. With these positive and negative reports in mind, we decided to explore whether fixation of a CVC with Dermabond might decrease the rate of pericatheter leakage.

### Tissue adhesive for the topical approximation of skin-class II… [^115pr8Z7]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

1. Introduction This guidance document was developed as a special control to support the reclassification of tissue adhesive for the topical approximation of skin into class II. The device is intended for topical closure of surgical incisions, including laparoscopic incisions and simple traumatic lacerations that have easily approximated skin edges. This guidance document does not apply to tissue adhesives for non-topical uses. Tissue adhesive for the topical approximation of skin — Identification. A tissue adhesive for the topical approximation of skin is a device intended for topical closure of surgical incisions, including laparoscopic incisions, and simple traumatic lacerations that have easily approximated skin edges. Tissue adhesives for the topical approximation of skin may be used in conjunction with, but not in place of, deep dermal stitches.

Tissue adhesives polymerize at room temperature in an exothermic reaction on contact with a small amount of water or a basic fluid to form strong adhesive bonds with a variety of substrates. Various formulations can be manufactured that vary in viscosity, setting time, bond strength, degradation rate, and other physical and mechanical properties. Because these properties define the adhesive performance and utility of the final product, your description should discuss the molecular composition and structure of your compound. b. Material Characteristics of the Adhesive We recommend you provide the following information about the device, including your test methods:

- viscosity determination 8
- analysis of residual content of the components of bulk formation by, for example, gas chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, or mass spectrometry
- purity
- moisture determination
- setting time determination 9
- physical and mechanical testing
- shelf life determination
- sterility. Specifically, the degradation products of cyanoacrylate adhesives could accumulate in tissues and lead to significant histotoxicity characterized by both acute and chronic inflammation. The literature shows that the rate of formation of the formaldehyde decreases with increase in the length of alkyl groups and the molecular weight of the cyanoacrylate polymers. The tissue adhesive will not adhere to skin pre-coated with petroleum jelly. Therefore, avoid using petroleum jelly on any skin area where tissue adhesive is intended to adhere. 1 See, Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Format for Traditional and Abbreviated 510s 2 See, Device Advice: Premarket Notification 510.

### Preventive skin care [^113CzvCL]. NPIAP (2025). High credibility.

Preventive skin care — topical leave-on product effectiveness: The meta-analysis included nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a leave-on skin product to no leave-on product and showed a significantly lower rate of pressure injuries with topical leave-on products (16.7% versus 23.3%, RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.66, p < 0.001), translating to 112 fewer per 1,000 individuals experiencing a PI when used; however, it is very uncertain if this represents a true effect, with the true effect lying between 138 fewer and 79 fewer individuals experiencing a PI with a leave-on topical skin product.

### Wound complications are affected by different skin closure methods in primary hip and knee arthroplasty [^1173L7m8]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a lack of consensus on optimal skin closure and dressing strategies to reduce early wound complication rates after primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Methods

All 13,271 patients at low risk for wound complications undergoing primary, unilateral THA (7,816), and TKA (5,455) for idiopathic osteoarthritis at our institution between August 2016 and July 2021 were identified. Skin closure, dressing type, and postoperative events related to wound complications were recorded during the first 30 postoperative days.

Results

The need for unscheduled office visits to address wound complications was more frequent after TKA than THA (2.74 versus 1.78%, P < .001), and after direct anterior versus posterior approach THA (2.94 versus 1.39%, P < .001). Patients who developed a wound complication, had a mean of 2.9 additional office visits. Compared to the use of topical adhesives, skin closure with staples had the highest risk of wound complications (odds ratio 1.8 [1.07–3.11], P = 0.028). Topical adhesives with polyester mesh had higher rates of allergic contact dermatitis than topical adhesives without mesh (1.4 versus 0.5%, P < .0001).

Conclusion

Wound complications after primary THA and TKA were often self-limited but increased burden on the patient, surgeon, and care team. These data, which suggest different rates of certain complications with different skin closure strategies, can inform a surgeon on optimal closure methods in their practice. Adoption of the skin closure technique with the lowest risk of complications in our hospital would conservatively result in a reduction of 95 unscheduled office visits and save a projected $585,678 annually.

### A randomized, crossover, adhesion performance and pharmacokinetic study of a lidocaine topical system under conditions of water exposure in healthy subjects [^115RwLBP]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Topical systems, commonly referred to as patches, containing lidocaine are a well-established treatment for pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and other neuropathic pain conditions. Lidocaine is an amide local anesthetic agent that stabilizes neuronal membranes by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels, which are required for initiation and conduction of impulses. A novel lidocaine topical system (ZTlido ®, Scilex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Palo Alto, CA, USA) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the relief of pain associated with PHN in 2018. Each topical system contains 36 mg of lidocaine in a thin, nonaqueous adhesive matrix (18 mg per gram adhesive: 1.8%), with 10×14 cm dimension and 0.08 cm thickness. Lidocaine topical system 1.8% was developed to deliver a bioequivalent level of drug as Lidoderm ® (lidocaine patch 5%; Endo Pharmaceuticals, Malvern, PA, USA), a hydrogel patch containing 700 mg of lidocaine, which is also indicated for the treatment of PHN.

Lidocaine topical systems provide drug directly to the site of pain with low systemic exposure and therefore avoid some of the disadvantages of oral pain management therapies. This is important given the potential for adverse events (AEs) with oral medications used for PHN including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentinoids, anticonvulsants, and opioids. However, optimal drug delivery from a topical system can only be achieved if the system adheres to the skin. Lack of adhesion can compromise drug delivery resulting in poor compliance due to early treatment abandonment.

Regulatory agencies recommend evaluating the adhesion of topical systems to support drug approval and recognize in vivo adhesion studies as the most meaningful predictors of commercial drug product performance. Adhesion performance may be challenged by many real-world use conditions. In vitro and in vivo data have shown that external heat application can increase absorption of transdermal and topical drugs, including lidocaine. Exercise also can affect drug absorption, but previous studies with the lidocaine topical system 1.8% have shown moderate exercise does not have a major effect on drug absorption despite a small degree of product lifting. Water exposure is another variable that may compromise adhesion and the higher temperatures associated with bathing and showering could affect drug delivery.

### Preventive skin care [^116psf3q]. NPIAP (2025). High credibility.

Preventive skin care — scope of leave-on topical skin products for pressure injury (PI) prevention — the clinical question is, "Should a leave-on topical skin product versus no leave-on topical skin product be used to prevent PI occurrence in individuals at risk?" The document explains that commonly used terms to describe leave-on topical products are varied and may not accurately characterize the product, that products described as hyperoxygenated fatty acid-based preparations consist of esters from glycerol and different fatty acids and fatty acid is not the only defining product characteristic, and that descriptors such as 'cream' or 'moisturizer' are unclear because these mixtures have many ingredients and varied functions. Because of the huge number, variety and non-comparability of topical products, the Guideline Governance Group considered the use of any (topical) leave-on product, which includes all different kinds of oils, creams, emulsions etc. used specifically for PI prevention.

### A randomized, open-label, bioequivalence study of lidocaine topical system 1.8% and lidocaine patch 5% in healthy subjects [^116VkGNe]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2018, a novel topical system (ie, patches, now referred to as "topical systems" by the FDA) consisting of lidocaine dissolved in an organic acid/polyalcohol solvent system in a polymer-based adhesive matrix was FDA-approved for the relief of PHN pain (ZTlido ® [lidocaine topical system 1.8%], Scilex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Mountain View, CA). Each topical system contains 36 mg of lidocaine (1.8% = 18 mg per gram adhesive).

Similar to lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine topical system 1.8% was designed with a skin contact area of 140 cm 2 and is indicated to be worn for 12 hours per day (maximum of 3 topical systems per day). The nonaqueous formulation of lidocaine topical system 1.8% results in improved biopharmaceutical efficiency and drug delivery compared with lidocaine patch 5%, such that bioequivalent plasma levels are achieved with ~19-fold lower drug load (36 mg vs 700 mg) and lower strength (1.8% vs 5%). The lidocaine topical system 1.8% was developed to have optimal adhesion (ie, maintaining contact with the skin over the 12-hour administration period) and to be thinner and lighter than lidocaine patch 5% so that it can better adhere to contour-challenged areas of the body and maintain contact during normal activities and moderate exercise. A comparison of lidocaine topical system 1.8% and lidocaine patch 5% product attributes is provided in Table 1.

Table 1
Characteristics of Lidocaine Topical System 1.8% and Lidocaine Patch 5%

To characterize drug delivery with lidocaine topical system 1.8% compared with lidocaine patch 5%, 2 separate pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were performed in normal, healthy volunteers. Study 1 was designed to characterize the PK of lidocaine topical system 1.8%, including apparent dose, and Study 2 was designed to confirm comparable PK between lidocaine topical system 1.8% and lidocaine patch 5%. Safety, adhesion, and skin tolerability of both formulations were also assessed.

### Testing the effects of topical skin care products on tumor treating fields (TTFields) adhesiveness of arrays and delivery of electric currents [^116pc1pi]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

For the eight topical skin care products tested clinically, good concordance with the preclinical data was observed: (1) The Staquis ointment that showed a major decrease in array peeling force and a significant reduction in the electrical current in the preclinical tests prevented skin adherence of the array in the human study; (2) The other topical products, which did not compromise array adherence nor significantly reduce the currents in the animal studies, demonstrated no significant decrease in currents in the human studies (except for Esenta wipes, which nonetheless was associated with current reduction of less than 10%). Specifically, Calamine was associated with an increase in current in the majority of participants. For SensiCare and Dermovate there was a mild decrease in current with a narrow range of responses, indicating consistent results across all patients, making their responses easier to predict. For most participants the decrease in the current was less than 10%, and the mean and median decrease in current were less than 5%.

### Treatment with oestrogen or manual separation for labial adhesions-initial outcome and long-term follow-up [^116PjeyR]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Side-effects and indication for treatment

In total, 6% of those treated with oestrogen reported or had documented side-effects while none were reported/documented by those who underwent manual separation treatment. In the previous literature, short-term side-effects from topical oestrogen, such as breast development, vaginal bleeding, local skin irritation, rash and vulvar pigmentation were reported to be higher than our result, and present in 6–22%. Long-term side-effects after childhood are unknown, and there are no reports on side-effects after manual separation. The unknown long-term side effects of oestrogen must be considered when taking the decision to treat or not, and what treatment to use. Risks of topical oestrogen in adult women, e.g. with breast malignancies, are currently being discussed but there is no longitudinal study on children receiving topical oestrogen. Neither is there any longitudinal study on long-term side effects of treatment with manual separation.

Furthermore, there are no studies reporting on spontaneous resolution of adhesions and what happens in the long term if no treatment is prescribed. But in the light of that the final success rates after recurrences turn out to be quite low, and because of the parental hesitation to recommend the treatment, treatment should only be advocated if a strong indication is present, such as obstruction leading to urinary infections, or intense rash.

Overall, the chances of reaching a complete and permanent resolution of adhesions seem to increase if adhesions are thin and the treatment is combined with post-treatment prophylaxis and compliance is assured by close follow-up for several months.

Fingertip laceration care — povidone-iodine or another antimicrobial solution should be applied once analgesia has been achieved; size 6–0 or 7–0 absorbable sutures are typically used to reapproximate the laceration, and topical glue is an acceptable alternative. Management of simple lacerations may be completed by the family physician, whereas more complex or stellate lacerations should be referred to a hand surgeon.

### Tissue adhesive, adhesive tape, and sutures for skin closure of paediatric surgical wounds: prospective randomized clinical trial [^112gSG6n]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

This RCT demonstrated that wounds closed with sutures alone did not differ significantly in terms of evaluated outcomes from those closed with sutures and adjunctive tissue adhesive or adhesive tape. Although use of tissue adhesive as an adjunct to sutures was associated with poorer short-term wound cosmesis, this difference did not appear to be sustained in the long term. There was no significant difference between techniques for all other outcomes evaluated. Given that adjunctive skin closure appears to yield similar outcomes to use of sutures alone, and the substantially higher cost of materials and poorer short-term wound cosmesis associated with tissue adhesives, it may be preferable to use sutures alone or sutures with adhesive tape in preference to sutures with tissue adhesive.

### A comparison of a new skin closure device and intradermal sutures in the closure of full-thickness surgical incisions [^117LvxUk]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A novel topical skin adhesive system was developed to close the outermost layer of skin in an expeditious manner. To determine its clinical utility, a clinical investigation was undertaken to demonstrate equivalence of a new adhesive skin closure system (Prineo Skin Closure System) to intradermal sutures in wound closure.

Methods

The investigation included 83 patients who underwent elective abdominoplasty, circumferential body lift procedures, and breast reconstruction with deep inferior epigastric perforator flaps. Incisions were divided in half, and each half was randomized to wound closure with the new skin closure system, including a pressure-sensitive adhesive mesh tape for wound edge approximation and next-generation cyanoacrylate or intradermal sutures. Postoperative evaluations took place at 24 hours, 7 days, 12 to 25 days, 90 days, 6 months, and 12 months.

Results

The new skin closure system was found to be equivalent to intradermal sutures for the continuous approximation of wounds. The upper limit of the two-sided 90 percent confidence interval for difference in proportions was 10.9 percent. The mean time to closure for the new skin closure system was 1.46 minutes, approximately 5 minutes faster than that for intradermal sutures (p < 0.0001). Both treatments had similar incision healing and cosmetic outcomes. No quantitative or qualitative differences of clinical significance were evident between the treatment groups.

Conclusions

The Prineo Skin Closure System can be considered equivalent to intradermal sutures for full-thickness surgical incisions with regard to safety and effectiveness. The ease and speed of application contribute to shortened operative times (4.5 times faster than intradermal sutures).

### Effectiveness of securing central venous catheters with topical tissue adhesive in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a randomized controlled pilot study [^1176xm9X]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Central venous catheters (CVCs) play a role in critically ill patients who often require central venous pressure monitoring, pulmonary artery catheterization, transvenous cardiac pacing, and drug administration, among other techniques. However, CVC insertion is an invasive procedure that may lead to any one of several complications, such as pneumothorax, hematoma, pericatheter leakage, localized infection, and catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). The goal of CVC utilization is to facilitate medical treatment without complications.

From an anesthetic aspect, CVC is generally selected for patients at high operative risk, such as those scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery. These patients tend to have pericatheter leakage because most of them are at risk of bleeding from antiplatelet/anticoagulant medication exposure or due to cardiopulmonary bypass, and even massive blood loss is possible. Once pericatheter leakage occurs, it increases the risk of infection — both localized and CRBSI — due to oozing blood acting as a medium that allows bacterial overgrowth.

Currently, topical tissue adhesives, or "super glues" [e.g. octyl cyanoacrylate (Dermabond®) and n-butyl cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl®)], are widely used in the surgical field. A long-chain cyanoacrylic glue is available that can form a permanent thin film coating that binds to keratin in the epidermis, remaining intact for 5–10 days, after which it naturally sloughs off with the epithelia. The advantages of these glues are not only that they can tightly close a surgical wound (as an alternative to sutures or staples) but also that they prevent leakage and control bleeding.

Clinical studies have demonstrated that Dermabond maintained a catheter-to-nerve apposition in a patient under continuous interscalene nerve block and decreased pericatheter local anesthetic leakage in a patient undergoing continuous perineural infusion. Dermabond is also an effective barrier to microbial penetration by Gram-positive and Gram-negative motile and nonmotile species. In contrast, although Dermabond provides antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, it is ineffective against fungi and Gram-negative bacteria. Another report described the use of histoacryl to secure an epidural catheter and CVC. Moreover, Dermabond significantly increased the pull-out force in an experimental study, which may be an effective securement technique for intravascular catheters.

### Skin protectants made of curable polymers: effect of application on local skin temperature [^116JbvJu]. Advances in Wound Care (2017). Low credibility.

Innovation

Film-forming tissue adhesives based on cyanoacrylate chemistries have been available since the 1950s. The first FDA-approved product for human use was Dermabond ® (1998), cleared to approximate surgical wound edges. Variations in chemistries have led to different formulations and additional uses. The commonality between these cyanoacrylate-based products is their exothermic polymerization. The heat released may cause the patient to experience a burning sensation. This could be exacerbated in denuded skin such as is often seen with severe IAD. We present here a new formulation designed to mitigate this rise in temperature; the new skin protectant may potentially be more comfortable for patients by causing a drop in skin surface temperature instead of a rise during the curing process after application.

Key Findings
- A commercially available cyanoacrylate skin protectant causes an exothermic reaction lasting 4.5 min with a peak of +0.3°C on application to healthy human skin.
- A new skin protectant formulation designed to mitigate the rise in temperature causes an endothermic reaction lasting at least 6 min with a peak of −1.2°C on application to healthy human skin.
- The new skin protectant formulation causes a drop in skin surface temperature instead of a rise during the curing process that follows application.

### The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland consensus guidelines in emergency colorectal surgery [^113ZF5U2]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Irritant contact dermatitis from the stoma effluent usually takes the form of a mild rash of peristomal skin but can lead to ulceration. Allergic contact dermatitis towards the adhesive used in the stoma appliance can also occur. Many patients with peristomal skin complications may not recognize or self‐report these problems. A minority of around 20% may have exacerbation of pre‐existing skin diseases such as psoriasis and eczema.

A rare differential for peristomal ulceration is peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum, which is a neutrophilic dermatosis of unclear aetiology that is rare but most commonly occurs in patients with IBD. It is usually characterized by pain and undermined violaceous irregular borders. Investigations of the remaining bowel for signs of active IBD may be useful in patients with suspected peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum as the majority have active systemic disease at presentation.

The majority of these conditions are managed by expert stoma care nurses with the aim to remove or reduce the skin irritant and halt the progression of the condition. Topical corticosteroids can sometimes help. Peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum can be treated with topical steroids but often respond well to systemic immunosuppressive therapies. Difficult cases including those where a systemic dermatosis or peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum is suspected should be referred for specialist management by dermatology.

Question 7.11

Is there any indication for emergency surgery for peristomal skin problems?

Recommendation: There is no absolute indication for emergency surgery for peristomal skin conditions.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: D

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)

Rarely some patients may come to revisional surgery for peristomal skin complications. In nearly all cases this is planned as an elective or expedited procedure. In these cases, it is likely that the stoma may need to be re‐sited and, if any other complication such as retraction or parastomal hernia is thought to be contributing, then this requires addressing.

A number of case series of patients with peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum found that surgical closure of the stoma, if possible, cured the disease in all affected patients. In those in whom stoma closure was not feasible then resection of residual bowel with active inflammation also cured the large majority of patients but the disease recurred in 67% of patients treated with stoma revision and relocation as the sole procedure.

### Open-label adhesion performance study of a prescription lidocaine topical system 1.8% versus three lidocaine-containing over-the-counter patches in healthy subjects [^113ogBCQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Adhesion is a critical attribute of a topical delivery system (TDS) regardless of whether it is a prescription or OTC product, and is especially the case for drug-in-adhesive (DIA) systems such as the Reference (lidocaine topical system 1.8%) and OTC Test Products (lidocaine patches 4% (Test 1 and 2) and lidocaine + menthol patch 1%/4% (Test 3)) where the drug is in and delivered from the adhesive itself and lack of contact between the product and skin compromises proper delivery of drug to the skin to allow palliation of the indicated pain. A TDS product with poor adhesion performance also presents a safety risk as a detached product can be ingested by small children and pets, and a lifting patch can allow the transfer of drugs to clothing and bedding.

The lidocaine topical system 1.8% demonstrated target adhesion performance in previously reported studiesand replicated these findings here along with the demonstration of superior adhesion to three lidocaine-containing OTC patch products. This performance is attributed to its unique DIA nonaqueous polymer system specifically formulated to maintain tackiness over time optimizing skin contact over the 12-hour administration period. The contrast in performance between lidocaine topical system 1.8% and the comparator OTC Test Products is possibly attributed to the OTC Product not having undergone regulatory review or otherwise required to meet an adhesion performance standard (or other critical product attributes) in order to be on the market.

One (1) subject (4.6%) treated with the lidocaine topical system 1.8% experienced product detachment of 50% or greater compared with OTC Products Test 1 (lidocaine patch 4%) (50%), Test 2 (lidocaine patch 4%) (45.5%), or Test 3 (lidocaine (59.1%). More than one-third of subjects experienced substantial detachment (reduction to < 10% adhesion) of the generic lidocaine patch 5%. No lidocaine topical system 1.8% became completely detached, whereas 11, 7, and 6 detachments 50.0%, 31.8%, and 27.3%) were observed for OTC Products Test 1, Test 2, and Test 3, respectively.

### In vivo study of wound bursting strength and compliance of topical skin adhesives [^114uubhe]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Over the past decade, the use of topical skin adhesives (TSA) for wound closure has increased. Among TSA characteristics, strength and flexibility are most important. Prior studies have compared the wound bursting strengths (WBSs) of the cyanoacrylates immediately after wound closure. In this study the authors compared the WBS and flexibility of multiple TSAs immediately and up to 2 days after closure.

Methods

This was a controlled animal experiment. Two-centimeter incisions were created on both sides of 210 Sprague-Dawley rats and randomly closed with one of five commercially available TSAs (Dermabond [D], Indermil [I], Histoacryl [H], Liquiband [L], or GluStitch [G]). WBS and TSA flexibility were measured using the BTC-2000 device immediately after closure and at 1 and 2 days after closure. WBS and TSA flexibility were compared across groups with analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Results

Wound bursting strengths were higher (p < 0.05) at 0, 1, and 2 days for D (274, 388, 232 mm Hg) than for all other TSAs (I 182, 225, and 107; H 189, 214, and 69; L 146, 118, and 75; or G 161, 150, and 73). TSA flexibility was also greater (p < 0.05) at 0, 1, and 2 days for D (36, 27, and 29 mm Hg/mm) than for all other TSAs (I 18, 14, and 12; H 18, 13, and 15; L 19, 14, and 12; G 26, 23, and 18).

Conclusions

The octyl-cyanoacrylate-based adhesive is significantly stronger and more flexible than all the butyl-cyanoacrylate-based adhesives at 0, 1 and 2 days after closure.

### Tissue adhesive, adhesive tape, and sutures for skin closure of paediatric surgical wounds: prospective randomized clinical trial [^113kXvjz]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Study interventions

There was no alteration to the standard operative technique, although the wound closure technique was standardized. VICRYL ® (polyglactin 910; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA), or Polysorb ® (Covidien, Minneapolis, MN, USA), or PDS ® II (polydioxanone; Ethicon) was used for fascial closure depending on hospital supply and/or surgeon preference. All subcuticular sutures were Coated VICRYL RAPIDE™ (polyglactin 910; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) placed in a running fashion along the length of the wound and secured with a single buried Aberdeen knot. After randomization, either tissue adhesive, adhesive tape, or an occlusive film wound dressing was applied. For the tissue adhesive group, High Viscosity DERMABOND ® Topical Skin Adhesive (2-octylcyanoacrylate; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) was applied over the sutured wound in two or more layers with time allowed between each layer in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. For the adhesive tape group, Steri-Strip™ Reinforced Skin Closures 12 mm × 100 m (3 M Health Care, St Paul, MN, USA) adhesive tape was cut to size and applied over the sutured wound in a non-overlapping fashion perpendicular to the wound. For the sutures-alone group, Tegaderm™ Transparent Film Dressing Frame Style (3 M Health Care, St Paul, MN, USA) was applied over the sutured wound. In line with clinical practice in this department, wounds in the adhesive tape group were similarly covered with the same occlusive film dressing applied over the adhesive tape to create a waterproof barrier to prevent wound soiling and to prevent children from picking at the easily removed adhesive tape. To assess for differences in wound closure time, the time taken to close 10 inguinal skin incisions from each group was recorded from commencement of closure of Scarpa's fascia to dressing application. Before discharge, participants were informed about the skin closure technique used and provided a handout containing standardized wound care instructions.

### Preventive skin care [^115Wsooc]. NPIAP (2025). High credibility.

Preventive skin care — adverse events with leave-on topical skin products: In a meta-analysis comparing different leave-on topical skin products to placebo topical products for preventing pressure injuries, adverse events occurred at a higher rate with a leave-on topical skin product but were not statistically significant (0.6% versus 0%, RR 4.38, 95% CI 0.50 to 38.30, p = 0.18), with low certainty that this represented a true effect; evidence not specific to PI prevention further suggests that vegetable and seed oils should not be used in people with skin barrier impairments because disruption to the stratum corneum can lead to skin irritation and other adverse events.

### Which tissue adhesive for wounds? [^113C9R8x]. Injury (2003). Low credibility.

We studied the three available tissue adhesives comparing their ease of technique, wound healing, satisfaction, merits and complications when treating childhood lacerations. Children presenting with uncomplicated wounds < 2.5cm and < 6h since the injury were studied. There were 17 children in each group. Results were compared for the individual tissue adhesive and the technique-contact and non-contact. The application was considered pain free in 82% of the non-contact technique and 56% for the contact technique-pain in 18 and 44%, respectively (P = 0.062). Parents were satisfied in 88 and 94% for the contact and non-contact techniques, respectively (P = 0.505) and the authors in 76 and 94% (P = 0.119). The glove stuck to the wound in nine instances and was damaged once while breaking the container. The scab persisted in all scalp applications for 9–25 days. The adhesive effect was similar in all three. Indermil was considered to be the best among the three. Non-contact, droplet instillation (rather than contact application as was suggested for Dermabond and Histoacryl) was felt more comfortable.

### Evidence-based skin care in preterm infants [^115AKuub]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Most guidelines on neonatal skin care emphasize issues pertaining to healthy, term infants. Few address the complex task of skin barrier maintenance in preterm, very preterm, and extremely preterm infants. Here, we provide an evidence-based review of the literature on skin care of preterm neonates. Interestingly, the stratum corneum does not fully develop until late in the third trimester, and as such, the barrier function of preterm skin is significantly compromised. Numerous interventions are available to augment the weak skin barrier of neonates. Plastic wraps reduce the incidence of hypothermia while semipermeable and transparent adhesive dressings improve skin quality and decrease the incidence of electrolyte abnormalities. Tub bathing causes less body temperature variability than sponge bathing and can be performed as infrequently as once every four days without increasing bacterial colonization of the skin. Topical emollients, particularly sunflower seed oil, appear to reduce the incidence of skin infections in premature neonates-but only in developing countries. In developed countries, studies indicate that topical petrolatum ointment increases the risk of candidemia and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus infection in the preterm population, perhaps by creating a milieu similar to occlusive dressings. For preterm infants with catheters, povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine are comparably effective at preventing catheter colonization. Further studies are necessary to examine the safety and efficacy of various skin care interventions in premature infants with an emphasis placed on subclassifying the patient population. In the interim, it may be beneficial to develop guidelines based on the current body of evidence.

### Essentials of skin laceration repair [^113uX7h2]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Skin laceration repair is an important skill in family medicine. Sutures, tissue adhesives, staples, and skin-closure tapes are options in the outpatient setting. Physicians should be familiar with various suturing techniques, including simple, running, and half-buried mattress (corner) sutures. Although suturing is the preferred method for laceration repair, tissue adhesives are similar in patient satisfaction, infection rates, and scarring risk in low skin-tension areas and may be more cost-effective. The tissue adhesive hair apposition technique also is effective in repairing scalp lacerations. The sting of local anesthesia injections can be lessened by using smaller gauge needles, administering the injection slowly, and warming or buffering the solution. Studies have shown that tap water is safe to use for irrigation, that white petrolatum ointment is as effective as antibiotic ointment in postprocedure care, and that wetting the wound as early as 12 hours after repair does not increase the risk of infection. Patient education and appropriate procedural coding are important after the repair.

### Tissue adhesives for closure of surgical incisions [^112ry6X2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Sutures, staples and adhesive tapes are the traditional methods of wound closure, whilst tissue adhesives have entered clinical practice more recently. Closure of wounds with sutures enables meticulous closure, but they may show tissue reactivity and can require removal. Tissue adhesives offer the advantages of no risk of needlestick injury and no requirement to remove sutures later. Tissue adhesives have been used primarily in emergency rooms but this review looks at the use of tissue adhesives in the operating room where surgeons are increasingly using these for the closure of surgical skin incisions.

Objectives

To determine the relative effects of various tissue adhesives and conventional skin closure techniques on the healing of surgical wounds.

Search Strategy

For this update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (Searched 17/11/09); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) - The Cochrane Library Issue 4 2009; Ovid MEDLINE - 1950 to November Week 1 2009; Ovid EMBASE - 1980 to 2009 Week 46; EBSCO CINAHL - 1982 to 17 November 20098. No date or language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled clinical trials were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of eligible studies and data extraction were conducted independently and in triplicate whilst assessment of the methodological quality of the trials was conducted independently and in duplicate. Results were expressed as random effects models using mean difference for continuous outcomes and relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes. Heterogeneity was investigated including both clinical and methodological factors.

Main Results

This update identified an additional six trials resulting in a total of fourteen RCTs (1152 patients) which met the inclusion criteria. Sutures were significantly better than tissue adhesives for minimising dehiscence (10 trials). Sutures were also found to be significantly faster to use. For all other analyses of infection, patient and operator satisfaction and cost there was no significant difference between sutures and tissue adhesives. No differences were found between tissue adhesives and tapes (2 trials) for minimising dehiscence, infection, patients assessment of cosmetic appearance, patient satisfaction or surgeon satisfaction. However a statistically significant difference in favour of using tape was found for surgeons' assessment of cosmetic appearance (mean difference 13, 95% CI 5 to 21). Tapes were also demonstrated to be significantly faster to use than tissue adhesives as were staples (1 trial). No other outcome measures were analysed in this group. One trial compared tissue adhesives with a variety of methods of wound closure and found both patients and clinicians were significantly more satisfied with the alternative closure methods than the adhesives. In this same trial tissue adhesives were significantly less time consuming to use. For the remaining outcomes of dehiscence and infection no difference was observed between groups. This trial also compared high viscosity with low viscosity adhesives and found that high viscosity adhesives were less time consuming to use than low viscosity tissue adhesives. For all other outcomes of dehiscence, infection, patient satisfaction and operator satisfaction there was no statistically significant difference between high and low viscosity adhesives.

Authors' Conclusions

Sutures were significantly better than tissue adhesives for minimising dehiscence and were found to be significantly faster to use. Although surgeons may consider the use of tissue adhesives as an alternative to other methods of surgical site closure in the operating theatre they must be aware that adhesives may take more time to apply and that if higher tension is needed upon an incision, sutures may minimise dehiscence. There is a need for more well designed randomised controlled trials comparing tissue adhesives and alternative methods of closure. These trials should include people whose health may interfere with wound healing and surgical sites of high tension.

### Nitroglycerin transdermal system [^116kvVTq]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Information for the Patient

Please read this instruction sheet carefully before using Nitroglycerin Transdermal System

Nitroglycerin Transdermal System for the prevention of angina

Nitroglycerin Transdermal System

Nitroglycerin Transdermal System is easy to use — it has a transparent outer backing with a special adhesive that keeps the system in place and a white, translucent protective peelable liner.

Select any area of skin on the body, EXCEPT the ex tremities below the knee or elbow. The chest is the pre ferred site. The area should be clean, dry, and hairless. If hair is likely to interfere with system adhesion or removal, it can be clipped but not shaved. Take care to avoid areas with cuts or irritations. Do NOT apply the system immediately after showering or bathing. It is best to wait until you are certain the skin is completely dry.

Each Nitroglycerin Transdermal System is individually sealed in a protective pouch.

Application

When Nitroglycerin Transdermal System is applied to your body, the nitroglycerin contained in the system begins to flow onto your skin so that it is released and available for absorption through your skin at a uniform rate.

At the time recommended by your doctor, remove and discard the system.

Place a new system on a different skin site, following the steps for application, according to your doctor's instructions.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for basic wound management in the austere environment: 2014 update [^113rg7fs]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society basic wound management — methods of wound closure for minor and scalp wounds: The use of tissue glue (octyl cyanoacrylate) to close minor wounds is well supported by the literature; glue can be applied more quickly than sutures, causes less pain, and high-tension wounds have a higher dehiscence rate when repaired with glue than with sutures. Surgical tapes have the lowest tensile strength of any wound closure aid and therefore the highest rate of dehiscence; in low-tension wounds, results are comparable to the use of tissue adhesives alone, and care should be taken to apply surgical tapes without exerting shear stress on the skin, particularly with the use of adhesive aids (eg, tincture of benzoin), as this may lead to blistering. The "hair apposition technique" has been described and validated for the closure of scalp wounds; hair on either side of the wound can be knotted or twisted and secured with cyanoacrylate, and this technique is most effective in small wounds, results in apposition of only the superficial skin layer, and does not provide much hemostasis. Staples and sutures probably yield equivalent rates of wound healing, surgical site infection, and dehiscence, although one meta-analysis suggests a higher incidence of wound infection with the use of staples in orthopedic surgery; wound stapling devices are easier to use than sutures but are bulkier to carry and result in an inferior cosmetic result.

### Birch triterpenes (Filsuvez) [^1124Zbx5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use).

Administration Instructions

Advise patients (and/or their caregivers or guardians) of the following [see Dosage and Administration (2)]:

Wash hands before and after applying FILSUVEZ or wear gloves for application.
Apply a 1 mm layer of FILSUVEZ to the affected wound surface. Do not rub in the gel. Cover the wound with a sterile non-adhesive wound dressing. Alternatively, apply a generous layer of FILSUVEZ directly to the dressing so that the gel is in direct contact with the wound.
Apply FILSUVEZ to cleansed wounds at dressing changes until the wound is healed.
FILSUVEZ is for topical use only. FILSUVEZ is not for ophthalmic use and should not be applied to mucous membranes. In case of accidental contact, irrigate eyes with water.
The sterile tube of topical gel is for one-time use only. Once the tube is opened, use the product immediately. Discard the tube after use, even if there is some topical gel left.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Inform patients that local hypersensitivity and skin reactions, including urticaria and dermatitis, have been reported in patients treated with FILSUVEZ. If signs and symptoms of local hypersensitivity or skin reactions occur, instruct patients to discontinue FILSUVEZ immediately and contact their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Tissue adhesive with adjunct wound closure device… [^117RF8pf]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

1. Introduction This guidance document was developed as a special control to support the classification of the tissue adhesive with adjunct wound closure device intended for the topical approximation of skin into class II. The device is intended for topical closure of surgical incisions, including laparoscopic incisions and simple traumatic lacerations that have easily approximated skin edges. The device may be used in conjunction with, but not in place of deep dermal stitches. This guidance document does not apply to tissue adhesives for non-topical uses. This guidance document is issued in conjunction with a Federal Register notice announcing the classification of tissue adhesive with adjunct wound closure device intended for the topical approximation of skin.

Following the effective date of a final rule classifying the device, any firm submitting a premarket notification) for a tissue adhesive with adjunct wound closure device intended for the topical approximation of skin will need to address the issues covered in this special controls guidance document. However, the firm need only show that its device meets the recommendations of the guidance document or in some other way provides equivalent assurances of safety and effectiveness.
2. Background FDA believes that special controls, when combined with the general controls, will be sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the tissue adhesive with adjunct wound closure device intended for the topical approximation of skin. Identification.

A tissue adhesive with adjunct wound closure device intended for the topical approximation of skin is a device indicated for topical application only to hold closed easily approximated skin edges of wounds from surgical incisions, including punctures from minimally invasive surgery, and simple, thoroughly cleansed, trauma-induced lacerations. It may be used in conjunction with, but not in place of, deep dermal stitches. Additionally, the adjunct wound closure device component maintains temporary skin edge alignment along the length of wound during application of the liquid adhesive. "Tissue adhesives with adjunct wound closure device intended for the topical approximation of skin should not be used:

- in the presence of infection;
- in the presence of ongoing bleeding;
- in the presence of incomplete debridement; and
- on mucosal or hair covered surfaces.

"Tissue adhesives with adjunct wound closure device intended for the topical approximation of skin should also not be used on wounds that are: "The tissue adhesive will not adhere to skin pre-coated with petroleum jelly. Therefore, avoid using petroleum jelly on any skin area where tissue adhesive is intended to adhere".

### Subcuticular sutures for skin closure in non-obstetric surgery [^115CCQgN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Following surgery, surgical wounds can be closed using a variety of devices including sutures (subcuticular or transdermal), staples and tissue adhesives. Subcuticular sutures are intradermal stitches (placed immediately below the epidermal layer). The increased availability of synthetic absorbable filaments (stitches which are absorbed by the body and do not have to be removed) has led to an increased use of subcuticular sutures. However, in non-obstetric surgery, there is still controversy about whether subcuticular sutures increase the incidence of wound complications.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy and acceptability of subcuticular sutures for skin closure in non-obstetric surgery.

Search Methods

In March 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials which compared subcuticular sutures with any other methods for skin closure in non-obstetric surgery were included in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified the trials, extracted data and carried out risk of bias and GRADE assessment of the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 66 studies (7487 participants); 11 included trials had more than two arms. Most trials had poorly-reported methodology, meaning that it is unclear whether they were at high risk of bias. Most trials compared subcuticular sutures with transdermal sutures, skin staples or tissue adhesives. Most outcomes prespecified in the review protocol were reported. The certainty of evidence varied from high to very low in the comparisons of subcuticular sutures with transdermal sutures or staples and tissue adhesives; the certainty of the evidence for the comparison with surgical tapes and zippers was low to very low. Most evidence was downgraded for imprecision or risk of bias. Although the majority of studies enrolled people who underwent CDC class 1 (clean) surgeries, two-thirds of participants were enrolled in studies which included CDC class 2 to 4 surgeries, such as appendectomies and gastrointestinal surgeries. Most participants were adults in a hospital setting. Subcuticular sutures versus transdermal sutures There may be little difference in the incidence of SSI (risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.52; 3107 participants; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether subcuticular sutures reduce wound complications (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.71; 1489 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Subcuticular sutures probably improve patient satisfaction (score from 1 to 10) (at 30 days; MD 1.60, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.88; 290 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Wound closure time is probably longer when subcuticular sutures are used (MD 5.81 minutes; 95% CI 5.13 to 6.49 minutes; 585 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Subcuticular sutures versus skin staples There is moderate-certainty evidence that, when compared with skin staples, subcuticular sutures probably have little effect on SSI (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.01; 4163 participants); but probably decrease the incidence of wound complications (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.98; 2973 participants). Subcuticular sutures are associated with slightly higher patient satisfaction (score from 1 to 5) (MD 0.20, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.30; 1232 participants; high-certainty evidence). Wound closure time may also be longer compared with staples (MD 0.30 to 5.50 minutes; 1384 participants; low-certainty evidence). Subcuticular sutures versus tissue adhesives, surgical tapes and zippers There is moderate-certainty evidence showing no clear difference in the incidence of SSI between participants treated with subcuticular sutures and those treated with tissue adhesives (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.45; 869 participants). There is also no clear difference in the incidence of wound complications (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.11; 1058 participants; low-certainty evidence). Subcuticular sutures may also achieve lower patient satisfaction ratings (score from 1 to 10) (MD -2.05, 95% CI -3.05 to -1.05; 131 participants) (low-certainty evidence). In terms of SSI incidence, the evidence is uncertain when subcuticular sutures are compared with surgical tapes (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.27; 354 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or surgical zippers (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.08 to 8.48; 424 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little difference in the incidence of wound complications between participants treated with subcuticular sutures and those treated with surgical tapes (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.34; 492 participants; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether subcuticular sutures reduce the risk of wound complications compared with surgical zippers (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.04; 424 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It is also uncertain whether it takes longer to close a wound with subcuticular sutures compared with tissue adhesives (MD -0.34 to 10.39 minutes; 895 participants), surgical tapes (MD 0.74 to 6.36 minutes; 169 participants) or zippers (MD 4.38 to 8.25 minutes; 424 participants) (very low-certainty evidence). No study reported results for patient satisfaction compared with surgical tapes or zippers.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no clear difference in the incidence of SSI for subcuticular sutures in comparison with any other skin closure methods. Subcuticular sutures probably reduce wound complications compared with staples, and probably improve patient satisfaction compared with transdermal sutures or staples. However, tissue adhesives may improve patient satisfaction compared with subcuticular sutures, and transdermal sutures and skin staples may be quicker to apply than subcuticular sutures. The quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low; evidence for almost all comparisons was subject to some limitations. There seems to be no need for additional new trials to explore the comparison with staples because there are high-quality studies with large sample sizes and some ongoing studies. However, there is a need for studies exploring the comparisons with transdermal sutures, tissue adhesives, tapes and zippers, with high-quality studies and large sample sizes, including long-term assessments.

### Open-label adhesion performance studies of a new lidocaine topical system 1.8% versus lidocaine patches 5% and lidocaine medicated plaster 5% in healthy subjects [^1164eWtE]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Safety

In Study 1, skin irritation at the application site of the lidocaine topical system 1.8% was evaluated at 30 minutes (+10 minutes) and 2 hours (± 15 minutes) after product removal using an 8-point scale of dermal response (where 0 represents no evidence of irritation; scores then range from 1 [representing mild, barely perceptible erythema] to 7 [representing a strong reaction, extending beyond the application site]) and a scale of other effects, including glazed appearance, peeling and cracking, dried or serous exudates covering at least a portion of the application site, and small petechial erosions and/or scabs). In Study 2, skin irritation at the application site was also evaluated at 30 minutes (+15 minutes), 2 hours (± 15 minutes), and 12 hours (± 30 minutes) after product removal to confirm whether any irritation observed immediately after removal was associated with mechanical removal of the patch. If the product was detached or otherwise removed prior to the conclusion of the 12-hour application period, an irritation assessment was made at the time of detachment and at all subsequent time points in what would have been the full 12-hour application period had detachment not occurred. AEs were monitored and recorded at specified time points throughout the study. In Study 3, dermal AEs were reported, but no formal skin irritation assessments were performed.

### Cyanoacrylates for skin closure [^111h6C8s]. Dermatologic Clinics (2005). Low credibility.

Cyanoacrylates (CAs) were not widely adopted for medical use until recently because of lingering concerns regarding the initial tissue toxicities of the short-chain CAs. The medium-chain CAs, primarily butyl-cyanoacrylate, have been widely used in Europe and Canada for several decades and have gone a long way in dispelling any lingering concerns about tissue toxicity. The newer, longer chain CA, octyl-2-cyanoacrylate (2-OCA), now has been approved for multiple uses in the United States and has achieved widespread acceptance by the medical and lay communities. The current authors believe that this is probably only the beginning of the use of 2-OCA and other CAs in cutaneous medicine. This article discusses the use of CAs in their original cutaneous use as glues for the repair of lacerations and incisions and in their more recent use as dressings for the treatment of abrasions and wounds.

### Tissue adhesive and adhesive tape for pediatric wound closure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113rsQ7X]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tissue adhesive (TiA), adhesive tape (AdT), and sutures can be used to close surgical wounds and lacerations in children. However, it is unclear which technique produces the best results.

Methods

In this prospectively registered study, the PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination Database, and ScienceDirect databases were searched. English language studies published between January 1980 and August 2017 evaluating TiA and/or AdT for primary skin closure of surgical wounds or lacerations in patients aged ≤ 18 years were included. Study endpoints included clinician-rated wound cosmesis and incidence of wound complications.

Results

Thirty-one studies were included in the systematic review and 16 studies in the meta-analysis. Amongst heterogeneous studies, AdT yielded marginally better cosmetic outcomes than TiA (p = 0.04). There was no difference in cosmesis between sutured wounds and those closed with TiA (p = 0.2). No difference in overall risk of wound infection or dehiscence was identified when comparing TiA with AdT (p = 0.3), and TiA with sutures (p = 0.9 and 0.3 respectively).

Conclusions

TiA, AdT, and sutures can all be used for wound closure with equivalent risk of wound infection and dehiscence. AdT appears to convey better cosmesis. Further adequately powered studies directly comparing techniques are required.

### Laceration repair: a practical approach [^1138Ptrx]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

The goals of laceration repair are to achieve hemostasis and optimal cosmetic results without increasing the risk of infection. Many aspects of laceration repair have not changed over the years, but there is evidence to support some updates to standard management. Studies have been unable to define a "golden period" for which a wound can safely be repaired without increasing risk of infection. Depending on the type of wound, it may be reasonable to close even 18 or more hours after injury. The use of nonsterile gloves during laceration repair does not increase the risk of wound infection compared with sterile gloves. Irrigation with potable tap water rather than sterile saline also does not increase the risk of wound infection. Good evidence suggests that local anesthetic with epinephrine in a concentration of up to 1:100,000 is safe for use on digits. Local anesthetic with epinephrine in a concentration of 1:200,000 is safe for use on the nose and ears. Tissue adhesives and wound adhesive strips can be used effectively in low-tension skin areas. Wounds heal faster in a moist environment and therefore occlusive and semiocclusive dressings should be considered when available. Tetanus prophylaxis should be provided if indicated. Timing of suture removal depends on location and is based on expert opinion and experience.

### Tissue adhesives for traumatic lacerations in children and adults [^114BWQU6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Tissue adhesives have been used for many years to close simple lacerations as an alternative to standard wound closure (sutures, staples, adhesive strips). They offer many potential advantages over standard wound closure, including ease of use, decrease in pain and time to apply, as well as not requiring a follow-up visit for removal. Many studies have compared tissue adhesives and standard wound closure to determine the cosmetic outcome as well as these other secondary outcomes in their respective study populations. However, due to the wide variation in study parameters, there are no generalisable, definitive answers about the effectiveness of tissue adhesives. No study has been adequately powered to assess differences in complications, which are rare.

Objectives

To summarize the best available evidence for the effect of tissue adhesives in the management of traumatic lacerations in children and adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CD ROM 2001 Issue 4), the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialized Trials Register (Nov 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to Oct 1, 2001), and EMBASE (1988 to Sept 1, 2001) for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the citations of selected studies, and we contacted relevant authors and manufacturers of tissue adhesives to inquire about other published and unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing tissue adhesives versus standard wound closure or tissue adhesive versus tissue adhesive for acute, linear, low tension, traumatic lacerations in an emergency or primary care setting. Trials evaluating tissue adhesives for surgical incisions or other types of wounds were not considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data from eligible studies were extracted by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer. Two reviewers independently assessed masked copies for quality. Outcomes of cosmesis (subgroups of age, wound location and need for deep sutures), pain, procedure time, ease of use and complications were analysed separately for two comparisons: 1) tissue adhesive versus standard wound care; and 2) tissue adhesive versus tissue adhesive.

Main Results

Eight studies compared a tissue adhesive with standard wound care. No significant difference was found for cosmesis at any of the time points examined, using either Cosmetic Visual Analogue Scale (CVAS) or Wound Evaluation Score (WES). Data were only available for subgroup analysis for age; no significant differences were found. Pain scores (Parent VAS WMD -15.7 mm; 95% CI -21.9, -9.5) and procedure time (WMD -5.6 minutes; 95% CI -8.2, -3.1) significantly favoured tissue adhesives. No studies reported on ease of use. Small but statistically significant risk differences were found for dehiscence (favouring standard wound care NNH 25 95% CI 14, 100) and erythema (favouring tissue adhesive NNH 8 95% CI 4, 100). Other complications were not significantly different between treatment groups. Only one study was identified that compared two tissue adhesives (butylcyanoacrylate (Histoacryl TM) versus octylcyanoacrylate (Dermabond TM)) for pediatric facial lacerations. No significant difference was found for cosmesis using CVAS at 1–3 months, or using WES at 5–14 days and 1–3 months. Similarly, no significant difference was found in pain, procedure time or complications. Results for ease of use were incomplete as reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Tissue adhesives are an acceptable alternative to standard wound closure for repairing simple traumatic lacerations. There is no significant difference in cosmetic outcome between tissue adhesives and standard wound closure, or between different tissue adhesives. They offer the benefit of decreased procedure time and less pain, compared to standard wound closure. A small but statistically significant increased rate of dehiscence with tissue adhesives must be considered when choosing the closure method (NNH 25).

### How should clinical wound care and management translate to effective engineering standard testing requirements from foam dressings? Mapping the existing gaps and needs [^111BfWA9]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). Medium credibility.

THE REQUIRED DRESSING-WOUND/SKIN INTERFACE CONDITIONS DURING THE USE AND REMOVAL OF DRESSINGS

An adequately performing wound dressing must "stay in place" over the periwound skin during use, even in a moist environment, but should also allow for easy, atraumatic, painless, and as convenient as possible removal when a change is required. Adhesive dressings may strip layers of the periwound skin. This causes discomfort or pain during removals and further compromises the integrity of the skin (particularly the stratum corneum), adversely affects transepidermal water loss, and promotes inflammation. The above processes are repetitive, as skin damage accumulates each time a dressing is removed from the wound.

In people with sensitive skin (e.g. the elderly or infants), excessive adhesion of a dressing to the skin near the wound can cause skin tears. In addition, painful episodes during dressing changes can cause chronic psychological stress in patients, which in itself delays wound healing. The requirements of "stay in place" and "no skin peeling" are seemingly contradictive and again require careful optimization of wound dressing designs, which is another bioengineering challenge.

From a patient's perspective, a dressing that is not adhesive enough may slip and move during wear, hindering its ability to manage exudate and not facilitating showering for the user. Since chronic wounds are typically present for many weeks or months, the ability of a person to shower regularly with the dressing remaining in place is also a necessary property for their quality of life. Related to that, and from an engineering testing point of view, the adhesive strength of a dressing onto a skin-mimicking material can be measured using a laboratory "peel test", which is designed to determine the adhesive bond strength or the tacky property between the dressing and a (dry or wet) skin simulant.

Nevertheless, despite decades of research, no suitable material to optimally mimic skin has been found that would allow for reproducible adhesion force testing and determination of which forces would be considered being comparable with what native skin is exposed to clinically when dressings are removed. Traditionally, glass and steel plates are therefore commonly used as a substrate for peel tests; for reproducibility, however, efforts are underway to develop more biomimetic skin substitutes for this purpose, for example, based on blends of natural proteins in gelatin, to better represent the interactions occurring at the skin/adhesive interface with respect to conventional substrates for peel tests.

### The science of skin: measuring damage and assessing risk [^116XVtBv]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Standard methods (utilizing standardized substrates such as steel) exist to test adhesion of pressure-sensitive tapes from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), the International Standards Organization (ISO), and the Pressure Sensitive Tape Council (PSTC). In addition, several publications (using standard methods or variations thereof) are available reporting human volunteer studies in which various medical devices were adhered to skin and peel force was measured along with assessments of skin damage and self-reported discomfort. Some studies also compared peel force results between human skin and substrates intended to mimic it better than steel to develop a more consistent assay.

Peel force methods are typically used to compare the adhesion strength of various products. They can easily be combined with corneocyte or total protein assays on the same samples to provide additional information (see previous paragraphs describing those methods). They can also be used to compare the adhesion under different moisture conditions. Another use for these methods may be to see the effect on adhesion of other products often used simultaneously with adhesive devices, such as skin cleansers, antibacterial skin preps, barrier films, and skin protectants. It is important to know if these products affect the performance of tapes, dressings, or other adhesive medical devices such as securement devices, incise drapes, and so on. For example, petrolatum-based products reduce the adherence of wound dressings but most film-forming polymers do not.

Finally, a specific application in which adhesion is critically important is for transdermal drug delivery patches, where adhesion characteristics must be designed to provide complete and consistent adhesion over the entire application period to ensure proper drug delivery.

This method belongs in research settings, as it could cause skin damage to patients with fragile skin.

### 2-octyl cyanoacrylate topical adhesive as an alternative to subcuticular suture for skin closure after total knee arthroplasty: a randomized controlled trial in the same patient [^116yAZNj]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2-octyl cyanoacrylate topical adhesive with flexible self-adhesive polyester mesh (Dermabond Prineo) is becoming widely used in many surgical fields. However, no prior studies have tested the efficacy and safety of this topical adhesive compared with subcuticular suture in the same patient. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety between Dermabond Prineo and subcuticular suture for skin closure in patients undergoing same-day bilateral total knee arthroplasties (TKAs).

Materials and Methods

A prospective, double-blind randomized controlled trial was performed in 51 patients scheduled to undergo same-day bilateral TKAs. One knee was randomly assigned to the Dermabond Prineo and the other knee was allocated to the subcuticular suture. As primary outcomes, Vancouver scar scale was evaluated at 6 months and Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale was evaluated at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Secondary outcomes included cosmesis efficacy (Hollander wound evaluation scale [HWES] and cosmesis visual analog scale [VAS]), time and pain efficiency (skin suture time, stitch out time, and stitch out pain VAS), and safety (wound complications during the 6-month follow-up period). The primary and secondary outcome measures were compared between groups.

Results

There were no significant differences in Vancouver scar scale and Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale at 6 months. Although there were no significant differences in HWES at 2 weeks, the Dermabond Prineo group showed better step-off border item of HWES. There was also no difference in cosmesis VAS at 6 months. The Dermabond Prineo group showed superior results in terms of time (suture time: Dermabond Prineo = 191 second (sec) ± 60.1 sec, subcuticular suture = 356.8 sec ± 92.3 sec; stitch out time: Dermabond Prineo = 4 sec ± 1.3 sec, subcuticular suture = 26.6 sec ± 4.2 sec, all P < .001) without significant differences in pain scale (P = 0.823) or wound complications (all P > .05).

Conclusion

Comparing cosmetic efficacy, time efficiency, and safety, Dermabond Prineo provided quicker wound closure, shorter stitch out time, and better wound margin coaptation in the early postoperative period but similar cosmetic efficacy compared with subcuticular suture. Based on our study, Dermabond Prineo is a useful alternative to subcuticular suture in patients undergoing TKA.

### Buprenorphine (Butrans) [^113xbrVw]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.7 Administration of BUTRANS

Instruct patients to apply immediately after removal from the individually sealed pouch. Instruct patients not to use BUTRANS if the pouch seal is broken or the patch is cut, damaged, or changed in any way. See the Instructions for Use for step-by-step instructions for applying BUTRANS.
Apply BUTRANS to the upper outer arm, upper chest, upper back or the side of the chest. These 4 sites (each present on both sides of the body) provide 8 possible application sites. Rotate BUTRANS among the 8 described skin sites. After BUTRANS removal, wait a minimum of 21 days before reapplying to the same skin site [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Apply BUTRANS to a hairless or nearly hairless skin site. If none are available, the hair at the site should be clipped, not shaven. Do not apply BUTRANS to irritated skin. If the application site must be cleaned, clean the site with water only. Do not use soaps, alcohol, oils, lotions, or abrasive devices. Allow the skin to dry before applying BUTRANS.
Incidental exposure of the BUTRANS patch to water, such as while bathing or showering is acceptable based on experience during clinical studies.
If problems with adhesion of BUTRANS occur, the edges may be taped with first aid tape. If problems with lack of adhesion continue, the patch may be covered with waterproof or semipermeable adhesive dressings suitable for 7 days of wear.
If BUTRANS falls off during the 7-day dosing interval, dispose of the transdermal system properly and place a new BUTRANS patch on at a different skin site.
When changing the system, instruct patients to remove BUTRANS and dispose of it properly [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)].
If the buprenorphine-containing adhesive matrix accidentally contacts the skin, instruct patients or caregivers to wash the area with water and not to use soap, alcohol, or other solvents to remove the adhesive because they may enhance the absorption of the drug.

### Methods of laceration closure in the ED: a national perspective [^1139eCJD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Laceration closure is one of the most common procedures performed in the emergency department (ED). While sutures and staples have been the traditional wound closure device, topical skin adhesives (TSA) were introduced in the United States 20 years ago as a non-invasive alternative for simple, low-tension wounds. We determined which closure devices were used to close ED lacerations and explored patient and provider characteristics associated with choosing TSA. We also tested the hypothesis that use of TSA would be associated with shorter ED length of stay (LOS) than sutures/staples.

Methods

We extracted demographic and clinical data on all patients with a laceration from the publicly available website of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for the years 2012–2015. This database is provided by the National Center for Health Statistics of the CDC. Based on weighted sampling, national estimates are made for all ED visits in the US. We determined the association between patient characteristics (age, sex, insurance type, geographic location, laceration site, type of ED provider) and use of TSA. We also compared ED LOS between patients whose wounds were closed with TSA or sutures/staples using the t-test and a linear regression model.

Results

There were an estimated 540 million ED patient visits, and 26.1 million patients (4.8%) had at least one laceration. Of the 15.4 million patients with a single laceration, 9.2 million were closed with either sutures/staples (7.2 million), TSA (1.5 million), or both (0.5 million). Mean (SE) age was 30 (1) years, 63% were male and 42% were under age 18 years. Lacerations were on the upper extremity (42%), face (30%), lower extremity (14%) and scalp (8%). Of patients with a single laceration closed with either TSA or sutures/staples, use of TSA did not differ by age, sex, year, geographic location or wound site. ED LOS was significantly shorter in patients whose wounds were closed with TSA (101 ± 7 vs. 136 ± 4 min; P < 0.001). After adjusting for potential confounding variables, use of TSA was associated with a 26 (95% CI 9–44) minute shorter ED LOS (P = 0.004) then sutures/staples.

Conclusion

Topical skin adhesives are used in about 1 of 4 wound closures in the ED. Use of TSA did not differ based on demographic characteristics or wound site. Use of TSA is associated with a shorter ED LOS than sutures/staples.

### Cellular, histomorphologic, and clinical characteristics of a new octyl-2-cyanoacrylate skin adhesive [^116de5QL]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Short-chained cyanoacrylates have been used for many years for topical skin closure. Toxic effects in cell culture of a new long-chained octyl-2-cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive are compared with those of short-chained ethyl-2- and butyl-2-cyanoacrylates. Two cellular tests were used: the agar overlay test and the MTT test. An in vitro test using copper plates coated with the three types of cyanoacrylates serves for evaluating the stability of polymerized skin adhesives. Bilateral neck skin incisions in Goettingen miniature pigs were glued on one side with Dermabond. On the other side, conventional sutures were applied. After the pigs were killed, the resulting skin samples were tested for the tensile strength of their wound stability. Samples of pig dermis were exemplarily and histomorphologically characterized. A clinical examination after submandibular lymph node dissection should examine the application in humans. Cell culture tests were used to show the toxic effects of the three cyanoacrylates. In a copper test, octyl-2-cyanoacrylate was more stabile than ethyl- and butyl-cyanoacrylates. Breaking strength was 30% lower 28 days after operation with the new product than with sutures. In electron microscopy, octyl-2-cyanoacrylate showed no disadvantages with regard to tissue regeneration and no histotoxicity. For plastic surgery, this new topical skin adhesive is a real alternative with attractive results, as compared with conventional suture.

### Open-label adhesion performance studies of a new lidocaine topical system 1.8% versus lidocaine patches 5% and lidocaine medicated plaster 5% in healthy subjects [^114eqFDw]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Significantly, fewer subjects (2.3%) treated with the lidocaine topical system 1.8% experienced product detachment of 50% or greater compared with the lidocaine patch 5% (20.5%) or lidocaine medicated plaster 5% (15.9%). More than one-third of subjects experienced substantial detachment (reduction to < 10% adhesion) of the generic lidocaine patch 5%. No lidocaine topical system 1.8% became completely detached, whereas 2 detachments (4.5%) occurred with both the lidocaine patch 5% and lidocaine medicated plaster 5%, and 7 detachments (29.1%) occurred with the generic lidocaine patch 5%.

These differences in adhesion performance are expected to be clinically important. Although up to 30% of patients might experience poor adhesion and need to replace the comparator prescription lidocaine topical products, our results suggest that less than 1% of patients would have this problem with the lidocaine topical system 1.8% under the conditions studied. Accordingly, one could anticipate that the number of patients needed to treat to prevent one poor adhesion episode through the utilization of the lidocaine topical system 1.8% compared with the other products is 25.

The poor adhesion performance observed for the generic Mylan lidocaine patch 5% in Study 3 indicates that the study was overpowered relative to the hypothesis that the product would have comparable performance to that established by the Lidoderm Patch 5% reference product in Study 2; the results were surprising, considering the comparable adhesion data reported in the independent study conducted by Mylan in support of its abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). Although the study designs were comparable, the studies were conducted at separate sites using different subjects using different time points, which could explain the difference. Also, Studies 2 and 3 may differ from the Mylan ANDA study in that subjects were allowed to remain ambulatory during the treatment periods, whereas the FDA adhesion guidance only prevents the use of artificial means to affect adhesion performance (tape reinforcement, overlays, pressing, etc.). Because patients should expect comparable adhesion performance when switched to generic topical and transdermal products, perhaps this regulatory guidance should be revisited to incorporate design features that more rigorously challenge adhesion performance relative to real-world use.

### A comparison of three methods of skin closure following repair of achilles tendon rupture [^111wUePi]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Meticulous skin closure is required to avoid wound problems after Achilles tendon surgery. The purpose of our study was to compare postoperative complication rate, operation time, clinical outcome and patient satisfaction with the wound among two topical skin adhesives (2-octyl cyanoacrylate and n-butyl cyanoacrylate) and conventional nylon skin sutures in Achilles tendon repair surgery. We retrospectively reviewed the records 122 consecutive patients (40 patient in nylon skin suture, 43 patients in 2-octyl cyanoacrylate and 39 patients in n-butyl cyanoacrylate) who underwent surgical repair for acute Achilles tendon rupture between 2012 and 2016. The primary outcome measure was the development of complications in the wound. Secondary outcome measures included the operative time, the Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS) and patient satisfaction with the wound. There was no difference in complication rate in the wound (p = 0.694) and in ATRS (p = 0.824) among patients in the three groups. Mean operative time in nylon skin suture group was significantly longer than in the 2-octyl cyanoacrylate group and n-butyl cyanoacrylate group (p = 0.018 and p = 0.002, respectively). Patient satisfaction in the 2-octyl cyanoacrylate and n-butyl cyanoacrylate groups was significantly higher than in the nylon skin suture group (p = 0.015 and 0.018, respectively). The use of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate and n-butyl cyanoacrylate topical skin adhesives for skin closure following repair of Achilles tendon rupture has equivalent effectiveness and safety compared to conventional nylon skin suture, but higher patient satisfaction. Despite its higher cost, these topical skin adhesives are viable alternatives for wound closure in patients who regard cosmetic outcomes as important.

### Skin protectants made of curable polymers: effect of application on local skin temperature [^111nFUo9]. Advances in Wound Care (2017). Low credibility.

Cyanoacrylates were first introduced for medical use as skin tissue adhesives to approximate the edges of incisional wounds and to achieve closure by primary intention. In some circumstances, they can provide an alternative to sutures and staples for surgical woundsand for simple traumatic lacerations. Another use for cyanoacrylates has been as a preoperative skin care strategy, applying them on top of the surgical skin prep to reduce surgical site infections (SSIs) by immobilizing any bacteria left on the skin after prepping and to prevent growth. A Cochrane review published on this topic concludes that the results show a significant difference, but it cautiously states that more research is needed. Dohmen has also reviewed the literature on this and concluded that this approach is an attractive option to reduce SSIs. In a similar thought process, Grimaldi et al. shared their experience of using octyl-2-cyanoacrylate to cover the suture after surgical incision closure and reported a decrease in the incidence of wound infection and wound dehiscence in a group of 900 patients over 8 years. The literature has described concerns in using such adhesives in the actual incision, reporting that they can delay healing by acting as a barrier between the growing edges of the incision. However, this may depend on the formulation, because others have reported an enhancement of the healing process in a partial-thickness wound animal model. The current study highlights a different application for this chemistry, consisting of a skin protectant to manage superficial skin lesions or to protect skin exposed to irritants.

The new skin protectant presented here is delivered in a nonstinging solvent and as this solvent evaporates, the heat of volatilization causes a cooling effect, compensating for the heat released during polymerization. This composition also contains a smaller percentage of reactive chemistry than the comparator product. Comparatively, the commercial product has no solvent and contains 100% reactive monomer, leading to a greater exothermic reaction on curing. The new skin protectant may potentially be more comfortable for patients, since it does not add any heat to the skin during the curing process that follows application. An additional benefit provided by the nonstinging solvent is that it prevents the cyanoacrylate from bonding tissues together, which is a critical concern when dealing with skin folds such as the gluteal cleft where such a product is used to manage IAD.

Local wound applications — harms: The most commonly reported harms from dressings and topical therapies were skin irritation, inflammation, and tissue damage and maceration; evidence was insufficient to determine whether specific dressings or topical therapies resulted in less harm than others, and evidence was also insufficient to conclude about harms for biological agents.
