## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of scopolamine's pharmacology, indications, dosing, efficacy, safety, special populations, and practical pearls. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's identity and mechanism. Then, I should verify labeled indications and dosing. Next, I will review efficacy data for motion sickness and PONV, followed by safety and adverse effects. After that, I need to consider special populations and drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize practical pearls and a cautious conclusion, making sure to double-check any claims against the highest-quality sources available.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and mechanism, because precision here underpins everything else. Scopolamine is a nonselective muscarinic antagonist and belladonna alkaloid that competitively inhibits acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, with central and peripheral anticholinergic effects, including reduced GI motility and secretions, mydriasis, and CNS effects such as sedation and antiemesis, which explains its clinical utility in motion sickness and PONV [^114KCcgw] [^115bQ8Fw].

> I need to verify the labeled indications and core dosing, and I should double-check the timing details. The transdermal system is FDA-approved in adults for prevention of motion sickness and for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting associated with anesthesia and/or opioid analgesia; it is not approved for pediatric use, and it is not indicated for treatment of established nausea or vomiting, only for prevention [^111KjthB] [^112jw5pV]. For motion sickness, apply one patch to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the antiemetic effect is needed, and if therapy exceeds 3 days, rotate to the other ear; for PONV, apply the evening before surgery and remove 24 hours postoperatively, which aligns with its 2–4 hour onset and approximately 72-hour duration of effect [^114cPmy3] [^116TYjax].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy without anchoring to high-quality data. For motion sickness, randomized trials and Cochrane reviews consistently show scopolamine reduces motion-induced nausea and vomiting versus placebo, with roughly a 75% reduction in incidence in controlled studies, and it performs comparably to or better than some antihistamines while causing more dry mouth; importantly, there are no randomized trials establishing efficacy for treating established motion sickness, only prevention [^116ViY73] [^1154s6r1] [^112NG9hk]. For PONV, meta-analyses and contemporary guidelines indicate a modest but real reduction in early PONV versus placebo, with an onset of 2–4 hours and duration up to 72 hours, making it useful for delayed symptoms; however, effect sizes vary and combination therapy may outperform monotherapy in high-risk patients [^116TYjax] [^111SU2DK] [^115TUrbq].

> Wait, let me verify the safety profile and quantify trade-offs, because this is where clinical decisions hinge. Common adverse effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, mydriasis, drowsiness, and dizziness; visual disturbances and dry mouth occur in roughly 18% and 8% of patients, respectively, in some PONV studies, and anticholinergic effects scale with exposure and patient susceptibility [^111SU2DK] [^112EVsRH]. Serious risks include neuropsychiatric reactions such as psychosis, agitation, and cognitive impairment, angle-closure glaucoma in predisposed patients, and withdrawal symptoms after patch removal; rare but important toxicities include seizures and hyperthermia, with the FDA recently warning about heat-related complications, particularly in children and older adults, reinforcing caution in these groups [^111x9R7T] [^112ky9rt] [^112U4ae6] [^111gLU5h] [^115gi6Hn].

> I should confirm special population considerations next, and I need to ensure I align with geriatric and obstetric guidance. In older adults, scopolamine is on Beers and geriatric surgery guidance as generally to be avoided for PONV prophylaxis due to strong anticholinergic burden and increased risks of delirium, cognitive impairment, and urinary retention; large retrospective cohorts associate perioperative scopolamine with higher risks of delirium, pneumonia, urinary retention, and readmission, especially after age 60–70, so alternatives are preferred when feasible [^111bbERo] [^112m5TMx] [^111fSJ64] [^112w7vw6]. In pregnancy, avoid in severe preeclampsia due to reported eclamptic seizures after parenteral scopolamine; in lactation, scopolamine is present in human milk, so risk–benefit discussion is warranted [^111yy2As] [^114Ykc3C]. In pediatrics, the patch is not FDA-approved, and although off-label use for sialorrhea has evidence of efficacy, adverse effects and the new FDA hyperthermia warning argue for caution and consideration of alternatives like glycopyrrolate or botulinum toxin [^113P5Yew] [^111gLU5h].

> Let me consider drug interactions and functional cautions, and I should double-check the list of co-administered agents that amplify CNS effects. Concomitant CNS depressants and other anticholinergics increase risks of sedation, confusion, and psychosis; patients should avoid driving or hazardous tasks until individual effects are known, and clinicians should screen for anticholinergic polypharmacy before prescribing [^111x9R7T] [^112jw5pV]. But wait, what if the patient is on dopamine-blocking antiemetics? Withdrawal of scopolamine can unmask dystonia in that context, so tapering strategy and monitoring matter in polypharmacy perioperative settings [^117YJYjK].

> Next, I should review practical pearls that prevent common pitfalls. Always counsel on meticulous handwashing after handling patches to avoid ocular contamination and unilateral mydriasis that can mimic stroke; if anisocoria occurs, a 1% pilocarpine test can help distinguish pharmacologic blockade from neurogenic causes, averting unnecessary imaging or thrombolysis [^115yV9c4] [^1162wadW]. I need to ensure patients know to apply only one patch at a time, not to cut it, to rotate ears if therapy exceeds 3 days, and to fold used patches in half before disposal to prevent accidental exposure; if toxicity is suspected, immediate patch removal and supportive care are first steps, with physostigmine reserved for severe anticholinergic syndromes after securing the airway [^114cPmy3] [^111fzaJj] [^116M8BHF]. Hold on, I should verify the withdrawal syndrome features too: bradycardia, headache, nausea, abdominal cramps, and sweating 24+ hours after removal warrant supportive care and, in some cases, meclizine for vestibular symptoms, particularly in children with prior scopolamine exposure [^112U4ae6] [^116Bwgny].

> I will now examine off-label and emerging uses, but I should be careful to flag the evidence gaps. Scopolamine has been explored for antidepressant effects with rapid onset in treatment-resistant depression when given intravenously, yet transdermal patches at standard doses do not reliably produce cognitive or mood effects in healthy volunteers, underscoring that this remains investigational and not a patch-based indication [^117N3Lqc] [^1175UYXH]. In palliative care, scopolamine is used to reduce secretions and the "death rattle", leveraging its antisialogogue effect, though evidence is largely expert consensus and case-based rather than randomized trials [^1114Ltb4] [^1151c98P]. For gastroparesis, use is off-label and unsupported by robust trials, so it should be reserved for select refractory cases with careful monitoring for anticholinergic adverse effects [^113yvnws].

> Let me reconsider the overall risk–benefit balance and make sure I am not overstating any claims. Scopolamine remains a reasonable option for motion sickness prevention and for PONV prophylaxis in appropriately selected adults, particularly when delayed nausea is a concern and alternatives are unsuitable; however, its anticholinergic burden, delayed onset, and meaningful risks in older adults and those with polypharmacy argue for selective, time-limited use and heightened vigilance for neuropsychiatric and urinary adverse effects [^116TYjax] [^111bbERo]. I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with guidelines: use after risk stratification, prefer non-anticholinergic antiemetics in older adults when possible, and counsel thoroughly on application, removal, and warning signs to mitigate harm [^112m5TMx] [^114cPmy3].

Scopolamine is a **muscarinic antagonist** used to prevent motion sickness and postoperative nausea and vomiting via transdermal patches that deliver ~1 mg over 3 days [^114cPmy3]. It is effective for motion sickness [^1154s6r1] and PONV [^116TYjax], but not for treating established nausea/vomiting [^1154s6r1]. Common adverse effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, and drowsiness [^112EVsRH]; serious risks include **angle-closure glaucoma** [^112ky9rt], **delirium** [^111x9R7T], and **withdrawal symptoms** after removal [^112U4ae6]. Use is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, or hypersensitivity [^notfound]; caution is advised in older adults due to anticholinergic effects [^111bbERo]. For motion sickness, apply one patch behind the ear at least 4 hours before travel [^114cPmy3]; for PONV, apply the evening before surgery and remove 24 hours postoperatively [^114cPmy3].

---

## Pharmacological properties

Scopolamine is a **competitive antagonist** at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1–M5) [^114KCcgw], with central and peripheral anticholinergic effects. It **crosses the blood–brain barrier**, enabling CNS-mediated antiemetic and sedative effects [^115bQ8Fw].

---

## Clinical indications

Scopolamine is indicated for:

- **Motion sickness**: Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with motion [^111KjthB] [^114za4sF].
- **Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)**: Prevention of nausea and vomiting after surgery and anesthesia [^111KjthB] [^116TYjax].
- **Off-label uses**: Sialorrhea control in neurological conditions [^113P5Yew] and palliative care for secretions [^1114Ltb4].

---

## Dosage and administration

| **Indication** | **Dosage and administration** |
|-|-|
| Motion sickness | Apply one transdermal patch behind the ear at least 4 hours before travel; effective for up to 3 days [^114cPmy3] |
| Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) | Apply one patch the evening before surgery; remove 24 hours postoperatively [^1128o9sZ] [^116TYjax] |

---

## Clinical efficacy

Scopolamine is **highly effective** in preventing motion sickness [^1154s6r1], with a 75% reduction in motion-induced nausea and vomiting [^114bJyhW]. For PONV, it **reduces incidence and severity** [^notfound], particularly in high-risk patients [^115TUrbq].

---

## Adverse effects and safety profile

Common adverse effects include:

- **Dry mouth**: Most frequent (≈66%) [^112EVsRH].
- **Blurred vision**: Due to mydriasis and cycloplegia [^1123Kte7].
- **Drowsiness and dizziness**: CNS depression [^116dxPjL].
- **Application site reactions**: Local irritation, erythema [^116dxPjL].

Serious adverse effects include:

- **Acute angle-closure glaucoma**: Contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma [^notfound].
- **Neuropsychiatric reactions**: Delirium, confusion, psychosis, especially in elderly [^111x9R7T] [^111bbERo].
- **Withdrawal symptoms**: Dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia, hypotension [^112U4ae6] [^112CZR5t].
- **Hyperthermia**: Risk of heat-related complications, especially in children and elderly [^111gLU5h] [^115gi6Hn].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **glaucoma** (narrow-angle), prostatic hypertrophy, obstructive gastrointestinal disorders, and hypersensitivity to scopolamine or other belladonna alkaloids. Use with caution in older adults due to anticholinergic effects [^111bbERo]; avoid in patients with a history of psychiatric disorders or seizures [^notfound].

---

## Drug interactions

Scopolamine interacts with **CNS depressants** (sedatives, hypnotics, alcohol), which increase the risk of CNS depression [^111x9R7T]. It also interacts with **anticholinergic drugs**, which increase anticholinergic burden and adverse effects [^112jw5pV].

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid in severe preeclampsia due to risk of eclamptic seizures [^111yy2As]; limited data on fetal risk [^notfound].
- **Lactation**: Scopolamine is present in breast milk; weigh benefits vs potential infant effects [^111yy2As] [^116w2xP3].
- **Pediatric use**: Not approved; use glycopyrrolate or botulinum toxin for sialorrhea when possible [^111x9R7T] [^113P5Yew].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend scopolamine for motion sickness and PONV prophylaxis, particularly in high-risk patients [^114za4sF] [^116TYjax]. Routine use in older adults is discouraged due to anticholinergic effects; consider alternatives when possible [^111bbERo].

---

## Recent developments and controversies

Recent FDA warnings highlight **hyperthermia risk**, especially in children and older adults [^111gLU5h] [^115gi6Hn]. Ongoing debate concerns routine perioperative use, with some evidence suggesting increased adverse events in older adults [^111fSJ64] [^112Jj9Az].

---

Scopolamine is effective for motion sickness and PONV prevention but carries anticholinergic risks; use is contraindicated in glaucoma and prostatic hypertrophy, and caution is advised in older adults.

### Scopolamine for cancer-related nausea and vomiting [^115uXqCG]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2010). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting is a common and troublesome symptom in advanced cancer. There have been different approaches described for the management of nausea and vomiting, specifically empirical and etiological. Scopolamine is listed in textbooks as a useful medication in management of nausea and vomiting in this setting, although there is no published data to support this recommendation. We present three cases that support the use of scopolamine in an etiologically based approach for management of nausea in advanced cancer.

### Scopolamine (hyoscine) for preventing and treating motion sickness [^1154s6r1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 3, 2004 and previously updated in 2007 and 2009. Motion sickness, the discomfort experienced when perceived motion disturbs the organs of balance, may include symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, pallor, cold sweats, hypersalivation, hyperventilation and headaches. The control and prevention of these symptoms has included pharmacological, behavioural and complementary therapies. Although scopolamine (hyoscine) has been used in the treatment and prevention of motion sickness for decades, there have been no systematic reviews of its effectiveness.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of scopolamine versus no therapy, placebo, other drugs, behavioural and complementary therapy or two or more of the above therapies in combination for motion sickness in persons (both adults and children) without known vestibular, visual or central nervous system pathology.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 14 April 2011.

Selection Criteria

All parallel-arm, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on scopolamine versus no therapy, placebo, other drugs, behavioural and complementary therapy or two or more of the above therapies in combination. We considered outcomes relating to the prevention of onset or treatment of clinically-defined motion sickness, task ability and psychological tests, changes in physiological parameters and adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data from the studies using standardised forms. We assessed study quality. We expressed dichotomous data as odds ratio (OR) and calculated a pooled OR using the random-effects model.

Main Results

Of 35 studies considered potentially relevant, 14 studies enrolling 1025 subjects met the entry criteria. Scopolamine was administered via transdermal patches, tablets or capsules, oral solutions or intravenously. Scopolamine was compared against placebo, calcium channel antagonists, antihistamine, methscopolamine or a combination of scopolamine and ephedrine. Studies were generally small in size and of varying quality. Scopolamine was more effective than placebo in the prevention of symptoms. Comparisons between scopolamine and other agents were few and suggested that scopolamine was superior (versus methscopolamine) or equivalent (versus antihistamines) as a preventative agent. Evidence comparing scopolamine to cinnarizine or combinations of scopolamine and ephedrine is equivocal or minimal. Although sample sizes were small, scopolamine was no more likely to induce drowsiness, blurring of vision or dizziness compared to other agents. Dry mouth was more likely with scopolamine than with methscopolamine or cinnarizine. No studies were available relating to the therapeutic effectiveness of scopolamine in the management of established symptoms of motion sickness.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of scopolamine versus placebo in preventing motion sickness has been shown to be effective. No conclusions can be made on the comparative effectiveness of scopolamine and other agents such as antihistamines and calcium channel antagonists. In addition, we identified no randomised controlled trials that examined the effectiveness of scopolamine in the treatment of established symptoms of motion sickness.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

Scopolamine transdermal system contains scopolamine, which is not a controlled substance.

9.3 Dependence

Termination of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. These withdrawal symptoms indicate that scopolamine, like other anticholinergic drugs, may produce physical dependence. The onset of these symptoms, generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed, can be severe and may require medical intervention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### A comprehensive analysis of in-hospital adverse events after scopolamine administration: insights from a retrospective cohort study using a large nationwide inpatient database [^113gNojG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

These findings are particularly relevant because healthcare providers may not be fully aware of the risks associated with scopolamine use in elderly patients. According to our data, the use of scopolamine appears to increase with age, with the highest number of patients receiving the drug being in the 70 + age category. This may reflect the higher frequency of surgeries among older adults; according to the 2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), 19% of Americans over the age of 65 had surgery in the previous year. These observations underscore the notion that scopolamine use carries inherent risks and should be judiciously considered, with a clear evaluation of the benefit-to-risk ratio. In cases of postoperative nausea and vomiting, alternative antiemetic options with more favorable side effect profiles may be more prudent choices over scopolamine. It is conceivable that scopolamine's utility may be best suited for younger patients and individuals with a documented history of PDNV, where its benefits may outweigh the associated risks.

Limitations

As with any retrospective cohort study relying on administrative data, our findings may be limited by the confines of the database and skewed by diagnostic coding errors. Diagnostic coding may overestimate or underestimate the incidence of adverse events. Additionally, the outcomes may have been influenced by unaccounted-for confounding factors that were not part of our analyses. Finally, after 1:1 propensity score matching, certain cohorts within the younger age group had limited patient numbers, which presents difficulties in extending the generalizability of our results to larger populations. Along with the intrinsic limitations of 1:1 propensity score matching, the lack of dosage information and time of administration of medications are not available through the TriNetX database, which may affect the generation of cohorts. The patients within the TriNetX network may not be fully representative of the entire United States population, including healthy populations and those who may not have had medical encounters with health care systems.

### A comprehensive analysis of in-hospital adverse events after scopolamine administration: insights from a retrospective cohort study using a large nationwide inpatient database [^111fSJ64]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this retrospective cohort study, perioperative scopolamine usage was associated with a significantly increased risk of in-hospital mortality, delirium, pneumonia, new antipsychotic utilization, readmission, and urinary retention both within all age cohorts after major surgery, but especially in the > 60 age cohort. These findings underscore the importance of carefully evaluating the risks and benefits of scopolamine administration in perioperative settings, particularly within these age groups. Scopolamine is most suited for post-discharge nausea and vomiting in ambulatory patients given its 4-hour onset time, and its 72-hour duration. Clinicians should reconsider scopolamine's routine use in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting.

### The efficacy and safety of transdermal scopolamine for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting: a quantitative systematic review [^111SU2DK]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The role of scopolamine administered via transdermal therapeutic systems in the prevention of postoperative vomiting, nausea, and nausea and vomiting is unclear. We performed a systematic search for full reports of randomized comparisons of transdermal scopolamine with inactive control. Dichotomous data were extracted. In the meta-analysis, relative risks and numbers-needed-to-treat/harm were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). In 23 trials, 979 patients received transdermal scopolamine, and 984 patients received placebo. Sensitivity analyses were performed using restricted data for truncated control event rates (40%-80%) and for large trials. With these data, the relative risks for postoperative vomiting (five reports), nausea (five reports), nausea and vomiting (eight reports), and rescue treatment (three reports) were 0.69 (95% CI, 0.58–0.82), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.54–0.87), 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66–0.88), and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.54–0.85), respectively. This means that of 100 patients who receive transdermal scopolamine, approximately 17 will not experience postoperative vomiting who would have done so had they all received a placebo. However, 18 of 100 patients will have visual disturbances, eight will report dry mouth, two will report dizziness, one will be classified as being agitated, and 1–13 patients who are prescribed transdermal scopolamine will not use it correctly. The timing of application does not alter efficacy.

Implications

Of 100 patients who receive transdermal scopolamine, approximately 17 will not vomit in the postoperative period who would have done so had they all received a placebo. However, 18 of 100 patients will have visual disturbances, and eight will report dry mouth. Incorrect use further limits its efficacy.

### Anisocoria secondary to inadvertent contact with scopolamine patch [^116joGCr]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

In the era of modern medicine, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), has made ground-breaking advances in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. In the suspicion of stroke, time is of the essence for tPA administration, because it is most effective within 3–4.5 hours of the onset of symptoms. However, administration of tPA to ineligible patients can lead to catastrophic consequences, such as increased risk of haemorrhage. Due to the time constraints, healthcare providers may have stroke high on the differential, making it easier to overlook other diagnoses that can mimic a stroke. Therefore, it is essential to form a differential that contains all possible etiologies that may contribute to a presentation that mimics a stroke.

The scopolamine patch, a commonly used medication in the hospital, has been noted to cause mydriasis in patients and healthcare workers. Accidental ocular contamination secondary to scopolamine has been documented in various case reports. This patient's symptoms at first appeared worrisome for a stroke which ultimately led to numerous tests and imaging. However, by the end of her hospital stay, it was a detailed history that guided the management of the patient, which ultimately saved the patient from potentially harmful therapy (i.e. tPA).

### A comprehensive analysis of in-hospital adverse events after scopolamine administration: insights from a retrospective cohort study using a large nationwide inpatient database [^116kDXkW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common, yet complex problem affecting anesthetic care, occurring in up to 80% of high-risk patients. Furthermore, PONV is associated with prolonged hospitalizations, increased rate of readmissions, and magnified healthcare costs.

Scopolamine is a common agent used for the treatment of PONV and post-discharge nausea and vomiting (PDNV) given its long duration of activity and unique transdermal dosing regimen. The agent acts as a competitive antagonist of the acetylcholine muscarinic receptor and works primarily in smooth muscle and the central nervous system to directly antagonize cholinergic synaptic transmissions. The parasympathetic activity produced leads to drying of secretions, increased cardiac output, and reduced nausea and vomiting. According to consensus guidelines, the risk of experiencing delayed nausea and vomiting significantly diminishes after the age of 50, making it a less prominent concern in older populations. Despite scopolamine's frequent usage and recognized efficacy, concerns have emerged regarding the potential for increased side effects, particularly in elderly patients. This population faces an elevated risk of delirium and potential side effects due to scopolamine's anticholinergic properties. The adverse effects of scopolamine are well documented, with patients receiving transdermal scopolamine commonly experiencing effects such as urinary retention, dry mouth, mydriasis, visual disturbances, and amblyopia. Furthermore, the use of transdermal scopolamine may result in significant elevations in heart rate when compared to placebo. Surprisingly, while numerous case reports have highlighted these concerns, no comprehensive study has quantified the frequency and severity of these side effects in the context of scopolamine administration in elderly patients. This critical gap in our understanding warrants further investigation on the safety and appropriateness of scopolamine use in this particular patient population. We therefore hypothesized that perioperative scopolamine use in older adults would be associated with worse clinical outcomes, mainly increased risk of pneumonia, delirium, urinary retention, and increased rate of readmissions.

### Perspectives on transdermal scopolamine for the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^1129dNsQ]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Transdermal scopolamine, a patch system that delivers 1.5 mg of scopolamine gradually over 72 hours following an initial bolus, was approved in the United States in 2001 for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in adults. Scopolamine (hyoscine) is a selective competitive anatagonist of muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Low serum concentrations of scopolamine produce an antiemetic effect. Transdermal scopolamine is effective in preventing PONV versus placebo [relative risk (RR) = 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.61–0.98, P = 0.03] and a significantly reduced risk for postoperative nausea (RR = 0.59, 95% CI, 0.48–0.73, P < 0.001), postoperative vomiting (RR = 0.68, 95% CI, 0.61–0.76, P < 0.001), and PONV (RR 0.73, 95% CI, 0.60–0.88, P = 001) in the first 24 hours after the start of anesthesia.

Palliative care best practices — ventilator withdrawal and dyspnea management advise to precede the withdrawal of ventilator support with the cessation of neuromuscular blockade and to administer appropriate medications for sedation, pain control, and prevention of dyspnea. Opioids are the first line for treatment of dyspnea, and if dyspnea is refractory, then administer small doses of benzodiazepines that are titrated to effect. Often the patient is simply extubated after suctioning because oral and respiratory secretions can cause stridor, airway obstruction, or the "death rattle". To diminish secretions, scopolamine is effective, as are elevating the head of the bed and oral suctioning. Patients and families find dyspnea very distressing, so reassure them that medications will be offered and dyspnea will be managed.

5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions

Psychiatric Adverse Reactions

Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. In cases of psychiatric reactions occurring scopolamine transdermal system should be removed at once. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention.

Seizures

Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold.

Cognitive Adverse Reactions

Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. If, despite this, the symptoms persist in a severe form, instruct patients to seek medical attention. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Hazardous Activities

Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely.

### Randomized, double-blind comparison of oral aprepitant alone compared with aprepitant and transdermal scopolamine for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^111PZpuL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Aprepitant blocks the emetic effects of substance P. Scopolamine antagonizes muscarinic type 1 and histamine type 1 receptors. This study compares monotherapy and multimodal therapy by looking at complete response, nausea, vomiting, and rescue medication in patients at high risk for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) treated with oral aprepitant with or without scopolamine.

Methods

We enrolled 120 patients in this randomized, double-blind trial. Inclusion criteria were: > 18 yr old, ASA I-III, two or more Apfel four-point risk factors, undergoing an elective surgical procedure with a high risk of PONV expected to last at least 60 min. The primary outcome variable was complete response, that is, no emesis and no rescue therapy from 0 to 24 h. The outcomes measured included the incidences of nausea, vomiting, their composite, and the need for rescue medication.

Results

The aprepitant alone and aprepitant with scopolamine did not differ in complete responses (63% vs 57%, P = 0.57) or net clinical benefit (26% vs 19%, P = 0.38). The number who did not experience PONV and who used rescue medication did not differ. The incidence of PONV in the post-anaesthesia care unit did not differ nor did the use of rescue medications.

Conclusions

This trial evaluating the effectiveness of aprepitant alone and in combination with scopolamine showed no difference between treatment groups. The primary objective, complete response, and secondary objectives, incidences of nausea, vomiting, their composite, and the need for rescue medication, all showed no statistical difference.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

Scopolamine transdermal system contains scopolamine, which is not a controlled substance.

9.3 Dependence

Termination of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. These withdrawal symptoms indicate that scopolamine, like other anticholinergic drugs, may produce physical dependence. The onset of these symptoms, generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed, can be severe and may require medical intervention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^116TYjax]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Anticholinergics — transdermal scopolamine for PONV: Transdermal scopolamine reduces the risk of PONV in PACU and for 24 hours after surgery, with an onset of action of 2–4 hours after application and a duration of effect of 72 hours, allowing application on the day of surgery or the night before. There is some evidence it may reduce intraoperative nausea in women having regional anesthesia for cesarean section. It is generally well tolerated with the most common side effects reported being visual disturbances, dry mouth, and dizziness (A1). Recent evidence suggests transdermal scopolamine may increase the risk of postoperative urinary retention, especially after urogynecologic procedures, and in this patient population, other antiemetics option may be considered to reduce the incidence of urinary retention (A3).

### Antidepressant treatment history as a predictor of response to scopolamine: clinical implications [^117N3Lqc]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The intravenous administration of scopolamine produces rapid antidepressant effects. Generally, failing multiple previous antidepressant trials is associated with a poor prognosis for response to future medications. This study evaluated whether treatment history predicts antidepressant response to scopolamine.

Methods

Treatment resistant patients (2 failed medication trials) (n = 31) and treatment naïve patients (no exposure to psychotropic medication) (n = 31) with recurrent major depressive or bipolar disorder participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial. Following a placebo lead-in, participants randomly received P/S or S/P (P = 3 placebo; S = 3 scopolamine (4ug/kg) sessions 3 to 5 days apart). The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was the primary outcome measure. A linear mixed model was used to examine the interaction between clinical response and treatment history, adjusting for baseline MADRS.

Results

Treatment resistant and treatment naïve subjects combined responded significantly to scopolamine compared to placebo (F = 15.06, p < 0.001). Reduction in depressive symptoms was significant by the first post-scopolamine session (F = 42.75, p < 0.001). A treatment history by scopolamine session interaction (F = 3.37, p = 0.04) indicated treatment naïve subjects had lower MADRS scores than treatment resistant patients; this was significant after the second scopolamine infusion (t = 2.15, p = 0.03).

Limitations

Post-hoc analysis: Also, we used a single regimen to administer scopolamine, and smokers were excluded from the sample, limiting generalizability.

Conclusions

Treatment naïve and treatment resistant patients showed improved clinical symptoms following scopolamine, while those who were treatment naïve showed greater improvement. Scopolamine rapidly reduces symptoms in both treatment history groups, and demonstrates sustained improvement even in treatment resistant patients.

### A comprehensive analysis of in-hospital adverse events after scopolamine administration: insights from a retrospective cohort study using a large nationwide inpatient database [^113J9LVS]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Additional indicators of delirium were also observed. Postoperative pneumonia, a marker of sedation (a key feature of delirium), increased in patients over 50, as postoperative pneumonia is often caused by micro-aspiration of gram-negative bacteria. There was also an increase in new antipsychotic use across all age groups, likely reflecting a rise in symptoms of agitation. However, since scopolamine is an effective antiemetic for delayed nausea and vomiting, antipsychotic use for PONV should have decreased in the group receiving transdermal scopolamine. Instead, we found that patients who received scopolamine were over 70% more likely to require antipsychotic medication in the days following surgery, suggesting their use was driven by other factors, such as agitation.

Scopolamine use was also associated with an increased risk of urinary retention across all age groups. This finding is consistent with recent studies, such as by Courtepatte et al. which reported a 75% increase in the incidence of postoperative urinary retention (POUR) following uro-gynecological surgeries associated with scopolamine. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence that challenges the meta-analysis of retrospective studies by Lanpher et al. which found no statistically significant increase in POUR among patients receiving scopolamine. However, the absolute risk of urinary retention exceeded 1% only in patients over the age of 70. This is likely an underestimation, as previous studies have reported the incidence of POUR to range from 4 to 70%, depending on the type of surgery. Additionally, readmission for any reason was higher in all age groups, which may reflect urinary retention as well as other serious medical complications, such as delirium, excessive sedation, or postoperative pneumonia. While the absolute risk of readmission was low, it represents a significant cost burden on the healthcare system.

### Epidemic of poisoning caused by scopolamine disguised as rohypnol tablets [^1176hx1E]. Clinical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

An epidemic of scopolamine poisonings occurred in Oslo in 2008 among users of illicit drugs, caused by fake Rohypnol pills. The clinical features, diagnostic process, and handling of the epidemic are presented.

Methods

Suspected cases of scopolamine poisoning were extracted by reviewing registration forms from an ongoing prospective clinical study of acute poisonings in Oslo. Medical records of extracted contacts were examined and cases included according to specified clinical criteria.

Results

Forty-four cases of probable scopolamine poisoning were registered. Main clinical features were mydriasis, visual hallucinations, plucking behavior, agitation, and coma. No clinical diagnosis of anticholinergic syndrome was made prior to forensic analysis of the tablets, the most frequent diagnosis up to this point being unspecified drug-induced psychosis. Later in the epidemic, scopolamine poisoning became the dominating diagnosis. Ten patients were admitted to psychiatric hospitals, the rest recovered in medical units, or left health care against medical advice.

Discussion

Scopolamine poisonings are rare, but the resulting anticholinergic syndrome is well described. The syndrome was not recognized until the forensic analysis result strikingly changed how the patients were diagnosed and handled. A unique aspect of this epidemic was the intoxicating agent being scopolamine-containing tablets looking like Rohypnol, sold and used under the impression of being the latter.

Conclusion

Recognizing the anticholinergic syndrome is important to provide proper treatment. Forensic analysis was the key to correct diagnosis in this outbreak, demonstrating its importance in verifying an epidemic of poisoning by fake drugs.

### Postoperative anticholinergic poisoning: concealed complications of a commonly used medication [^113nNarz]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Scopolamine is a potent anticholinergic compound used commonly for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Scopolamine can cause atypical anticholinergic syndromes due to its prominent central antimuscarinic effects.

Case Report

A 47-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) 20 h after hospital discharge for a right-knee meniscectomy, with altered mental status (AMS) and dystonic extremity movements that began 12 h after her procedure. Her vital signs were normal and physical examination revealed mydriasis, visual hallucinations, hyperreflexia, and dystonic movements. Laboratory data, lumbar puncture, and computed tomography were unrevealing. The sustained AMS prompted a re-evaluation that revealed urinary overflow with 500 mL of retained urine discovered on ultrasound and a scopolamine patch hidden behind her ear. Her mental status improved shortly after patch removal and physostigmine, with complete resolution after 24 h with discharge diagnosis of scopolamine-induced anticholinergic toxicity. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although therapeutically dosed scopolamine transdermal patches rarely cause complications, incomplete toxidromes can be insidiously common in polypharmacy settings. Providers should thoroughly evaluate the skin of intoxicated patients for additional adherent medications that may result in a delay in ED diagnosis and curative therapies. Our case, as well as rare case reports of therapeutic scopolamine-induced anticholinergic toxicity, demonstrates that peripheral anticholinergic effects, such as tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, and hyperpyrexia are often not present, and incremental doses of physostigmine may be required to reverse scopolamine's long duration of action. This further complicates identification of the anticholinergic toxidrome and diagnosis.

Results

We identified a total of 201,908 patients aged 20 and above who underwent a major surgical procedure and received perioperative scopolamine within 24 h of surgery between January 1, 2009, and March 21, 2018. In the same timeframe, we identified 14,100,875 patients aged 20 and above who underwent a major surgical procedure and did not receive perioperative scopolamine. After 1:1 propensity score matching each age group cohort, we identified a total of 403,816 (201,908 pairs) perioperative scopolamine users and nonusers. The cohorts of 20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, and 70 + contained 22,910 (11,455 pairs), 44,170 (22,085 pairs), 58,590 (29,295 pairs), 71,660 (35,830 pairs), 88,386 (44,193 pairs), and 118,100 (59,050 pairs) patients respectively. The baseline characteristics: sex, race, ethnicity, surgery type, and comorbidity burden pre and post propensity score matching are shown in Table 1. The treatment cohorts were well balanced, with standardized mean differences less than 0.1.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous or intramuscular scopolamine. Avoid use of TRANSDERM SCOP in patients with severe preeclampsia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Data]. Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes.

In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data

In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Animal Data

In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by TRANSDERM SCŌP did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for TRANSDERM SCŌP and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from TRANSDERM SCŌP or from the underlying maternal condition.

Intradermal skin testing to atropine and scopolamine has been described in 7 healthy volunteers using 20 nmol and 2 nmol with solutions prepared in 0.9% saline, 0.03% human albumin, and 0.4% phenol buffered to pH 6.5 to 7.5. Reported clinical testing used undiluted atropine for skin prick at 0.6 mg/mL with intradermal 1:1000, and in another case atropine 1 mg/mL for skin prick with 0.1 mg/mL intradermal, with a positive intradermal in the patient and negative intradermal in 10 control subjects. Regarding management, there is little evidence for cross‑reactivity across antimuscarinic agents; case reports recommend avoidance of similar antimuscarinic drugs, and desensitization protocols are yet to be described.

### Optimal perioperative management of the geriatric patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons NSQIP and the American Geriatrics Society [^112m5TMx]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2016). Medium credibility.

Perioperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in older adults — risk assessment and prevention are emphasized: The risk factors for postoperative nausea and vomiting should be assessed in all older adult patients undergoing a surgical procedure, and there are several tools available that can assist with objective assessment of risk, including the Apfel and Koivuranta tools. Risk factors for PONV include patient-specific: Female gender; Nonsmoking status; History of PONV or motion sickness; Younger age (age < 50 years); and anesthetic- and surgery-related: Use of volatile anesthetics and nitrous oxide; General versus regional anesthesia; Use of intraoperative and postoperative opioids; Longer duration of surgery. Older adults at moderate or high risk for PONV should receive prophylactic interventions and risk mitigation strategies based on their baseline risk factors per guidelines and local norms. The health care team should be aware of those medications used for PONV prophylaxis and treatment that are on the American Geriatrics Society updated Beers criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults and carefully weigh their potential benefits and risks. Important in its prevention and management in older adults is appropriate risk stratification, implementation of prevention strategies, and avoidance of medications typically used this setting (for example, scopolamine) that may precipitate confusion and postoperative delirium.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Prevention of Motion Sickness

In 195 adult subjects of different racial origins who participated in clinical efficacy studies at sea or in a controlled motion environment, there was a 75% reduction in the incidence of motion-induced nausea and vomiting. TRANSDERM SCŌP was applied from 4 to 16 hours prior to the onset of motion in these studies.

14.2 Prevention of Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting

A clinical efficacy study evaluated 168 adult female patients undergoing gynecological surgery with anesthesia and opiate analgesia. Patients received TRANSDERM SCŌP or placebo applied approximately 11 hours before anesthesia/opiate analgesia. No retching/vomiting during the 24-hour post-operative period was reported in 79% of those treated with TRANSDERM SCŌP compared to 72% of those receiving placebo. When the need for additional antiemetic medication was assessed during the same period, there was no need for medication in 89% of patients treated with TRANSDERM SCŌP as compared to 72% of placebo-treated patients.

### A comprehensive analysis of in-hospital adverse events after scopolamine administration: insights from a retrospective cohort study using a large nationwide inpatient database [^112Jj9Az]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Supporting this hypothesis, our study found an increased risk of delirium in patients over the age of 60, despite not having significantly higher use of deliriogenic medications, such as benzodiazepines (Supplemental Table S1). These results align with the American Geriatrics Society's strong recommendation to avoid the use of anticholinergic agents, such as scopolamine, in elderly patients. This also corroborates the findings of a retrospective study by Herrmann et al. which identified a strong association between the administration of anticholinergic medications and postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing elective surgery.

Although the absolute risk of delirium was over 1% only in the 70 + age group, this is likely an underestimation. TriNetX relies on the logging of CPT codes, and cases of mild to moderate delirium that respond to treatment are often not recorded. In contrast, a meta-analysis by Sadeghirad et al. found that 18% of adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery met the criteria for delirium. The studies included in this meta-analysis employed well-validated and highly specific tools for assessing delirium, such as the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and the Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOSS), which primarily screen for inattention, confusion, and sedation — symptoms that are commonly observed after surgery.

### Practice advisory for intraoperative awareness and brain function monitoring: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on intraoperative awareness [^112mn2rv]. Anesthesiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Intraoperative awareness — preinduction checks and prophylactic medications address system checks and selective use of benzodiazepines or scopolamine. Issues regarding the preinduction phase include checking the functioning of anesthesia delivery systems and the prophylactic administration of benzodiazepines, and the consultants and ASA members strongly agree that the functioning of anesthesia delivery systems should be checked to reduce the risk. Randomized clinical trials evaluated the prophylactic administration of midazolam during total intravenous anesthesia and reported a lower frequency of intraoperative awareness versus placebo, and other randomized clinical trials examined anterograde amnesia after midazolam given before induction, although the presence of consciousness during general anesthesia and subsequent intraoperative awareness was not examined. The consultants disagree and the ASA members are equivocal that a benzodiazepine or scopolamine should be used as a component of the anesthetic for all patients; the consultants agree it should be used for patients requiring smaller dosages of anesthetics and for patients undergoing cardiac or trauma surgery and are equivocal regarding cesarean delivery, emergency surgery, and total intravenous anesthesia; ASA members agree it should be used for patients requiring smaller dosages and for cardiac surgery, emergency surgery, trauma surgery, and total intravenous anesthesia and are equivocal regarding cesarean delivery. The Task Force believes there should be adherence to a checklist protocol for anesthesia machines and equipment, extended to verification of intravenous access, infusion pumps, and connections; the Task Force consensus is that the decision to administer a benzodiazepine prophylactically should be made on a case-by-case basis for selected patients, and the Task Force cautions that delayed emergence may accompany the use of benzodiazepines.

### Transdermal scopolamine: an alternative to ondansetron and droperidol for the prevention of postoperative and postdischarge emetic symptoms [^111ByuBT]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Given the controversy regarding the use of droperidol and the high cost of the 5-HT3 antagonists, a cost-effective alternative for routine use as a prophylactic antiemetic would be desirable. We designed two parallel, randomized, double-blind sham and placebo-controlled studies to compare the early and late antiemetic efficacy and adverse event profile of transdermal scopolamine (TDS) 1.5 mg, to ondansetron 4 mg IV, and droperidol 1.25 mg IV for antiemetic prophylaxis as part of a multimodal regimen in "at risk" surgical populations.

Methods

A total of 150 patients undergoing major laparoscopic (n = 80) or plastic (n = 70) surgery procedures received either an active TDS patch (containing scopolamine 1.5 mg) or a similar appearing sham patch 60 min before entering the operating room. All patients received a standardized general anesthetic technique. A second study medication was administered in a 2-mL numbered syringe containing either saline (for the two active TDS groups), droperidol, 1.25 mg, or ondansetron, 4 mg (for the sham patch groups), and was administered IV near the end of the procedure. The occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting/retching, need for rescue antiemetics, and the complete response rates (i.e., absence of protracted nausea or repeated episodes of emesis requiring antiemetic rescue medication) was reported. In addition, complaints of visual disturbances, dry mouth, drowsiness, and restlessness were noted up to 72 h after surgery.

Results

There were no significant differences in any of the emetic outcomes or need for rescue antiemetics among the TDS, droperidol, and ondansetron groups in the first 72 h after surgery. The complete response rates varied from 41% to 51%, and did not significantly differ among the treatment groups. The overall incidence of dry mouth was significantly more frequent in the TDS groups than in the droperidol and ondansetron groups (21% vs 3%).

Conclusions

Premedication with TDS was as effective as droperidol (1.25 mg) or ondansetron (4 mg) in preventing nausea and vomiting in the early and late postoperative periods. However, the use of a TDS patch is more likely to produce a dry mouth.

### A randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing transdermal scopolamine plus ondansetron to ondansetron alone for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting in the outpatient setting [^115TUrbq]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are common complications after ambulatory surgery. We sought to determine whether the use of transdermal scopolamine (TDS) in combination with IV ondansetron (OND) is more effective than one alone for reducing PONV in outpatient settings.

Methods

In a randomized, double blind, multicenter trial, 620 at-risk female patients undergoing outpatient laparoscopic or breast augmentation surgery received either an active TDS patch or a similar appearing sham 2 h before entering the operating room. All patients received IV OND (4 mg) 2–5 min before induction of anesthesia followed by a general anesthetic regimen. Complete antiemetic response, defined as no vomiting/retching or rescue medication use, was measured through 24 h and 48 h after surgery. The proportion of patients with vomiting/retching, nausea, or use of rescue medication, the time from the end of surgery to the first episode of these events and the time to discharge from the hospital/surgery center, as well as the number and severity of vomiting/retching and nausea episodes, and patient satisfaction with antiemetic therapy were also collected.

Results

The combination of TDS + OND statistically significantly reduced nausea and vomiting/retching compared with OND alone 24 h after surgery but not at 48 h. The proportion of patients who did not experience vomiting/retching and did not use rescue medication was 48% for TDS + OND and 39% for OND alone (P < 0.02). Total response (no nausea, no vomiting/retching, and no use of rescue medication) was also statistically higher for the TDS + OND group compared with the OND-only group (35% vs 25%, P < 0.01). The time to first nausea, vomiting/retching, or rescue episode was statistically significantly longer for the TDS + OND group compared with the OND-only group (P < 0.05). The cumulative overall incidence of adverse events was lower in the TDS + OND group compared with the OND group (36.7% vs 49%, P < 0.01).

Conclusions

TDS + OND reduces PONV compared with OND alone. This is achieved with a reduction in adverse events.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Anticholinergic toxicity includes both central and peripheral signs and symptoms: agitation, central nervous system effects (e.g., coma, confusion, hallucinations, lethargy, seizures, somnolence), decreased bowel sounds, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, hyperthermia, hypertension, supraventricular arrhythmias, tachycardia, urinary retention, visual disturbances (e.g., amblyopia, mydriasis). These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention.

In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended.

The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal.

If over-exposure occurs, call the Poison Help line at 1–800–222–1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage.

### Cholinergic regulation of mood: from basic and clinical studies to emerging therapeutics [^112vebG4]. Molecular Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Mood disorders are highly prevalent and are the leading cause of disability worldwide. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression remain poorly understood, although theories regarding dysfunction within various neurotransmitter systems have been postulated. Over 50 years ago, clinical studies suggested that increases in central acetylcholine could lead to depressed mood. Evidence has continued to accumulate suggesting that the cholinergic system has a important role in mood regulation. In particular, the finding that the antimuscarinic agent, scopolamine, exerts fast-onset and sustained antidepressant effects in depressed humans has led to a renewal of interest in the cholinergic system as an important player in the neurochemistry of major depression and bipolar disorder. Here, we synthesize current knowledge regarding the modulation of mood by the central cholinergic system, drawing upon studies from human postmortem brain, neuroimaging, and drug challenge investigations, as well as animal model studies. First, we describe an illustrative series of early discoveries which suggest a role for acetylcholine in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Then, we discuss more recent studies conducted in humans and/or animals which have identified roles for both acetylcholinergic muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in different mood states, and as targets for novel therapies.

A transdermal scopolamine patch is an effective medication for relieving motion sickness, treating nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy and decreasing withdrawal side-effects from wearing off opioids. A 14-year-old boy with chronic granulomatous disease and severe infection was admitted to the hospital because of left shoulder aspergillus' infection and pain. The patient required high dose opioid to control the shoulder pain. A unilateral fixed and dilated pupil was noted. We assumed this to be related to the advancing central nervous system aspergillosis. After extensive neurological 'work up', we realized that the anisocoria was related to the transdermal scopolamine patch that we had prescribed for weaning off the opioid.

This case exemplifies thorough history taking is still essential to avoid unnecessary investigation, patient anxiety and potentially harmful therapy.

Learning points

It is important to recognise neurological symptoms that mimic a stroke before considering administering tPA.
Healthcare providers should be aware of accidental ocular contamination with scopolamine and other anticholinergic agents in cases of unilateral mydriasis.
Obtaining a detailed and targeted history is still essential to prevent costly investigations, unnecessary radiation to the patient and potentially harmful therapy.

### Overnight transdermal scopolamine patch administration has no clear effect on cognition and emotional processing in healthy volunteers [^1175UYXH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Medium credibility.

There has been increasing interest in the antidepressant effects of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist scopolamine. Here we assess, for the first time, whether a transdermal scopolamine patch is sufficient to induce changes in cognition that are consistent with the reported cognitive and antidepressant effects of scopolamine. A scopolamine or placebo patch was administered to healthy volunteers (n = 33) for 17 h in a double-blind, between-subject procedure. There was no clear effect of scopolamine patch on emotional cognition, verbal or working memory, suggesting that the effective dose of scopolamine available through the patch is too low to represent a viable antidepressant mechanism.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia because eclamptic seizures have been reported after exposure to scopolamine (see Data).

In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data

Eclamptic Seizures

In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Animal Data

In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because there have been no consistent reports of adverse events in breastfed infants over decades of use, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine transdermal system or from the underlying maternal condition.

### Experimental medication treatment approaches for depression [^117Sp5sJ]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Cholinergic modulators

Scopolamine

Hypercholinergic states in the brain may be a cause of depression. Therefore, anticholinergic compounds may have a role in the treatment of depression. Scopolamine, derived from the plant Brugmansia, is an antimuscarinic medication that acts specifically at the M1 receptor. One study investigated intravenous repeat infusions of scopolamine (4 mcg kg⁻¹) versus placebo. Specifically, patients with unipolar or bipolar depression (n = 19) were randomized to receive a sequence of scopolamine/placebo or placebo/scopolamine; each series consisted of three placebo sessions and three scopolamine sessions at 3–5 days apart. Compared with placebo, scopolamine significantly reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety after only a few days after the initial intravenous scopolamine infusion. These data were later replicated in a patient with major depressive disorder (n = 22 analyzed).

CP-601,927

Developed by Pfizer, CP-601,927 is a partial agonist at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Fava et al. recently conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the antidepressant efficacy of augmentation with CP-601,927 (1–2 mg b.i.d.) compared with placebo in patients with treatment-resistant depression (refractory to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Unfortunately, there were no overall statistical differences between changes in depression ratings from baseline to week 14 in the drug group compared with placebo. However, post hoc analyses revealed that elevated leptin levels at baseline had a significant effect on treatment outcome. Specifically, P -values for the effect of treatment on changes in depression scores were 0.0055 for patients above the median for leptin levels. Despite the overall negative results, the data point toward a potential use of leptin levels as a biomarker of patient subtypes for predicting treatment outcomes.

### Sialorrhea-therapeutic drug options [^115ddPR6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of various drug treatments for sialorrhea. Pharmacotherapy for drug-induced sialorrhea is not addressed.

Data Sources

Clinical studies were identified using PubMed (1966-October 2001). Key search terms included sialorrhea and drug therapy.

Data Synthesis

Sialorrhea is a social and physical detriment to patients. Drug treatment, although not necessarily the treatment of choice for all patients, can offer some symptom relief.

Conclusions

Literature has documented that benztropine, glycopyrrolate, and scopolamine can reduce the incidence of sialorrhea. Although the literature evaluating the therapeutic options has limitations (e.g., small sample size, inconsistent outcome measurements), glycopyrrolate may have an advantage over the other agents due to fewer adverse effects.

If therapy for more than 3 days is required, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new transdermal system behind the other ear. (2.2)
PONV: For surgeries other than cesarean section, apply one transdermal system behind the ear the evening before surgery and remove 24 hours following surgery. (2.2)

2.1 Important Application and Removal Instructions

Each scopolamine transdermal system is formulated to deliver in vivo approximately 1 mg of scopolamine over 3 days.
Only wear one transdermal system at any time.
Do not cut the transdermal system.
Apply the transdermal system to the skin in the postauricular area (hairless area behind one ear).
After the transdermal system is applied on the dry skin behind the ear, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry hands [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
If the transdermal system becomes displaced, discard the transdermal system, and apply a new transdermal system on the hairless area behind the other ear.

10 OVERDOSAGE

The signs and symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity include: lethargy, somnolence, coma, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, convulsion, visual disturbance, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, tachycardia, hypertension, and supraventricular arrhythmias. These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention.

In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended.

The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal.

If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1–800–222–1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage.

### Transdermal scopolamine as an adjunct to multimodal pain management in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty [^1163zLdi]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after surgery degrades patient experience, tolerance of pain medication, rehabilitation progress, and functional outcomes. Given the importance of early rehabilitation following total joint arthroplasty (TJA), we asked whether transdermal scopolamine is effective in reducing rates of PONV and improving functional outcomes following TJA.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 1580 consecutive patients who underwent TJA between 2014 and 2017 and compared patients before the addition of the scopolamine patch (control group) to those after the addition (study group). Patients were given the scopolamine patch in the holding area unless contraindicated. A total of 495 patients were excluded. Charts were reviewed for PONV, demographic information, surgical time, length of stay, distance walked with physical therapy, and Visual Analog Scale pain scores. Student t-test was used to compare continuous data and chi-square was used for categorical variables.

Results

The incidence of PONV was significantly lower in the study group compared to the control group (14.4% vs 29.3%, P < .0001). Patients who were given scopolamine had lower Visual Analog Scale pain scores on postoperative days (POD) 0 through 2 (P < .01), were able to walk further distances on POD 0 through 3 (P < .001), and received fewer morphine equivalents on POD 1 and 2 (P < .001). Greater morphine equivalents were received by the study group on POD 0.

Conclusion

Use of a scopolamine patch was associated with significant reduction in PONV and improvement in functional outcomes following TJA. These data support the use of transdermal scopolamine as part of a multimodal, perioperative pain protocol in patients undergoing TJA.

### Antiemetic-related dystonic reaction unmasked by removal of a scopolamine transdermal patch [^117YJYjK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

A case of a dystonic reaction is presented that occurred after the use of prochlorperazine, metoclopramide and ondansetron for the treatment of post-operative nausea and vomiting. The onset of dystonia coincided temporally with the removal of a transdermal scopolamine patch used as adjunctive antiemetic therapy. Withdrawal of concurrently administered anticholinergic medication, after recent use of antiemetic medications with dopamine receptor (D2) inhibition, can unmask a dystonic reaction. This case also suggests that transdermal scopolamine may offer an innovative therapy for the treatment of acute dystonic reactions.

### Noneffectiveness of scopolamine for facilitating detection of upper gastrointestinal neoplasia during screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy: propensity score-matched study [^116fKyvn]. Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Antispasmodics, such as scopolamine, are widely used in several countries prior to diagnostic and screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), with the goal of optimizing the detection of minute lesions, typically early gastric cancer (T1 lesions). The aim of this study was to determine whether scopolamine facilitates detection of gastric cancer in the screening setting.

Methods

A propensity score-matched retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary referral medical center in Tokyo, Japan. Consecutive individuals (n = 40776) underwent screening EGD between January 2011 and May 2016. All outcome lesions were diagnosed with histopathological confirmation. Detection of esophageal cancer, gastric adenoma, duodenal adenoma, and upper gastrointestinal neoplasia (UGIN) were investigated as secondary outcomes.

Results

Scopolamine was used in 31130 patients (76.3%) and propensity score matching yielded 6625 pairs. Bivariate analysis revealed no significant association between possible confounders (age, sex, overweight, atrophic gastritis, alcohol history, smoking history, midazolam use, endoscopist biopsy rate grade, and gastric cancer in first-degree relatives) and scopolamine use. Lesions detected were 18 gastric cancers, 11 esophageal cancers, 19 gastric adenomas, 6 duodenal adenomas, and 54 UGINs, with no significant association between scopolamine use and lesion detection.

Conclusions

Scopolamine use did not appear to effectively facilitate detection of gastric or esophageal cancer, gastric or duodenal adenoma, and UGIN during screening EGD. Scopolamine should be avoided until its efficacy is confirmed by a randomized controlled trial.

### Anisocoria secondary to inadvertent contact with scopolamine patch [^111vHdXr]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A unilaterally fixed mydriasis, also known as a 'blown pupil', is considered an ominous sign concerning for intracranial pathology. Causes of anisocoria can range from benign to immediately life-threatening. When a patient presents with anisocoria, the concern for a fatal diagnosis leads the clinician to obtain numerous tests, many of which may be unnecessary. The authors present a case of a healthy woman in her 30s who presented with an acute unilateral mydriasis likely secondary to inadvertent contact with a scopolamine patch. On examination, she had no other neurological deficits. Further investigation did not reveal any abnormality. In the event of a patient with an isolated mydriasis in an otherwise healthy and conversant patient with no other neurological deficits, it is essential to rule out other causes before pursuing aggressive and unnecessary testing and treatment.

### Microdosing of scopolamine as a "cognitive stress test": rationale and test of a very low dose in an at-risk cohort of older adults [^112aLsfP]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Abnormal β-amyloid (Aβ) is associated with deleterious changes in central acetylcholinergic tone in the very early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which may be unmasked by a cholinergic antagonist. We aimed to establish an optimal "microdose" of scopolamine for the development of a "cognitive stress test".

Methods

Healthy older adults (n = 26, aged 55–75 years) with two risk factors for AD, but with low cortical Aβ burden, completed the Groton Maze Learning Test (GMLT) at baseline and then received scopolamine (0.20 mg subcutaneously). Participants were reassessed at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8 hours postinjection.

Results

There were significant differences, of a moderate magnitude, in performance between baseline and 3 hours postinjection for total errors, rule break errors, and the GMLT composite (d ≈ 0.50) that were all unrelated to body mass.

Conclusions

A very low dose of scopolamine leads to reliable cognitive impairment at 3 hours postdose (Tmax) and full cognitive recovery within 5 hours, supporting its use as a prognostic test paradigm to identify individuals with potential preclinical AD. This paradigm is being implemented in a larger cohort of healthy adults, with high or low Aβ, to identify pharmacodynamic differences between groups.

Principles of medication management at end-of-life — ventilator withdrawal and secretion control: Precede the ventilator withdrawal with the cessation of neuromuscular blockade, and administer appropriate medications for sedation and analgesia, and for the prevention and treatment of dyspnea. Often the patient is simply extubated after suctioning because oral and respiratory secretions can cause stridor, airway obstruction, or the "death rattle". Head of bed elevation, oral suctioning, and transdermal scopolamine can reduce secretions. Patients and families find dyspnea very distressing — reassure them.

Outcome and follow-up

Following thorough workup, including neurology and ophthalmology consult, the patient was discharged from the emergency department and given appropriate follow-up with both the neurologist and ophthalmologist. The patient's mydriasis and blurry vision improved within 2 days of onset of the symptoms without any need for medical intervention. It has been reported that mydriasis caused by scopolamine or hyoscine normally resolves spontaneously within 24–72 hours. However, its effects can last anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks.

### Postoperative urinary retention [^111bYrHu]. Urogynecology (2023). High credibility.

Research needs for postoperative urinary retention (POUR) after PRS and MUS — medications, VT criteria, and postdischarge management — are identified as follows: Future research should be considered with respect to preoperative medication management, including determining when women should discontinue anticholinergics preoperatively; the use of bethanechol perioperatively warrants further study and comparisons with tamsulosin may be informative; and the role of scopolamine with respect to POUR is poorly defined, with evidence quantifying its RR and benefits needed to determine when its use is warranted. The review highlights inconsistency in classification and management of patients with POUR after PRS, noting a wide range in definition of VT failure; standardization of VT passing criteria based on VT type is a prerequisite for future research, and further studies on patients undergoing multiple VTs would be useful to assess criteria equivalence. Additional research is needed to guide management following discharge, including evidence comparing repeat VT at varying intervals after the index surgery to optimize chances of passing on a second attempt while minimizing risks of prolonged catheterization, and in MUS, studies should evaluate timing of MUS revision and compare loosening versus cutting techniques.

### Transdermal scopolamine patch with odansetron for the control of nausea after uterine artery embolization compared with odansetron alone: results of a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^115Q9iTx]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether the transdermal scopolamine patch in combination with odansetron is more effective than odansetron alone at reducing the nausea that occurs after uterine artery embolization (UAE).

Materials and Methods

Patients undergoing UAE at a single university medical center were randomly assigned to receive either a scopolamine patch (containing 1.5 mg of scopolamine) or a placebo. All participants and study personnel were blinded as to group assignment. The primary outcome was the degree of nausea in the first 24 hours after UAE as measured on a visual analog scale from 0 to 10. Nausea and pain at 24 and 72 hours after UAE and medication use were recorded. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were also analyzed.

Results

A total of 74 patients were enrolled; 37 were randomly assigned to receive scopolamine, and 37 received placebo. Although the overall level of nausea after UAE was low (mean score of 2.6 out of 10), there was a lower level of nausea with those treated with scopolamine compared with placebo during the first 24 hours after embolization; the difference was statistically significant (1.8 vs 3.4, P = 0.03). Adverse events were more common with the patch, with two patients experiencing episodes of profound disorientation and 71% reporting substantial dry mouth. The only predictor of greater nausea was the increasing severity of pain.

Conclusions

The scopolamine patch provides a moderate reduction in the nausea associated with UAE but is associated with infrequent but notable episodes of patient disorientation.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^1129XF5n]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Vestibular suppressants for acute vertigo in Ménière's disease — central vestibular suppressants (first-generation antihistamines, benzodiazepines, and anticholinergics) are used for acute vertigo attacks but should be used only to suppress acute vertiginous events; chronic use is undesirable because it can suppress central adaptation/compensation and perpetuate symptoms of chronic imbalance, and there is a paucity of peer-reviewed evidence with insufficient evidence demonstrating the relative efficacy of any given class over another. Benzodiazepines are gamma aminobutyric acid receptor agonists effective at suppressing vertigo and mitigating nausea, yet there is no evidence for the superiority of one benzodiazepine over another or over first-generation antihistamines, and all benzodiazepines carry significant risk for drug dependence. Centrally acting anticholinergic drugs (scopolamine and atropine) and glycopyrrolate can suppress acute attacks, with scopolamine most commonly used in a transdermal formulation created primarily to prevent motion sickness, but anticholinergics can cause blurring of vision, dry mouth, dilated pupils, urinary retention, and sedation, and because of toxicity and withdrawal when used for more than several days they are not commonly prescribed for acute vertigo control associated with MD.

### Acetylcholine modulates the temporal dynamics of human theta oscillations during memory [^114BgyNk]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Subjects' memory performance significantly decreased in the presence of scopolamine. Every subject individually showed a significantly lower recall probability in the scopolamine condition compared to placebo (all p 's < 0.05, χ² tests), with the magnitude of this decrease ranging from ~20 to 100% (Fig. 1 c). At the group level, the disrupted memory performance from scopolamine was significant, with subjects remembering an average of 31.2 ± 3.27% of items with saline, and only 10.3 ± 3.56% with scopolamine (mean ± SEM; t (12) = 6.19, p = 6.79 × 10⁻⁵, paired t -test) (Fig. 1 b). Across subjects, the magnitude of the scopolamine-related memory disruption was not explained by variations in patients' weight (Fig. S1 b), age (r = 0.101, p = 0.754, two-sided Pearson's correlation), or the interaction between weight and age (p > 0.05, linear mixed effect (LME) model). The effects of scopolamine were sustained throughout the experiment, as there were no significant changes in mean recall probability across trials within sessions (Fig. S2 c). These results, showing the robust disruption of human episodic memory encoding following scopolamine administration, are consistent with previous experiments.

### Rapid-acting antidepressants targeting modulation of the glutamatergic system: clinical and preclinical evidence and mechanisms [^114dnFny]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a devastating mental illness that affects approximately 20% of the world's population. It is a major disease that leads to disability and suicide, causing a severe burden among communities. Currently available medications for treating MDD target the monoaminergic systems. The most prescribed medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. However, these medications have serious drawbacks, such as a delayed onset requiring weeks or months to reach efficacy and drug resistance, as one-third of patients are unresponsive to the medications. Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel therapies with rapid action, high efficacy and few adverse effects. The discovery of the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine has triggered tremendous enthusiasm for studying new antidepressants that target the glutamatergic system in the central nervous system. Many agents that directly or indirectly modulate the glutamatergic system have been shown to provide rapid and lasting antidepressant action. Among these agents, ketamine, an antagonist of metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptors, and scopolamine, an unspecific muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, have been extensively studied. In this review, we discuss the clinical and preclinical evidence supporting the antidepressant efficacy of these agents and the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

### Transdermal scopolamine for prevention of intrathecal morphine-induced nausea and vomiting after cesarean delivery [^115DjLBg]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Intrathecal morphine for cesarean delivery provides excellent postoperative analgesia but is associated with significant nausea and vomiting.

Methods

We compared the antiemetic efficacy of transdermal scopolamine, IV ondansetron, and placebo during the first 24 h postoperatively. Two-hundred forty women undergoing cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated, in a double-blind study design, to receive transdermal scopolamine 1.5 mg, ondansetron 4 mg, or placebo at the time of cord clamping.

Results

Our study showed that the overall rates for all emesis were 59.3% in the placebo group and were reduced to 40% in the scopolamine group and 41.8% in the ondansetron group. The greatest reduction in emesis in the scopolamine group when compared with placebo was in the 6–24 h time period.

Conclusion

Scopolamine is an effective medication for prophylactic use in parturients receiving intrathecal morphine while undergoing cesarean delivery. Its use, however, was associated with a higher incidence of side effects such as dry mouth and blurry vision.

5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions

Psychiatric Adverse Reactions

Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Seizures

Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold.

Cognitive Adverse Reactions

Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Hazardous Activities

Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely.

5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women

Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia.

### Efficacy of scopolamine transdermal patch in children with sialorrhea in a pediatric tertiary care hospital [^113P5Yew]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Scopolamine transdermal patch (STP) has been used to decrease salivation in adult patients and was reported in 1984 by Dettman et al. and Gordon et al. in 1985 with a significant reduction of the salivary flow. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 1994 on ten developmentally delayed children supported earlier reports of the safety and efficacy of STP for reducing excessive drooling. Another study in Nijmegen, 2006 conducted in an out-patient clinic on 45 pediatric patients with CP and severe drooling, using scopolamine patch and botulinum toxin, showed that both scopolamine and botulinum toxin significantly decreased salivary flow. In 2010, a prospective randomized double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial done in Spain for 30 patients with severe disabilities came up with significant reduction in drooling. A multi-center randomized controlled trial was initiated to identify whether glycopyrronium or scopolamine was more effective in treating drooling in children with non-progressive neurodisability, and showed that scopolamine and glycopyrrolate were both clinically effective in treating drooling, but scopolamine produced more problematic side effects leading to a greater chance of treatment cessation. In a recent study by Reid et al. benzhexol, glycopyrrolate, and scopolamine reduced drooling, but improvement was offset by adverse side effects, glycopyrrolate performed best. A number of side effects have been reported with STP such as; blurred vision, sedation, dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, increased seizure frequency, constipation, urinary retention, difficulties in hot weather due to decreased sweating and mild itching/redness at the application site.

Despite the abundance of reports on the efficacy and safety profiles of each treatment option, definitive conclusions are difficult to draw, given the heterogeneous nature of the patient populations studied and the different outcome measures used in the various studies. The aims of this study were: (1) to assess the impact of scopolamine transdermal patch use on the severity and frequency of drooling, (2) to assess its efficacy in pediatric patients with regards to the frequency of drooling-related emergency department (ED) visits and hospital readmission (RA) visits, and (3) to determine the level of satisfaction of families and/or caregivers and their convenience before and after using this medication.

Sialorrhea is a distressing symptom accompanying oral cancer and many heterogeneous cancer-related conditions (chemotherapy-induced nausea, bowel subocclusion, pharmacologic side effects), but its incidence is low in cancer patients. Conversely, it is frequent in patients with neurological damage, and some therapeutic options have been attempted such as botulinum toxins, anticholinergic agents, and surgical procedures.

Case Report

We report the case of an 80-year-old woman with peritoneal carcinomatosis and bowel subocclusion, suffering from distressing nausea and sialorrhea that rapidly improved using transdermal scopolamine. No relevant side effects occurred during the treatment, and the reduction of the abnormal salivation allowed the recovery of oral feeding.

Conclusions

Anticholinergic drugs are classified as secondary options in the treatment of sialorrhea of patients with Parkinson's disease or cerebral palsy, owing to the relevant side effects occurring during prolonged treatments. However, they could be useful in cancer patients with bowel subocclusion, as the reduction of gastrointestinal secretions and intestinal motility (frequent side effects of anticholinergic drugs) could be effective in controlling nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Moreover, the transdermal or sublingual route of administration can be of some interest, avoiding other more invasive parenteral approaches.

### Transdermal scopolamine withdrawal syndrome case report in the pediatric cerebral palsy population [^116Bwgny]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Sialorrhea in children with cerebral palsy (CP) results in aspiration, decreased social integration, and poor quality of life. Management options include transdermal anticholinergics such as the scopolamine patch. A controlled clinical trial has proven botulinum toxin (BTX) injections into the salivary glands are an effective alternative to transdermal anticholinergics with a safer side effect profile. Multiple studies of the injections in diverse populations demonstrate reduction in saliva production with improvement in quality of life and decrease in hospitalization-associated costs. The authors describe a 15-year-old boy with spastic quadriplegic CP who developed emesis, nausea, and lethargy 1 day after the first injection of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) to his salivary glands for sialorrhea management. The authors ascribed his symptoms to scopolamine withdrawal. Given the lack of exposure in the medical literature, there is minimal awareness of the withdrawal syndrome from transdermal scopolamine in children with or without CP, resulting in delayed diagnosis and potential complications. Treatment of the withdrawal syndrome has been successful with meclizine though safety and efficacy has not been established in children younger than 12 despite frequent clinical and over-the-counter use. Prompt diagnosis of the transdermal scopolamine withdrawal syndrome can result in quicker treatment and a shorter hospital stay.

### Transdermal scopolamine use for post-rhytidectomy sialocele [^117U1Q8A]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Post-rhytidectomy sialocele is a rare complication. The usual treatment uses prolonged drainage. The use of antisialogogues has been described previously, but has potential side effects. Transdermal scopolamine SCOPODERM TTS is indicated for the prevention of motion sickness and also has antisialogugue action.

Methods

An interventional case report is presented.

Results

The application of transdermal scopolamine SCOPODERM TTS resulted in resolution of a post-rhytidectomy sialocele within 6 days.

Conclusion

Transdermal scopolamine delivery should be considered as an option for the treatment of post-rhytidectomy parotid fistulas.

### ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified in children aged 4–18 years [^113CRM2T]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale: The specialized nature of second‐line analgesics warrants expert guidance when considering their application to pediatric AP‐DGBIs. Agents like gabapentin or pregabalin have roles in wider pain management, but come with well‐recognized significant side effect profiles and the complete absence of pediatric‐specific evidence for the treatment of AP‐DGBIs. Specialist involvement ensures that such treatments are only considered with extreme caution and within a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach tailored to the individual patient. This should not be considered unless patients have symptoms refractory to a large number of other therapy options that were delivered with good compliance. If used, limiting use when efficacy is not demonstrated is mandatory.

Rationale: Anticholinergic antispasmodics such as hyoscyamine, dicyclomine, and scopolamine butylbromide are commonly used to alleviate intermittent pain in the management of AP‐DGBIs. The use of antispasmodics is based on usual practice, anecdotal experience, data from animal studies, and recommendations from adult and pediatric guidelines. These medications work by blocking the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors, reducing gastrointestinal smooth muscle spasms, which can provide symptomatic relief. However, their potential adverse effects, including dry mouth, dizziness, blurred vision, and constipation, require careful consideration. Therefore, clinical expertise is necessary to ensure a balanced approach to patient care. Clinical trials are recommended due to the low level of evidence regarding their effectiveness.

### Anisocoria secondary to inadvertent contact with scopolamine patch [^117HbZY2]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A healthy 30-year-old female nurse who presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of blurry vision in the right eye. She was noted to have right unilateral mydriasis without any other neurological deficits. The patient had no significant medical history, denied any history of trauma or use of any new medications, aside from her chronic oral contraceptive use. The patient denied any smoking or alcohol consumption. Her family history was unremarkable.

For fear of a stroke in such a young healthy patient, a Code Neuro was immediately called. Clinically relevant differential diagnoses to rule out in this type of presentation included cerebrovascular accident, carotid artery dissection, cerebral aneurysm, multiple sclerosis and drug-induced mydriasis. CT of the head without contrast, CT angiogram of the head and MRI of brain were all obtained and negative for any abnormalities. Ophthalmology was consulted. Patient's consensual response of the left eye was preserved, however, the right eye remained non-reactive to light and dilated at 5.5 mm. However, in a dim/dark room, patient's left eye dilated from 2.7 to 3.1 mm, and the right eye pupil remained unchanged. Extraocular muscles were intact; funduscopic examination was normal and visual acuity was 20/25 in both the right and left eyes. After multiple tests and several interviews, the patient recalled having contact with a patient in the hospital with a scopolamine patch. She insisted that she washed her hand immediately after this activity and did not recall touching the patch. However, despite not having direct contact with the scopolamine patch, the patient could have contacted contaminated bedding and rubbed her eye. Within 2 days of the onset of symptoms, patient's mydriasis improved and no longer complained of blurry vision.

This unique presentation of pharmacologically induced mydriasis emphasises the importance of obtaining a thorough and detailed history to evade expensive, unnecessary testing and misdiagnosis, and highlights the importance of recognising this rare side effect of a commonly used medication. The suspicion for a pharmacological cause should especially be heightened for patients who work in healthcare.

### Anisocoria secondary to inadvertent contact with scopolamine patch [^1162wadW]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological anisocoria can be distinguished from neurogenic pupillary dilation using the 1% pilocarpine test in both eyes. In the absence of trauma to the eye, if the dilated pupil fails to constrict within 30 min, is proof of pharmacological blockage of the iris muscle. Neurogenic dilation of the pupil due to oculomotor nerve palsy, for example, does not directly affect the cholinergic receptor of the sphincter pupillae, and will constrict if pilocarpine is instilled into the affected eye. Other causes of decreased response to pilocarpine would include trauma or increased intraocular pressure.

There are several case reports of inadvertent pharmacological mydriasis due to scopolamine (hyoscine). Many of these cases, an MRI or CT scan were obtained to investigate the cause of the anisocoria, however in only one case, imaging was cancelled as the patient recalled coming into contact with a scopolamine patch. A similar case report discussed a 46-year-old female nurse who worked in a stroke ward who also presented with sudden onset unilateral mydriasis. With further history, she recalled applying a hyoscine (scopolamine) patch to a patient in the morning. Another case report revealed a 42-year-old male with progressive blurred vision who had initially denied any topical eye medications, but later remembered that he used atropine 1% which believed were lubricant eye drops. Glassner and Skiendzielewski, also described inadvertent ocular contamination of scopolamine patches in air medical personnel. A 28-year-old male with blurry vision and unilateral mydriasis had been wearing a scopolamine patch to prevent motion sickness but inadvertently caused contamination to his eye. Aside from scopolamine, there have also been cases of inadvertent contact with anticholinergic agents that also lead to anisocoria. Examples include ipratropium use in critically ill patients and deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna).

### Acetylcholine modulates the temporal dynamics of human theta oscillations during memory [^114jJVL2]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In humans, the main behavioral effect of scopolamine is a disruption in the ability to encode new episodic memories. Importantly, the effects of scopolamine are specific to memory encoding and not retrieval, as there is minimal impact for recalling items learned prior to drug administration. A separate line of research in humans shows that theta oscillations are critical for memory encoding, supporting the notion that the memory impairment from cholinergic blockade in humans could also result from changes in theta. Theta power in the human hippocampus reliably increases for successful episodic memory encoding. Further, previous studies show that inter-trial phase locking in the theta band predicts successful memory –, and that theta networks synchronize during memory processing –. Computational models and associated experiments further suggest that acetylcholine promotes the shifting of hippocampal theta networks between encoding and retrieval states that preferentially occur at different phases of theta. Together, these findings support a hypothesis by which the cholinergic system regulates theta power and phase dynamics that underlie successful memory encoding.

Administering drugs that modulate cholinergic processes offers a direct intervention to understand the physiological effects of cholinergic tone in the human brain and examine its potential link to theta oscillations. Here, combining intracranial brain recordings, pharmacological manipulation, and behavioral experiments, we provide the first account of the neurophysiological effects of an anticholinergic drug in the human hippocampal formation during episodic memory. We administered a single dose of scopolamine (or saline, in a placebo condition) to twelve epilepsy patients prior to a verbal episodic memory task. Based on animal models, we hypothesized that scopolamine would disrupt hippocampal theta oscillations in humans, including both slow (2–4 Hz) and fast (4–10 Hz) theta bands. As such, we analyzed three physiological phenomena linked to theta oscillations and memory in humans: oscillatory power, phase reset, and synchrony. We found that scopolamine impaired memory for every subject and this impairment was accompanied by a selective disruption in slow theta power during encoding. We also found that scopolamine disrupted the phase reset of theta oscillations at the time of encoding, and that the magnitude of this disruption correlated with memory impairment. Lastly, we demonstrated that scopolamine disrupted theta-band synchrony within the hippocampal formation. These findings demonstrate that cholinergic blockade significantly influences oscillatory dynamics of theta power and phase in the hippocampal formation, suggesting potential strategies to restore memory in diseased states via selective modulation of theta oscillations.

### Scopolamine-medical countermeasures database-CHEMMchemm.hhs.gov › countermeasure_scopolamine… [^115bQ8Fw]. chemm.hhs.gov (2013). Low credibility.

Mechanism of action Scopolamine is a naturally occurring musarinic receptor antagonists and belladonna alkaloid. Scopolamine competes with acetylcholine and other muscarinic agonists for a common binding site on the muscarinic receptor. Muscarinic receptor antagonists inhibit responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation less effectively that they inhibit responses to injected choline esters. The difference may be explained by the fact that release of ACh by cholinergic nerve terminals occurs in close proximity to the receptors, resulting in very high concentrations of the transmitter at the receptors. Scopamine is able to permeate the blood brain barrier and is effective in preventing motion sickness, possibly by blocking neural pathways from the inner ear to the emetic center in the brainstem.

Diazepam and scopolamine are known to be beneficial when each is used in combination with atropine + oxime therapy against intoxication by soman, but the efficacy of each might be expected to vary with the dosage of AT. Exposure to high doses of organophosphorus nerve agents such as soman, even with carbamate pretreatment, produces a variety of toxic cholinergic signs, including secretions, convulsions and death. Evidence suggests that soman-induced convulsions may be associated with postexposure brain neuropathology. These findings allow us to postulate that central muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms are primarily involved in eliciting the convulsions following exposure to soman and that subsequent recruitment of other excitatory neurotransmitter systems and loss of inhibitory control may be responsible for sustaining the convulsions and for producing the subsequent brain damage. Future studies to confirm these neuropharmacological mechanisms are proposed.

The alkaloid L — scopolamine competitively inhibits muscarinic receptors for acetylcholine and acts as a nonselective muscarinic antagonist, producing both peripheral antimuscarinic properties and central sedative, antiemetic, and amnestic effects. The parasympatholytic scopolamine, structurally very similar to atropine, is used in conditions requiring decreased parasympathetic activity, primarily for its effect on the eye, gastrointestinal tract, heart, and salivary and bronchial secretion glands, and in special circumstances for a CNS action.

### FDA adds warning about serious risk of heat-related complications… [^111gLU5h]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

AUDIENCE: Patient, Health Care Professional, Neurology ISSUE: The FDA is warning that the antinausea patch Transderm Scōp can increase body temperature and cause heat-related complications, resulting in hospitalization or even death in some cases. Most cases occurred in children 17 years and younger and in adults 60 years and older, who may be sensitive to body temperature control disturbances. As a result, the FDA required that the Transderm Scōp prescribing information be revised to include a warning and other information about this risk. Most reports of hyperthermia that resulted in serious harm occurred when the Transderm Scōp was used in children 17 years and younger. Transderm Scōp is not FDA-approved for any use in children but is sometimes prescribed "off-label" to manage excessive drooling in children with cerebral palsy or other neurologic disorders.

Hyperthermia occurred most often within 72 hours after the Transderm Scōp patch was applied to patients' bodies for the first time. The Transderm Scōp patch can affect the body's ability to maintain a stable internal temperature, leading to a rise in core body temperature. It can also reduce sweating, which may cause increases in body temperature. Severe cases may lead to heat-related complications, such as confusion, loss of consciousness, coma, or death. Hyperthermia may be exacerbated when patients are in warm environmental temperatures and when they are using external heat sources, such as a heated blanket. BACKGROUND: Transderm Scōp is a prescription medicine, available as a patch, that FDA approved for adults in 1979 to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness. FDA later also approved it for adults to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with recovery from anesthesia or opioid pain medicines used during surgery.

The Transderm Scōp patch releases a medicine called scopolamine, an anticholinergic agent that blocks signals from a brain substance that causes nausea and vomiting. The Transderm Scōp patch is applied behind the ear and delivers the medicine for up to 3 days. Scopolamine patches are also available as generic products.

### Safely and effectively. see full prescribing information… [^114KCcgw]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1. 5 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is 3-hydroxy-2-phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C₁₇H₂₁NO₄ and its structural formula is: Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303. 35 and a pKa of
7. 55–7.
81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular,

1. 8 cm² film with four layers. Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation.

It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function. An in vitro study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an in vitro study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar.

In 195 adult subjects of different racial origins who participated in clinical efficacy studies at sea or in a controlled motion environment, there was a 75% reduction in the incidence of motion-induced nausea and vomiting. Scopolamine transdermal system was applied from 4 to 16 hours prior to the onset of motion in these studies.
