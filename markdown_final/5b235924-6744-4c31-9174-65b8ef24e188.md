## Question

risk factors, prognosis, clinical features of hepatic artery aneurysm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hepatic artery aneurysm (HAA) risk factors, clinical features, and prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and epidemiology to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify etiologic risk factors, distinguishing true from pseudoaneurysms. Next, I will examine patient-specific and anatomic risk modifiers. After that, I need to review clinical presentation patterns and diagnostic implications. Finally, I will appraise rupture risk, mortality, and prognostic modifiers, and close with guideline-aligned management thresholds that reflect prognosis and risk stratification [^112ufFdZ] [^113qeL63].

> Let me first confirm the definitions and epidemiology so I don't misclassify entities. True HAAs are focal dilations involving all arterial wall layers, whereas pseudoaneurysms are contained ruptures lined by adventitia or perivascular tissue; HAAs are the second most common visceral artery aneurysm after splenic artery aneurysms, typically discovered incidentally in the sixth decade with a male predominance around 3:2, and most are extrahepatic rather than intrahepatic, which matters for collateral perfusion and treatment planning [^116Y6eVN] [^112qkEtt] [^111Bggnd].

> I need to check etiologic risk factors next, and I should separate true from pseudoaneurysm drivers. For true HAAs, atherosclerosis is the most common cause in contemporary series, with other contributors including fibromuscular dysplasia, connective tissue disorders such as Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos, vasculitides like polyarteritis nodosa and Takayasu, and congenital anomalies; for pseudoaneurysms, iatrogenic trauma from hepatobiliary or pancreatic procedures, blunt or penetrating trauma, pancreatitis, and infection are key, and importantly, pseudoaneurysms carry a markedly higher rupture propensity than true aneurysms, which I should keep front-of-mind for triage [^114S7o7i] [^112FKiBh] [^112RqCD2] [^116GjAJc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about rupture risk without considering patient-specific modifiers. Female sex appears to increase rupture risk in some series, and vasculitis is a strong risk amplifier; portal hypertension and cirrhosis elevate rupture risk to roughly 15% in pooled analyses, and pregnancy-related hemodynamic changes increase rupture risk across visceral aneurysms, though the strongest pregnancy signal is with splenic artery aneurysms rather than hepatic; I should confirm that these associations inform lower thresholds for intervention in such patients [^115fNK6C] [^116V89gt] [^11596M1T].

> Next, I should review anatomic and lesion-specific modifiers. Larger size correlates with higher rupture risk, with most ruptures occurring when HAAs exceed 2 cm, and growth exceeding 0.5 cm per year is a recognized trigger for intervention; multiplicity of HAAs and nonatherosclerotic etiologies, particularly inflammatory or infectious, also portend higher rupture risk; location matters because extrahepatic HAAs often have robust collaterals enabling safer proximal occlusion, whereas intrahepatic lesions risk ischemia if parent arteries are sacrificed, influencing the choice between exclusion and revascularization strategies [^112qkEtt] [^111w3RH9] [^1175rW1Z] [^111RPTAo].

> I will now examine clinical features, and I should double-check that I distinguish typical from catastrophic presentations. Most true HAAs are asymptomatic and found incidentally; when symptomatic, right upper quadrant or epigastric pain is common, and obstructive jaundice or a palpable pulsatile mass may occur with larger lesions compressing the biliary tree; however, the classic and most feared presentation is rupture with acute abdominal pain, hemodynamic shock, hemoperitoneum, and gastrointestinal bleeding from hemobilia or retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which mandates emergent intervention [^114S7o7i] [^115dHUMp] [^111ceqgk].

> Wait, let me verify the rupture risk figures so I don't overstate them. Reported rupture rates for true HAAs vary widely from about 14% up to 80% across series, with mortality after rupture commonly exceeding 30% and reaching 40% in some cohorts; pseudoaneurysms behave even more aggressively, with rupture rates up to 70–80% and mortality that can approach 60% in certain contexts, underscoring the need for urgent repair once identified [^112qkEtt] [^114S7o7i] [^116GjAJc] [^113JReXR].

> Let me consider prognosis more broadly, and I should confirm how elective repair alters outcomes. Elective repair carries substantially lower mortality than emergency repair, with contemporary series showing 0% perioperative mortality after elective intervention versus 30–40% mortality after rupture; endovascular-first strategies generally yield lower 30-day morbidity and mortality than open surgery, though reintervention rates may be higher, and careful collateral assessment is essential to mitigate hepatic ischemia risks after parent artery occlusion [^112qkEtt] [^114HPda5] [^111htLNW].

> I should confirm surveillance and growth dynamics to guide expectant management. In a Mayo Clinic series of untreated true HAAs averaging 2.3 cm followed for a mean 68 months, no ruptures occurred and only 27% enlarged, with the greatest recorded growth 0.8 cm over 34 months; this supports selective observation of small, stable lesions with imaging surveillance, while growth beyond 0.5 cm per year should prompt repair consideration [^1175rW1Z] [^111w3RH9].

> Next, I should review guideline-aligned management thresholds that operationalize prognosis and risk. The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends repair of all hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms immediately upon diagnosis, repair of all symptomatic HAAs regardless of size, repair of true HAAs greater than 2 cm in low-risk patients, and repair of HAAs greater than 5 cm in high-risk patients if open repair is planned; vasculopathy, vasculitis, and positive blood cultures warrant repair irrespective of size, and an endovascular-first approach is favored when anatomy allows preservation of hepatic perfusion [^112ufFdZ] [^113hfn5u] [^111w3RH9] [^114HPda5].

> Hold on, I should verify imaging and surveillance recommendations so follow-up is consistent. CTA is the diagnostic modality of choice for detection and characterization, with mesenteric angiography reserved for pre-intervention planning; for small, asymptomatic HAAs under about 3 cm, individualized surveillance with duplex ultrasound or CTA is reasonable, with annual imaging commonly used initially and interval adjustments based on stability and growth; after endovascular repair, periodic imaging is advised to detect recurrence or endoleak [^113qWkEE] [^114E1oPL] [^113qeL63] [^111pLAVA].

> Let me reconsider any potential inconsistencies before concluding. Earlier I implied that most ruptures occur when HAAs exceed 2 cm, which aligns with guideline thresholds, but I should acknowledge that some series show rupture risk can be size-independent in certain subtypes, particularly pseudoaneurysms and those with inflammatory or infectious etiologies; this reinforces the principle that etiology, symptoms, and growth dynamics should weigh at least as heavily as absolute diameter in decision-making [^112qkEtt] [^116GjAJc] [^115hhHT9].

Hepatic artery aneurysm (HAA) is a rare but high-risk visceral aneurysm with a **rupture risk of 14–80%** and a **mortality of 20–40%** if rupture occurs [^112qkEtt] [^114S7o7i]. The most common risk factors are **atherosclerosis**, trauma, iatrogenic injury, and vasculitis; female sex and nonatherosclerotic etiologies further increase rupture risk [^115fNK6C] [^1175rW1Z]. Most HAAs are asymptomatic and found incidentally, but when symptomatic, patients present with right upper quadrant pain, a pulsatile mass, or gastrointestinal bleeding from hemobilia; rupture causes acute abdominal pain, shock, and high mortality [^116Y6eVN] [^115dHUMp]. Prognosis is excellent with elective repair (0% mortality in some series) [^112qkEtt], but poor after rupture; therefore, **repair is recommended for aneurysms > 2 cm**, symptomatic lesions, pseudoaneurysms, or those with rapid growth (> 0.5 cm/year) [^111w3RH9] [^111i5GNL]. Endovascular therapy is preferred when feasible due to lower morbidity, while open surgery is reserved for complex anatomy or failed endovascular therapy [^114HPda5] [^112H1VcK].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors contribute to the development and progression of HAA:

- **Atherosclerosis**: The most common cause of true HAA, accounting for approximately 20% of cases [^115fNK6C].

- **Trauma**: Blunt or penetrating trauma, including iatrogenic injury from hepatobiliary or pancreatic procedures, is a significant risk factor [^112RqCD2].

- **Vasculitis**: Inflammatory conditions such as polyarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Takayasu arteritis are associated with HAA formation [^112FKiBh].

- **Connective tissue disorders**: Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and fibromuscular dysplasia increase the risk of HAA [^112FKiBh].

- **Infection**: Mycotic aneurysms, though rare, can occur due to bacterial or fungal infections [^113Wbw8U].

- **Female sex**: Females have a higher rupture risk compared to males [^115fNK6C].

---

## Clinical features

HAAs are often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during imaging for unrelated reasons. When symptomatic, they may present with the following:

- **Abdominal pain**: Typically located in the right upper quadrant, often dull or aching in nature [^111htLNW].

- **Pulsatile mass**: A palpable pulsatile mass may be felt in the upper abdomen [^notfound].

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Hemobilia (bleeding into the biliary tree) can cause upper gastrointestinal bleeding, presenting as melena or hematemesis [^111ceqgk].

- **Rupture**: Acute severe abdominal pain, hypotension, and shock due to intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage [^116V89gt].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis of HAA is primarily determined by the risk of rupture, which is associated with high mortality:

- **Rupture risk**: Ranges from 14% to 80%, with most series reporting a significant risk of rupture, particularly in aneurysms larger than 2 cm [^112qkEtt].

- **Mortality**: Rupture-related mortality is approximately 20% to 40%, emphasizing the need for timely intervention [^114S7o7i].

- **Elective repair**: Elective repair carries a favorable prognosis, with some series reporting 0% mortality [^112qkEtt].

- **Factors influencing prognosis**: Aneurysm size, growth rate, etiology (nonatherosclerotic), and patient comorbidities significantly influence prognosis [^1175rW1Z].

---

## Management and outcomes

Management strategies depend on aneurysm size, growth rate, symptoms, and patient comorbidities:

- **Observation**: Small, stable, asymptomatic aneurysms (< 2 cm) may be observed with regular imaging surveillance [^111i5GNL] [^115tYCvy].

- **Endovascular repair**: Preferred first-line treatment for most HAAs due to lower morbidity and mortality compared to open surgery [^114HPda5] [^112qkEtt].

- **Open surgical repair**: Reserved for complex anatomy, failed endovascular therapy, or when arterial reconstruction is required [^1176U1Hu] [^116uW9zR].

- **Outcomes**: Elective endovascular repair has excellent outcomes with low morbidity and mortality, while ruptured HAAs carry high mortality despite intervention [^112qkEtt].

Hepatic artery aneurysm is a rare vascular anomaly with significant rupture risk and mortality. Early diagnosis and appropriate intervention, particularly endovascular repair, **significantly improve prognosis** [^112H1VcK].

Objectives

To identify independent risk factors for visceral artery aneurysms.

Methods

Retrospective medical record review over 10 years.

Results

There were 26 men and 15 women, median age of 54 (range 22 to 85), and median follow-up was 20.6 months (range 0 to 94 months). There were 11 splenic, 17 hepatic, 8 gastroduodenal, 6 pancreatoduodenal, 5 superior mesenteric, and two inferior mesenteric artery aneurysms. Thirteen patients (13/41, 31.7%) were treated surgically without adjuvant endovascular intervention. Nineteen patients (19/41, 46.3%) were treated exclusively using endovascular procedures. Five patients (5/41, 12.2%) received second endovascular or surgical treatment as salvage procedure after the first procedure failed. Concomitant malignancy was positive predictors for in-hospital death. Renal failure, chronic lung disease, liver cirrhosis, previous abdominal surgery and concomitant malignancy were positive predictors of 2-year mortality. With the intention to treat in the whole cohort, less than 10% (2/21) of the endovascular treatments failed, compared to 18.5% (3/16) in the surgical group. Patients treated by surgery without aid of endovascular intervention, have lower 2-year mortality. In hospital-death rate was 9.8%, while overall mortality rate was 21.9%.

Conclusions

The endovascular intervention provides compatible, even better early postoperative outcomes for visceral artery aneurysms to surgery. Concomitant malignancy was the major determinant of visceral artery aneurysms, both in-hospital death and survival.

### Hepatic artery aneurysm: factors that predict complications [^1175rW1Z]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

We reviewed the Mayo Clinic experience with management and outcome of hepatic artery aneurysms (HAA).

Methods

Retrospective review of charts for 306 patients with true visceral aneurysm diagnosed from 1980 to 1998 enabled identification of 36 patients (12%) with HAA.

Results

Patients with HAA included 23 men and 13 women, with mean age of 62.2 years (range, 20–85 years). Most aneurysms were extrahepatic (78%) and single (92%). Mean aneurysm diameter at presentation was 3.6 cm (range, 1.5–14 cm). Five aneurysms had ruptured (14%), and four were symptomatic (11%). Mortality from rupture was 40%. Of the 9 patients with ruptured or symptomatic aneurysms, 2 patients had multiple HAA, 3 patients had fibromuscular dysplasia, and 2 patients had polyarteritis nodosa. All five HAAs that ruptured were of nonatherosclerotic origin (P = .001). Fourteen patients (39%) underwent elective procedures, including excision with vein graft (n = 7), excision with dacron graft (n = 3), excision alone (n = 2), and percutaneous embolization (n = 2). Two vein grafts and one dacron graft became occluded within 1 year. Nonoperative management was elected in 22 patients (61%) with mean aneurysm diameter 2.3 cm (range, 1.5–5 cm). No complications related to the aneurysm occurred during mean follow-up of 68.4 months (range, 1–372 months). Aneurysm growth was identified in 27%, the greatest being 0.8 cm over 34 months.

Conclusions

HAA are at definite risk for rupture (14%). Risk factors for rupture include multiple HAA and nonatherosclerotic origin. Patients with symptomatic aneurysms or any of these risk factors should be considered for intervention.

### Vascular liver disorders, portal vein thrombosis, and procedural bleeding in patients with liver disease: 2020 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114S7o7i]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Hepatic artery aneurysms — epidemiology, imaging, and management: Most HAAs are true arterial aneurysms. The primary causes are atherosclerosis, mediointimal degeneration, trauma, and, less commonly, infection. Most true HAAs are asymptomatic and found incidentally on cross-sectional imaging obtained for other reasons. The reported incidence of rupture in patients with true HAAs is up to 25%, and the mortality rate from rupture of an HAA is > 30%. Doppler ultrasound studies and CT readily demonstrate HAAs, and multidetector CT arteriography is the optimal tool for defining these lesions, assessing the collateral circulation, and planning treatment. In a retrospective review of 22 patients with a mean HAA diameter of 2.3 cm (range, 1.5–5.0) who were followed up and untreated for a mean of 68.4 months (range, 1–372), no complications were identified. Patients treated using endovascular approaches appear to have less morbidity and mortality; however, the actual benefit-to-risk ratio of treating aneurysms deemed to be at higher risk of rupture has not been evaluated, and there are no data on which to base recommendations for surveillance of HAAs in the setting of expectant management.

Hepatic artery aneurysm (HAA) — diagnostic imaging, indications for repair, and preferred techniques are detailed as follows: In patients thought to have HAA we recommend computed tomography angiography (CTA) as the diagnostic tool of choice, and for those considered for intervention we recommend mesenteric angiography for preoperative planning; given rupture risk and mortality, we recommend that all hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms be repaired as soon as the diagnosis is made, and we recommend repair of all symptomatic HAAs regardless of size; in asymptomatic patients without significant comorbidity, we recommend repair if true HAA is > 2 cm or if aneurysm enlarges > 0.5 cm/y, and in patients with significant comorbidities we recommend repair if HAA is > 5.0 cm; we recommend repair for vasculopathy or vasculitis regardless of size and in patients with positive blood cultures; we recommend an endovascular-first approach to all HAAs if anatomically feasible to maintain arterial circulation to the liver, use open and endovascular techniques to maintain liver circulation for extrahepatic aneurysms, and coil embolization for intrahepatic aneurysms, with resection of the involved lobe of liver for large intrahepatic aneurysms to avoid significant liver necrosis; we suggest abdominal axial imaging to screen for concomitant intra-abdominal aneurysms in patients who did not have CTA at the time of HAA diagnosis.

### Assessment of open surgical and endovascular management of true hepatic artery aneurysms over 20 years highlights increased rupture risk in females [^115fNK6C]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

True hepatic artery aneurysms (HAAs) are rare but have been associated with a significant risk of rupture and associated mortality. The 2020 release of HAA-specific clinical practice guidelines represented an important step toward management standardization. However, it remains essential to build on the body of evidence to further refine these recommendations.

Methods

The HAA management and outcomes from a single academic center during a 20-year period were retrospectively reviewed. We identified 72 patients from the institutional radiology database (November 24, 1999 to 2019). Pseudoaneurysms were excluded, and 48 patients were found to have had true HAAs. Forty-three HAA patients had sufficient medical records for inclusion in the analysis.

Results

Of the 43 patients with HAA included, 65% were male. The mean age was 63 years (range, 22–89 years). Of the HAAs, 72% presented asymptomatically, 16% had ruptured, and 12% were symptomatic at presentation. Most HAAs were of atherosclerotic origin (74%). In addition, 16% of the patients had other visceral aneurysms and 12% had nonvisceral aneurysms on presentation. The mean HAA size overall was 3.3 cm (range, 0.8–10.8 cm), with most being solitary (72%) and involving the common hepatic artery (65%). Rupture was more common in females (40%) and those with vasculitis (67%), with females representing 86% of all patients with rupture. The mean size at intervention was 4.8 cm (21 patients [49%]). Ten patients (23%) had undergone open surgical repair (seven elective and three emergent because of rupture). Eleven patients (26%) had undergone endovascular intervention (64% elective and 36% emergent). Nonoperative management was selected for 22 patients (51%). These patients had a mean HAA diameter of 2.1 cm, and 59% had a life-limiting illness. Of the 18 patients who had been initially monitored for a mean of 3.9 ± 4.1 years, 3 had undergone elective repair and 2 had minimal growth. None of these patients had a subsequently documented rupture.

Conclusions

True HAAs are a rare but important clinical phenomenon, with 16% of patients presenting with rupture in this study. Endovascular intervention is a promising alternative to open surgical repair, with no 30-day mortality, and is suitable for ruptured HAAs. Importantly, for the first time, our findings have demonstrated an increased risk of rupture for females, highlighting the need for additional data and ultimately, sex-specific guidelines.

Splenic and hepatic artery aneurysm natural history and management thresholds — rupture risk for aneurysms larger than 2 or 3 cm is likely < 5% after a mean observation duration of 70 months; in patients with portal hypertension with or without cirrhosis, rupture risk is ~15%; there is no consensus on an asymptomatic true SAA size threshold, although traditional surgical teaching has historically recommended intervention at 2 cm in size, and some authors in adult living donor LT recipients have proposed reserving interventions for SAAs > 30 mm or for enlarging lesions under close angiographic follow-up; pooled analysis comparing surgical versus endovascular repair found a higher proportion treated for ruptured aneurysm in the surgical group (18.4% vs. 8.8%; P < 0.001), higher 30-day mortality (5.1% vs. 0.6%; P < 0.001), but lower repeat intervention (0.5% vs. 3.2%) in the surgical group.

Vascular diseases of the liver include portal vein thrombosis (with or without cirrhosis), portosinusoidal vascular disorder, Budd-Chiari syndrome, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, non-obstructive sinusoidal dilatation and peliosis, splanchnic artery aneurysms, and hepatic arteriovenous fistulas. Except for portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis, these are all rare conditions. Since the last Clinical Practice Guidelines were issued by the European Association for the Study of the Liver in 2016, much data has been published on the diagnosis and management - medical and interventional - of patients with vascular liver diseases. Based on a thorough review of the relevant literature, recommendations are provided to address key clinical dilemmas. The document emphasises personalised care, considering individual risk factors and clinical presentation. Multidisciplinary management involving hepatologists, haematologists, pathologists, interventional radiologists and surgeons is essential in this area. Our aim is to provide guidance on the management of patients with vascular liver diseases based on the best available evidence.

### Hepatic artery aneurysm: a rare case of obstructive jaundice with severe hemobilia [^111ceqgk]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Computed tomography angiogram demonstrating common hepatic artery aneurysm

On the second day of admission, she developed high-grade fever with chills and rigors with neutrophilic leukocytosis. A side viewing endoscopy was performed which revealed blood spurting from the ampulla of Vater with multiple blood clots. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram with biliary stenting was deferred in view of active hemobilia and the patient was planned for immediate surgical repair. On the same day she developed massive hematemesis and succumbed to the illness.

Notwithstanding the rarity, HAA is reported to be the second commonest visceral artery aneurysm second to splenic artery aneurysm. In the past, mycotic aneurysms accounted for most HAAs but atherosclerosis has emerged as the most common cause in the present era. Less frequent causes are polyarteritis nodosa, tuberculosis, Marfan syndrome and diagnostic instrumentation.

No definite risk factors have been established which predict the tendency for HAA rupture, but non-atherosclerotic origin and multiple lesions have been cited as potential risk factors. Once HAA ruptures, the patient manifests hemobilia, which may range from mild to severe. The therapeutic options available include coil embolization of the aneurysm, stenting across the main trunk and embolization of the common hepatic artery or open surgical repair with reconstruction.

In conclusion, HAAs are an extremely rare cause of obstructive jaundice and hemobilia. Symptomatic HAAs are associated with a poor prognosis if the diagnosis is delayed. We also believe that HAAs which present with an index bleed, as in our case, warrants urgent management strategies, as they rupture in no time, resulting in fatal hemobilia.

Splenic artery aneurysms — features and risks: A majority of SAAs are true aneurysms of a mean size of ~3 cm upon diagnosis, and most SAAs are asymptomatic and found incidentally. A majority of patients are in their sixth or seventh decade of life at the time of diagnosis, and associations with pregnancy, portal hypertension, or pancreatitis have been frequently reported. Patients may present with penetration into the stomach with gastrointestinal bleeding or rupture into the peritoneal cavity with abdominal pain and shock. Incidence of rupture in patients with SAAs is ~3%, and mortality related to rupture is 20%-36%. The risk of rupture of true aneurysms appears to be negligible, below a size of 2 cm, which is the size of the majority of SAAs upon detection. Commonly reported causes include arteriosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia, and pseudoaneurysms of the SA are mostly related to pancreatitis, infection, and trauma.

### Visceral artery aneurysms: incidence, management, and outcome analysis in a tertiary care center over one decade [^116xB47i]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Visceral arterial aneurysms (VAAs) are a rare entity; they are often asymptomatic, incidental findings in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). VAAs can present as life-threatening ruptures that require emergency treatment. However, discriminating between VAAs that are harmless incidental CT findings which do not require treatment and high-risk aneurysms is not always possible. Several publications recommend treatment of VAAs > 2 cm in diameter. Nonetheless, clinical experience indicates that the risk of rupture depends not only on the aneurysm diameter, but also upon VAA localization; underlying disease, such as congenital defects (e.g. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome), atherosclerosis, and mycotic/inflammatory aneurysm; and the rate of growth. In contrast to true aneurysms, which feature distension of all three layers of the arterial wall, so-called false aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms result from a breach of the inner-wall layers, resulting in bulging of the adventitial layer. False aneurysms are often caused by iatrogenic trauma, e.g. after hepatobiliary or vascular surgery.

This retrospective study reviewed all cases of VAA seen at our university medical centre over a 10-year period. Our objective was to characterize the incidence of VAA, identify possible risk factors for aneurysm rupture, and compare surgical and interventional–radiological approaches with respect to clinical outcome.

### Operative management of hepatic artery aneurysms [^111htLNW]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Degenerative hepatic artery aneurysms (HAAs) are an uncommon pathologic process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the approach to and outcomes of operative management of HAA with open techniques (OTs) and endovascular techniques (ETs).

Methods

Twenty-one patients who underwent intervention for HAA from January 1, 1992, to January 30, 2015, at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patient presentation, risk factors, and operative approach were reviewed. The primary outcome was operative morbidity and mortality. Secondary outcomes included long-term survival, patency, and need for reintervention.

Results

Of the 21 patients, 14 (67%) were men. The mean age of all patients was 66 years (range, 30–85 years), with a mean HAA size of 45 ± 28 mm (12 common hepatic, 5 common and proper hepatic, 3 right hepatic, and 1 accessory left hepatic). Nine patients (43%) had connective tissue disorders. More than half of the patients (63%) had synchronous aneurysms (29% in the aorta, 24% in the splenic and iliac arteries, and 10% in the celiac arteries). Ten patients (48%) were asymptomatic. Right upper quadrant pain was the most common symptom at presentation (43%), followed by transaminitis (5%) and obstructive jaundice (5%). Five patients (24%) presented with rupture (size, 15–40 mm). OT was performed in 17 patients; 4 patients had ET. Fourteen patients (67%) underwent open reconstruction of the common hepatic (n = 10), the common and proper hepatic (n = 2), and the right and left accessory hepatic arteries (n = 1 each). Seven bypasses were performed with saphenous vein, six with Dacron, and one with polytetrafluoroethylene. Endoaneurysmorrhaphy alone, patch, and ligation were performed in one instance each. Postoperative complications occurred in six patients (29%), including hemorrhage, graft thrombosis, common bile duct stricture that required reoperation, duodenal perforation, and enterocutaneous fistula. ET was attempted in five patients; coil embolization was performed in four patients (two of the common and two of the right hepatic arteries). Overall mortality was 14% (6% after elective OT, 40% for emergency OT, 0% for ET). Mean follow-up was 32 ± 46 months. Overall survival was 86% at 5 years. Primary and secondary graft patency was 86% at 5 years. One patient underwent reintervention because of occlusion of saphenous vein graft.

Conclusions

Open repair remains the mainstay treatment for degenerative HAA repairs to preserve arterial flow to the liver, with notable morbidity and mortality, particularly in the setting of rupture. However, coil embolization may be applied safely in select patients with aneurysms not involving the proper hepatic artery if adequate collateral circulation ensures hepatic perfusion.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines on the management of visceral aneurysms [^1176U1Hu]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Hepatic artery aneurysm — operative approach considerations: Open surgical revascularization using autologous vein conduit is recommended if endovascular stent graft exclusion is not possible. Endovascular repair of extrahepatic HAA depends on the collaterals and location of the HAA, and in patients with proper hepatic artery, endovascular repair requires covered stent exclusion of the aneurysm rather than coil embolization. Intrahepatic aneurysms will require resection of the lobe in which the aneurysm is located; endovascular interventions have become the primary treatment modality for these intrahepatic lesions when feasible, but complications of embolization include hepatic ischemia, abscess, cholecystitis, and possible recanalization. Coil embolization is discouraged in patients with large parenchymal lesions or if large segments of liver are at risk of ischemia, and in these patients, liver lobe resection should be considered.

Hepatic artery aneurysms are a rare phenomenon but their diagnosis and prompt treatment are imperative due to a high risk of mortality and complications. Appropriate management depends on patient characteristics, anatomical location of the aneurysm, operative risk and collateral arterial supply. Management options include surgical and endovascular approaches. The endovascular approach has gained popularity over recent years as it is an effective and less invasive alternative to surgical management. In this case report, we present a giant common hepatic artery aneurysm and its successful endovascular management. The patient had a complete resolution of symptoms after the procedure and remained well 8months postprocedure.

### Treatment of six hepatic artery aneurysms [^1153y6AZ]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Hepatic artery aneurysms are rare lesions but of significant clinical importance because rupture is associated with elevated mortality. Although diagnosis using CT scanning and, more importantly, angiography has been well defined, the therapeutic choices are less clear. We retrospectively selected patients from 1985 to 2000 who were treated with either traditional surgical or percutaneous techniques. In total we treated six patients, four males and two females. This represents 17.6% of 34 patients treated by us for splanchnic artery aneurysms. The treatment was surgical in two cases (33.3%) and percutaneous in four cases (66.6%). All lesions were successfully treated with exclusion/ablation of the aneurysm. Mortality was nil; in one of the surgical cases we reported a transient hepatic failure and in the endovascular group, one right pleural effusion, one small splenic infarction, and one pseudoaneurysm of the gastroduodenal artery. The first therapeutic strategy to be taken into consideration is always the percutaneous approach. However, surgery still has a role in those cases where the lesion cannot be repaired percutaneously. Based on our own experience (good results, no mortality, and few complications) and in accordance with the literature, it is clear that an aggressive approach is warranted in those patients.

### Aneurysmectomy and revascularization of a large hepatic artery aneurysm [^112YKiK1]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Aneurysms of the hepatic artery are rare, but are associated with significant mortality because of their lack of symptoms at presentation and risk of rupture. We report a case of an enlarging 4-cm hepatic artery aneurysm involving the proximal common hepatic artery to the bifurcation of the right and left hepatic arteries which was found incidentally on ultrasound examination. Endovascular treatment with a stent was considered, but because of the location of the aneurysm as well as the presence of significant thrombosis involving the right and left hepatic arteries, aneurysmectomy and revascularization using saphenous vein was performed. Doppler ultrasound measurements demonstrated good flow through the graft postoperatively and at 1-month follow-up. Although a variety of endovascular techniques exist to treat hepatic artery aneurysms, our results indicate that open excision and revascularization may be required and can have a good outcome.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^116V89gt]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Natural History and Risk of Rupture

The incidence of VAAs can be as high as 10% at autopsy, as most are asymptomatic. Due to the widespread use of cross-sectional imaging techniques in medicine, especially computed tomography (CT), increasing numbers are being detected.

Approximately 25% of VAAs reported in the literature present with rupture and a high mortality rate (Table 2). This is almost certainly an over-estimate in terms of their typical presentation; however, the natural history of visceral aneurysms and their risk of rupture remain poorly defined due to the rarity of the pathology and it is difficult to analyse which factors may predispose to rupture.

The main predisposing causes or risk factors of VAAs are listed in Table 2. Most VAAs are slow-growing or remain stable once developed; however, pregnancy does increase the risk of rupture due to underlying hormonal changes.

The common causes of VAPA include iatrogenic injury, pancreatitis, trauma, and vasculitis. The risk of rupture of VAPAs is higher than that of true aneurysms due to the lack of the three layers of the artery wall.

Clinical Presentation

Clinical symptoms are quite rare in both VAAs and VAPAs. Abdominal pain is the most common clinical presentation and may become severe at the time of rupture, when classic symptoms of acute bleeding such as haemodynamic instability and hypovolemic shock may also occur. VAAs and VAPAs can rupture into the peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneal space, gastrointestinal tract, or biliary tract. If a hepatic artery aneurysm ruptures into the biliary tree, it may present with upper GI bleeding. A splenic or pancreatic artery aneurysm may rupture into the pancreatic duct (haemosuccus pancreaticus), also presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding.

Large VAAs (over 5 cm in diameter) may present with compression symptoms, in particular abdominal discomfort and pain, lumbar pain, jaundice, or even intermittent upper gastrointestinal bleeding. VAPAs will mostly have a relevant history of the precipitating underlying pathology such as pancreatitis, infective symptomatology or trauma including iatrogenic injuries. VAAs and VAPAs are almost never palpable on clinical examination.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines on the management of visceral aneurysms [^112FKiBh]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Hepatic artery aneurysm (HAA) imaging and follow-up — modalities, scope, and associated conditions: Given the sensitivity and specificity of computed tomography angiography (CTA) for diagnosis of other intra-abdominal aneurysms, we recommend CTA to diagnose other intra-abdominal aneurysms; axial CTA or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may detect thoracic aortic or intracerebral aneurysms. In thin patients, abdominal duplex ultrasound is sensitive and specific in detecting abdominal or iliac artery aneurysms, but this study needs to be performed on individual arteries and therefore may miss other noninvestigated vessels. Given that these are slow-growing aneurysms, annual follow-up is adequate; CTA with or without contrast enhancement provides the best modality to observe these aneurysms, and abdominal duplex ultrasound can also be used in certain patients. There is an association between HAA and fibromuscular dysplasia, vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus or polyarteritis nodosa, Takayasu arteritis, and Wegener granulomatosis, and congenital causes of HAA such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome are reported.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines on the management of visceral aneurysms [^114ST36d]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Visceral artery aneurysms — natural history, rupture risk, and general management: Splenic artery aneurysms are thought to have a particular tendency toward rupture, especially during the third trimester of pregnancy, and visceral artery pseudoaneurysms certainly have a higher rupture potential than true aneurysms. There is no firm evidence that calcification in a visceral artery aneurysm protects against a risk of rupture, and when rupture occurs it can involve the peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneal space, gastrointestinal tract, or biliary tract, with free rupture into the peritoneal cavity resulting in hemoperitoneum often termed abdominal apoplexy and it may also be manifested with life-threatening gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Although not directed by randomized prospective trials, general principles of management of visceral artery aneurysms do exist; because of their potential for rupture, most visceral artery pseudoaneurysms, mycotic aneurysms, and many larger true aneurysms warrant intervention, and treatment can generally be accomplished by either open surgical or endovascular approaches. The treatment goal is to prevent aneurysm expansion and potential rupture by exclusion from the arterial circulation while maintaining necessary distal or collateral bed perfusion; in areas of the visceral circulation with an abundance of collateral flow, for example, in the splenic artery, proximal and distal ligation of the aneurysm segment is a viable surgical option, and endovascular isolation can be achieved either by placement of a stent graft or by coil embolization of the proximal and distal arterial segment. The preferred treatment of an individual patient and aneurysm must be carefully based on the particular anatomy and any associated clinical conditions as well as the underlying condition of the patient, and the purpose of these guidelines is to inform the diagnosis, treatment options, screening, and follow-up of visceral aneurysms based on the available published literature and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Hepatic artery aneurysm (HAA) is a rare form of visceral artery aneurysm. Historically, most HAAs were ruptured at presentation, but advances in imaging have led to an increase in the diagnosis of asymptomatic HAAs. Description of the natural history of patent HAAs has been difficult because of their rarity, even more so for less common thrombosed HAAs. We report the case of a 74-year-old man who experienced the rupture of a previously thrombosed HAA. He was successfully surgically treated with ligation of the aneurysm. Our case provides insight into the progression and management of thrombosed HAAs.

### A case of Candida parapsilosis endocarditis complicated by right hepatic artery aneurysm, rupture and hemorrhage of brain abscess: case report and literature review [^112ameAH]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This patient was admitted with infective endocarditis, and based on the patient's medical history, MRI findings, and pathological data, the clinical diagnosis was Candida parapsilosis infection. During subsequent treatment, the patient developed multi-system lesions. However, after receiving appropriate treatment, expect for the seizure of epilepsy the patient recovered well, and follow-up revealed no other significant sequelae. It is exceedingly rare for Candida parapsilosis infective endocarditis to be accompanied by systemic fungal infections, resulting in tissue abscess formation and involvement of arterial walls leading to hemorrhage, particularly in patients with normal immune function. What we present here is the overall treatment process of complications associated with infectious endocarditis caused by rare fungi, along with images of the lesions in various organs.

The time when the inflammation of the right hepatic artery was discovered was October 31, 2021 (Fig. 5), the time when the right hepatic artery aneurysm was formed was December 10, 2021 (Fig. 5). We believe that the cause of this pseudoaneurysm is the secondary embolization of the emboli of endocarditis and the direct infection of the arterial wall by circulating pathogens. Risk factors for arterial infection include arterial injury and endothelial dysfunction. Some relevant literature has also pointed out, HAAs in IE (HAAs-IE) are the result of a microbial infiltration that including degradation. Pathogens may settle in any pre-existing lesions and expand the erea of injury. Common sites of arterial infection include the abdominal and thoracic aorta and their branches, the femoral artery, and intracranial arteries, with infections of the hepatic artery and subclavian artery being relatively rare. As a consequence, little is known about their prevalence, clinical and radiological characteristics, natural history, treatment, and outcome. Therefore, in this article, I have presented the evolution process of hepatic pseudoaneurysms, which is of certain value.

### Role of imaging in visceral vascular emergencies [^112GWXYQ]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatic artery aneurysm and pseudoaneurysms

True hepatic artery aneurysms (HAA) are rare and account for 20% of all visceral artery aneurysms. The etiology is mostly due to degenerative and dysplastic processes with atherosclerosis being the most commonly encountered factor. The risk of rupture is highly variable, ranging from 20 to 80%. Both HAAs and pseudo-HAAs follow the contrast enhancement pattern of the originating artery. Both arterial and portal venous phase images should be acquired as some pseudoaneurysms with a narrow neck may enhance only in the venous phase and may be easily missed on the arterial phase images.

Pseudo-HAAs usually occur due to iatrogenic reasons (biopsy, biliary interventions, liver transplant, biliary interventions, etc.) or trauma and they also have a high risk for rupture and severe bleeding (Fig. 9). Rheumatologic diseases may also rarely cause hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms (Fig. 10). Pseudo-HAAs are usually seen as enhancing intrahepatic masses. However, they may also be detected extrahepatically when they originate from the common or proper hepatic arteries. Pseudoaneurysms have a very fragile wall which may be prone to rupture. Their contours are mostly irregular and they typically have a saccular shape. Hematomas surrounding the pseudoaneurysms are frequently observed at the time of diagnosis. As imaging findings may be extremely subtle or nonexistent in the acute phase, follow-up imaging may be necessary in patients where clinical suspicion is high for HA pseudoaneurysm.

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^112uAf6J]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Mesenteric artery aneurysms — Management thresholds and follow-up are outlined as follows: Intervention is considered for aneurysms greater than 2–2.5 cm in diameter even if asymptomatic; for aneurysms smaller than 2–2.5 cm, follow-up imaging is recommended initially in 6 months, then at 1 year and subsequently every 1–2 years. In true asymptomatic mesenteric aneurysms, intervention irrespective of diameter may be considered for aneurysms of the pancreatoduodenal and gastroduodenal arcade; intra-parenchymal hepatic artery branches; in women of childbearing age; and liver transplant recipients. Coil embolization may be considered for aneurysms not involving proper hepatic artery, and in general, a minimally invasive approach to management is preferred. After endovascular repair, follow-up CTA imaging is considered at 3-yearly intervals, and no follow-up imaging is recommended for pseudoaneurysms treated by embolization.

### Iatrogenic hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms: an uncommon complication after hepatic, biliary, and pancreatic procedures [^112RqCD2]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms are uncommon but potentially lethal complications of hepatic, biliary, and pancreatic interventions. To enhance our knowledge about these pseudoaneurysms, we reviewed our institution's experience with the management of these lesions. We reviewed the literature on 136 cases of hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms as well as our experience with 17 patients (excluding patients who were post-transplantation or had suffered abdominal trauma). The causes, pathogenesis, and clinical features were analyzed. Ten women and seven men developed hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms after undergoing hepatic (65%), biliary (30%), or pancreatic procedures (5%). The mean time between initial intervention and diagnosis was 5.7 months (range 7 days-38 months). Rupture occurred in 13 patients (76%). Mean pseudoaneurysm size was 1.9 cm (range 0.7–4 cm). Embolization was successful in 12 of 14 patients (86%). Four patients (24%), including the two who failed embolization, required operative intervention. Postoperative mortality was 25% while postembolization mortality was 14%. One patient was observed, and the aneurysm thrombosed at 72 months follow-up. Mean follow-up was 48 months (range 1–184 months) for 13 of the 14 survivors (93%) (1 patient was lost to follow-up) without any clinical sequela. Hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms are rare. Rupture is common and occurred in 76% of patients. For both ruptured and nonruptured cases angiography with embolization of the pseudoaneurysm is safe and effective. Operative intervention should be reserved for patients for whom embolization fails or for whom it is not feasible.

### Hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms: a single-center experience [^116qXEyQ]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The management of hepatic artery aneurysms has evolved largely because of changes in etiology and presentation, and advances in endovascular therapy. Although many case reports have been published on the condition, few have been from developing countries and few have compared patient outcomes after angioembolization and surgery.

Patients and Methods

This study retrospectively analyzed patients admitted with hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms between 1999 and 2011. The patients were divided into those who presented before 2007 (surgery group) and after 2007 (embolization group), and their demographic characteristics, presentation, and investigations; the technical and clinical success of treatment; and in-hospital mortality were studied.

Results

A total of 29 patients were studied, 17 of whom men, with a median age of 42 years. Of these 29 patients, 8 underwent surgery and 21 had embolization (24 total procedures). No mortality was seen in the surgery group, and their hospital stay was longer and transfusion requirement higher than those in the embolization group, in whom technical success was achieved in all procedures and clinical success in 19 of 24 (79%). Clinical failure and complications were seen when common hepatic artery aneurysms were embolized. Three patients (14%) died in the embolization group from ischemic hepatitis and bowel gangrene, coagulopathy, and a leak from a previous pancreaticojejunal anastomosis.

Conclusions

Both surgery and angioembolization are equally effective for hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms, but the latter has the advantages of more rapid bleeding control, shorter hospital stay, and lower transfusion requirement.

### Hepatic predominant presentation of Kawasaki disease in adolescence case report and review of literature [^11299sGi]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Kawasaki Disease (KD) is the most common paediatric vasculitis affecting small to medium arteries. Previously referred to as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, the majority of morbidity and mortality in KD stems from cardiac involvement with the development of coronary artery aneurysms and arrhythmias.

The presentation is typically heralded by a prodromal phase with non-specific viral-like respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Classic findings that form the diagnosis of complete KD as defined by Tomisaku Kawasaki in 1967 are listed in Table 1. The disease affects between 12 to 215 per 100,000 children under 5 years of age. The median age of the disease at diagnosis is 3.4 years and these patients are most likely to present with classical symptoms. Older children and adolescents between 5 and 18 years represent 23% of cases and frequently present with fewer classic features and are less likely to suffer from meningitis, thrombocytosis, and coronary artery aneurysms. They are however more likely to develop hepatitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, and arthralgia. Atypical presentation and reduced awareness of non-paediatric disease mean these patients are more likely to experience diagnostic delay. Consequently 30% of KD patients over the age of 10 years are diagnosed ten days after symptom onset compared to 19% for children under 10 years of age.

Table 1
Classical clinical features of kawasaki's disease

KD is typically a self-limiting monophasic disease with prognosis linked to diagnostic timing and subsequent expedient administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), within 10 days of symptom onset, shortening the duration of inflammation and preventing organ dysfunction. Treatment resistance has been identified in older demographics with multiple doses of IVIG required to maintain remission. Coupled with the risk of diagnostic delay, these patients subsequently have a worse prognosis.

Celiac artery aneurysm (CAA) — treatment selection and follow-up: We recommend emergent intervention for ruptured CAAs. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High). We recommend treatment of nonruptured celiac artery pseudoaneurysms of any size in patients of acceptable operative risk because of the possibility of rupture. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). We recommend treatment of nonruptured celiac artery true aneurysms > 2 cm, with a demonstrable increase in size, or with associated symptoms in patients of acceptable risk because of the risk of rupture. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: C (Low). We suggest observation over intervention for small (< 2 cm), stable asymptomatic CAAs or those in patients with significant medical comorbidities or limited life expectancy. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low). In patients with ruptured CAA discovered at laparotomy, we suggest ligation if sufficient collateral circulation to the liver can be documented. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low). In patients with ruptured CAA diagnosed on preoperative imaging studies who are stable, we recommend treatment with open surgical or appropriate endovascular methods based on the patient's anatomy and underlying clinical condition. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). For the elective treatment of CAA, we suggest using an endovascular intervention if it is anatomically feasible; however, elective treatment may appropriately involve open surgical, endovascular, or laparoscopic methods of intervention, depending on the patient's anatomy and underlying clinical condition. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). To determine the need for revascularization of the celiac artery and its branches in treating CAA, we suggest evaluating the status of the superior mesenteric artery, gastroduodenal artery, and other relevant collateral circulation, which must be carefully documented on preoperative CTA or angiography. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). We suggest screening patients with CAAs for other arterial aneurysms. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). In patients in whom a CAA is being observed with a nonoperative or noninterventional approach, we suggest annual surveillance with CTA scans to assess for growth.

### Stent graft placement by pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic arteries: efficacy and patency rate in follow-up [^113aEbUA]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Risk of rebleeding can represent a contraindication for dual antiplatelet therapy after major hepatobiliary surgery in patients with active bleeding. In our cohort, one patient presented with significant abdominal rebleeding which could be possibly related to the anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy. The causes of death in the other patients were not related to the antiplatelet therapy and bleeding of pseudoaneurysms was part of the process which led to multiorgan failure and contributed to the relevant 30-day mortality. Consequently, dual antiplatelet therapy must be evaluated in consideration of the clinical conditions of patients.

Stent occlusion was mainly asymptomatic and characterized by sufficient collateralization in most patient (86%). High degrees of collateralization were reported previously by Hur et al. with maintenance of hepatic arterial flow in 10/13 patients after coiling of the hepatic artery. These results may justify coiling in case of tortuous or small vessels. In our cohort, stent deployment was possible in 23/25 patients as the pseudoaneurysm was located proximal to the hepatic bifurcation. In consideration of possible ischemia after coiling, a stent grafting of the proximal hepatic artery should always be attempted first before resorting to coiling.

Limitations of this study are represented by its retrospective and monocentric design, which, together with the low incidence of this complication, limits the collection of a larger and more varied patient population. Another limitation is the absence of standardized follow-up CT studies which were not available 9/25 patients due to variable referral practice; however, current evidence does not suggest performing CT imaging in asymptomatic patients; moreover, the inherently poor prognosis of these patients hampers the collection of substantially larger patient sizes at mid- and long-term.

In conclusion, stent graft placement was confirmed to be an effective treatment for hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm, especially in acute bleeding. Patency rates were high in the short term yet decreased substantially as a function of time. If present, stent occlusion was mainly asymptomatic due to the development of collateral vessels which provided sufficient hepatic blood supply.

### Percutaneous transhepatic coil embolisation of a common hepatic artery aneurysm in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^115Q4wvq]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

vEDS has a complex disease pathogenesis which requires close surveillance and supportive management.
Embolisation techniques like vascular coiling are effective radiological interventions to manage vascular emergencies.
An integrative, multidisciplinary approach is important to manage challenging pathologies, and cooperation in specialised input leads to improved patient outcomes.
Due to the complex pathology of vEDS, critical signs can be overlooked by seasoned radiologists if they are not specifically searched for.
Direct transhepatic puncture of the HA aneurysm, while successful in this instance, is operator dependent, carries significant risks, and may not be suitable in all centres without specialised expertise.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines on the management of visceral aneurysms [^11596M1T]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) natural history and rupture risk — overall mortality of ruptured SAAs is high, and pregnancy markedly increases risk: The overall mortality of ruptured SAAs is as high as 25%. SAAs in young women are thought to have a particular tendency toward rupture, especially during the third trimester of pregnancy, and pregnancy may be associated with 20% to 50% of all ruptures. Rupture of an SAA during pregnancy has devastating maternal and fetal mortality rates of 80% and 90%, respectively. Splenic artery pseudoaneurysms certainly have a higher rupture potential than true aneurysms; in one series of 48 visceral aneurysms, 80% of 28 pseudoaneurysms were symptomatic at presentation vs 30% of 20 true aneurysms. In a review of 233 patients with 253 visceral artery aneurysms, rupture at presentation was significantly more frequent for visceral pseudoaneurysms than true aneurysms (76.3% vs 3.1%), with 35 ruptures reported, and the authors concluded that visceral pseudoaneurysms are at increased risk for rupture and that diameter is not necessarily a reliable predictor of rupture.

### Visceral artery aneurysm rupture [^11386JUC]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Aneurysms of the visceral arteries are infrequently encountered. Many are found incidentally and are thought to have a benign outcome. To better characterize these lesions and their clinical course, we reviewed our experience with visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs) at a single institution.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of all VAAs diagnosed at our institution over the past 10 years was performed. The presentation, management, and outcome of therapy was examined for each patient.

Results

Thirty-four VAAs in 26 patients were diagnosed over the past 10 years. Four patients had multiple VAAs: splenic (17), hepatic (7), celiac (3), superior mesenteric (2), gastroduodenal (2), pancreaticoduodenal (1), right gastric (1), ileal (1) artery aneurysms. Associated aneurysms were found in 31% of patients and involved the thoracic aorta (3 patients), abdominal aorta (4 patients), renal arteries (2 patients), iliac artery (3 patients), lower extremity (1 patient), and intracranium (1 patient). In 15 patients (58%), VAAs were detected before rupture by chance or because abdominal symptoms resulted in diagnostic evaluation. Eight of these underwent elective surgery, and there were no deaths. Of those 15 patients with known VAAs, one patient died of rupture and hemorrhage from an untreated splenic artery aneurysm. Eleven patients (42%) presented unexpectedly with rupture, and two died despite prompt surgical treatment. The mortality rate in patients who had ruptured VAAs was 25%, including those who presented with ruptured aneurysms and those observed whose aneurysms eventually ruptured.

Conclusions

Aneurysms of the visceral arteries are rare but important vascular lesions. Associated aneurysms are common. Because of the risk of rupture, often with a fatal outcome, an aggressive approach to the treatment of VAA is essential.

Splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) in pregnancy — risk and size considerations: Splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) affects patients with portal hypertension (PHT) and can present with rupture during pregnancy, and SAA rupture is associated with a high fetal and maternal mortality of 15.6% to 90% and 21.9% to 70%, respectively. Limited data support treatment of SAA to prevent rupture, and there is no established consensus for SAA therapy based on diameter; risk appears highest when SAA is greater than or equal to 2 cm, but 50% of lesions presenting with rupture during pregnancy are smaller than 2 cm.

We describe a case of hepatic artery dissection in a 65-year-old woman. This is the 22nd reported case of hepatic artery dissection, and the first associated with mild acute pancreatitis. The incidence of this condition may be increasing with rising rates of intervention affecting the biliary system. Recognition may also be increasing with growing use of high-quality radiography. Treatment should prevent rupture and ameliorate cardiovascular risk. Surgery should be considered in patients with complications or those likely to have them in future. There is a paucity of data regarding hepatic artery dissection, limiting evidence for guiding management.

### Combined endovascular-open surgical procedure in a great hepatic artery aneurysm [^116kdiky]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Visceral artery aneurysms are rare lesions. They involve the hepatic artery in approximately 20% of cases. Various therapeutic options are available for patients with hepatic artery aneurysms (HAAs). Dictated predominately by the need to maintain distal end-organ perfusion, potential therapies include traditional surgical techniques and laparoscopic surgery, endovascular methods of embolization, and stenting of the lesions. There is still a lack of studies demonstrating the comparative efficacy or inefficacy of any particular treatment, so there are currently no precise indications for determining which type of treatment should be used. In this paper, we present a case of great HAA in a 59-year-old man. He was preoperatively diagnosed and treated with a combined surgical and endovascular approach. The clinical presentation, management, and therapy of patients with HAAs are discussed. In addition to that, we reviewed the literature dealing with HAAs. This case report lays emphasis on the aspect that the treatment strategy in HAAs has to be determined individually in each case due to the high anatomic variability of the arterial supply of the liver. Treatment with a combined surgical and endovascular approach may reduce the risk of liver ischemia and morbidity.

### Analysis of outcomes of endovascular embolisation: a cross-sectional two-center study on 46 visceral artery pseudoaneurysms [^116u15fS]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs) typically occur within celiac trunk and its branches, superior or inferior mesenteric arteries and renal arteries. Unlike true aneurysms that are localized dilatation of the artery with the involvement of all arterial wall layers, pseudoaneurysms are effectively contained ruptures of the artery that are lined by adventitia or by the perivascular tissues (Belli et al.). Generally, true aneurysms are asymptomatic and occur secondary to underlying arterial diseases while pseudoaneurysms are a sequence of direct trauma, or inflammation of the vessel (Belli et al.). Despite the rarity of true visceral artery aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms are more frequently encountered in specialized centers dealing with acute trauma patients or high volumes of abdominal interventions than true aneurysms that are often incidentally discovered (Jesinger et al.).

The imaging appearance of visceral artery pseudoaneurysms (VAPAs) is similar to that of true aneurysms, but typically exhibit more irregular margins, and the pseudoaneurysm is typically surrounded by a hematoma (Jesinger et al.). Up to 70% of pseudoaneurysms and 20% of true aneurysms are liable to rupture and mortality occurs in 25% to 100% (Pitton et al.). Hyperdynamic circulation e.g. pregnancy, portal hypertension and infections are risk factors for rupture. Eighty per cent of the aneurysms of the hepatic artery are liable to rupture, followed by aneurysms of SMA and pancreaticoduodenal arcades (Bradley et al; van Rijn et al; Durkin et al.).

### Technical considerations of endovascular management of true visceral artery aneurysms [^112XiKFq]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominal visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs) are complex to manage but are increasingly the domain of the interventional radiologist. Developments in endovascular detachable coiling, liquid embolic agents and novel stent and stent-graft technology, now allow the safe treatment of more complex aneurysms. Visceral artery aneurysms by definition generally involve a pathological dilatation of branches of the coeliac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric, or renal arteries. The aim of embolisation therapy is the prevention of rupture.

VAAs are classically subdivided into true and false aneurysms (Belli et al.). A true aneurysm is a localized dilatation of the artery by more than 1.5 times the expected arterial diameter with involvement of all three layers of the arterial wall. True aneurysms may occur because of underlying arterial pathology such as atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, and arteritis. True VAAs show a 0.1–2% prevalence, and most true VAAs are asymptomatic at diagnosis. They are often incidentally detected on cross-sectional imaging performed for other reasons. A minority may cause abdominal pain, which may be a harbinger of potential rupture (Tulsyan et al.).

False aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms are effectively a contained arterial rupture that remains contained by adventitia or perivascular tissues. False aneurysms more commonly occur because of inflammation, infection, or trauma (Madhusudhan et al.). Up to 70% of pseudoaneurysms and 20% of true aneurysms are liable to rupture and in this context, expected mortality can be unpredictable ranging from 25 to 100% (Pitton et al.). There are further risk factors for rupture such as a hyperdynamic circulation, which may be exacerbated by pregnancy, portal hypertension and infections. Rupture is seen more commonly in hepatic, pancreatic and SMA aneurysms than renal and splenic artery aneurysms (Rijn et al.).

General indications for treatment of VAA

The Society of Vascular Surgery (SVS) set guidelines to manage VAAs based on the affected artery, size of the lesion, rate of growth, the associated symptoms, and the potential pregnancy status (Chaer et al.) (Fig. 1).

Methods

The writing group for this document, which was established by the CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee, consisted of five clinicians with internationally recognised expertise in interventional radiological treatment of visceral artery aneurysms. The writing group reviewed existing literature on VAA and VAPA endovascular treatment, performing a pragmatic evidence search using PubMed relevant publications from 1980 to 2022. The writing group formulated the recommendations by consensus.

Background

Definition

Visceral and renal artery aneurysms (VAAs) are rare pathologies with an incidence of 0.01–0.2%. Visceral aneurysms are those affecting the splanchnic arteries and include the celiac axis and its branches, the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and their branches, with the splenic artery involved in up to 60% of cases, followed by the hepatic artery as the second most commonly affected artery (Table 2).

VAAs Visceral artery aneurysms; F Female; M Male; VAPA Visceral artery pseudoaneurysm

A true aneurysm is defined as a focal dilatation of an artery of more than 50% of the expected diameter for the anatomical area and patient gender, involving all three vessel layers; it may have a saccular or a fusiform shape.

A false aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm is due to a contained rupture of the artery that is lined only by adventitia or by the perivascular tissues.

### Visceral artery aneurysms: incidence, management, and outcome analysis in a tertiary care center over one decade [^116GjAJc]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the incidence, management, and outcome of visceral artery aneurysms (VAA) over one decade.

Methods

233 patients with 253 VAA were analyzed according to location, diameter, aneurysm type, aetiology, rupture, management, and outcome.

Results

VAA were localized at the splenic artery, coeliac trunk, renal artery, hepatic artery, superior mesenteric artery, and other locations. The aetiology was degenerative, iatrogenic after medical procedures, connective tissue disease, and others. The rate of rupture was much higher in pseudoaneurysms than true aneurysms (76.3% vs.3.1%). Fifty-nine VAA were treated by intervention (n = 45) or surgery (n = 14). Interventions included embolization with coils or glue, covered stents, or combinations of these. Thirty-five cases with ruptured VAA were treated on an emergency basis. There was no difference in size between ruptured and non-ruptured VAA. After interventional treatment, the 30-day mortality was 6.7% in ruptured VAA compared to no mortality in non-ruptured cases. Follow-up included CT and/or MRI after a mean period of 18.0 ± 26.8 months. The current status of the patient was obtained by a structured telephone survey.

Conclusions

Pseudoaneurysms of visceral arteries have a high risk for rupture. Aneurysm size seems to be no reliable predictor for rupture. Interventional treatment is safe and effective for management of VAA.

Key Points

- Diagnosis of visceral artery aneurysms is increasing due to CT and MRI.

- Diameter of visceral arterial aneurysms is no reliable predictor for rupture.

- False aneurysms/pseudoaneurysms and symptomatic cases need emergency treatment.

- Interventional treatment is safe and effective.

### A large series of true pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms [^111Fqgej]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

True pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms (PDAAs) are rare, and prior reports often fail to distinguish true aneurysms from pseudoaneuryms. We sought to characterize all patients who presented to our health system from 2004 to 2019 with true PDAAs, with a focus on risk factors, interventions, and patient outcomes.

Methods

Patients were identified by querying a single health system picture archiving and communication system database for radiographic reports noting a PDAA. A retrospective chart review was performed on all identified patients. Patients with pseudoaneurysm, identified as those with a history of pancreatitis, abdominal malignancy, hepatopancreaticobiliary surgery, or abdominal trauma, were excluded. Continuous variables were compared using t-tests, and categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact tests.

Results

A total of 59 true PDAAs were identified. Forty aneurysms (68%) were intact (iPDAAs) and 19 (32%) were ruptured (rPDAAs) at presentation. The mean size of rPDAAs was 16.4 mm (median size, 14.0 mm; range, 10–42 mm), and the mean size of iPDAAs was 19.4 mm (median size, 17.5 mm; range, 8–88 mm); this difference was not statistically significant (P = .95). Significant celiac disease (occlusion or > 70% stenosis) was noted in 39 aneurysms (66%). Those with rupture were less likely to have significant celiac disease (42% vs 78%; p = 0.017) and less likely to have aneurysmal wall calcifications (6% vs 53%; p = 0.002). Thirty-seven patients underwent intervention (63%), with eight (22%) undergoing concomitant hepatic revascularization (two stents and six bypasses) due to the presence of celiac disease. Eighteen patients with occluded celiac arteries underwent aneurysm intervention; of those, 11 were performed without hepatic revascularization (61.1%). Those with rPDAAs experienced an aneurysm-related mortality of 10.5%, whereas those with iPDAAs experienced a rate of 5.6%. One patient with celiac occlusion and PDA rupture who did not undergo hepatic artery bypass expired postoperatively from hepatic ischemia. rPDAAs showed a trend toward the increased need for aneurysm-related endovascular or open reintervention, but this was not statistically significant (47% vs 28%; p = 0.13).

Conclusions

These findings support previous reports that the rupture risk of PDAAs is independent of size, their development is often associated with significant celiac stenosis or occlusion, and rupture risk appears decreased in patients with concomitant celiac disease or aneurysm wall calcifications. Endovascular intervention is the preferred initial treatment for both iPDAAs and rPDAAs, but reintervention rates are high in both groups. The role for hepatic revascularization remains uncertain, but it does not appear to be mandatory in all patients with complete celiac occlusion who undergo PDAA interventions.

### Stent graft placement by pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic arteries: efficacy and patency rate in follow-up [^113JReXR]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pseudoaneurysms of the hepatic arteries represent a rare but potentially fatal complication after major pancreatic or hepatic surgery. Their incidence is increased in complicated postoperative courses with anastomotic fistulae. Because of the high risk of rupture and consequent massive hemorrhage, with an associated mortality rate of up to 60%, pseudoaneurysms should be treated promptly. Besides surgical vessel repair, endovascular therapies such as stent graft placement or coil embolization are part of the therapeutic algorithm in these patients. Among the interventional and endovascular options, treatment of pseudoaneurysms by stent graft implantation has the advantage of preserving arterial hepatic perfusion, which decreases the onset of major postoperative complications in these patients. Despite preliminary evidence on the efficacy of stent grafting in the treatment of hepatic pseudoaneurysms, clinical studies with substantial patient numbers and meaningful follow-up periods are scarce.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of stent graft placement in the treatment of hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms in a larger cohort of patients with a particular focus on stent graft patency as a function of time.

### Streptococcus agalactiae infective endocarditis complicated by multiple mycotic hepatic aneurysms and massive splenic infarction: a case report [^113Wbw8U]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

MA is a rare disease characterized by elusive clinical presentation and high mortality rate. The diffusion of antibiotic therapy in the clinical practice has reduced the incidence of MAs: actually infected aneurysms comprise 1–2.5% of all aortic aneurysms. The typical feature of this pathologic entity is the destruction of the arterial wall caused by bacterial infection leading to vessel dilatation. The etiology of MA is mainly ascribed to septic embolism of vasa vasorum originating from valvular vegetations in the setting of infective endocarditis; direct colonization of damaged atherosclerotic arterial wall during bacteremia is considered a rare pathogenetic mechanism. Most frequently, MAs occur in abdominal aorta, peripheral arteries, especially femoral artery, and cerebral arteries. Infected aneurysms of visceral arteries are relatively infrequent and generally show an aggressive clinical course with significant mortality. Multidetector CT angiography is considered the pivotal imaging modality in the characterization of MA, showing contrast-enhancing saccular dilatation of the artery with central or eccentric lumen. The most frequent infective agents related to the development of these aneurysms in post-antibiotic era are Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp.; β-hemolytic group A Streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were more common in the past decades. GBS infection rarely causes MAs and only seven other cases are described in the literature: six of them involving the thoracic or abdominal aorta and one the femoral artery. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported of mycotic aneurysm of visceral arteries caused by Streptococcus agalactiae. Hepatic artery MA is usually asymptomatic, but in a minority of cases right upper quadrant pain, jaundice and digestive bleeding may be present. The management of infected aneurysms of hepatic arteries consists in surgical treatment or in endovascular embolization. Although only small series are published, urgent treatment (surgical or radiologic) is generally recommended in symptomatic patients or when aneurysm is larger than 2 cm: these conditions are associated with a higher risk of rupture than atherosclerotic aneurysms. Surgical option is preferable in patients with low surgical risk and proximal aneurysms; embolization should be considered in case of intrahepatic lesions or in high-risk surgical candidates. Antibiotics, possibly tailored on culture sensitivity, are invariably indicated and should be continued for at least 6–8 weeks postoperatively. In our case, we opted for urgent surgical intervention considering the high risk of rupture of the proximal right hepatic aneurysm, proved by its rapid enlargement (from 1.4 to 2.4 cm within 17 days), the sudden increase of bilirubin level and the development of new lesions. In addition, a concomitant splenectomy was required and consequently the open procedure seemed to be the best choice. Unfortunately, the surgical ligation of the right hepatic artery did not result in a complete obliteration of the aneurysms and subsequently endovascular embolization became necessary. This was due to collateral arterial branches from the left hepatic artery that provided blood supply to the right hepatic aneurysms. After selective radiological embolization of the left hepatic artery branches of IV segment, anemia and jaundice were resolved.

### Association between hepatic fat and subclinical vascular disease burden in the general population [^113SFheW]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Fatty liver disease (FLD), defined as an ectopic fat accumulation (≥ 5%) in the hepatocytes, constitutes the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. With a growing prevalence of 2%–44% in the general population, clinical manifestations of FLD ranging from simple steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis and eventually cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma pose a substantial burden on healthcare systems. In particular, cardiovascular disease (CVD), one of the extrahepatic repercussions of FLD, remains to be the largest contributor of mortality among people with FLD.

Prior to the clinical manifestation of CVD, subclinical vascular disease, representing pathological changes of various blood vessels, can provide important aetiological insights into early detection of CVD development. We have previously shown with our data that hepatic fat was positively associated with subclinical vascular parameters such as left ventricular remodelling index. Moreover, data from other population-based studies have also indicated a positive association between FLD and subclinical calcified plaque in different vessels.

One understudied outcome of interest in the realm of subclinical vascular changes is aortic aneurysm, which represents a disproportionate dilation of aortic diameter (thoracic aorta diameter ≥ 5 cm or abdominal aorta diameter ≥ 3 cm) that could result in life-threatening events such as aortic rupture or dissection. Several risk factors for the development of aortic aneurysm including age, increased body mass index (BMI) and hyperlipidaemia are mutually shared with FLD. However, whether hepatic fat is associated with expanding aortic dimeters, measured along multiple locations of the aorta, has not been previously investigated in a population-based setting.

Furthermore, the evidence is still inconsistent regarding whether hepatic fat represents an independent modifiable risk factor for subclinical atherosclerosis, such as carotid plaque. A meta-analysis reported that compared with people without FLD those who with FLD were almost 80% more likely to have carotid plaque detected by ultrasound. However, different criteria used for defining carotid plaque made their conclusions unconvincing. Ultrasound is less precise than CT or MRI in quantifying plaque calcification, which is particularly prone to progress to CVD events. Interestingly, two well-powered population-based studies could not show a link between FLD and carotid calcification measured by CT. On the other hand, most previous studies used either ultrasound or CT to define FLD, which are less sensitive than MRI when fat content is low.

Therefore, we aimed to determine the association of hepatic fat quantified by dedicated whole-body MRI protocols with aortic diameters and carotid atherosclerosis measured by MRI or ultrasound in two well-characterised independent German studies.

Prognosis

Rupture

The incidence of rupture is approximately 0.95% annually. The factors associated with an increased risk of rupture of a cerebral aneurysm are hypertension, smoking, cocaine and alcohol usage. The risk of rupture also varies according to the size (> 7 mm) and location, with anterior and posterior aneurysms at a higher risk of rupture than middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms. A daughter sac (irregular protrusion on the sac wall of the aneurysm) and a large size ratio, defined as the aneurysm to vessel size ratio, also increase the risk of aneurysmal rupture.

Outcomes

They vary significantly, from complete recovery to severe disability or death. The most important early predictor of outcome is intact consciousness, with patients having better Glasgow coma score (GCS) at presentation faring better,: Survival after aSAH has increased by 17% in the past few decades due to early diagnosis, early minimally invasive interventions of aneurysm securement, nimodipine usage and intensive care support. Cumulative case fatality rates after SAH are 25–30% on day one, 40–45% within week one, 50–60% after the first month, and 55–60%, 65% and 65–70% at 6, 12 and 60 months respectively. 12% of patients die before receiving medical attention. Poor outcomes in patients with aSAH are often associated with several key factors. These include older age, worsening neurological conditions, posterior circulation aneurysm rupture, larger aneurysm sizes, and an increased presence of SAH on initial CT scans. Complications such as intracerebral haematoma or intraventricular haemorrhage and elevated admission systolic blood pressure also contribute to unfavourable outcomes. Previous diagnoses of hypertension, myocardial infarction, liver disease, or SAH further compound the risk. Intensive care management of aSAH patients primarily focuses on addressing delayed cerebral ischaemia, which affects 20–45% of patients and is linked with worse neurologic outcomes and mortality. However, aSAH also often leads to medical complications like fever, anaemia, and hyperglycaemia, which further influence the patient's prognosis and hospital stay duration.

### Endoscopic diagnosis of a right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm [^115M7tWq]. Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Hepatic artery aneurysms are rare occurrences with diverse etiologies. We present a case of a right hepatic artery aneurysm, which was diagnosed at endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) and treated angiographically. This is the first report where ERC has been critical in delineating the aneurysmal cavity, suggesting the diagnosis and prompting emergency intervention.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^115hhHT9]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Indications for Treatment

Despite the natural history being unclear, numerous reports and data available in the literature suggest that a significate percentage of VAAs present with rupture and, therefore, the management of VAAs and VAPAs usually depends on the size and location of the aneurysm, and the estimated risk of aneurysm rupture (Table 2).

No data from randomised controlled trials exist to support treatment according to the aneurysm size or shape. Historically, the treatment threshold for VAA was 2 cm. Recent Society of Vascular Surgery guidelines based on retrospective studies recommend treatment of splenic or renal artery aneurysms > 3 cm in asymptomatic patients. The evidence for moving the threshold from 2 to 3 cm for splenic and renal aneurysm treatment is, however, not high and remains controversial. Therefore, this standards of practice document supports the endovascular treatment of splenic and renal aneurysms > 2 cm, especially when they have a sacciform shape, are distally located and the vascular anatomy is favourable.

Hepatic, celiac, jejunal or ileal artery aneurysms should be treated if > 2 cm. Patients with gastric or gastroepiploic, pancreaticoduodenal or gastroduodenal, mesenteric or colic artery aneurysms should be treated regardless of their size due to the associated high risk of rupture.

VAAs with any related symptoms or in which there is a demonstrable increase in size (usually > 0.5 cm/year) should be treated regardless of their size. Treatment of asymptomatic VAAs in women of child-bearing age should be considered, particularly if an increase in size is detected.

VAPAs should be treated promptly due to the high risk of rupture, regardless of their size.

Conservative management of small VAPAs within the parenchyma may be reasonable but strict follow-up must be performed to monitor their evolution.

In ruptured VAAs or VAPAs, emergency treatment is required. For non-ruptured VAAs or VAPAs that could be treated either endovascularly or surgically, the procedural risk–benefit should be carefully evaluated, taking age, comorbidities and procedural complexity into consideration. The summary of recommendations is presented in Table 1.

### A case of Candida parapsilosis endocarditis complicated by right hepatic artery aneurysm, rupture and hemorrhage of brain abscess: case report and literature review [^1159o4Yi]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The most severe outcome of a right hepatic pseudoaneurysm is rupture, leading to massive hemorrhage. Monique Boukobza and other authors point out in the literature related to hepatic aneurysms that, most cases of ruptured abdominal false aneurysms occur within the liver parenchyma and in the peritonea cavity, presenting as isolated hemorrhage, and rarely are accompanied by biliary tract hemorrhage. At the same time, the risk of a pseudoaneurysm is much higher than that of a true aneurysm.

The most common presenting symptoms were fever constant, and abdominal pain, that is associated with the rupture and ischemia of the hepatic pseudoaneurysm. At present, endovascular intervention is an effective alternative to open surgical repair. According to the Society for Vascular Surgery's clinical practice guidelines on abdominal aortic aneurysms, once a hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm is diagnosed, prompt repair is recommended, regardless of size, and all symptomatic HAA should be repaired. Consequently, we performed timely embolization of the right hepatic artery aneurysm in this patient. Cases of hepatic artery aneurysm caused by Candida species are extremely rare, and the successful treatment of this patient, who underwent embolization of the intrahepatic pseudoaneurysm and subsequently recovered and was discharged, appears to be unique and we search of the existing databases revealed no similar case reports.

Splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) screening and surveillance — population screening suggestion, association rates, and follow-up intervals are provided: We suggest screening of patients with SAAs for other intra-abdominal, intrathoracic, intracranial, and peripheral artery aneurysms; SAAs may be multiple and may be found in association with other visceral and nonvisceral aneurysms, including a review of 212 cases in which 3.3% had concomitant visceral aneurysms with the most common location extrahepatic (2.3%) and 14.3% had concomitant nonvisceral aneurysms with the most common locations renal (7.4%) and abdominal aortic (3.7%); for conservative management with observation, surveillance to assess for progression and size growth is required, and CT or ultrasound should be performed every 12 months, with CT generally preferred and possible with or without contrast enhancement.

Results

We identified 233 patients (age 65 ± 13 years [range 17–95 years], 142 men and 91 women) diagnosed with a total of 253 VAAs over the course of a decade (Table 1). In the majority of cases VAA involved the splenic artery (n = 83), followed by the coeliac trunk (n = 47), the renal arteries (n = 44), the hepatic artery (n = 40), the superior mesenteric artery and its branches (n = 17), the gastroduodenal artery (n = 10), the pancreaticoduodenal artery (n = 8), the gastric artery (n = 4), and combinations of these as listed in Table 2. Thirty-seven aneurysms in 35 patients presented with rupture; the majority of aneurysms were detected in a non-ruptured condition (n = 216 aneurysms). Over 90% of the aneurysms (n = 231 in 212 patients) were detected by CT scans, followed by angiography (n = 13 in 12 patients) and MRI (n = 9 in 9 patients). Radiological follow-up was 18.0 ± 26.8 months (range: 1 day to 109 months).

Sixty-two of the 233 patients (26.6%) presented with specific symptoms upon admission to hospital, and all 35 patients with ruptured aneurysms showed symptoms. A reduced haemoglobin count of 8.2 ± 1.6 g/dl in 34 of 62 patients (54.8%) was the most frequent sign of rupture. Eleven of 62 symptomatic patients (17.7%) presented with abdominal pain. For a summary of the patients' clinical presentation, see Table 3.

### Hybrid repair of a hepatic artery aneurysm [^117WdpJ9]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Visceral arterial aneurysm is a rare pathology. Currently, there are no sufficient data to support the superiority of surgical or endovascular treatment. The choice depends mainly on patient characteristics and the anatomy of the aneurysm. We present a case of a 12-cm fusiform aneurysm of the common hepatic artery. A combined approach including endovascular exclusion of the celiac trunk and surgical closure of the aneurysm was chosen. The postoperative course was uneventful. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature describing this combined approach.
