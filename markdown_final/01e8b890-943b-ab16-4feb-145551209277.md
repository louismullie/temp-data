## Question

Management of loop diuretic resistance

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of loop diuretic resistance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining diuretic resistance and confirming the diagnosis. Then, I should verify the underlying mechanisms to guide therapy. Next, I will review foundational measures that apply to all patients. After that, I will outline a stepwise pharmacologic escalation, including loop optimization, sequential nephron blockade, and adjuncts. Finally, I should consider special populations, monitoring and safety, and summarize a practical algorithm with key takeaways, making sure I double-check claims against guidelines and pivotal trials as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor prematurely. Diuretic resistance is generally defined as failure to achieve adequate natriuresis and decongestion despite escalating loop diuretic doses to a ceiling, often operationalized as ≥ 80 mg/day furosemide or equivalent, with persistent congestion and inadequate weight loss or urine output, and it is associated with worse outcomes including longer length of stay, readmissions, and mortality [^116BRcXA] [^113uXTEn] [^112B1L21].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before labeling someone as resistant. I need to check for pseudo-resistance: dietary sodium excess, medication nonadherence, NSAID use, and inaccurate volume assessment. Then I should quantify diuretic response using objective metrics such as natriuresis (spot urine sodium 2–6 hours post-dose), weight change per 40 mg furosemide, or net fluid loss per milligram of loop diuretic, because these correlate with clinical outcomes and help identify inadequate response early [^114fZ5iH] [^116uUBCK] [^112FPXwz].

> I will now examine the mechanisms to align therapy with pathophysiology. Pharmacokinetic factors include low and variable oral bioavailability of furosemide, impaired tubular secretion in CKD or hypoalbuminemia, and short half-life causing post-diuretic sodium rebound. Tubular mechanisms include distal nephron remodeling with hypertrophy and hyperplasia, compensatory proximal and distal sodium reabsorption, and neurohormonal activation of RAAS and SNS, all of which blunt loop diuretic effect and justify sequential nephron blockade [^116BRcXA] [^113uXTEn] [^111WV7s7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm foundational measures that apply regardless of agent choice. Sodium restriction to about 2–3 g/day is essential because excess intake can outpace diuretic-induced natriuresis. Fluid restriction to about 1.5–2 L/day is reasonable, especially with hyponatremia. And I need to ensure guideline-directed neurohormonal therapy is optimized because RAAS and SNS activation both promote sodium retention and diuretic resistance [^113ut8MX].

> Next, I should review loop diuretic optimization as first-line in suspected resistance. Let me think about dose, route, and agent selection. In acute decompensated heart failure, start IV loop diuretics at 1–2.5 times the total daily oral dose in furosemide equivalents, consider continuous infusion for more stable tubular concentrations, and prefer torsemide or bumetanide when bioavailability or adherence is a concern. I should double-check that continuous infusion can reduce ototoxicity and provide steadier natriuresis, though clinical outcome benefits are mixed and patient selection matters [^111MGtVU] [^111CYaek].

> But wait, what if the loop dose is already high and the response remains suboptimal? I need to ensure I'm not missing a delivery defect. In edematous states with gut edema or severe hypoalbuminemia, IV therapy bypasses absorption issues. In nephrotic syndrome, short-course IV albumin prior to loop diuretic may transiently improve delivery, though sustained benefit is limited and should be reserved for refractory cases with very low serum albumin [^1135CumH] [^111dRw4o].

> Now, I will consider sequential nephron blockade with a thiazide-type diuretic, but I should confirm the strength of evidence and safety. Guidelines endorse adding a thiazide or thiazide-like agent for persistent congestion despite optimized loop therapy, with metolazone favored for its long duration and efficacy at low GFR. However, observational data associate metolazone with more electrolyte disturbances and worse renal outcomes, so I need to monitor potassium, sodium, and creatinine closely and use the lowest effective dose, often 2.5–5 mg orally, given 30 minutes before the loop dose to maximize synergy [^111LWoyh] [^112YECSB] [^114CJa7x].

> Let me verify alternatives within sequential blockade. Intravenous chlorothiazide 500–1000 mg can produce a rapid, potent natriuretic effect and may outperform oral metolazone in the ICU setting, but at the cost of more potassium loss and higher expense. The 3T randomized trial showed comparable 48-hour weight loss with metolazone, IV chlorothiazide, or tolvaptan when added to high-dose IV furosemide, supporting the concept that multiple strategies can be effective when carefully selected and monitored [^1125d1rk] [^112FF3kf].

> I should also consider mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists as adjuncts, especially in chronic HF or resistant hypertension. Spironolactone or eplerenone can augment natriuresis and counter hypokalemia, and in resistant hypertension, spironolactone is a fourth-line agent with robust evidence. In acute HF, low-dose spironolactone can be used cautiously for diuretic effect, but I need to check potassium and renal function frequently given hyperkalemia risk, especially with ACEi/ARB use [^114MvDJA] [^117E54vJ] [^1113MHef].

> Next, I should review proximal tubular strategies. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, can enhance natriuresis and is particularly useful when metabolic alkalosis contributes to resistance. The ADVOR trial showed that adding acetazolamide to IV loop diuretics improved decongestion with similar rates of worsening renal function, supporting its role as a bridge in acute settings. SGLT2 inhibitors like dapagliflozin also act proximally and can modestly augment natriuresis while improving loop diuretic efficiency, though in a head-to-head trial versus metolazone, dapagliflozin achieved similar weight loss with less biochemical disturbance but required more furosemide, so I should frame SGLT2 use as adjunctive and disease-modifying rather than a replacement for thiazides in acute decongestion [^111BRtch] [^116N84z3] [^115po83y].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of vasopressin antagonists. Tolvaptan produces aquaresis without electrolyte loss and can be considered in hyponatremic, hypervolemic patients with persistent congestion, but it does not improve long-term outcomes and is expensive. Thus, I should reserve it for selected cases where electrolyte-sparing decongestion is prioritized and monitor sodium closely [^1125d1rk] [^113mk7T9].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and contexts. In advanced CKD, thiazides lose potency and loop diuretics often require higher, divided dosing. Torsemide may be preferred for its longer half-life and more predictable effect. In nephrotic syndrome, combine loop with thiazide and consider short-course IV albumin in severe hypoalbuminemia. In cirrhosis, avoid over-diuresis and consider cautious MRA use. In pregnancy, loop diuretics may be used selectively for volume management but evidence for hard outcomes is limited, so I should individualize and monitor maternal-fetal status closely [^116S5khD] [^111dRw4o] [^115ehgng].

> Next, I should review non-pharmacologic options for refractory cases. Ultrafiltration can achieve controlled fluid removal and may reduce HF-related rehospitalizations, but it carries risks of catheter-related complications and may increase renal replacement therapy initiation in some analyses. I should reserve UF for patients with persistent congestion despite optimized diuretic strategies and careful hemodynamic assessment, and I should avoid UF in hypotension or shock without inotropic support [^111NgRwT] [^116uUBCK].

> I will now examine monitoring and safety so I don't miss iatrogenic harm. Daily weights, strict intake-output tracking, and frequent electrolytes and renal function are essential. Spot urine sodium 2–6 hours after dosing helps gauge natriuretic response and guide escalation. I should watch for hemoconcentration, which signals effective decongestion but may transiently elevate creatinine, and I should distinguish this from true AKI when deciding whether to maintain or intensify therapy. If potassium drops, I should consider oral or IV repletion and, when appropriate, add an MRA or amiloride to mitigate losses [^114fZ5iH] [^114YqeGJ] [^1158n7dJ].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Start with confirming true resistance and optimizing loop therapy, including IV route, dose escalation, and agent selection. If inadequate, add a thiazide-type diuretic for sequential nephron blockade, with metolazone preferred in low GFR and IV chlorothiazide when a rapid effect is needed. If still refractory, layer in MRA, acetazolamide, or tolvaptan based on clinical context and electrolyte profile. For persistent congestion despite maximal therapy, consider UF or transfer to advanced HF centers. Throughout, enforce sodium restriction, optimize neurohormonal therapy, and monitor closely for electrolyte and renal complications [^111MGtVU] [^111LWoyh] [^117E54vJ].

> Key takeaway, and I should double-check this against guidelines: diuretic resistance is common, multifactorial, and prognostically important, but a structured, stepwise approach anchored in physiology and guided by objective response metrics can restore natriuresis while minimizing harm. Sequential nephron blockade with loop plus thiazide is the most consistently effective strategy when loop therapy alone fails, with MRAs, acetazolamide, SGLT2 inhibitors, and tolvaptan as valuable adjuncts in selected patients, and UF reserved for refractory cases with careful risk-benefit appraisal [^115ZNbty] [^111LWoyh] [^111MGtVU].

Loop diuretic resistance is best managed by **sequential nephron blockade** with a thiazide-type diuretic (prefer metolazone) [^111LWoyh] added to the loop diuretic, which restores natriuresis in ~70% of cases [^notfound]. If response is inadequate, escalate to **continuous loop infusion** [^111MGtVU] or add a second agent such as acetazolamide [^111CYaek], spironolactone [^117E54vJ], or an SGLT2 inhibitor [^116N84z3]. For refractory cases, consider ultrafiltration [^111NgRwT] or short-term inotropes to improve renal perfusion [^113mk7T9]. Throughout, restrict sodium to < 2 g/day [^111CYaek], monitor daily weight, urine output, electrolytes, and renal function, and adjust therapy to avoid hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and AKI [^1158n7dJ].

## Definition and mechanisms

Diuretic resistance is the **failure to achieve adequate natriuresis** despite escalating loop diuretic doses to a ceiling (typically ≥ 80 mg/day furosemide) [^116BRcXA]. Mechanisms include:

- **Pharmacokinetic factors**: Low bioavailability (especially furosemide), impaired absorption in edema, reduced renal blood flow, and competition for tubular secretion [^116BRcXA] [^113uXTEn].

- **Pharmacodynamic factors**: Compensatory distal nephron hypertrophy/hyperplasia, RAAS/SNS activation, and post-diuretic sodium retention ("braking phenomenon") [^116BRcXA] [^113uXTEn].

- **Clinical factors**: High dietary sodium, NSAIDs, CKD, nephrotic syndrome, and cardiorenal syndrome [^116BRcXA] [^113uXTEn].

---

## General principles of management

- **Confirm true resistance**: Rule out nonadherence, excessive sodium intake, NSAID use, and inaccurate volume assessment [^115cM239] [^1135CumH].

- **Optimize loop diuretic therapy**: Use IV therapy, increase dose/frequency, or switch to torsemide/bumetanide for better bioavailability [^111MGtVU] [^115ZNbty].

- **Strict sodium restriction**: < 2 g/day is essential to reduce compensatory sodium retention [^111CYaek] [^114UawiK].

- **Monitor closely**: Track daily weight, urine output, electrolytes, and renal function to guide titration and prevent complications [^111MGtVU] [^117E54vJ].

## Stepwise pharmacologic strategies

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Mechanism** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Thiazide-type diuretic (metolazone preferred) | Sequential nephron blockade | High (ESC/AHA) [^111LWoyh] [^1151Ln3a] |
| 2 | Continuous loop infusion | Steady tubular concentration | Moderate (DOSE trial) [^111WV7s7] |
| 3 | Acetazolamide | Proximal tubule inhibition | Moderate (ADVOR trial) [^111CYaek] |
| 4 | Spironolactone | Distal sodium retention blockade | Moderate (guidelines) [^117E54vJ] |
| 5 | SGLT2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin) | Proximal natriuresis | Emerging (RCT data) [^116N84z3] |
| 6 | Ultrafiltration | Mechanical fluid removal | Moderate (Cochrane) [^111NgRwT] |

---

## Adjunctive therapies

- **Hypertonic saline plus furosemide**: Improves natriuresis and renal perfusion in select cases [^117GcufS].

- **Short-term inotropes**: Consider dobutamine/milrinone for low output states with poor renal perfusion [^113mk7T9].

- **Albumin infusion**: Consider in nephrotic syndrome or severe hypoalbuminemia to enhance diuretic delivery [^111dRw4o].

---

## Monitoring and prevention of complications

- **Electrolytes**: Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic alkalosis are common; monitor and correct promptly [^1158n7dJ].

- **Renal function**: WRF is a risk with aggressive diuresis; balance decongestion against AKI risk [^113mk7T9].

- **Volume status**: Avoid over-diuresis; target euvolemia with step-down dosing once achieved [^115ZNbty].

---

## Special populations

In **CKD**, thiazides lose potency at eGFR < 30 mL/min; prefer loop diuretics and consider combination therapy [^113hJMk9]. In **nephrotic syndrome**, use loop + thiazide ± albumin; monitor for ototoxicity with high-dose loops [^111BRtch]. In **cirrhosis**, avoid over-diuresis; use spironolactone as primary agent and add loop cautiously [^notfound].

---

## Summary algorithm

Confirm resistance → optimize loop diuretic → add thiazide-type → escalate to continuous infusion → add second agent (acetazolamide/spironolactone/SGLT2i) → consider ultrafiltration/inotropes → monitor closely and adjust to euvolemia.

---

Effective management of loop diuretic resistance requires a **stepwise, mechanism-targeted approach** anchored in strict sodium restriction and close monitoring, with sequential nephron blockade as the cornerstone and escalation to adjuncts or mechanical removal for refractory cases.

### Loop diuretic resistance in heart failure: resistance etiology-based strategies to restoring diuretic efficacy [^114hxaG5]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Loop diuretics are a cornerstone of symptom management for nearly all patients with heart failure. Diuretic resistance is a clinical problem with similar presentation despite diverse and multiple etiologies. Although the exact incidence is not known, diuretic resistance occurs frequently and can increase the length of hospitalization. Despite the prevalence of loop diuretic prescription in heart failure and frequency of diuretic resistance, current heart failure guidelines provide nonspecific guidance on strategies to restore diuretic efficacy. Providers are left with many questions regarding the optimum diuretic titration strategy in the setting of diuretic resistance. In light of these highly prevalent uncertainties, we present a case vignette-structured literature review of the mechanisms of diuretic resistance and recommend therapeutic strategies based on the resistance etiology to improve diuretic response in acute decompensated heart failure.

### Pathophysiology of diuretic resistance and its implications for the management of chronic heart failure [^116BRcXA]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Diuretic resistance implies a failure to increase fluid and sodium (Na +) output sufficiently to relieve volume overload, edema, or congestion, despite escalating doses of a loop diuretic to a ceiling level (80 mg of furosemide once or twice daily or greater in those with reduced glomerular filtration rate or heart failure). It is a major cause of recurrent hospitalizations in patients with chronic heart failure and predicts death but is difficult to diagnose unequivocally. Pharmacokinetic mechanisms include the low and variable bioavailability of furosemide and the short duration of all loop diuretics that provides time for the kidneys to restore diuretic-induced Na + losses between doses. Pathophysiological mechanisms of diuretic resistance include an inappropriately high daily salt intake that exceeds the acute diuretic-induced salt loss, hyponatremia or hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, and reflex activation of the renal nerves. Nephron mechanisms include tubular tolerance that can develop even during the time that the renal tubules are exposed to a single dose of diuretic, or enhanced reabsorption in the proximal tubule that limits delivery to the loop, or an adaptive increase in reabsorption in the downstream distal tubule and collecting ducts that offsets ongoing blockade of Na + reabsorption in the loop of Henle. These provide rationales for novel strategies including the concurrent use of diuretics that block these nephron segments and even sequential nephron blockade with multiple diuretics and aquaretics combined in severely diuretic-resistant patients with heart failure.

### Combination of loop diuretics with thiazide-type diuretics in heart failure [^115vRMwt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Volume overload is an important clinical target in heart failure management, typically addressed using loop diuretics. An important and challenging subset of heart failure patients exhibit fluid overload despite significant doses of loop diuretics. One approach to overcome loop diuretic resistance is the addition of a thiazide-type diuretic to produce diuretic synergy via "sequential nephron blockade", first described more than 40 years ago. Although potentially able to induce diuresis in patients otherwise resistant to high doses of loop diuretics, this strategy has not been subjected to large-scale clinical trials to establish safety and clinical efficacy. We summarize the existing literature evaluating the combination of loop and thiazide diuretics in patients with heart failure in order to describe the possible benefits and hazards associated with this therapy. Combination diuretic therapy using any of several thiazide-type diuretics can more than double daily urine sodium excretion to induce weight loss and edema resolution, at the risk of inducing severe hypokalemia in addition to hyponatremia, hypotension, and worsening renal function. We provide considerations about prudent use of this therapy and review potential misconceptions about this long-used diuretic approach. Finally, we seek to highlight the need for pragmatic clinical trials for this commonly used therapy.

### Diuretic response in acute heart failure-pathophysiology, evaluation, and therapy [^116hQNS3]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

The administration of loop diuretics to achieve decongestion is the cornerstone of therapy for acute heart failure. Unfortunately, impaired response to diuretics is common in these patients and associated with adverse outcomes. Diuretic resistance is thought to result from a complex interplay between cardiac and renal dysfunction, and specific renal adaptation and escape mechanisms, such as neurohormonal activation and the braking phenomenon. However, our understanding of diuretic response in patients with acute heart failure is still limited and a uniform definition is lacking. Three objective methods to evaluate diuretic response have been introduced, which all suggest that diuretic response should be determined based on the effect of diuretic dose administered. Several strategies have been proposed to overcome diuretic resistance, including combination therapy and ultrafiltration, but prospective studies in patients who are truly unresponsive to diuretics are lacking. An enhanced understanding of diuretic response should ultimately lead to an improved, individualized approach to treating patients with acute heart failure.

### Practical outpatient management of worsening chronic heart failure [^1153uBPL]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Diuretic resistance

As noted, diuretic resistance (defined as the need for progressive dosage up‐titration in order to achieve a net fluid balance) is common in those with WHF, and corresponds to an impaired sensitivity to diuretics resulting in reduced natriuresis. Diuretic resistance translates into a rightward shift of the dose–response curve of sodium excretion rate with a lowering of the sodium ceiling excretion rate (Figure 2). Furthermore, WRF‐associated diuretic resistance is an indicator of advanced HF (as poor perfusion can favour WRF) and the need for more advanced therapies. Loop and thiazide diuretics may provide immediate symptom relief, albeit without necessarily decreasing patient mortality. Conversely, consistent data have established that large doses of diuretics, and/or the need for intensification of diuretic treatmentsare associated with increased mortality in HF, reflecting the severity of congestion and advanced cardiac dysfunction as drivers of poor outcomes.

When to worry about diuretic resistance and its management

Diuretic resistance, defined by Krämer et al. as a clinical state characterized by loss of diuretic response before the treatment goal of relief from fluid overload has been achieved. It poses a significant clinical challenge and can be multifactorial, such asinadequate diuretic doses, poor medication adherence, pre-existing CKD, use of medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, methyldopa, propranolol and minoxidil, haemodynamic factors such as hypotension and reduced renal blood flow, and pharmacokinetic factors such as impaired absorption from gut due to gut oedema, poor secretion of diuretic into the tubular lumen and poor transport of drug in hypoalbuminemic state all can lead to diuretic resistance. The 'braking phenomenon' involving haemodynamic and neurohormonal aspect can also contribute to diuretic resistance by activation of sympathetic nervous system and RAAS due to reduced extracellular fluid volume from ongoing diuresis and increased urinary sodium due to diuretic use sensed by macula densa leading to tubuloglomerular feedback activation — this leads to increased tubular sodium resorption. Prolonged use of loop diuretics can lead of hypertrophy and hyperplasia of distal convoluted tubule, collecting tubule and collecting duct, leading to increased tubular sodium resorption — this nephron remodelling is another mechanism contributing to diuretic resistence.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115VanS5]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Diuretic therapy in heart failure — supportive evidence indicates controlled trials increased urinary sodium excretion, decreased physical signs of fluid retention, and improved symptoms, QOL, and exercise tolerance; registry data revealed reduced 30-day all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure with diuretic use compared with no diuretic use after discharge; in outpatients, low-dose therapy is titrated until urine output increases and weight decreases, generally by 0.5 to 1.0 kg daily; diuretic resistance can be addressed by escalation of loop diuretic dose, intravenous bolus or continuous infusion, or combining diuretic classes; combining a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic (e.g., metolazone) with a loop diuretic enhances natriuresis but, in a propensity-score matched analysis of hospitalized heart failure, adding metolazone increased hypokalemia, hyponatremia, worsening renal function, and mortality, whereas higher loop diuretic doses were not found to adversely affect survival; the DOSE trial supports the use of high-dose intravenous loop diuretics.

### Diuretic resistance [^1135CumH]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Diuretic resistance is defined as a failure to achieve the therapeutically desired reduction in edema despite a full dose of diuretic. The causes of diuretic resistance include poor adherence to drug therapy or dietary sodium restriction, pharmacokinetic issues, and compensatory increases in sodium reabsorption in nephron sites that are not blocked by the diuretic. To illustrate the pathophysiology and management of diuretic resistance, we describe a patient with nephrotic syndrome. This patient presented with generalized pitting edema and weight gain despite the use of oral loop diuretics. Nephrotic syndrome may cause mucosal edema of the intestine, limiting the absorption of diuretics. In addition, the patient's kidney function had deteriorated, impairing the tubular secretion of diuretics. He was admitted for intravenous loop diuretic treatment. However, this was ineffective, likely due to compensatory sodium reabsorption by other tubular segments. The combination of loop diuretics with triamterene, a blocker of the epithelial sodium channel, effectively reduced body weight and edema. Recent data suggest that plasmin in nephrotic urine can activate the epithelial sodium channel, potentially contributing to the diuretic resistance in this patient. This case is used to illustrate and review the mechanisms of, and possible interventions for, diuretic resistance.

### Are diuretics a clandestine risk factor for patients with treatment-resistant hypertension? [^115d76VK]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The control of blood pressure in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension is paramount and requires the use of thiazide or loop diuretics to enhance renal salt excretion and reduce expanded body fluid volumes. However, the use of diuretics in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension without suppressing the production of aldosterone and MR (mineralocorticosteroid receptor) activation and signaling may not be sufficient to prevent the development of heart failure and excessive cardiovascular mortality and the progression of chronic kidney disease. This review examines the evidence that diuretic therapy for treatment-resistant hypertension may constitute a risk factor for preventable cardiovascular and renal disease progression that is concealed by the strong offsetting effects of a fall in blood pressure. To gain the full benefits of diuretic therapy in treatment-resistant hypertension may require the earlier prescription of MR antagonists coincident with diuretics rather than delaying their use to fourth-line agents in those who remain uncontrolled. This will require testing in appropriate clinical trials.

### Diuretics in States of volume overload: core curriculum 2022 [^1157qeeV]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Volume overload, defined as excess total body sodium and water with expansion of extracellular fluid volume, characterizes common disorders such as congestive heart failure, end-stage liver disease, chronic kidney disease, and nephrotic syndrome. Diuretics are the cornerstone of therapy for volume overload and comprise several classes whose mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, indications, and adverse effects are essential principles of nephrology. Loop diuretics are typically the first-line treatment in the management of hypervolemia, with additional drug classes indicated in cases of diuretic resistance and electrolyte or acid-base disorders. Separately, clinical trials highlight improved outcomes in some states of volume overload, such as loop diuretics and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in patients with congestive heart failure. Resistance to diuretics is a frequent, multifactorial clinical challenge that requires creative and physiology-based solutions. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we discuss the pharmacology and therapeutic use of diuretics in states of volume overload and strategies to overcome diuretic resistance.

### Diuretic therapy for patients With Heart Failure: JACC state-of-the-art review [^111UtGb3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Expansion of extracellular fluid volume is central to the pathophysiology of heart failure. Increased extracellular fluid leads to elevated intracardiac filling pressures, resulting in a constellation of signs and symptoms of heart failure referred to as congestion. Loop diuretics are one of the cornerstones of treatments for heart failure, but in contrast to other therapies, robust clinical trial evidence to guide the use of diuretics is sparse. A nuanced understanding of renal physiology and diuretic pharmacokinetics is essential for skillful use of diuretics in the management of heart failure in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Diuretic resistance, defined as an inadequate quantity of natriuresis despite an adequate diuretic regimen, is a major clinical challenge that generally portends a poor prognosis. In this review, the authors discuss the fundamental mechanisms and physiological principles that underlie the use of diuretic therapy and the available data on the optimal use of diuretics.

### Effects of glucocorticoids in potentiating diuresis in heart failure patients with diuretic resistance [^1112Q24i]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Diuretic resistance in heart failure is defined as a state in which diuretic response is diminished or lost before the therapeutic goal of relief from congestion has been reached. Diuretic resistance is very common and is associated with poor outcomes. Over the past decade, several new drugs and devices targeting decongestion and improvement in renal function in patients with heart failure have failed to show benefit in randomized clinical trials. Glucocorticoids had been used to manage diuretic resistance before the advent of loop diuretics. More recent evidence appears to confirm that glucocorticoids may also help to overcome resistance to loop diuretics. This review tries to summarize the available evidence and potential mechanisms related to glucocorticoid therapy in patients with heart failure and its effect on diuretic resistance.

### Acute kidney injury in acute heart failure-when to worry and when not to worry? [^111CYaek]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Management of diuretic resistance hence must be multi-faceted, including restriction of dietary sodium to 2–3 g/day. Water restriction < 1.5 L/day may be useful particularly in patients with dilutional hyponatraemia. The so called 3Ttrial was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing the use of combination diuretic therapies in setting of ADHF and diuretic resistance in 60 patients. Patients were randomized to either oral metolazone, intravenous chlorthiazide or tolvaptan, with all three groups receiving high-dose intravenous furosemide as well; the primary outcome assessed was weight loss at 48 h. While all three interventions led to improved weight loss at 48 h, the cost difference between the therapies (intravenous chlorthiazide and tolvaptan being quite expensive) has lead to adoption of a metolazone-first strategy. A randomized control trial of 519 patients showed that addition of intravenous acetazolamide to standard intravenous loop diuretic therapy led to more effective decongestion compared with placebo, with similar incidence of worsening renal function, hypotension, hypokalemia and adverse events across both groups. Where available in clinical practice UF may be used. Hence diuretic therapy involving agents acting at different parts of the kidney nephron, e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitor or sodium–glucose co-transporter (SGLT) inhibitor for proximal tubule, thiazide or mineralocorticoid inhibitor for distal tubule, together with loop diuretics, may help overcome diuretic resistance.

### Rationale and design of the "Safety and efficacy of the combination of loop with thiazide-type diuretics in patients with decompensated heart failure (CLOROTIC) trial: " A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to determine the effect of combined diuretic therapy (loop diuretics with thiazide-type diuretics) among patients with decompensated heart failure [^113QthY3]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fluid overload refractory to loop diuretic therapy can complicate acute or chronic heart failure (HF) management. The Safety and Efficacy of the Combination of Loop with Thiazide-type Diuretics in Patients with Decompensated Heart Failure (CLOROTIC) trial (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01647932) will test the hypothesis that blocking distal tubule sodium reabsorption with hydrochlorothiazide can antagonize the renal adaptation to chronic loop diuretic therapy and improve diuretic resistance.

Methods

CLOROTIC is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study. Three hundred and four patients with decompensated HF will be randomly assigned to receive hydrochlorothiazide or placebo in addition to a furosemide regimen. The main inclusion criteria are: age ≥ 18 years, history of chronic HF (irrespective of etiology and/or ejection fraction), admission for acute decompensation, and previous treatment with an oral loop diuretic for at least 1 month before randomization. The 2 coprimary endpoints are changes in body weight and changes in patient-reported dyspnea during hospital admission. Morbidity, mortality, and safety aspects will also be addressed.

Conclusions

CLOROTIC is the first large-scale trial to evaluate whether the addition of a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) to a loop diuretic (furosemide) is a safe and effective strategy for improving congestive symptoms resulting from HF. This trial will provide important information and will therefore have a major impact on treatment strategies and future trials in these patients.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) — volume overload and diuretic management — states that approximately 70% of patients with ADHF have signs and symptoms of elevated ventricular filling pressures, and that loop diuretics such as furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide are the mainstay of treatment for volume overload; HF specialists should select the most appropriate agent, dose, and route, recognize the deleterious effects of excessive diuretic use and select the lowest effective dose, and when resistance occurs must reassess the plan, adjust dose, use synergistic diuretics, and initiate therapies that augment cardiac output and renal blood flow, while balancing chronic neurohumoral blockade against hemodynamic derangements during ADHF.

### Loop diuretic therapy with or without heart failure: impact on prognosis [^1131UPzJ]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is characterized by water and salt retention leading to congestion of the systemic and pulmonary circulation and eventually to symptoms, such as exertional breathlessness, and signs, such as peripheral oedema. Guidelines on HF strongly recommend loop diuretics for managing symptoms and signs of congestion, but loop diuretics can also be used for resistant hypertension or managing congestion due to end-stage kidney disease. For patients with HF, the development of congestion and the need for loop diuretics to manage it are associated with an adverse prognosis. However, many patients are prescribed loop diuretics but are not investigated to exclude cardiac dysfunction; if they relieve symptoms and signs, they may mask a diagnosis of HF.

To find out how many patients are prescribed loop diuretics, how often this is associated with a diagnosis of HF, and whether prescribing loop diuretics is associated with an adverse prognosis, electronic health records were obtained for patients in the Greater Glasgow & Clyde region who either had a diagnosis of coronary or peripheral arterial disease or HF or were prescribed loop diuretics or medicines commonly prescribed for hypertension or ventricular dysfunction.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — diuretic therapy management and risks: Electrolyte imbalances should be treated aggressively and the diuresis continued, and if hypotension or azotemia occurs the physician may elect to slow the rapidity of diuresis, but diuresis should nevertheless be maintained until fluid retention is eliminated, even if this strategy results in mild or moderate decreases in blood pressure or renal function, as long as the patient remains asymptomatic. Once fluid retention has resolved, treatment with the diuretic should be maintained to prevent the recurrence of volume overload, with dose adjustment often accomplished by having patients record their weight each day and make changes in their diuretic dosage if the weight increases or decreases beyond a specified range. Patients may become unresponsive to high doses if they consume large amounts of dietary sodium, are taking agents that can block the effects of diuretics (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including cyclo- oxygenase-2 inhibitors), or have a significant impairment of renal function or perfusion, but diuretic resistance can generally be overcome by the intravenous administration of diuretics (including the use of continuous infusions), the use of 2 or more diuretics in combination (e.g., furosemide and metolazone), or the use of diuretics together with drugs that increase renal blood flow (e.g., positive inotropic agents). Diuretics can cause the depletion of potassium and magnesium and can predispose patients to serious cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in the presence of digitalis therapy, and the risk of electrolyte depletion is markedly enhanced when 2 diuretics are used in combination; concomitant administration of ACEIs alone or in combination with potassium-retaining agents (such as spironolactone) can prevent electrolyte depletion in most patients with HF who are taking a loop diuretic, and when these drugs are prescribed, long-term oral potassium supplementation is generally not needed and may be deleterious. Excessive use of diuretics can decrease blood pressure and impair renal function and exercise tolerance; if there are no signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia are likely to be related to volume depletion and may resolve after a reduction in diuretic dose, whereas the signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia, are likely to reflect worsening HF and a decline in effective peripheral perfusion, which is an ominous clinical scenario and necessitates considering the measures discussed under Stage D HF.

### Diuretics and ultrafiltration in acute decompensated heart failure [^116bdNgE]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Congestion and volume overload are the hallmarks of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), and loop diuretics have historically been the cornerstone of treatment. The demonstrated efficacy of loop diuretics in managing congestion is balanced by the recognized limitations of diuretic resistance, neurohormonal activation, and worsening renal function. However, the recently published DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial suggests that previous concerns about the safety of high-dose diuretics may not be valid. There has been a growing interest in alternative strategies to manage volume retention in ADHF with improved efficacy and safety profiles. Peripheral venovenous ultrafiltration (UF) represents a potentially promising approach to volume management in ADHF. Small studies suggest that UF may allow for more effective fluid removal compared with diuretics, with improved quality of life and reduced rehospitalization rates. However, further investigation is needed to completely define the role of UF in patients with ADHF. This review summarizes available data on the use of both diuretics and UF in ADHF patients and identifies challenges and unresolved questions for each approach.

### Diuretics in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111Wa9xM]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Diuretic drugs act on electrolyte transporters in the kidney to induce diuresis and are often used in chronic kidney disease (CKD), given that nephron loss creates a deficit in the ability to excrete dietary sodium, which promotes an increase in plasma volume. This rise in plasma volume is exacerbated by CKD-induced systemic and intra-renal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, which further limits urinary sodium excretion. In the absence of a compensatory decrease in systemic vascular resistance, increases in plasma volume induced by sodium retention can manifest as a rise in systemic arterial blood pressure. Management of sodium and volume overload in patients with CKD is therefore typically based on restriction of dietary sodium intake and the use of diuretic agents to enhance urinary sodium excretion. Thiazide and thiazide-type diuretics are foundational therapies for the management of hypertension, whereas loop diuretics are often needed for volume overload, which might also require combination therapies. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have an important role in the management of diuretic-resistant volume overload or treatment-resistant hypertension. Additionally, diuretics can be used for the diagnosis of kidney diseases and in the management of hyperkalaemia or hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia.

### The use of diuretics in heart failure with congestion-a position statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^115RN2Sg]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The vast majority of acute heart failure episodes are characterized by increasing symptoms and signs of congestion with volume overload. The goal of therapy in those patients is the relief of congestion through achieving a state of euvolaemia, mainly through the use of diuretic therapy. The appropriate use of diuretics however remains challenging, especially when worsening renal function, diuretic resistance and electrolyte disturbances occur. This position paper focuses on the use of diuretics in heart failure with congestion. The manuscript addresses frequently encountered challenges, such as (i) evaluation of congestion and clinical euvolaemia, (ii) assessment of diuretic response/resistance in the treatment of acute heart failure, (iii) an approach towards stepped pharmacologic diuretic strategies, based upon diuretic response, and (iv) management of common electrolyte disturbances. Recommendations are made in line with available guidelines, evidence and expert opinion.

### Diuretic efficiency of a single dose of subcutaneous versus oral furosemide after heart failure hospitalization across diuretic resistance strata: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^112B1L21]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intravenous (IV) diuretics are the primary treatment strategy in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). However, the response to diuretic therapy varies, with 20–50% of ADHF patients noted to have diuretic resistance (DR), defined as failure to increase urine or sodium output sufficiently in response to loop diuretics.DR is associated with prolonged hospital stays, higher residual congestion at discharge, and an increased risk of readmission and mortality. Thus, there is a critical need for effective management strategies for DR.

Furoscix®, a wearable infusor, delivers subcutaneous (sc) furosemide and is Food and Drug Administration‐approved for at‐home use. The diuretic efficiency of sc furosemide among patients after ADHF hospitalization with varying degrees of DR is not well‐established. Accordingly, we conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effects of single‐dose sc furosemide versus oral furosemide on diuretic efficiency in patients after ADHF hospitalization. We used the recently published and validated BAN‐ADHF score to identify patients with DR. We hypothesized that single‐dose sc furosemide would provide superior diuretic efficiency than oral furosemide in patients with DR.

### Venous excess Doppler ultrasound assessment and loop diuretic efficiency in acute cardiorenal syndrome [^115UrH2n]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study puts yet another stone in the foundation supporting the need to assess the severity of venous congestion and bringing forward the novel potential of identifying diuretic resistance in patients with cardio-renal issues in order to optimize pharmacologic and/or extracorporeal fluid management. From a clinical standpoint, the presence of an elevated VExUS score or low RVSI should alert the clinician to the likelihood of diuretic resistance, and prompt a close follow-up in order to optimize decongestion. Clinicians need to be aware that congestion can be a significant factor in the management of AKI which should be taken into consideration in randomised trials in order to avoid being covertly undermined by patient heterogeneity in terms of venous congestion, which is rarely assessed precisely. We hope that others can use this study as a springboard to the next levels of interventional research to continue to further the science of precision medicine and fine tune the goals of decongestion, as much remains to be discovered.

### Revisiting resistant hypertension in kidney disease [^115tM21t]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Optimal diuretic regimen

Since the challenges imposed by lifestyle modifications including dietary sodium restriction are enormous, the use of diuretics is crucial to achieve volume control and manage resistant hypertension associated CKD. As Dr Scribner said, a patient with uncontrolled hypertension with CKD is volume expanded until proven otherwise; maximizing and optimizing the diuretic regimen for the severity of CKD and proteinuria is an essential next step. Thiazide-like diuretics become less effective when the GFR is less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Although Agarwal et al. reported the beneficial effect of chlorthalidone compared to placebo in patients with stage IV CKD with between-group difference of −10.5 (95% CI, −14.6 to −6.4) mm Hg (P < 0.001) at 12 months. These patients did not meet criteria for resistant hypertension (eligibility included 24-h ambulatory BP > 130/80 mmHg at least on only one antihypertensive drug) and 60% of the participants were on loop diuretics. Thus, the use of thiazide-like diuretics alone in patients with resistant hypertension with advanced CKD remains unexplored and is not recommended. An effective approach to achieve required diuresis and BP control in patients with advanced CKD and proteinuria includes switching to loop diuretics at lower GFRs, escalation of doses of diuretics, or combined diuretics (loop + thiazide-like ± potassium-sparing diuretics). Short-acting loop diuretics should be dosed twice daily; however, many patients skip the evening dose due to inconvenience of nocturia. An emphasis on intake of second dose of short-acting loop diuretic by early evening or once daily torsemide is an alternative to improve adherence. Several academic centres have reported successful outcomes based on the modification of the diuretic regimen in patients with resistant hypertension.

### Diuretics in critically ill patients: a narrative review of their mechanisms and applications [^1141NUCk]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Diuretics remain the cornerstone therapy of critically ill patients with volume overload as a result of cardiac failure, acute kidney injury or aggressive fluid resuscitation. This review summarises the principles of applied renal physiology, describing the mechanisms of action, the clinical applications, and the adverse effects of commonly used diuretics during critical illness. Loop diuretics, and in particular furosemide, remain the most popular, despite evidence of any effect on mortality or, indeed, on the need for renal replacement therapy. The efficacy of loop diuretics after administration depends on three factors. Firstly, the tubular concentration of the diuretic: continuous infusion of furosemide seems to provide a higher and more stable tubular concentration of furosemide with respect to bolus injection. Secondly, the interaction with albumin both in the plasma and in the renal tubule: despite a strong physiological rationale supporting this approach, albumin supplementation in hypoalbuminaemic patients does not seem to result in a higher diuretic efficacy. Thirdly, diuretic resistance, which can be addressed by optimising loop diuretic dose and by using combination therapy with other agents, including thiazides or thiazide-like diuretics or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. These drugs constitute a useful adjunct to overcome loop diuretic resistance. Other agents such as distal potassium-sparing diuretics and osmotic diuretics can also be considered. The latter have been used successfully in hypokalaemia, rhabdomyolysis-associated acute kidney injury or to prevent ischaemia-reperfusion injury in kidney transplantation. Finally, this review provides the basic concepts of the interplay between acid-base equilibrium and diuretic therapy.

### Protocolized natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy in acute heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112FPXwz]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 3 RCTs and 2 observational studies encompassing 933 patients with AHF, we compared natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy with SOC. Our main findings were: (1) protocolized diuretic therapy significantly increased natriuresis and diuresis after 2 days with a trend toward greater weight loss; (2) no significant differences were observed between groups in length of hospital stay, all-cause mortality, or HF rehospitalization; and (3) protocolized therapy demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no increased risk of hypokalemia or hypotension and a reduced incidence of serum creatinine doubling.

Management of fluid overload is the key goal during AHF. Loop diuretics are the number one recommended therapy by American and European guidelines. However, one-third of the patients with AHF are diuretic-resistant and need an increased medication dose to have an efficient diuresis. Previous monitoring tools have low accuracy in determining an appropriate treatment and rely on clinical signs and measurements that often take longer to obtain. Sodium natriuresis has emerged as an early tool to determine diuresis and individualize treatment for each patient. Nevertheless, its efficacy and efficiency in clinical practice remain uncertain compared to standard management.

Natriuresis is one of the most important outcomes to assess during loop diuretic therapy, as a positive sodium balance is associated with higher mortality rates. Our pooled analysis demonstrated a 30% higher GM of natriuresis in patients under the protocol after 48 h. Diuresis showed a similar trend, with a 21% higher GM of urinary volume in the intervention group. This may be explained by the higher doses of loop diuretics administered in patients under the protocol compared to those in SOC, as the dose was individually adjusted according to urinary sodium. This approach appears particularly beneficial for patients with previous use of loop diuretics, as they tend to demonstrate greater resistance to diuretics. However, the EASY-HF and PUSH-AHF trials were composed primarily of diuretic-naive patients, and also demonstrated an improved natriuresis when using the protocol, with no significant difference between diuretic-naive and previously treated with diuretics. Moreover, the PUSH-AHF showed that differences in natriuresis and diuresis between the intervention and control groups were most pronounced during the first 24 h, likely due to protocol cessation after 36 h. These findings suggest that protocol-guided diuretic therapy may be effective in rapidly identifying and adjusting to the optimal loop diuretic dose, increasing diuresis and natriuresis using an individualized approach.

### Evaluation and management of the patient with difficult-to-control or resistant hypertension [^113Dokp9]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

High blood pressure is often difficult to control. Resistant hypertension is blood pressure above goal despite adherence to a combination of at least three antihypertensive medications of different classes, optimally dosed and usually including a diuretic. The approach to blood pressure that is apparently difficult to control begins with an assessment of the patient's adherence to the management plan, including lifestyle modifications and medications. White-coat hypertension may need to be ruled out. Suboptimal therapy is the most common reason for failure to reach the blood pressure goal. Once-daily fixed-dose combination pills may improve control through the synergism of antihypertensive agents from different classes and improved adherence. Truly drug-resistant hypertension is commonly caused by chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, or hyperaldosteronism, all of which can lead to fluid retention. Higher doses of diuretics (or a change to a loop diuretic) are usually needed. Other strategies include adding an alpha blocker, alpha-beta blocker, clonidine, or an aldosterone antagonist (e.g., spironolactone). Particularly in patients with diabetes or renal disease, combining a long-acting nondihydropyridine with a dihydropyridine calcium channel. blocker can also be considered. Obesity, heavy alcohol intake, high levels of dietary sodium, and interfering substances (especially nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) contribute to hypertension that is resistant or difficult to control.

### Diuretic treatment in heart failure [^115ZNbty]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diuretic treatment in heart failure:

- **Definition**: Diuretic treatment in HF is used to promote renal sodium and water excretion, thereby reducing intravascular congestion, pulmonary edema, and elevated filling pressures. Loop diuretics such as furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide are the cornerstone of therapy, with thiazide or potassium-sparing diuretics added for additional effect when needed. The primary goal is to achieve rapid symptomatic relief and restoration of euvolemia while avoiding excessive volume loss, renal dysfunction, or electrolyte imbalance.
- **Pathophysiology**: In HF, neurohormonal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems causes sodium and water retention, leading to increased venous pressures and pulmonary or systemic congestion. Diuretics counteract these effects by lowering preload and reducing ventricular filling pressures, which alleviates dyspnea and edema. However, excessive diuresis can decrease renal perfusion and stimulate further neurohormonal activation, diminishing long-term efficacy.
- **Disease course**: Diuretic therapy provides rapid improvement in symptoms, often within hours of initiation, particularly in acute decompensated HF. Treatment usually begins with intravenous loop diuretics, titrated according to urine output, weight reduction, and renal function. Thiazide-type diuretics may be combined with loop agents in cases of diuretic resistance. Once euvolemia is achieved, therapy is transitioned to the lowest effective oral dose while guideline-directed agents for HF are optimized.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Diuretic therapy is recommended in patients with HF and fluid retention to relieve congestion, improve symptoms, enhance exercise capacity, and reduce the risk of hospital readmission. In HFrEF, early and effective decongestion improves QoL and functional status, although diuretics do not confer a direct survival benefit. Prompt administration in acute HF may shorten hospitalization and lower in-hospital mortality, provided the diagnosis of volume overload is certain. Combination therapy with a thiazide such as metolazone is reserved for patients unresponsive to high-dose loop diuretics to minimize electrolyte disturbances and renal dysfunction.

### Diuretic strategies for loop diuretic resistance in acute heart Failure: the 3T trial [^1125d1rk]. JACC: Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study compared combination diuretic strategies in acute heart failure (AHF) complicated by diuretic resistance (DR).

Background

Combination diuretic regimens to overcome loop DR are commonly used but with limited evidence.

Methods

This study was a randomized, double-blinded trial in 60 patients hospitalized with AHF and intravenous (IV) loop DR. Patients were randomized to oral metolazone, IV chlorothiazide, or tolvaptan therapy. All patients received concomitant high-dose IV infusions of furosemide. The primary outcome was 48-h weight loss.

Results

The cohort exhibited DR prior to enrollment, producing 1,188 ± 476 mL of urine in 12 h during high-dose loop diuretic therapy (IV furosemide: 612 ± 439 mg/day). All 3 interventions significantly improved diuretic efficacy (p < 0.001). Compared to metolazone (4.6 ± 2.7 kg), neither IV chlorothiazide (5.8 ± 2.7 kg; 1.2 kg [95% confidence interval (CI)]: -2.9 to 0.6; p = 0.292) nor tolvaptan (4.1 ± 3.3 kg; 0.5 kg [95% CI: -1.5 to 2.4; p = 0.456) resulted in more weight loss at 48 h. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) cumulative urine output increased significantly and did not differ among those receiving metolazone (7.78 [IQR: 6.59 to 10.10] l) and chlorothiazide (8.77 [IQR: 7.37 to 10.86] l; p = 0.245) or tolvaptan (9.70 [IQR: 6.36 to 13.81] l; p = 0.160). Serum sodium decreased less with tolvaptan than with metolazone (+4 ± 5 vs. -1 ± 3 mEq/l; p = 0.001), but 48-h spot urine sodium was lower with tolvaptan (58 ± 25 mmol/l) than with metolazone (104 ± 16 mmol/l; p = 0.002) and with chlorothiazide (117 ± 14 mmol/l; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In this moderately sized DR trial, weight loss was excellent with the addition of metolazone, IV chlorothiazide, or tolvaptan to loop diuretics, without a detectable between-group difference.

### Resistant hypertension [^115S19ZY]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Resistant hypertension (RH) is defined as blood pressure above a goal despite adherence to at least 3 optimally dosed antihypertensive medications of different classes, one of which is a diuretic. Evaluation of possible RH begins with an assessment of adherence to medications. The white-coat effect should be ruled out by out-of-office blood pressure monitoring. Obesity, heavy alcohol intake, and interfering substances all contribute to RH. Dietary sodium restriction is an important part of management. RH may be secondary to problems such as renal disease, obstructive sleep apnea, or aldosteronism, and testing for these conditions should be considered. Adequate diuretic treatment is a key part of therapy. Chlorthalidone is more effective than hydrochlorothiazide in reducing blood pressure because it is more potent and lasts longer. In addition, it may reduce cardiovascular events to a greater extent than hydrochlorothiazide. When glomerular filtration rate is < 30 mL/min, a loop diuretic usually is needed. The addition of spironolactone, with careful attention to potassium levels, is an evidence-based strategy for the treatment of RH. Other strategies include use of a vasodilating β-blocker, adding a long-acting nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, or adding clonidine. When blood pressure is not coming under control despite 4 or 5 agents, referral to a hypertension specialist may be warranted.

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^112LrgsS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The retention of sodium and water and consequential fluid accumulation in the extracellular compartment is a cardinal feature of heart failure (HF), irrespective of the left ventricular ejection fraction. The expansion of the extracellular volume, manifesting as volume overload, represents a leading cause for HF hospitalization, with severity of volume overload associated with adverse HF outcomes. Alleviating volume expansion through the use of loop diuretics is a cornerstone of HF treatment. However, achieving decongestion represents a longstanding challenge due to multiple physiological adaptations that favour the retention of sodium, with persistent fluid overload despite increasing diuretic dosing (i.e. diuretic resistance) representing a cardinal sign of worsening HF. Indeed, low urine output in response to loop diuretics or the need for repeated short-term intravenous administration of loop diuretics, are both associated with mortality in the acute HF setting. Furthermore, high diuretic dose requirements or dose escalation in the chronic HF setting are associated with hospitalization.

Accordingly, there is growing interest in understanding the diuretic and natriuretic properties of contemporary medical therapies such as sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists, and their roles in managing volume overload in HF, especially as adjuncts to loop diuretic therapy. The current review aims to summarize existing physiological and clinical evidence on the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, CA inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and MR antagonists in managing HF and their role as adjunctive diuretic agents in the acute and chronic setting.

Proximal tubular diuretics

Under normal physiological conditions, the proximal tubule is responsible for two-thirds of sodium reabsorption, principally mediated through the sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-3 (NHE3) and the sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) (Fig. 1). Neurohormonal activation, including increased plasma levels of norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and vasopressin, characterizes an early physiological manifestation contributing to sodium and bicarbonate (HCO 3) retention in HF by upregulating SGLT2, Na-HCO 3, and NHE3 activity in the proximal tubule. Importantly, increased proximal tubular reabsorption leads to decreased downstream sodium delivery thereby influencing the effectiveness of loop diuretics.

### Expanding the role of PoCUS in tailoring diuretic strategies for congestion management in critical care [^114YqeGJ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Ostermann et al. emphasize the need for careful monitoring of diuretic strategies to balance efficacy and safety. While loop diuretics remain the cornerstone of therapy, they face limitations, including resistance to venous congestion or hypovolemia. PoCUS can help tailor diuretic therapy to specific congestion phenotypes and, combined with urine biomarkers, differentiate hemodynamic changes or permissive AKI from true tubular damage in patients with rising serum creatinine during decongestion. In such cases, maintaining or increasing diuretics may be justified, as the rise in serum creatinine often reflects glomerular hemodynamic changes rather than tubular injury. PoCUS also aids in monitoring hemodynamic improvements and guides adjunctive treatments such as albumin for hypoalbuminemia or hypertonic saline for hyponatremia.

Integrating advanced monitoring tools like PoCUS with tailored diuretic strategies marks a significant step forward in critical care. By providing real-time, actionable insights into congestion phenotypes, PoCUS enhances both the precision and safety of fluid management. Moving forward, research should prioritize standardizing training protocols, refining clinical guidelines, and evaluating cost-effectiveness to ensure broad accessibility and optimal implementation across diverse clinical settings.

Conclusions

In hospitalized patients with HF and loop diuretic resistance, we did not prove that dapagliflozin was more effective at relieving congestion than metolazone. Patients assigned to dapagliflozin received a larger cumulative dose of furosemide but experienced less biochemical upset than those assigned to metolazone.

### Loop diuretics in acute heart failure: beyond the decongestive relief for the kidney [^113incF6]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Fig. 2
Effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic overdrive in different kidney sites

To avoid these pitfalls, many strategies have been proposed. The so-called breaking phenomena of loop diuretic resistance could in theory be overcome by continuous infusion. Sequential nephron blockade includes the contemporary use of loop diuretics together with thiazides and aldosterone antagonists in order to obtain a stepwise impairment of sodium reabsorption at multiple points along the nephron. This strategy is prone to increased risks of hypoperfusion, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia. Lastly, ultrafiltration of isotonic fluid could in theory remove fluid at a rate to match plasma refill without causing volume contraction or activation of neurohormonal systems. This method may be beneficial in congestive patients who are predicted to become diuretic-resistant. Another optional strategy during early phases of AHF management is the non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy. Although the potential beneficial role of the current treatment is still under debate, it is accepted for patients with low systolic pressure values to improve respiratory gas exchanges. Prior studies have been limited to patients with cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema and have provided conflicting results: data from the ADHERE registry documented a reduced mortality rate with respect to patients with pulmonary edema submitted to endotracheal intubation together with reduced length of hospital stay. More recently, a cross-sectional multicenter study confirmed previous findings underlying some difference in the use and application of modalities. Finally, the NIV treatment seems to have beneficial effects, reducing the need for vasoactive and inotropic therapies. All of these data suggest that NIV should be a reasonable treatment option in some specific AHF pictures characterized by systemic hypoperfusion and low oxygenation status. NIV could potentially favor the reduction of high dosage loop diuretic administration, avoiding further decrease in blood pressure, although specific studies appear mandatory to clarify the specific classes which deserve this treatment.

6. Details of Loop Diuretic Status at Study Follow-up as Acquired via the DCRI Call Center Nonauthor Collaborator Group. TRANSFORM-HF Investigators. In terms of loop diuretic discontinuation, 2. 8% of patients were not discharged taking any loop diuretic. At 30 days and 6 months, 7. 0% and
9. 5% were not taking any loop diuretic, respectively. eTable 6 in Supplement 3 provides details of follow-up loop diuretic status. At index hospitalization discharge, the mean loop diuretic dose in furosemide equivalents was 79. 3 mg and was similar in both groups for those individuals prescribed the assigned loop diuretic.

At 1 month, in those prescribed the assigned loop diuretic, the mean dose was 73. 1 mg, with a lower dose in the furosemide group than the torsemide group. Crossover and loop diuretic discontinuation may have diminished the ability to distinguish the hypothesized between-group difference. Loop diuretics were prescribed as part of the routine strategy of care in the trial with mechanisms in place to support adherence to the randomized therapy, yet crossover was observed. Higher crossover in the torsemide group than furosemide group may relate to reversion to prior loop diuretic, differences in cost between the agents, patient or clinician preference, or perceived adverse effects. There were significant differences in the loop diuretic dosing with regard to furosemide equivalents during follow-up.

While dosing was similar at index hospital discharge, in patients with dosing data available at 1 month, dose was 10% to 15% greater in the torsemide than furosemide group for participants continuing to take the randomized therapy.

Therapy for HFpEF

The goals of therapy for patients with HFpEF are to reduce symptoms, improve functional status and lower the risk of hospital admission.

Diuretics: the cornerstone of therapy

Patients with HFpEF and documented volume overload should be offered diuretic therapy. Therapy is initiated with loop diuretics, type and dose depending on the severity of volume overload. For those patients with diuretic resistance, sequential nephron blockade can be achieved using thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), the latter of these has been included in the 2022 AHA HF guidelines with class 2b level of recommendation for treatment of HFpEF.

Treating underlying comorbidities

Up until 2022, the core of therapeutic recommendations in HFpEF was a focus on delivering therapy for underlying comorbidity and treating modifiable HF risk factors. Hypertension, AF, CAD, hyperlipidaemia, obesity, anaemia, DM, CKD and sleep apnoea are conditions that are frequently associated with HFpEF. There is no evidence for HFpEF-specific management of these conditions.

Even though multiple randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using ACE inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), MRAs, beta blockers and angiotensin–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) in patients with HFpEF did not show mortality benefit or reduction in hospitalisation, their effects on the course of HFpEF were shown in subgroup analyses. Therefore, in selected patients with HFpEF, MRAs, ARBs and ARNIs may be considered to decrease hospitalisations, particularly among patients with LVEF on the lower end of this spectrum, and their use is given a class 2b recommendation in 2022 HF guidelines from AHA/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Failure Society of America(HFSA).

In general, long-acting drugs are to be preferred, as they provide smoother BP control and are less affected by missed doses, as are agents with robust efficacy data. Under-dosing is particularly common with ACE-I/ARB, as very low doses are available for initial treatment in people with heart failure. Switching from thiazide to thiazide-like diuretic and from indapamide to chlorthalidone may be useful in people with RH and renal impairment, if eGFR > 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2, as chlortalidone is the only thiazide-like diuretic to demonstrate efficacy in people with advanced CKD. In subjects with CKD, particularly in cases of signs or symptoms suggestive of fluid retention, a long-acting loop diuretic such as torsemide may be considered in addition or instead of a conventional thiazide-like agent (Fig. 4).

### Fluid overload in the ICU: evaluation and management [^112pE19F]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Several complications like congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, delayed wound healing, tissue breakdown, and impaired bowel function are associated with fluid overload. Fluid overload has also been related to increased mortality. The optimal assessment of volume status in critically ill patients is of vital importance particularly during the early management of these patients. One key aspect of fluid overload management is to maintain hemodynamic stability and optimize organ function. Loop diuretics are frequently used as the initial therapy to treat critically ill patients with fluid overload; nevertheless, diuretics have limited effectiveness due to several factors such as underlying acute kidney injury that contribute to diuretic resistance. Renal replacement therapies are often required for optimal volume management in critically ill patients with fluid overload. In this setting, successful volume management depends on an accurate estimation of patients' fluid status, an adequate understanding of the principles of fluid overload treatment with ultrafiltration, and clear treatment goals.

### Outcomes associated with a strategy of adjuvant metolazone or high-dose loop diuretics in acute decompensated heart failure: a propensity analysis [^114CJa7x]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The principal finding of this study is that in a large and diverse real‐world population, using statistical methodology to reduce the influence of confounding by indication, adjuvant metolazone use during ADHF was independently and strongly associated with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, WRF, and decreased long‐term survival. This risk associated with metolazone appeared to be largely mediated through these in‐hospital acute adverse events. However, when the use of HDLDs were subjected to the same analytic methodology, there was no risk for hyponatremia, hypokalemia, or mortality. In light of the existing randomized trial data to support the safety of aggressive loop diuretic dosing, 23 and the currently presented findings suggesting a mortality disadvantage with metolazone as well as an increased risk of electrolyte disturbances and WRF, routine escalation of loop diuretic doses may be the preferred approach for the management of ADHF until adequately powered trials are available to more definitively inform this question.

The primary treatment for ADHF is intravenous loop diuretic, and in most patients, this therapy at modest doses is adequate to improve symptoms. 24 However, compensatory sodium reabsorption that occurs in the distal convoluted tubule, the site of action of thiazide diuretics, is an important cause for diuretic resistance. 25 The addition of a thiazide or thiazide‐like diuretic (ie, metolazone) to loop diuretics, often referred to as sequential nephron blockade, inhibits compensatory distal tubular sodium reabsorption, thereby enhancing natriuresis. 26 Furthermore, unlike loop diuretics, thiazides do not directly stimulate renin secretion at the macula densa and therefore do not activate the renin angiotensin aldosterone system to the same extent. 27 Physiologically this seems like an attractive approach to decongestion, one that is supported in the current heart failure practice guidelines, despite no randomized trials comparing combination diuretic therapy with a thiazide to loop diuretics alone. 4 In fact, most studies examining metolazone use in HF are small, single‐center retrospective analyses without a control arm, published over 25 years ago, that focused on end points like urinary volume and sodium concentration as opposed to clinical outcomes. 8, 10, 28, 29 Nevertheless, the cumulative existing evidence in only 350 patients does illustrate that metolazone produces a 3‐fold increase in natriuresis, increases weight loss and improves diuresis in patients who were previously not suitable for hospital discharge. 7, 8, 9, 10, 28, 29, 30

KDIGO 2022 — Nephrotic syndrome (NS) diuretic approach emphasizes diet and combination therapy, noting diuretics are "accompanied by moderate dietary sodium restriction (1.5–2 g/d or 60–90 mmol/d of sodium)", that "Loop diuretics are considered first-line in treating nephrotic edema, and twice daily administration is usually preferred", and that combining a loop with a thiazide-like diuretic "can be an effective oral regimen to overcome diuretic resistance, by blocking sodium reabsorption at several sites within the nephron"; "It is recommended to give the thiazide diuretic 2–5 hours prior to loop diuretic infusion for peak drug levels, and to maximize the blockade of distal sodium reabsorption". Additional options and cautions include "Amiloride blocks the epithelial sodium channel and may be a potentially useful add-on therapy for edema/hypertension and hypokalemia management in NS. The use of amiloride has not been validated in RCTs", "Acetazolamide is a weaker diuretic, but as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, it may be helpful if severe metabolic alkalosis is present", and if oral therapy fails, "it is reasonable to transition to intravenous loop diuretics", while "Avoid administration of loop diuretics as a rapid intravenous 'push', as toxicity can occur (hearing loss and/or tinnitus). The administration of a loop diuretic as a continuous infusion may mitigate the toxic effects and provide sustained diuretic excretion".

Therapies for decongestion

Prompt recognition of clinical congestion in worsening HF (Table 2) and complete decongestion should be priorities during hospitalization. Residual congestion at discharge is associated with an increased risk of readmission and death. As HF advances, patients may develop resistance to loop diuretics, requiring high-dose intravenous (IV) boluses, infusions, or a combination of different diuretics. Diuretic intensification with an IV formulation that is 2.5 times the equivalent oral dose is associated with improved net diuresis and symptom relief, but diuretic responsiveness may vary. Spot urine sodium levels less than 50 to 70 mmol/L 2 hours following IV diuretics may indicate inadequate natriuresis or diuretic resistance, suggesting a need to increase the diuretic dose. A natriuresis-guided diuretic strategy in the PUSH-AHF (Pragmatic Urinary Sodium-based algoritHm in Acute Heart Failure) randomized controlled trial (RCT) improved mean 24-hour urine sodium excretion compared with standard of care without increased adverse effects. Hemoconcentration can be another sign of diuretic effect, although it is not a target for decongestion. While associated with worsening kidney function, hemoconcentration is associated with a lower risk of mortality at 180 days.

Table 2
Parameters of Congestion in HF

Loop diuretics are the mainstay of decongestion therapy. They should be titrated to the degree of congestion and maintained at the lowest effective dose required to achieve euvolemia quickly while avoiding volume depletion or metabolic derangements. Among loop diuretics, the TRANSFORM-HF (ToRsemide compArisoN With furoSemide FOR Management of Heart Failure) RCT tested a strategy of torsemide vs oral furosemide for decongestion among hospitalized patients at a frequency and dosage determined by the treating clinician. There was no difference in the primary outcome of mortality across LVEF categories in patients recently facing HHF after a median of 17.4 months follow up; the effect of torsemide on decongestion parameters was not evaluated. Either loop diuretic remains a viable option for patients at risk for congestion following discharge.

### Ultrafiltration for acute heart failure [^111NgRwT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pharmacotherapies such as loop diuretics are the cornerstone treatment for acute heart failure (AHF), but resistance and poor response can occur. Ultrafiltration (UF) is an alternative therapy to reduce congestion, however its benefits, efficacy and safety are unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of UF compared to diuretic therapy on clinical outcomes such as mortality and rehospitalisation rates.

Search Methods

We undertook a systematic search in June 2021 of the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science CPCI-S and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched the WHO ICTRP platform in October 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared UF to diuretics in adults with AHF.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for any further information, and language interpreters to translate texts. We assessed risk of bias in included studies using Risk of Bias 2 (RoB2) tool and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 14 trials involving 1190 people. We included people who had clinical signs of acute hypervolaemia. We excluded critically unwell people such as those with ischaemia or haemodynamic instability. Mean age ranged from 57.5 to 75 years, and the setting was a mix of single and multi-centre. Two trials researched UF as a complimentary therapy to diuretics, while the remaining trials withheld diuretic use during UF. There was high risk of bias in some studies, particularly with deviations from the intended protocols from high cross-overs as well as missing outcome data for long-term follow-up. We are uncertain about the effect of UF on all-cause mortality at 30 days or less (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 2.85; 3 studies, 286 participants; very low-certainty evidence). UF may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality at the longest available follow-up (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.36; 9 studies, 987 participants; low-certainty evidence). UF may reduce all-cause rehospitalisation at 30 days or less (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.09; 3 studies, 337 participants; low-certainty evidence). UF may slightly reduce all-cause rehospitalisation at longest available follow-up (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.05; 6 studies, 612 participants; low-certainty evidence). UF may reduce heart failure-related rehospitalisation at 30 days or less (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.04; 2 studies, 395 participants; low-certainty evidence). UF probably reduces heart failure-related rehospitalisation at longest available follow-up, with a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial effect (NNTB) of 10 (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.90; 4 studies, 636 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies measured need for mechanical ventilation. UF may have little or no effect on serum creatinine change at 30 days since discharge (mean difference (MD) 14%, 95% CI -12% to 40%; 1 study, 221 participants; low-certainty evidence). UF may increase the risk of new initiation of renal replacement therapy at longest available follow-up (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.42 to 4.75; 4 studies, 332 participants; low-certainty evidence). There is an uncertain effect of UF on the risk of complications from central line insertion in hospital (RR 4.16, 95% CI 1.30 to 13.30; 6 studies, 779 participants; very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review summarises the latest evidence on UF in AHF. Moderate-certainty evidence shows UF probably reduces heart failure-related rehospitalisation in the long term, with an NNTB of 10. UF may reduce all-cause rehospitalisation at 30 days or less and at longest available follow-up. The effect of UF on all-cause mortality at 30 days or less is unclear, and it may have little effect on all-cause mortality in the long-term. While UF may have little or no effect on serum creatinine change at 30 days, it may increase the risk of new initiation of renal replacement therapy in the long term. The effect on complications from central line insertion is unclear. There is insufficient evidence to determine the true impact of UF on AHF. Future research should evaluate UF as an adjunct therapy, focusing on outcomes such as heart failure-related rehospitalisation, cardiac mortality and renal outcomes at medium- to long-term follow-up.

International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation — Recommendations for pharmacologic management of patients with compensated heart failure (Class I) state that in severe heart failure with fluid retention, loop diuretics should be used and adjusted to achieve symptom control and/or euvolemia (Level of Evidence: C). In diuretic resistance, precipitating factors or alternative causes should be investigated and excluded (Level of Evidence: C), and diuretic resistance should be treated with an increase in dose or frequency of loop diuretics, change to a loop with better bioavailability, addition of a thiazide diuretic, or intravenous administration (bolus or continuous infusion) of a loop diuretic (Level of Evidence: C). All neurohormonal antagonists used in patients with heart failure with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be those shown to be effective in clinical trials and used at maximally tolerated or target dosages (Level of Evidence: A). All patients with heart failure and low LVEF should have a trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors unless there are unequivocal contraindications (Level of Evidence: A), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should be used as an alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors due to cough or angioedema (Level of Evidence: A). All patients with heart failure and low LVEF should have a trial of β-blockers unless there are unequivocal contraindications (Level of Evidence: A). In patients with atrial fibrillation, control of the heart rate should be done and conversion may be performed (Level of Evidence: C). Patients with heart failure and low LVEF should be anti-coagulated with warfarin if they have a history of an embolic event, atrial fibrillation or evidence of a new left ventricular (LV) thrombus (Level of Evidence: C). In carefully selected advanced heart failure patients with low LVEF, aldosterone antagonists should be added to maximally tolerated ACE inhibitors and β-blockers; however, this approach requires frequent monitoring of serum potassium and renal function (Level of Evidence: B).

Selection of antihypertensive agents in resistant hypertension

According to American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) 2017, International Society of Hypertension (ISH) 2020 and European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2023 Guidelines, the preferred antihypertensive drug treatment of resistant hypertension should at least include the following antihypertensive classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium antagonist (= calcium channel blocker), and thiazide diuretics. The steps recommended to apply if triple therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, and diuretic) fails to achieve optimal BP are the following (Figure 1):

- Use of thiazide-like rather than thiazide diuretics, and initiation of loop diuretics for estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or clinical volume overload.
- Add a low dose of spironolactone as the 4th line agent in patients whose serum potassium is < 4.5 mmol/l and whose estimated glomerular filtration rate is > 45 ml/min/1.73m 2 to achieve BP targets.
- If spironolactone is contraindicated or not tolerated, amiloride, beta-blocker, clonidine, doxazosin, and eplerenone are alternatives, or any available antihypertensive class not already in use.

### Genotype-blinded trial of ambulatory blood pressure response to torasemide [^1149GxzW]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of regularly updated international treatment guidelines for hypertension management, considerable clinical uncertainty persists about the optimal management of individuals with uncontrolled or treatment-resistant hypertension. Diuretics have long been established as cornerstone agents in the management of hypertension, with robust evidence supporting their efficacy in reducing BP and lowering cardiovascular risk. Thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics have been extensively studied and are recommended as first-line therapy in various international guidelines due to their effectiveness, low cost, and favorable outcomes in large-scale clinical trials. While there is consensus that resistant hypertension stems from excessive sodium retention and further diuretic therapy may be effective, the superiority of 1 diuretic type over another remains unstudied, with existing evidence limited to diuretics targeting the distal nephron (spironolactone). Loop diuretics, such as furosemide and torasemide, are commonly used in the management of fluid overload conditions like heart failure, renal failure, and cirrhosis but are less frequently prescribed for hypertension due to concerns about electrolyte disturbances and adverse metabolic effects.

### Loop diuretic therapy with or without heart failure: impact on prognosis [^115NQU5Y]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

About half of patients had been hospitalized in the year before initiation of loop diuretics, and many others attended hospital outpatients, usually for non-cardiovascular conditions. A few patients treated with loop diuretics had end-stage kidney disease, and some will have received loop diuretics for the treatment of resistant hypertension, but neither indication for loop diuretics appeared to account for their widespread use. On general medical and surgical wards, loop diuretics may have been initiated for symptoms and signs of HF, but appropriate investigations were not done or not recorded in patients' medical records. When loop diuretics are listed as hospital discharge medications, primary care physicians may automatically repeat the prescription, trusting that their hospital colleagues have investigated appropriately. Patients admitted with, e.g. respiratory infections, may receive both antibiotics and loop diuretics due to diagnostic uncertainty. Even if antibiotics are responsible for the success of treatment, loop diuretics may be continued long term because no one decided to stop them.

### Beyond diuretics: management of volume overload in acute heart failure syndromes [^111r2iY7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Diuretics are an established foundation of therapy for patients with chronic heart failure (HF) as well as for those hospitalized for treatment of acute HF syndromes. Despite the accepted use of diuretics in acute HF syndromes, treatment patterns with diuretics vary widely, and there are no data from randomized studies on the benefit of diuretics on morbidity or mortality in patients hospitalized with acute HF syndromes. Additional pharmacologic therapies that complement or replace diuretics in this setting, especially in patients with diuretic resistance, include positive inotropes, nitrovasodilators, and natriuretic peptides, but data are likewise lacking on important clinical outcomes. Ultrafiltration has also been used as a nonpharmacologic strategy to treat patients with acute HF syndromes who exhibit resistance to diuretics. Effective monitoring of volume status with newer modalities may allow more selective use of diuretics and diuretic-like modalities, but additional randomized trial data are clearly needed to establish ideal strategies to promote volume removal in acute HF syndromes.

Discussion

The primary treatment goal of patients admitted with acute HF is achieving euvolaemia with the use of loop diuretics. Unfortunately, a large number of patients with acute HF show insufficient response to diuretics, resulting in residual congestion and poor outcomes, such as high rates of HF rehospitalizations. Natriuresis is a sensitive marker of response to loop diuretic therapy and allows for early identification of patients with insufficient diuretic response. Urinary sodium therefore has all the characteristics required for a marker that can be used to actively assess diuretic response and to consequently guide decongestive treatment, using a stepwise approach. The PUSH‐AHF is the first trial to assess the effect of natriuresis‐guided enhanced diuretic therapy compared with standard of care on total natriuresis and clinical outcomes. If the PUSH‐AHF is able to show superiority of natriuresis‐guided therapy over standard of care, this will pave the way for more individualized diuretic therapy in patients with acute HF.

Current treatment of patients with acute heart failure and the rationale for the enhanced diuretic treatment protocol

Acute HF is characterized by signs and symptoms due to redistribution and excessive fluid retention, for which loop diuretics are the first and only guideline‐recommended treatment. Loop diuretics inhibit the sodium–chloride–potassium co‐transporter in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, resulting in sodium and chloride excretion with concomitant water excretion. Several mechanisms, such as impaired resorption, neurohormonal activation and compensatory proximal and distal tubular sodium reabsorption, contribute to loop diuretic resistance in patients with acute HF. Despite it being well known that higher diuretic doses are required in patients with HF, due to the above described mechanisms, increasing diuretic doses will over time become less effective. Insufficient response to diuretics is therefore common and a large number of patients are discharged with residual congestion after an admission for acute HF. Yet, evidence‐based data on dosing and adjustment of loop diuretics in acute HF are currently lacking. The Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation (DOSE) trial failed to show a benefit of high doses of loop diuretics compared with low‐dose loop diuretics using a randomized, double‐blind approach. A possible explanation of the neutral results of the DOSE study might be due to the enrolment and randomization of patients with both a good and an insufficient diuretic response whereas no additional effect of higher doses is expected in patients with a good diuretic response. In contrast, in patients with an insufficient diuretic response, intensification of the diuretic treatment could lead to improved decongestion and consequent better outcomes.

Thiazide, thiazide-like diuretics, and loop diuretics

Chlorthalidone, a thiazide-like diuretic, is often used to lower BP and may help mitigate the risk of hyperkalaemia in patients with CKD. In the CLICK trial including 160 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and Stage 4 CKD, the addition of chlorthalidone 12.5 mg/day vs placebo lowered 24-h ambulatory systolic BP by 10–14 mmHg and decreased albuminuria levels over 12 weeks. However, chlorthalidone also significantly increased plasma renin and aldosterone levels, and co-administration of MRAs has been suggested. Switching from hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide, to chlorthalidone resulted in additional BP reduction in several studies. However, in a trial of 13 523 hypertensive patients on hydrochlorothiazide, the rates of primary CV outcomes and acute kidney injury-related hospitalizations were similar between those who continued hydrochlorothiazide and those switched to chlorothiazide.

Furthermore, in patients with GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, an adequately up-titrated loop diuretic is an option for managing TRH. Torsemide, a long-acting loop diuretic, inhibited aldosterone secretion by adrenal cells in a preclinical studyand may be preferable to shorter-acting agents such as bumetanide or furosemide.

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) diuretic-resistant edema — albumin use and adjunctive measures: It may be reasonable to consider intravenous albumin in the diuretic‑resistant patient who fails to respond to maximal dosing and whose serum albumin is < 2.0 g/dl (20 g/L); albumin can be administered by premixing with a loop diuretic, or by giving 25–50 g albumin solution 30–60 minutes prior to the intravenous loop diuretic. There is little evidence that intravenous albumin provides long‑term benefit and any effect on plasma albumin will be transient; occasionally, mechanical ultrafiltration and/or hemodialysis are required for resistant edema, especially if the GN is accompanied by acute kidney injury. Potassium‑sparing diuretics such as spironolactone or amiloride are helpful and may have additive natriuretic effects with thiazides or loop‑acting diuretics. Water restriction is usually not necessary in NS edema management but may be necessary in patients who develop hyponatremia.

ABSTRACT

Volume overload represents a hallmark clinical feature linked to the development and progression of heart failure (HF). Alleviating signs and symptoms of volume overload represents a foundational HF treatment target that is achieved using loop diuretics in the acute and chronic setting. Recent work has provided evidence to support guideline-directed medical therapies, such as sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists, as important adjunct diuretics that may act synergistically when used with background loop diuretics in people with chronic HF. Furthermore, there is growing interest in understanding the role of SGLT2 inhibitors, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and MR antagonists in treating volume overload in patients hospitalized for acute HF, particularly in the setting of loop diuretic resistance. Thus, the current review demonstrates that: (i) SGLT2 inhibitors and MR antagonists confer long-term cardioprotection in chronic HF patients but it is unclear whether natriuresis or diuresis represents the primary mechanisms for this benefit, (ii) SGLT2 inhibitors, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and thiazide diuretics increase natriuresis in the acute HF setting, but implications on long-term outcomes remain unclear and warrants further investigation, and (iii) a multi-nephron segment approach, using agents that act on distinct segments of the nephron, potentiate diuresis to alleviate signs and symptoms of volume overload in acute HF.

Introduction

Patients with heart failure (HF) who do not achieve the therapeutically desired diuresis despite a high dose of a loop diuretic are said to have 'diuretic resistance' and this lack of response is associated with worse clinical outcomes including prolonged hospital stay, higher risk of readmission after hospital discharge, and greater symptom burden and mortality. The usual treatment for this problem is to add a different diuretic to simultaneously block sodium resorption in a separate segment of the nephron. The commonest approach is to add a thiazide (or thiazide-like) diuretic acting in the distal convoluted tubule, although this can cause worsening kidney function, hyponatraemia, and hypokalaemia. However, there has been recent interest in agents acting on the proximal tubule because most sodium is absorbed in this segment. One such treatment, acetazolamide, has been shown to enhance decongestion when added to an intravenous (IV) loop diuretic in a placebo-controlled trial, although this was associated with a small increase in creatinine. The sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) is also responsible for sodium absorption in the proximal tubule and SGLT2 inhibitors might also augment the natriuretic and aquaretic action of loop diuretics. These agents are of particular interest as they are not known to cause electrolyte disturbances, as they have been postulated to lead to a smaller reduction in blood volume, relative to interstitial fluid volume, compared to loop diuretics, and because they improve outcomes in patients with HF. If correct, the latter difference might lead to less kidney dysfunction with an SGLT2 inhibitor compared to a conventional diuretic.

To test whether an SGLT2 inhibitor might be an alternative to a thiazide-like diuretic in the treatment of patients with loop diuretic resistance, we compared the addition of dapagliflozin or metolazone to loop diuretic treatment in patients hospitalized with HF who remained congested despite treatment with a high dose of IV furosemide. Metolazone was chosen as the reference therapy because it is believed to be at least as potent as alternative thiazide diuretics, effective in patients with a low glomerular filtration rate, and is recommended in guidelines. We hypothesized that dapagliflozin would lead to greater decongestion than metolazone but cause less kidney dysfunction. The primary endpoint of this randomized trial was the diuretic effect, measured as the reduction in weight, over 5 days (96 h).

Methods

Study design

This was a multi-centre, open-label, randomized, active-comparator, controlled clinical trial designed, and conducted by the Heart Failure Research Group at the University of Glasgow, sponsored by NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde and The University of Glasgow. The Clinical Trials Unit at the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics (RCB, University of Glasgow) was responsible for data management and statistical analysis. The study protocol and statistical analysis plan are included in the Supplementary data online, appendix. This study was performed according to the UK Policy Framework for Health and Social Care Research, The Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations, and the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (REC) and the Health Research Authority (HRA). All patients provided written informed consent. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04860011; EudraCT Number: 2020-004832-48.

Trial participants

Adult patients hospitalized for worsening HF (regardless of ejection fraction) with diuretic resistance defined as insufficient decongestion (decrease in weight < 1 kg or negative fluid balance < 1 L) over the prior 24 h despite treatment with high dose IV loop diuretic (equivalent to ≥ 160 mg IV furosemide in 24 h) were eligible. Additional inclusion criteria were plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) ≥ 100 pg/mL or plasma N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) ≥ 400 pg/mL, persisting congestion (defined as any of pitting peripheral oedema, ascites, elevated jugular venous pressure, or radiographic or ultrasonic evidence of pulmonary congestion) and an expected hospital length of stay > 3 days. Exclusion criteria included type 1 diabetes, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and receipt of an SGLT2 inhibitor, thiazide, or thiazide-like diuretic in the 48 h before randomization. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is given in the protocol in the Supplementary data online, appendix.

PartDiuretics in ambulatory settings – how to proceed?

The protocol published by Buckley et al.(adapted in Figure 4) has been used in more than 250 patients, and sets a good foundation for implementation strategies. This protocol has also been used, with some local adjustments/amendments, by our group on a regular basis in the last few years.

Figure 4
Ambulatory intravenous (IV) diuretics protocol according to maintenance loop diuretic dose. These doses are general guidelines that need to be adapted to renal function. Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 usually need higher (usually doubled) diuretic dose. ARNi, angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor; BP, blood pressure; HR, heart rate; MRA, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; RAASi, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone inhibitor; SGLT2i, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor.

Briefly, diuretic sessions consist in a 3‐h IV diuretic infusion, performed the same day or next‐day treatment. The pharmacological approach is contingent on the maintenance diuretic dose: patients with the highest oral diuretic maintenance dose would receive the highest IV diuretics (and possibly co‐diuretics such as thiazides). Generally, hydrochlorothiazide doses between 12.5 to 50 mg/session are used; metolazone 2.5 to 5 mg may be vey effective in those with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. In such patients, IV metolazone or chlorothiazide may also be given; however the advantage of oral thiazide administration makes it preferred. If sequential nephron blockade is utilized with an oral thiazide, the oral medication is administered 30 min prior to the IV loop diuretic. Thiazide has occasionally been replaced by a high‐dose IV MRA by some members of our group in similar settings given the natriuretic and diuretic properties of MRAs, including IV MRAs. The main advantage of MRA in this setting is to offset the primum movens of diuretic resistance, i.e. the key involvement of RAAS – in sharp contrast with thiazide that further increases RAAS activation. Acetazolamide is another option to consider in multi‐site nephron blockade. In the setting of 'hospital at home' (HaH), only IV boluses of loop diuretics are typically used, singly or divided to twice a day.

### Practical applications of intravenous diuretic therapy in decompensated heart failure [^111e47tU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Intravenous (IV) loop diuretics play an important role in the treatment of decompensated heart failure (DHF). They inhibit the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) reabsorptive pump in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, and the resultant natriuresis and diuresis decreases volume load, improves hemodynamics, and reduces DHF symptoms. However, loop diuretics have a short half-life and their efficacy may be limited by postdiuretic sodium rebound during the period between doses in which the tubular diuretic concentration is subtherapeutic. Moreover, they can produce electrolyte abnormalities, neurohormonal activation, intravascular volume depletion, and renal dysfunction. Several studies have reported an association between diuretic therapy and increased morbidity and mortality. In addition, many patients, especially those with more advanced forms of heart failure (HF), are resistant to standard doses of loop diuretics. These high-risk, resistant patients may benefit from pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic interventions to improve hemodynamic performance, treatment of renovascular disease, discontinuation of aspirin and other sodium-retaining drugs, manipulation of the route of delivery or combination of diuretic classes, or hemofiltration. Despite > 50 years of use, many questions regarding the use of intravenous diuretic agents in patients with DHF are still unanswered, and there remains a compelling need for well-designed randomized, controlled clinical trials to establish appropriate treatment regimens that maximize therapeutic benefit while minimizing morbidity and mortality.

Distal tubular diuretics

The distal convoluted tubule accounts for < 10% of sodium reabsorption through the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC) (Fig. 1) [1, 2]. However, distal sodium reabsorption can be altered by a variety of factors such as neurohormonal activation, tubular flow rate, aldosterone, and vasopressin, each of which can impact either the pathological development or therapeutic treatment of HF. Importantly, in the setting of chronic diuretic use or chronic HF, hypertrophy of the distal tubule increases distal tubular sodium reabsorption, contributing to sodium retention and is a major mechanism of diuretic resistance.

Thiazide diuretics

Thiazide diuretics have conventionally been considered a first line adjunct to augment diuresis, targeting the maladaptive distal tubular hypertrophy, by decreasing sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule through inhibition of the Na-Cl cotransporter (Fig. 1). Thiazide diuretics include metolazone, which has a long duration of action and is effective in those with advanced chronic kidney disease, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide, and chlorthalidone. Both metolazone and hydrochlorothiazide cause similar acute changes in body weight, urine output, diuretic efficiency, and patient congestion scores, suggesting that neither have established superiority. However, in the acute HF setting, metolazone treatment was associated with increased mortality compared to high-dose loop diuretic treatment in propensity analyses, although this may be attributed to confounding by indication. Other thiazide diuretics, such as intravenous chlorothiazide and oral chlorthalidone, have also been used to promote diuresis to mitigate volume overload in acute HF; although the only available evidence supporting this practice is observational in nature, and randomized controlled trial data is lacking.

Natriuresis and diuresis in chronic HF

Thiazide diuretics are most frequently utilized concurrently to loop diuretics for treating chronic HF patients in clinical practice, particularly in the setting of loop diuretic resistance. Indeed, loop diuretics and thiazide diuretics can act synergistically to help achieve adequate diuresis. This synergistic response, mediated by distinct tubular mechanisms of action for sequential nephron blockade, forms the physiological rationale for combined loop and thiazide diuretics in consensus statements. While observational studies support the addition of thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone, to improve weight loss and decongestion in patients with chronic HF, there is a lack of randomized controlled trial evidence in this setting.

Optimizing Volume Status — Approach to Vascular Congestion

The therapeutic approach to diuresis in ADHF has remained relatively unchanged with intravenous agents or consideration for continuous renal replacement therapy. The DOSE trial (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) evaluated the efficacy of high dose compared with low dose and bolus compared with continuous infusion of intravenous diuretics in a factorial design enrolling 308 patients admitted with ADHF. The trial demonstrated no difference in the patient's global assessment of symptoms or change in renal function between any of the strategies. Loop diuretics are organic anions that act on the ascending Loop of Henle to inhibit reabsorption of sodium via the Na + /K + /Cl − cotransporter thereby increasing water excretion. Worsening renal function results in increased endogenous anions that compete with loop diuretic binding of Na + /K + /Cl − cotransporters contributing to loop diuretic resistance. Additionally, chronic loop diuretic use can cause hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the epithelial cells of the distal convoluted tubule and increased sodium and, therefore, water reabsorption. Loop diuretic resistance is associated with all-cause mortality, sudden death, and death secondary to cardiac failure. Medical management includes initiation of intravenous loop diuretics with bolus dosing which can rapidly improve pulmonary artery pressure. Benzothiazide diuretics augment loop diuretic effectiveness by preventing distal sodium reabsorption at the distal convoluted tubule but are less potent when used as monotherapy. In the ROSE trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation), the efficacy of low-dose dopamine (renal dose) and nesiritide were evaluated in 360 patients hospitalized for ADHF with renal dysfunction. Neither dopamine nor nesiritide increased cumulative urine volume nor change in renal function as assessed by cystatin C, although both strategies were associated with increased adverse events compared with placebo. When medical diuretics are unsuccessful, continuous renal replacement therapy represents a necessary therapy, although studies have demonstrated that these patients have a higher in-hospital mortality and poor long-term prognosis possibly related to myocardial stunning as demonstrated on transthoracic echocardiography with global longitudinal strain.

### Renal tubular resistance is the primary driver for loop diuretic resistance in acute heart failure [^114pfU4K]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Loop diuretic resistance is a common barrier to effective decongestion in acute heart failure (AHF), and is associated with poor outcome. Specific mechanisms underlying diuretic resistance are currently unknown in contemporary AHF patients. We therefore aimed to determine the relative importance of defects in diuretic delivery vs. renal tubular response in determining diuretic response (DR) in AHF.

Methods and Results

Fifty AHF patients treated with intravenous bumetanide underwent a 6-h timed urine collection for sodium and bumetanide clearance. Whole-kidney DR was defined as sodium excreted per doubling of administered loop diuretic and represents the sum of defects in drug delivery and renal tubular response. Tubular DR, defined as sodium excreted per doubling of renally cleared (urinary) loop diuretic, captures resistance specifically in the renal tubule. Median administered bumetanide dose was 3.0 (2.0–4.0) mg with 52 (33–77)% of the drug excreted into the urine. Significant between-patient variability was present as the administered dose only explained 39% of variability in the quantity of bumetanide in urine. Cumulatively, factors related to drug delivery such as renal bumetanide clearance, administered dose, and urea clearance explained 28% of the variance in whole-kidney DR. However, resistance at the level of the renal tubule (tubular DR) explained 71% of the variability in whole-kidney DR.

Conclusion

Defects at the level of the renal tubule are substantially more important than reduced diuretic delivery in determining diuretic resistance in patients with AHF.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — alternatives when MRA not tolerated — When spironolactone or eplerenone are not tolerated due to side effects or cost, amiloride (10–20 mg) has been shown to be as effective as spironolactone in adults with resistant hypertension. Other alternative fourth- and fifth-line drug therapies include BBs, alpha blockers, central sympatholytic drugs, and direct vasodilators; however, direct vasodilators such as hydralazine and minoxidil should be used in combination with a BB and a loop diuretic given their effects on sympathetic tone, sodium reabsorption, and fluid retention. Aprocitentan, a dual endothelin A and B receptor antagonist, was shown to reduce 24-hour ambulatory SBP by 4 to 6 mm Hg compared with placebo in adults with resistant hypertension when added to a CCB, RAS inhibitor, and HCTZ, but it has not been directly compared with spironolactone and the side effects of leg edema and fluid retention (9%-18%) may be prohibitive in some patients.

### Comparison of oral or intravenous thiazides vs tolvaptan in diuretic resistant decompensated heart failure… [^113tYY9H]. ClinicalTrials (2015). Low credibility.

Study Overview Broad Objectives: To determine the comparative efficacy of commonly employed strategies to overcome loop diuretic resistance when added to concomitant loop diuretics in hospitalized decompensated heart failure patients with hypervolemia Specific Aims: Background: The investigators aim to evaluate the optimal regimen for restoring diuretic efficacy in patients with decompensated heart failure demonstrating loop diuretic resistance, for which guideline-based recommendations are weak secondary to a lack of evidence. By comparing the efficacy, cost, and adverse effects of currently recommended therapies and testing a novel diuretic combination, the investigators will augment the dearth of data that exists regarding this clinical challenge. Current heart failure guidelines recommend addition of a thiazide diuretic, listing either oral metolazone or intravenous chlorothiazide, to loop diuretic therapy as strategy to overcome loop diuretic resistance.

At equipotent doses, these two therapies differ 250 fold in cost. To date, no prospective trial has compared the efficacy of these two commonly utilized therapies. Tolvaptan, an oral vasopressin 2 receptor antagonist, could restore diuretic efficacy when used in combination with loop diuretics. While the safety of this combination has been established in the EVEREST trials, tolvaptan has been formally studied in a limited capacity as combination therapy to restore loop diuretic resistance. Hypokalemia is a common adverse effect of combining a thiazide and loop diuretic, increasing the risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in a population who is already at high risk. Hypokalemia as not been reported with the combination of tolvaptan and loop diuretics, likely due to tolvaptan's distinctive mechanism of action.

This potential benefit could provide tolvaptan a unique advantage for combination diuretic therapy in environments when electrolyte monitoring cannot be routinely performed or in patients with frequent arrhythmic events. To prevent confounding heterogeneity in the diuretic treatment approach, a stepped care algorithm similar to the CARRESS-HF trial will be utilized for loop diuretics, both initial doses and subsequent dose changes, and for concomitant inotropes and vasodilators. A minimum furosemide equivalent dose of 580mg/24hrs must be ordered at enrollment.

### Decongestion in acute heart failure [^1178SLXV]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Congestion is a major reason for hospitalization in acute heart failure (HF). Therapeutic strategies to manage congestion include diuretics, vasodilators, ultrafiltration, vasopressin antagonists, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and potentially also novel therapies such as gut sequesterants and serelaxin. Uncertainty exists with respect to the appropriate decongestion strategy for an individual patient. In this review, we summarize the benefit and risk profiles for these decongestion strategies and provide guidance on selecting an appropriate approach for different patients. An evidence-based initial approach to congestion management involves high-dose i.v. diuretics with addition of vasodilators for dyspnoea relief if blood pressure allows. To enhance diuresis or overcome diuretic resistance, options include dual nephron blockade with thiazide diuretics or natriuretic doses of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Vasopressin antagonists may improve aquaresis and relieve dyspnoea. If diuretic strategies are unsuccessful, then ultrafiltration may be considered. Ultrafiltration should be used with caution in the setting of worsening renal function. This review is based on discussions among scientists, clinical trialists, and regulatory representatives at the 9th Global Cardio Vascular Clinical Trialists Forum in Paris, France, from 30 November to 1 December 2012.

### The added value of hypertonic saline solution to furosemide monotherapy in patients with acute decompensated heart failure: a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^117GcufS]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This meta‐analysis, including 10 RCTs and ~3000 patients with HF, shows that treatment with intravenous HSS plus furosemide was associated with favorable responses across several surrogate efficacy endpoints, with no signals of safety based on low to moderate quality evidence (see Graphical abstract).

The administration of HSS is not used routinely in the management of ADHF patients. Current heart failure clinical practice guidelines dedicate too little attention to this therapy. However, there is evidence that supports its efficacy and safety in ADHF patients. The mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of HSS in decongesting patients with acute HF are diverse, including a rapid increase in plasma sodium and osmolality, with a rise in intravascular volume and renal perfusion, but are mainly focused on renal physiology. A neurohormonal effect inhibiting the deleterious action of the renin‐angiotensin system has been suggested. This hypothesis has been supported by plasma determination of values of BNP and also other inflammatory and fibrotic parameters (suppression of tumorigenicity 2, inflammatory cytokines [IL‐6]), which were lower in patients receiving HSS.

Diuretic resistance is a condition defined by an inability to increase fluid and sodium excretion despite an increase in loop diuretic dose, which is insufficient to relieve volume overload, peripheral edema, or pulmonary congestion. The physiology of diuretic resistance is also complex and not fully understood. It has been suggested that renal function (mainly glomerular filtration) would play a limited role in diuretic resistance, with sodium handling at the renal tubules being the most relevant mechanism. Therefore, diuretic combination strategies targeting sodium reabsorption at different tubular levels are highly effective in patients with diuretic resistance, but at the cost of worsening kidney function and notable electrolyte abnormalities that harm patients' outcomes.HSS administration improved the performance of loop diuretic therapy, as reflected in increased urinary volume and urinary sodium, and achieved a greater patient weight loss. To that effect, HSS is an adjunctive useful measure in patients with diuretic resistance. Furthermore, a trend towards a lower increase in creatinine levels was also observed in patients who received HSS.

Pharmacological treatment

Pharmacological therapy of RH is based on the use of ≥ 3 antihypertensive medications. These should include a RAS blocker (an ACEi or an ARB), a long-acting calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic. In patients with CKD, consider transitioning the diuretic to a loop diuretic if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is < 30–45 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Many antihypertensive agents are now available in various dual or triple-pill combinations, allowing for simplified regimens. However, to ensure that the patients receive the maximally recommended or maximally tolerated doses of all three agents, some single or double components of the three medications must be added. Also, if the prescribed diuretic is a thiazide, it should be replaced by a long-acting thiazide-like diuretic, preferably chlorthalidone or indapamide. All these modifications usually result in the prescription requiring at least two or three pills instead of just a single combination pill.

KDIGO 2021 — Diuretics and antihypertensive adverse effects in CKD — High BP due to fluid overload is common in CKD; therefore, diuretics are, in general, logical agents at appropriate dose to lower high BP, with or without the concomitant use of RASi. While thiazide diuretics decrease efficacy as GFR worsens, several, including chlorthalidone, metolazone, and indapamide appear to remain effective at GFRs < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and loop diuretics are often effective at lower GFRs (i.e., < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2). When combined with a loop diuretic, thiazides are particularly effective in inducing diuresis, but they often lead to hypokalemia and hyponatremia. The document notes common class adverse effects in CKD, including for both ACEi and ARBs, hyperkalemia as well as AKI, and for diuretics, hypokalemia, and states there are no data on clinical outcomes with loop diuretics in the treatment of high BP with or without CKD.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — alternatives to spironolactone and use of adjunct agents — Eplerenone, a more selective steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), is a potential alternative to spironolactone, but randomized controlled trials have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily when compared with placebo, and effective treatment may require higher dosages; use of nonsteroidal MRA for treating resistant hypertension in patients with moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium. When spironolactone or eplerenone are not tolerated due to side effects or cost, amiloride (10–20 mg) has been shown to be as effective as spironolactone in adults with resistant hypertension. Other alternative fourth- and fifth-line drug therapies include beta-blockers (BBs), alpha blockers, central sympatholytic drugs, and direct vasodilators; however, direct vasodilators such as hydralazine and minoxidil should be used in combination with a BB and a loop diuretic. Aprocitentan, a dual endothelin A and B receptor antagonist, was shown to reduce 24-hour ambulatory SBP by 4 to 6 mm Hg compared with placebo in adults with resistant hypertension when added to a CCB, renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor, and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), but it has not been directly compared with spironolactone and its side effects of leg edema and fluid retention (9%-18%) may be prohibitive in some patients.

VOLUME UNLOADING

PAH patients with advanced RV failure; or decompensated RV failure, will develop symptoms resulting from backward – (ankle edema, ascites) and forward failure (low systemic blood pressure, low CO, resulting in reduced perfusion of vital organs). As a consequence of both RAAS activation and venous congestion, volume load on the RV will increase. To reduce this RV preload, diuretic treatment can be initiated. In end stage disease, a balloon atrial septostomy can be considered, to relieve the heart from the volume overload.

Oral diuretics

As in left heart failure, preload reduction by diuretic treatment can be incorporated in PAH management. Clinical trials report numbers of patients on diuretic treatment varying from 50 to 90%. Although many patients are on diuretics, studies of the effects of these drugs on the RV function are absent. Because of the arguments in favor of reducing preload and wide availability of diuretics, research studying the optimal diuretic type (thiazide, loop diuretic), optimal dosage and the effects of these drugs on RV function are needed.

Intravenous diuretic treatment

Optimal volume management with loop diuretics is not always possible due to the development of diuretic resistance and deterioration of kidney function. Development of diuretics resistance is multifactorial. One of the possible mechanisms of diuretic resistance is the combination of both forward failure and renal venous congestion. This causes an increased renal interstitial pressure, which affects glomerular filtration. Strategies to overcome the diuretic resistance have not been explored until now. Theoretically, in these patients, supportive therapy with vasopressors might be of use, as those drugs increase systemic vascular resistance and subsequently renal perfusion pressure. Vasopressin analogues were successfully used in patients with end stage liver failure who developed hepatorenal syndrome. As in PAH, patients with this syndrome have ascites and systemic hypotension affecting renal perfusion. In this disease, administration of vasopressors increased systemic vascular resistance, diuresis and glomerular filtration rate.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — alternatives when spironolactone/eplerenone are not tolerated — When spironolactone or eplerenone are not tolerated due to side effects or cost, amiloride (10–20 mg) has been shown to be as effective as spironolactone in adults with resistant hypertension. Other alternative fourth- and fifth-line drug therapies include beta blockers (BBs), alpha blockers, central sympatholytic drugs, and direct vasodilators; however, direct vasodilators such as hydralazine and minoxidil should be used in combination with a BB and a loop diuretic. Aprocitentan, a dual endothelin A and B receptor antagonist, was shown to reduce 24-hour ambulatory SBP by 4 to 6 mm Hg compared with placebo when added to a CCB, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor, and HCTZ, but it has not been directly compared with spironolactone and leg edema and fluid retention (9%-18%) may be prohibitive in some patients.

### Dapagliflozin vs. metolazone in heart failure resistant to loop diuretics [^1146rmnq]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Collectively, these trials show that each of a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, acetazolamide, and an SGLT2 inhibitor augments decongestion in patients already receiving IV loop diuretic. Because the patients studied in each trial were different, the treatments were not compared directly, and the dose of loop diuretic varied between treatment groups, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the relative efficacy of each therapy (or strategy). Moreover, in some countries, the selective vasopressin receptor 2 antagonist tolvaptan is another agent that can be used to augment diuresis.

There is now irrefutable evidence of the benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors in HF, and guidelines recommend their initiation in the hospital, but, as with other therapies, once patients are 'stabilized'. The present data suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors can be started earlier, if needed, to facilitate decongestion. More research into the treatment of diuretic resistance is needed and future investigation should focus on the safety and efficacy of adding a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic or acetazolamide, and perhaps tolvaptan, in patients with persisting congestion despite treatment with a loop diuretic and SGLT2 inhibitor (and in patients with HF with reduced/mildly reduced ejection fraction, an MRA).

Limitations and strengths

The present trial was unblinded which may have led to bias. This was a pragmatic trial in which the clinicians responsible for the care of the participating patients were free to adjust the dose of furosemide as they thought appropriate. We did not attempt to mandate usual care and we do not believe that there is any universally agreed and routinely used furosemide-dosing protocol. Effectively, the comparison was of two decongestion strategies- one using furosemide plus metolazone and another using furosemide plus dapagliflozin. The latter resulted in the use of more furosemide than the former but, as we found, with less biochemical disturbance. The sample size was small but a post hoc power calculation showed sufficient power to detect a difference between treatments of 1 kg in weight. Nevertheless, in a larger trial, some of the differences between treatments, such as in diuretic efficiency, may have become statistically significant. There were some imbalances in patient characteristics between the treatment groups at baseline. Strengths of this trial include the use of LUS to assess congestion and the relatively large proportion of women included.

The development of peripheral edema can often pose a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for practitioners due to its association with a wide variety of underlying disorders ranging in severity. Updates to the original Starling's principle have provided new mechanistic insights into edema formation. Additionally, contemporary data highlighting the role of hypochloremia in the development of diuretic resistance provide a possible new therapeutic target. This article reviews the pathophysiology of edema formation and discusses implications for treatment.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Diuretic therapy (Figure 6) — in hospitalized heart failure, initiate IV loop diuretics early (ED or immediately after admission) with an initial dose usually 1–2.5 times total daily oral loop diuretic agent in furosemide equivalents, and prescribe IV diuretics every 8–12 hrs or continuous while measuring daily weights and urine output and monitoring vital signs and congestion; consider addition of SGLT inhibitors for chronic therapy and consider adjunct diuretic agent such as acetazolamide. For Adequate diuresis, continue diuretics with target relief of congestion and plan for transition to oral therapy. For Inadequate diuresis, usually increase loop diuretic agent dose by 50%-100% and consider other thiazides or additional diuretic agents. For Refractory to diuretics, change course by escalating diuretics, considering additional diuretic agents or other decongestion strategies, and consider hemodynamic monitoring to guide therapy.

### Dapagliflozin vs. metolazone in heart failure resistant to loop diuretics [^111catKa]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The present findings can be compared to those from other recent trials of combination diuretic therapy in patients hospitalized with worsening HF, albeit not specifically with diuretic resistance. In the Combination of Loop with Thiazide-type Diuretics in Patients with Decompensated Heart Failure (CLOROTIC) trial, the median (interquartile range) weight loss over 72 h in patients randomly assigned to placebo in addition to IV furosemide was 1.5 (0.0–3.2) kg and 2.0 (2.1–4.6) kg in those assigned to hydrochlorothiazide, giving an adjusted placebo-corrected difference of 1.14 (0.42–1.84) kg. The total mean dose of furosemide administered from enrolment to 72 h was 375 mg in the placebo group and 340 mg in the hydrochlorothiazide group (compared with 756 mg in the dapagliflozin group and 566 mg in the metolazone group in the present trial). The greater diuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazide was achieved at the expense of worse renal function and more hypokalaemia.

### 10 issues for the clinician in tricuspid regurgitation evaluation and management: 2025 ACC expert consensus decision pathway: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^111xFVck]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) diuretic therapy — There are no specific disease-modifying medical therapies (or guideline Class I medical recommendations) for the treatment of TR, although the magnitude of TR can be reduced in many patients with management of left-sided heart disease and atrial fibrillation (AF), and because TR was the strongest multivariable predictor of persistent congestion in acute heart failure (HF), management of congestion should be a primary treatment goal. Loop diuretic effectiveness may be limited by impaired kidney function and, in chronic kidney disease, by reduced activity of the organic anion transporter and decreased renal blood flow that lower intratubular diuretic concentrations; severe TR can cause renal venous hypertension with lower glomerular filtration rate and diuretic resistance, and neurohormonal activation with lower cardiac output and higher central venous pressure increases active sodium and water reabsorption, perpetuating congestion and reducing responsiveness. For gut congestion with impaired absorption, an oral loop diuretic with higher bioavailability (torsemide, bumetanide) may be considered, although the TRANSFORM study did not demonstrate a benefit of torsemide over furosemide in chronic HF and was not stratified by TR. In patients refractory to high-dose oral diuretic therapy, changing to an intravenous loop diuretic with a bolus infusion can reduce PA pressures and increase venous capacitance; higher doses may sometimes be needed but may not be predictably effective in advanced chronic kidney disease. Add-on options include thiazide-like diuretics (oral metolazone or hydrochlorothiazide; intravenous chlorothiazide) for dual nephron blockade, and more recent data suggest a benefit of adding acetazolamide or a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to enhance decongestion; aggressive diuretic management may require the input of a pharmacist.

### Resistant hypertension [^1147zhWP]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Hypertension that remains above 140/90 mmHg despite the use of three antihypertensive drugs in a rational combination at full doses and including a diuretic is known as 'resistant'. The percentage of hypertensives whose condition is resistant varies in large part upon the setting: those seen in general practice show a prevalence of perhaps 5%; those seen by nephrologists, probably 50%. This paper reviews the major causes of resistant hypertension and provides specific recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with this threatening condition.

### Intra-abdominal hypertension: an important consideration for diuretic resistance in acute decompensated heart failure [^115aPfaT]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Fluid accumulation is the hallmark of heart failure decompensation. Fluid overload and congestion are associated with recurrent hospitalizations, poor quality of life, and increased mortality in heart failure. Despite the use of high-dose intravenous loop diuretic therapy, acutely decompensated heart failure patients may develop diuretic resistance. Diuretic refractoriness can be a result of elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in acutely decompensated heart failure. Increased renal venous and interstitial pressures in patients with elevated IAP may lead to renal impairment and diuretic resistance. Routine approaches such as sequential nephron blockade with a combination of loop and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, continuous diuretic infusion, and ultrafiltration may not be sufficient. Presented here is a case illustrating the importance of recognizing intra-abdominal hypertension in patients with diuretic resistance. Lowering IAP improves renal perfusion, renal filtration, and diuresis. When elevated, IAP is an easily reversible cause of diuretic resistance. Additionally, abdominal perfusion pressure can be used to guide therapy to reverse end-organ damage and avoid permanent renal replacement therapy.

### The use of loop diuretics in the context of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ehgng]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Addressing volume expansion may improve the management of hypertension across the pregnancy continuum. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the evidence on the use of loop diuretics in the context of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

Methods and Results

Medline, Embase, Cochrane library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar were searched for original research articles published up to 29 June 2021. Of the 2801 results screened, 15 studies were included: eight randomized controlled trials, six before-after studies, and one cohort study. Based on random effects meta-analysis of before-after studies, antepartum use of loop diuretics was associated with lower DBP [mean difference -17.73mmHg, (95% confidence intervals -34.50 to -0.96); I2 = 94%] and lower cardiac output [mean difference -0.75l/min, (-1.11 to -0.39); I2 = 0%], with no difference in SBP, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, or total peripheral resistance. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials revealed that postpartum use of loop diuretics was associated with decreased need for additional antihypertensive patients [relative risk 0.69, (0.50–0.97); I2 = 14%], and an increased duration of hospitalization [mean difference 8.80h, (4.46–13.14); I2 = 83%], with no difference in the need for antihypertensive therapy at hospital discharge, or persistent postpartum hypertension.

Conclusion

Antepartum use of loop diuretics lowered DBP and cardiac output, while their postpartum use reduced the need for additional antihypertensive medications. There was insufficient evidence to suggest a clear benefit. Future studies focusing on women with hypertensive pregnancy disorders who may most likely benefit from loop diuretics are required.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^116S5khD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2023 ESH Guidelines emphasize that most individuals with CKD will not achieve target BP control with ACEi or ARB monotherapy, and dual combination by adding a dihydropyridine CCB or a diuretic should almost always be used to initiate the treatment in hypertensive patients with CKD as in most patients with hypertension. Nevertheless, the majority of patients with CKD would need triple combination to achieve target BP (Fig. 3). Dihydropyridine CCBs were shown to increase proteinuria when used in the absence of a RAS blocker in patients with proteinuric CKD. However, in the general hypertensive population, where the majority of patients do not have moderately or severely increased albuminuria, dihydropyridine CCBs have similar effects on kidney outcomes with RAS blockers or diuretics. Moreover, in a study of hypertensive patients of which 19% had moderately and 5% severely increased albuminuria at baseline, a combination of RAS blocker with a dihydropyridine CCBs was superior in reducing kidney outcomes compared with a RAS blocker–thiazide combination.

Diuretics are particularly useful in CKD patients, as these individuals are most often sodium-sensitive (especially if older, diabetic or obese) and have high prevalence of treatment resistant hypertension. Furthermore, diuretics were shown to effectively reduce proteinuria when added to RAS blockers in proteinuric CKD. When GFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2, thiazide diuretics become less effective, as they cannot reach their tubular site of action due to competition for tubular secretion with other substances that accumulate in CKD. This is theoretically also the case for thiazide-like diuretics, but recent RCT evidence indicated that at least chlorthalidone is clinically effective in lowering BP in patients with G4 CKD. In general, in patients with CKD G3b (eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m 2), diuretic therapy should be modified and the dosing individualized, while in patients with CKD G4 (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2), thiazides should be substituted with a loop diuretic. Within this class, torasemide might be preferred to furosemide because of its longer half-life, which allows a less frequent dosing scheme and a better adherence to treatment.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117E54vJ]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Diuretics in hospitalized heart failure: synopsis and supportive context. Intravenous loop diuretic therapy provides the most rapid and effective treatment for signs and symptoms of congestion leading to hospitalization for HF. Titration to achieve effective diuresis may require doubling of initial doses, adding a thiazide diuretic, or adding an MRA that has diuretic effects in addition to its cardiovascular benefits. A major goal of therapy is resolution of the signs and symptoms of congestion before discharge, as persistent congestion scored at discharge has been associated with higher rates of rehospitalizations and mortality. Most patients who have required intravenous diuretic therapy during hospitalization for HF will require prescription of loop diuretics at discharge to decrease recurrence of symptoms and hospitalization. As background, diuretic therapy with oral furosemide was the cornerstone of HF therapy for ≥ 20 years before construction of the modern bases of evidence for HF therapies.

### Cardio-renal syndromes: report from the consensus conference of the acute dialysis quality initiative [^113mk7T9]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Management strategies of cardio-renal syndromes

Although there are clinical guidelines for managing both HF and CKD, there are no agreed guidelines for managing patients with cardio-renal and/or reno-cardiac syndromes.

Acute cardio-renal syndrome (type 1)

Both abnormal renal function and also a deterioration early in the course of treatment of ADHF increase mortality. Thus, any treatment for HF should have a neutral effect or preferably improve renal function.

The management of ADHF is described in the recent ESC/ESICM guidelines. Vasodilatorsand loop diuretics are widely recommended in cases of ADHF and in CRS type 1. However, loop diuretics predispose to electrolyte imbalances, and hypovolaemia leading to neurohumoral activation, reduced renal glomerular flow with further rises in serum urea and creatinine. Vasodilators (e.g. nesiritide) may also affect renal functionand in some cases exacerbate renal injury. Vasopressin receptor 2 antagonists can improve hyponatraemia, but without any clear survival benefit. If congestion coincides with low blood pressure, inotropic agents should be considered.

In cardiogenic shock, treatments are designed to increase cardiac output and restore renal blood flow. Although inotropic drugs, typically dobutamine or dopamine, may tide patients over, they are often associated with increased mid-term mortality. Other agents include phosphodiesterase inhibitors, milrinone, and levosimendan. Extracorporeal ultrafiltration may be useful in ADHF associated with diuretic resistance. If systemic hypotension persists, then norepineprine may be considered, along with elective ventilation and/or intra-aortic balloon pumping. Depending upon pre-existing co-morbidity and the underlying aetiology, left ventricular assist devices as a bridge to transplantation or cardiac surgery may be appropriate. It should be mentioned that over-treatment with loop diuretics, ACE-I, and/or spironolactone may induce AKI.

### Intravenous chlorothiazide versus enteral metolazone to augment loop diuretic therapy in the intensive care unit [^112FF3kf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In cases of loop diuretic resistance in the intensive care unit (ICU), recommendations for a specific second-line thiazide agent are lacking.

Objective

To compare the effects of intravenous chlorothiazide (CTZ) and enteral metolazone (MET) on urine output (UOP) when added to furosemide monotherapy therapy in critically ill adults.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in the medical, surgical, and cardiothoracic ICUs of a quaternary medical center. The primary outcome was change in UOP induced by the study interventions compared with furosemide alone. Secondary outcomes included onset of diuresis, eventual need for hemodialysis, and incidence of adverse events.

Results

A total of 122 patients (58 in CTZ, 64 in MET) were included. When added to furosemide monotherapy, CTZ induced a greater change in UOP at 24 hours compared with MET (2405 vs 1646 mL, respectively; P = 0.01). CTZ also caused a more rapid dieresis: 1463 mL total UOP in the first 6 hours compared with 796 mL in the MET group (P < 0.01). There were no differences found regarding ICU length of stay, need for renal replacement therapy, or survival to discharge. The CTZ arm required more potassium supplementation to maintain normokalemia (median 100 vs 57 mEq in MET; P = 0.02) and carried a higher cost (mean $97 vs $8, P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Both CTZ and MET induced significant increases in UOP. CTZ induced a greater and more rapid change and was associated with higher cost and greater need for potassium replacement. Randomized controlled trials are needed to establish whether a preferable thiazide diuretic exists in this setting.

### Net ultrafiltration prescription survey in Europe [^1157Z4Y4]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this survey of doctors and nurses working in hospitals in Europe, the respondents were diverse with respect to countries, profession, years of practice, and types of hospital. Most had more than 15 years of experience and practiced in university-based hospitals. Almost all doctors were intensivists. There was significant variation in use of diuretics, criteria for initiation of ultrafiltration, UF NET prescription, assessment of prescribed-to-delivered dose, RRT modality, monitoring of net fluid balance, management of hemodynamic instability, and perceived barriers to UF. Most respondents agreed that early fluid removal might be useful, and that protocol-guided fluid removal might be beneficial. More doctors than nurses were keen to enroll patients in a clinical trial comparing a protocol-based ultrafiltration versus usual care.

The maximal dose of loop diuretics before determining diuretic resistance varied significantly. This may reflect lack of consensus in the literature. A recent survey also confirmed a wide de-resuscitation practice among critical care physicians. The term 'diuretic resistance' is typically used in heart failure but its definition is less clear in AKI where higher doses of furosemide may be required to achieve diuresis due to reduced kidney function. Consequently, the maximum dose of loop diuretics safe in AKI before considering extracorporeal fluid removal is unknown.

About half of doctors considered oliguria/anuria as a criterion for mechanical fluid removal, followed by complications of fluid overload e.g. pulmonary edema, hypoxemia. Most practitioners believed that earlier initiation might yield better outcomes. Whether this has changed following the publication of three recent randomized controlled trials and an individual-patient meta-analysis which failed to show a difference in mortality between early (within 6–12 h after AKI stage 3) versus delayed (up to 72 h after oliguria onset) initiation of RRT is unknown. Some earlier studies, including a single-center randomized controlled study with predominant surgical patients of whom 75% had pulmonary edema before randomization showed that early initiation of RRT had a survival benefit. However, the largest study to date, STARRT-AKI trial, showed no difference in 90-day mortality between the accelerated strategy and standard initiation groups, despite differences in fluid balance at RRT initiation (2.7 vs 5.9 L).

### Dapagliflozin vs. metolazone in heart failure resistant to loop diuretics [^116N84z3]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and Aims

To examine the decongestive effect of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin compared to the thiazide-like diuretic metolazone in patients hospitalized for heart failure and resistant to treatment with intravenous furosemide.

Methods and results

A multi-centre, open-label, randomized, and active-comparator trial. Patients were randomized to dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily or metolazone 5–10 mg once daily for a 3-day treatment period, with follow-up for primary and secondary endpoints until day 5 (96 h). The primary endpoint was a diuretic effect, assessed by change in weight (kg). Secondary endpoints included a change in pulmonary congestion (lung ultrasound), loop diuretic efficiency (weight change per 40 mg of furosemide), and a volume assessment score. 61 patients were randomized. The mean (± standard deviation) cumulative dose of furosemide at 96 h was 977 (± 492) mg in the dapagliflozin group and 704 (± 428) mg in patients assigned to metolazone. The mean (± standard deviation) decrease in weight at 96 h was 3.0 (2.5) kg with dapagliflozin compared to 3.6 (2.0) kg with metolazone [mean difference 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.12,1.41 kg; P = 0.11]. Loop diuretic efficiency was less with dapagliflozin than with metolazone [mean 0.15 (0.12) vs. 0.25 (0.19); difference −0.08, 95% CI −0.17,0.01 kg; P = 0.10]. Changes in pulmonary congestion and volume assessment score were similar between treatments. Decreases in plasma sodium and potassium and increases in urea and creatinine were smaller with dapagliflozin than with metolazone. Serious adverse events were similar between treatments.

Conclusion

In patients with heart failure and loop diuretic resistance, dapagliflozin was not more effective at relieving congestion than metolazone. Patients assigned to dapagliflozin received a larger cumulative dose of furosemide but experienced less biochemical upset than those assigned to metolazone.

### Loop diuretics in acute heart failure: beyond the decongestive relief for the kidney [^115K64og]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

In the setting of neurohormonal activation and adequate perfusion, nesiritide could play an adjunctive role but does not have a broadly applied benefit in AHF. It is possible that oral tolvaptan used in those with high arginine vasopressin (copeptin) levels even in the absence of hyponatremia could be beneficial in prompting an aquaresis before congestion worsens. Both of these approaches would call for a personalized approach which is based on hemodynamic and biomarker profiles and which has not been undertaken in clinical trials to date. Additionally, methods to anticipate diuretic resistance before it occurs are needed to avoid excessive loop diuretic use with either sequential pharmacologic nephron blockade or ultrafiltration. Overall, a direct measurement of hemodynamic changes in arterial and venous districts to better understand the primary dysfunction and the venous or pulmonary congestion should be applied by central venous pressure estimation and LV filling and pulmonary pressure exertion. Congestion status and intra- or extravascular fluid accumulation are other important items deserving careful monitoring. This is actually possible by the routine use of bioimpedance, evaluation of vena cava collapse, and lung ultrasound (Fig. 3). Such tools will likely include advanced renal physiologic imaging, advanced assessments of systemic and hemodynamics in the intra-abdominal arteries and veins, blood and urine biomarkers of kidney tubular function and injury, and lastly assessment of systemic neurohormonal activation profiles (renin-angiotensin, arginine vasopressin, sympathetic nervous system, endothelin, and others).

### Optimal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic management of cardiac transplant candidates: approaches to be considered prior to transplant evaluation: International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for the care of cardiac transplant candidates – 2006 [^113ut8MX]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Medium credibility.

Heart failure diuretic therapy and fluid management — key directives and observations include that measures to control or avoid fluid retention include fluid and salt intake restriction and the use of diuretic drugs, and fluid status should be monitored roughly by daily weights. Limited fluid intake (1.5 to 2 liters/day for severe heart failure) limits edema formation and avoids hyponatremia. In advanced stages of heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or IV) diuretics form the mainstay of symptomatic therapy, and as diuretics may induce further activation of the RAAS, diuretics should always be combined with an ACEI or ARB. In advanced heart failure, diuretic resistance may develop; management includes salt and volume restriction, increased dosing or intravenous application of diuretics, combination therapy of loop diuretic with thiazide or metolazone, and institution of inodilatory therapy with dopamine, dobutamine, or milrinone. Rapid restoration of euvolemia, usually via intensified diuretic therapy, achieves symptomatic relief, and in therapy-resistant cases hemofiltration or hemodialysis may be required. In the Congestive Heart Failure (TORIC) trial, a significant survival advantage was demonstrated for patients treated with torsemide vs furosemide.

### Extracorporeal ultrafiltration for fluid Overload in heart failure: current status and prospects for further research [^116uUBCK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

UNRESPONSIVENESS TO DIURETIC AGENTS IN HEART FAILURE

Diuretic agents remain the cornerstone of therapy for fluid overload. Although effective early in heart failure, diuretic agents become increasingly ineffective with disease progression due to the development of unresponsiveness in a significant subset of patients. Excellent reviews describe the mechanisms leading to decreased diuretic agent responsiveness. In patients with heart failure, impaired absorption, decreased renal blood flow, azotemia, and proteinuria all result in reduced levels of active diuretic agents in the tubular lumen. Recently proposed definitions of diuretic resistance include persistent congestion, despite adequate and escalating doses of diuretic agents equivalent to ≥ 80 mg/day furosemide; the amount of sodium excretion as a percentage of filtered load below 0.2%; and failure to excrete at least 90 mmol of sodium within 72 h of a 160-mg twice-daily dose of furosemide. Metrics for diuretic agent response have also been proposed, including weight loss per 40 mg of furosemide or equivalent; net fluid loss per milligram of loop diuretic agent; and natriuretic response to furosemide as urinary sodium-to-urinary furosemide ratio.

The clinical hallmarks of diuretic agent resistance are insufficient symptom relief, higher risk of in-hospital worsening of heart failure, increased mortality after discharge, and a 3-fold increase in rehospitalization rates. Among more than 50,000 patients enrolled in the ADHERE (Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry) study, only 33% lost ≥ 2.27 kg (5 lbs), and 16% gained weight during hospitalization. Nearly one-half of hospitalized patients with heart failure are discharged with residual fluid excess after receiving conventional diuretic therapies. Regardless of diuretic strategy, 42% of acutely decompensated heart failure subjects in the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial reached the composite endpoint of death, rehospitalization, or emergency department visit at 60 days. Vasopressin and adenosine-A1 receptor antagonists, exogenous natriuretic peptides, and low-dose dopamine, studied as either a complement or a replacement for conventional diuretic therapies, can decrease fluid overload in the short term but have failed to improve long-term outcomes.
