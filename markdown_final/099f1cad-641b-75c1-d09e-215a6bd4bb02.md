## Question

Diagnosis treatment strained quadriceps

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing and treating a strained quadriceps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and mechanism. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including history, examination, and when to image. Next, I will classify injury patterns and prognostic features. After that, I need to outline treatment principles, including acute management, rehabilitation phases, and criteria for return to sport. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, prevention, and synthesize a practical algorithm with appropriate caveats and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and mechanism so I don't jump to conclusions. A strained quadriceps is an indirect, non-contact muscle injury typically occurring during eccentric contraction with the muscle on stretch, such as sprinting, jumping, or kicking, and most often involves the rectus femoris due to its dual-joint action and intramuscular tendon anatomy, which predisposes to longer recovery when injured [^10c11d46] [^fb243ef3] [^d5347f9b].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before discussing imaging. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, anchored by a sudden onset of anterior thigh pain during activity, reproduction of pain with quadriceps stretch or activation, focal tenderness on palpation, and loss of function such as difficulty with knee extension or ambulation. I should confirm that most clinical tests have low diagnostic effectiveness, so I need to be cautious about overinterpreting isolated maneuvers [^fbfddd57] [^2f2f7b76].

> Hold on, I should verify which bedside tests actually help. Proximal rectus femoris palpation has high diagnostic effectiveness when positive and, importantly, a negative test essentially rules out a rectus femoris injury on MRI, which is useful when I need to decide whether to image. Resisted knee extension can also help rule out injury when negative, though I need to remember these data come from athletes with acute groin pain and may not generalize to all quadriceps strains [^fbfddd57] [^7a0207b5].

> I need to check when imaging changes management. MRI is indicated when I suspect a high-grade tear, intramuscular tendon involvement, or when the clinical course is atypical or prolonged, because MRI can identify central tendon injuries that carry substantially longer rehabilitation times and higher recurrence risk. Ultrasound can be used at the point of care to confirm complete ruptures or large hematomas when MRI is not immediately available, but I should confirm that routine imaging is not needed for low-grade strains [^0b453a93] [^1397ac6c] [^02ca06cf] [^2013ee2c].

> Let me consider classification and prognosis so I can set expectations. Clinically, injuries are often graded 1 to 3 by severity, while MRI-based grading ranges from edema without fiber disruption to complete tears; importantly, rectus femoris central tendon injuries behave like tendon injuries with mean rehabilitation around 27 days versus about 9 days for peripheral myofascial injuries, and intratendinous injuries have higher recurrence, which I should explicitly counsel athletes about [^2cefe25e] [^0b453a93] [^5d09bb61].

> Next, I should review acute management principles and make sure I'm aligned with current practice. Protection, relative rest, ice, compression, and elevation remain foundational, but I need to emphasize early activation and progressive loading rather than prolonged immobilization, because modern management favors an active approach to preserve tissue integrity and mitigate disuse atrophy, with analgesia as needed to enable movement [^85c58440].

> I will now examine rehabilitation phases, but wait, I should verify that the progression is criteria-based rather than time-based. Early phase focuses on pain control, gentle range of motion, and isometric activation; intermediate phase advances to concentric and then eccentric strengthening, multiplanar stability, and progressive running; late phase incorporates sport-specific drills, high-speed running, and power development, with eccentric loading at longer muscle lengths prioritized for rectus femoris injuries to restore tensile capacity [^85c58440] [^fbfddd57].

> Hold on, I should verify return-to-sport criteria because premature return drives recurrence. Functional milestones should include pain-free full range of motion, near-normal strength symmetry, and the ability to perform sport-specific tasks without pain or compensation. I should also remember that recent quadriceps injury is the strongest predictor of recurrence for about 15 weeks after return, so I need to build in a graded exposure and monitor closely during that window [^f9f57f36].

> But wait, what if the injury is a complete tear or involves the intramuscular tendon with retraction. I should confirm that surgical repair is generally reserved for complete ruptures, avulsions, or chronic, refractory cases with persistent deficits despite optimized rehabilitation. Case series and reports suggest good outcomes with repair in selected athletes, but evidence quality is low, so shared decision-making and individualized risk–benefit discussion are essential [^fb243ef3] [^29a9212f] [^00d395bd].

> Let me think about prevention, because reducing recurrence is as critical as treating the index injury. I should confirm that previous quadriceps injury, recent hamstring injury, dominant kicking leg, and competitive match play increase risk, and that FIFA 11+ may modestly reduce anterior thigh injuries, though the evidence specific to rectus femoris is limited. Therefore, preseason screening for asymmetries, targeted eccentric and multiplanar strengthening, and load management during congested schedules are prudent [^676dc27a] [^fbfddd57] [^7a0207b5].

> I should double-check special scenarios that can masquerade as quadriceps strains. In adolescents with hip or groin pain and knee extension weakness, slipped capital femoral epiphysis can present as a quadriceps strain, so I need a low threshold for hip radiographs. Similarly, quadriceps contusions can produce anterior thigh pain and weakness and carry a risk of myositis ossificans, which should be monitored if symptoms persist beyond a few weeks [^6b1e7213] [^0c87c682] [^30aff3ab].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and make sure it aligns with the evidence. Suspect quadriceps strain with acute anterior thigh pain during eccentric load, confirm with palpation and functional testing, and escalate to MRI if high-grade tear, central tendon involvement, or atypical course is suspected. Manage acutely with protection and early activation, progress through criteria-based rehabilitation emphasizing eccentric loading and sport-specific drills, and return to sport only after functional milestones are met, with heightened surveillance for 15 weeks given recurrence risk. Reserve surgery for complete tears or refractory cases, and embed prevention strategies to mitigate future injury [^fbfddd57] [^85c58440] [^f9f57f36].

> Finally, I should acknowledge evidence limitations so we don't overstate claims. Much of the quadriceps-specific literature is low quality, with small samples and indirect outcomes, so I need to integrate hamstring-derived principles judiciously and tailor decisions to athlete-specific factors. Where evidence is sparse, expert consensus and biomechanical rationale guide practice, but I should remain transparent about uncertainty during shared decision-making [^098b827b] [^2f2f7b76].

A strained quadriceps is best diagnosed by **clinical assessment** (history of sudden anterior thigh pain during sprinting/kicking, pain with stretch/activation, focal tenderness, and loss of function) [^notfound] and confirmed by **MRI when a high-grade tear or intramuscular tendon injury is suspected** [^1397ac6c] [^0b453a93]. Most cases heal with **conservative care**: POLICE (protection, optimal loading, ice, compression, elevation), early pain-limited ROM, and progressive eccentric strengthening with criteria-based return-to-sport [^85c58440] [^fbfddd57]. Surgery is rare, reserved for complete tears or refractory cases, and **recurrence risk is highest in the first 15 weeks** after return, so load management and prevention are key [^f9f57f36] [^fb243ef3].

---

## Clinical diagnosis

### History and mechanism

Typical history includes a **sudden onset of anterior thigh pain** during sprinting, jumping, or kicking, often with a popping sensation [^f82ff116]. Mechanism is usually **eccentric contraction of the quadriceps** during hip flexion and knee extension, especially in the rectus femoris [^10c11d46].

---

### Physical examination

- **Inspection**: Ecchymosis, swelling, deformity, or a palpable gap in severe tears [^4f52cb30].
- **Palpation**: Focal tenderness at the musculotendinous junction, often proximal rectus femoris [^fbfddd57].
- **Range of motion**: Pain with passive knee flexion/hip extension; limited knee extension in severe injuries [^4f52cb30].
- **Strength testing**: Pain and weakness with resisted knee extension; marked weakness suggests higher-grade injury [^notfound].
- **Special tests**: Resisted knee extension and proximal rectus femoris palpation have high diagnostic utility for rectus femoris injury [^fbfddd57].

---

### Clinical grading

| **Grade** | **Severity** | **Clinical findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Grade I | Mild | - Minimal pain <br/> - No significant weakness <br/> - Minimal ROM loss |
| Grade II | Moderate | - Moderate pain <br/> - Weakness <br/> - Restricted ROM <br/> - Possible ecchymosis |
| Grade III | Severe | - Severe pain <br/> - Marked weakness <br/> - Significant ROM loss <br/> - Palpable gap <br/> - Ecchymosis |

---

## Imaging

Imaging is not routine for low-grade strains but is indicated for **severe injuries, atypical presentations, or when intramuscular tendon involvement is suspected** [^2013ee2c].

- **MRI**: Gold standard for detecting tear extent, intramuscular tendon injury, and guiding prognosis; central tendon injuries have longer recovery and higher recurrence risk [^0b453a93] [^1397ac6c].
- **Ultrasound**: Useful for detecting tears, hematoma, and guiding interventions; limited by operator dependence [^02ca06cf].

---

## Treatment

### Conservative management

Conservative care is first-line for most strains and includes:

- **POLICE**: Protection, optimal loading, ice, compression, elevation in the acute phase [^notfound].
- **Pain control**: NSAIDs and acetaminophen as needed.
- **Early rehabilitation**: Pain-limited ROM, isometrics, and progressive eccentric strengthening (e.g. lengthening exercises) [^notfound].
- **Functional progression**: Gradual return to running, sport-specific drills, and criteria-based return-to-sport [^fbfddd57].

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is rare and reserved for **complete tears, avulsions, or chronic refractory cases** with persistent pain or functional limitation [^fb243ef3] [^f82ff116].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

- **Recovery time**: Grade I: 1–2 weeks; Grade II: 4–8 weeks; Grade III: 3–6 months or longer, especially with central tendon involvement [^0b453a93].
- **Recurrence**: High in the first 15 weeks after return; recent quadriceps injury is the strongest risk factor [^f9f57f36].
- **Long-term sequelae**: Chronic weakness, pain, and myositis ossificans can occur, particularly with inadequate rehabilitation or repeated trauma [^30aff3ab].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **eccentric strengthening** (e.g. lengthening exercises), neuromuscular training, and load management. Addressing modifiable risk factors — such as strength asymmetries, flexibility deficits, and training errors — also reduces injury risk [^676dc27a].

---

A strained quadriceps is diagnosed clinically and confirmed by MRI when severe or atypical; **most cases heal with conservative care**, while surgery is reserved for complete tears or refractory cases. Recurrence risk is highest early after return, so prevention and graded loading are essential.

Methods

This statement is divided into four sections: (1) hamstring, (2) adductor, (3) rectus femoris/quadriceps and (4) calf muscle strain injuries, and it includes three domains in each section: (1) diagnosis, (2) prevention and (3) treatment. We did not include studies solely reporting on non-acute problems, and/or clear traumatic injuries such as total muscle ruptures, avulsion injuries and muscle contusions. A systematic search was employed to identify literature for the three domains in each section, with inclusion of studies based on the highest level of available evidence. Data were synthesised and the quality of evidence were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group.

Search

Twelve systematic searches covering diagnosis, prevention and treatment for each of the four sections (1: hamstring, 2: adductor, 3: rectus femoris/quadriceps and 4: calf) were conducted in MEDLINE (via PubMed), CENTRAL and Embase (via Ovid) during July 2018 and updated in September 2019. No restrictions were applied concerning year of publication, however, only publications in English were included. We searched individual text words in title and abstract supplemented with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. We combined anatomical region of interest (eg, 'Groin (MeSH)' OR 'adductor' OR 'groin') AND type of injury (eg, 'Athletic Injury (MeSH)' OR 'Strains and Sprains (MeSH)' OR 'strain' OR 'injur' OR 're-injur' OR 'reinjur') AND outcome for diagnosis and treatment domains (eg, 'Diagnosis (MeSH)' OR 'exam' and 'Return To Sport' OR 'full training,' respectively) or intervention for prevention domains (eg, 'Primary Prevention (MeSHs)' OR 'Reduc'). If studies from one search was deemed relevant for one of the other 11 searches, the study was included as literature identified from other sources. In addition, reference lists of the included trials and relevant systematic reviews were scanned for relevant references.

### 'Serious thigh muscle strains': beware the intramuscular tendon which plays an important role in difficult hamstring and quadriceps muscle strains [^1397ac6c]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Thigh muscle injuries involving significant injury to the intramuscular tendon may be associated with prolonged RTP times and an increased incidence of recurrence.

Future research should aim at better understanding the involvement of the intramuscular tendon in muscle injuries, and investigating appropriate treatment interventions for this particular group of muscle injuries.

What are the findings?

Injuries involving the quadriceps or hamstring intramuscular tendon have prolonged rehabilitation and return to play times — they must be treated differently to 'muscle strains'.
Differentiation of these intramuscular tendon injuries seems particularly important in injuries to the biceps femoris and rectus femoris muscles.
If injury to these tendons is suspected, MRI is indicated for accurate diagnosis and athlete/player and coach/agent education.
There may be a role for surgical repair of the tendon in injuries with significant damage of the intramuscular tendon.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?

Improved recognition of injury of the intramuscular tendon may allow more accurate prediction of time to return to sport and thus, reduce risk of recurrence. This needs to be investigated further.
The role of surgical repair versus conservative management in some of these injuries is not clear. The options need to be weighed carefully and discussed appropriately (shared decision-making) until more data provide a basis for clear recommendations.

### Diagnosis, prevention and treatment of common lower extremity muscle injuries in sport-grading the evidence: a statement paper commissioned by the Danish society of sports physical therapy (DSSF) [^098b827b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have graded the quality of evidence concerning diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the most common muscle injuries and provide a comprehensive and up-to-date summary of the best available evidence. Most clinical tests showed very low to low diagnostic effectiveness. For hamstring injury prevention, programmes that included the Nordic hamstring exercise resulted in a risk reduction of 45% to 65% when compared with usual care. For prevention of groin injuries, both the FIFA 11+ programme and the Copenhagen adductor strengthening programme resulted in risk reduction of 41% when compared with usual care. For treatment of hamstring injuries, lengthening hamstring exercises showed fastest return to play with a lower reinjury rate when compared with conventional hamstring exercises. Platelet-rich plasma had no effect on time to return-to-play and reinjury risk after a hamstring injury when compared with placebo or rehabilitation. Most outcomes for all muscle injuries and domains were graded as very low to moderate quality of evidence, indicating that further high-quality research is likely to have an important impact on the confidence in the effect estimates. At this point, research on diagnosis, prevention and treatment of muscle injuries primarily concerns hamstring muscle injuries, with only limited research on quadriceps, adductor and calf muscle injuries. Furthermore, muscle injury prevention research is mainly conducted in football, whereas muscle injury treatment research is conducted across different sports.

What is already known

Lower extremity muscle strain injuries are very common in multidirectional sports.
The quality of evidence related to diagnosis, prevention and treatment for the most common muscle injuries (hamstring, adductor, calf, rectus femoris/quadriceps) have not been investigated.

What are the new findings

Most clinical tests for acute muscle injuries show very low to low diagnostic effectiveness.
Hamstring and groin injuries can be reduced 40% to 65% using specific exercise interventions.
Lengthening hamstring exercises show fastest return to play and lower reinjury rate compared with conventional exercises, and platelet-rich plasma offers no additional effect to current rehabilitation.
Most outcomes were graded as very low to moderate quality of evidence, thus further high-quality research is likely to have an important impact on the confidence in the effect estimates.

Introduction

Lower extremity muscle injuries are frequent in sports involving explosive actions such as high-speed running, jumping, change of direction and kicking. In professional football, muscle injuries constitute up to half of all injuries, and in sports, such as American football, Australian football, rugby, basketballand track and field, the incidence is also high. The majority of muscle injuries in football occur during non-contact situations, classified as 'indirect muscle injuries' or 'muscle strains'. These are typically thought to occur in the muscle-tendon junctionwhen the force applied exceeds the tissue capacity.

In football, muscle strain injuries constitute up to 31% of all injuries, and up to 37% of players experience absence from training and/or match play during a season due to a muscle injury. Besides from significant financial costs at the professional level, the high injury burden of muscle injuriesalso have substantial implications on player availability, potentially affecting team performance. Up to 92% of all muscle strain injuries encountered in football are located in the hamstrings (37%), adductors (23%), rectus femoris/quadriceps (19%) and calf muscles (13%), with hamstring strain injuries also being the most common diagnosis in sports such as Australian footballand track and field.

The fact that incidence of muscle strain injury has remained constant during the last decades in footballand Australian footballwith slightly increased incidence for hamstringand calf muscle strains, highlights the ongoing challenge of muscle strain injuries in sport. Thus, to aid management of common muscle injuries in sport, the aim of this statement, commissioned by the Danish Society of Sports Physical Therapy, was to provide an overview of the existing literature. We identify, evaluate and grade the quality of evidence concerning the diagnostic effectiveness of clinical tests and the effect of preventive and treatment strategies for the most common lower limb muscle injuries including hamstring, adductor, rectus femoris/quadriceps and calf muscle injuries.

METHODS

Item 8: selection process

Specify the methods used to decide whether a study met the inclusion criteria of the review, including how many reviewers screened each record and each report retrieved, whether they worked independently, and if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process.

Example: 'The selection of studies was a three-stage process, with the identified citations independently evaluated for inclusion by two reviewers. The first stage was evaluation of titles selected with systematic searches described above. The article was included in this first screen if the title identified athletes and/or lumbar discectomy. We then reviewed the abstracts of all articles identified as meeting the search criteria. Full-text articles meeting criteria were retrieved and read independently by both reviewers and assessed for inclusion in the study. Disagreement was resolved by consensus between the two reviewers and a third reviewer if consensus could not be reached'.

### Risk factors for quadriceps muscle strain injuries in sport: a systematic review [^676dc27a]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify risk factors for quadriceps muscle strain injury in sport.

Design

Risk factor systematic review.

Literature Search

A systematic search was conducted in the MEDLINECINAHL, Embase, AMED, AUSPORT, SPORTDiscus, PEDro, and Cochrane Library databases (from inception to September 2021).

Study Selection Criteria

Studies reporting prospective data to evaluate risk factors related to index and/or recurrent quadriceps muscle strain injury.

Data Synthesis

A risk-of-bias assessment (using a modified Quality in Prognosis Studies tool) was performed, and we used best-evidence synthesis to qualitatively synthesize the data to quantify relationships between risk factors and quadriceps muscle injury.

Results

Sixteen studies were included, capturing 2408 quadriceps injuries in 11 719 athletes. Meta-analyses were not performed due to clinical heterogeneity. The dominant kicking leg (over 3154 individuals, 1055 injuries), a previous history of quadriceps muscle injury (6208 individuals, 975 injuries), and a recent history of hamstring strain (4087 individuals, 581 injuries) were intrinsic factors associated with quadriceps injury. Extrinsic factors relating to the preseason period and competitive match play increased quadriceps injury risk; participating at higher levels of competition decreased quadriceps injury risk. Age, weight, and flexibility (intrinsic factors) had no association with quadriceps injury.

Conclusion

Previous quadriceps injury, recent hamstring injury, the dominant kicking leg, and competitive match play were the strongest risk factors for future quadriceps muscle injury in sport. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2022;52(6):389–400. doi:10.2519/jospt.2022.10870.

### Injuries to the rectus femoris: a review of evaluation, management, and return to sport [^f82ff116]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Injuries to the rectus femoris (RF) are an infrequently reported injury and can range from mild muscle strains to full tears, including injuries to the proximal and distal tendons of the RF. Patients often present with anterior thigh pain sustained after kicking or sprinting and describe a sudden "pop" in their thigh. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred modality for diagnosing the location, type, and severity of pathology. To date, there is no current treatment algorithm developed for managing these injuries. Nonsurgical management consists of rest, stretching, anti-inflammatory medications, gradual strengthening, and progressive functional rehabilitation before returning to activity. Injection therapy is sometimes used as well. Surgical treatment has typically been reserved for full-thickness muscle tears and tendon avulsions in high-level athletes. The literature has demonstrated that elite athletes have a high return to sport rate and do not have long-term effects. This review seeks to discuss the epidemiology, pathology, and outcomes of injuries to the RF muscle. Injuries to the quadriceps muscle in general are outside of the scope of this review.

### 'Serious thigh muscle strains': beware the intramuscular tendon which plays an important role in difficult hamstring and quadriceps muscle strains [^d5347f9b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Why do some hamstring and quadriceps strains take much longer to repair than others? Which injuries are more prone to recurrence? Intramuscular tendon injuries have received little attention as an element in 'muscle strain'. In thigh muscles, such as rectus femoris and biceps femoris, the attached tendon extends for a significant distance within the muscle belly. While the pathology of most muscle injures occurs at a musculotendinous junction, at first glance the athlete appears to report pain within a muscle belly. In addition to the musculotendinous injury being a site of pathology, the intramuscular tendon itself is occasionally injured. These injuries have a variety of appearances on MRIs. There is some evidence that these injuries require a prolonged rehabilitation time and may have higher recurrence rates. Therefore, it is important to recognise the tendon component of a thigh 'muscle strain'.

Domain 3: treatment

In total 217 studies were identified in the literature search; however, no studies on the effect of treatment of groin injury could be included.

Rectus femoris/quadriceps injuries

Domain 1: diagnostic tests

In total 8729 studies were identified in the literature search. Two cohort studieswere eligible, however, due to duplication of data between these studies, only the study focusing on diagnostic effectiveness was included (n = 81 athletes). Proximal rectus femoris palpation showed high diagnostic effectiveness when positive (LR+: 11.20) and negative (LR−: 0.00) in predicting a positive or negative rectus femoris injury on MRI (low to moderate quality of evidence). Furthermore, resisted knee extension showed high diagnostic effectiveness when negative (LR−: 0.00) in ruling out a rectus femoris injury on MRI (moderate quality of evidence). For the remaining tests (see table 6), very low to moderate diagnostic effectiveness (LR+: 1.45 to 5.47; LR−: 0.15 to 0.55) were observed (low to moderate quality of evidence).

Table 6

Domain 2: prevention

In total 3002 studies were identified in the literature search. No systematic reviews and five RCTs were included. As part of this statement data from Soligard et al and Silvers-Granelli et al was pooled post hoc, as this analysis was not available in the existing literature. Based on this, the FIFA 11+ programme showed a small and not significant effect versus usual care (RR: 0.73, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.12; I² = 0.0%) in reducing anterior thigh injuries in football (n = 3417) (low quality of evidence). Data from individual studiesare presented in table 7.

Domain 3: treatment

In total 484 studies were identified in the search. No systematic reviews or RCT's were included. One study (case-series) was included with a total of 18 Australian rules football players. A two-phase criteria-based intervention with increasing running and kicking intensity led to a return to full training at a mean of 13 days (range: 2 to 43) with no reinjuries during an unreported time-frame (very low quality of evidence).

### Acute quadriceps muscle strains: magnetic resonance imaging features and prognosis [^0b453a93]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

There has been no research examining the magnetic resonance imaging findings, and in turn the prognosis, for a series of acute quadriceps muscle strains.

Hypothesis

The magnetic resonance imaging findings of acute quadriceps muscle strain injuries are helpful in predicting their prognosis.

Study Design

Causal-comparative study.

Method

Forty professional players of Australian Rules football were followed over 3 years. Magnetic resonance imaging examinations were performed within 24 to 72 hours of muscle-strain injury. Imaging features of muscle strain injury included the anatomical location, size (cross-sectional area and length), and site (proximal, middle, or distal). The time from injury to return to full training was termed the rehabilitation interval.

Results

25 clinical quadriceps muscle strain injuries occurred, with 15 cases involving the rectus femoris. The rectus femoris injuries could be further categorized into cases with straining about the central tendon (n = 7, mean rehabilitation interval = 26.9 days) or cases with straining in the periphery (n = 8, mean rehabilitation interval = 9.2 days). Six cases involved one of the vastus muscles (mean rehabilitation interval = 4.4 days). Three players had normal magnetic resonance imaging examinations (mean rehabilitation interval = 5.7 days).

Conclusions

The rectus femoris-central tendon injury is the red flag diagnosis associated with a significantly longer rehabilitation interval.

Clinical Relevance

Magnetic resonance imaging is helpful in predicting the prognosis for acute quadriceps strains.

### Rectus femoris muscle injuries in football: a clinically relevant review of mechanisms of injury, risk factors and preventive strategies [^95edd789]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Quadriceps muscle strains frequently occur in sports that require repetitive kicking and sprinting, and are common in football in its different forms around the world. This paper is a review of aetiology, mechanism of injury and the natural history of rectus femoris injury. Investigating the mechanism and risk factors for rectus femoris muscle injury aims to allow the development of a framework for future initiatives to prevent quadriceps injury in football players.

### Quadriceps injuries [^fb243ef3]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Injuries to the quadriceps muscle group are common in athletes performing high-speed running and kicking sports. The complex anatomy of the rectus femoris puts it at greatest risk of injury. There is variability in prognosis in the literature, with reinjury rates as high as 67% in the severe graded proximal tear. Studies have highlighted that athletes can reinjure after nonoperative management, and some benefit may be derived from surgical repair to restore function and return to sport (RTS). This injury is potentially career-threatening in the elite-level athlete, and we aim to highlight the key recent literature on interventions to restore strength and function to allow early RTS while reducing the risk of injury recurrence. This article reviews the optimal diagnostic strategies and classification of quadriceps injuries. We highlight the unique anatomy of each injury on MRI and the outcomes of both nonoperative and operative treatment, providing an evidence-based management framework for athletes.

The rectus femoris muscle is the most frequently involved quadriceps muscle in strain pathologies. The majority of quadriceps muscle belly injuries can be successfully treated conservatively and even significant tears in the less active and older population, non-operative management is a reasonable option. The authors report the delayed presentation of a 17-year-old male who sustained an injury to his rectus femoris muscle belly while playing football. This young patient did not recover the functional outcome required to get back to running and participating in sport despite 15 months of physiotherapy and non-operative management. Operative treatment using the ligament augmentation and reconstruction system ligament to augment Kessler repair allowed immediate full passive flexion of the knee and an early graduated physiotherapy programme. Our patient was able to return to running and his previous level of sport without any restrictions.

Discussion

The following sections discuss the statements for each type of injury and domain including the limitations in the existing literature.

Hamstring injuries

Domain 1: diagnostic tests

Based on the existing literature, conducted mostly in male football players, very low to low diagnostic effectiveness was observed for most clinical tests. This means that the shift in pre-test to post-test probability, and thus the change in the certainty of an injury or not, was minimal for most tests. For example, in Wangensteen et al the certainty of an MRI-defined hamstring injury was 78% (pre-test probability) before clinical testing, and this changed to 80% to 84% for a positive test and to 59% to 73% for a negative test (moderate to high quality of evidence). In practice, this means that 59% to 73% of players will still have a hamstring injury following a negative test, and thus commonly used tests, such as pain during strength testing and/or stretching of the hamstring muscles, seems to provide limited value in ruling in or out a hamstring injury. This, notion is confirmed by Schneider-Kolsky et al, who observed no shift in pre-test to post-test probability (67% to 67%) following a cluster of tests (moderate quality of evidence). The only test with high diagnostic effectiveness was the 'Taking off shoe test,' which showed perfect agreement with ultrasound when positive, which means that a negative test is highly effective at ruling out a hamstring injury. However, the study was associated with serious risk of bias due to lack of blinding, which results in very low quality of evidence for this test. The limited diagnostic effectiveness of most tests may be explained by inclusion of athletes with acute onset of posterior thigh pain during sportor a verified hamstring injury on ultrasonography, that is a high pre-test probability of a hamstring strain injury. Thus, if a clear medical history, such as self-reported onset of acute posterior thigh pain during sport, is present it is questionable whether pain on stretching and/or contraction provide additional value in the clinical setting when diagnosing hamstring strain injuries, despite being considered important by most experts.

### Hamstring strain injuries: recommendations for diagnosis, rehabilitation, and injury prevention [^1bf9d721]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Hamstring strain injuries remain a challenge for both athletes and clinicians, given their high incidence rate, slow healing, and persistent symptoms. Moreover, nearly one third of these injuries recur within the first year following a return to sport, with subsequent injuries often being more severe than the original. This high reinjury rate suggests that commonly utilized rehabilitation programs may be inadequate at resolving possible muscular weakness, reduced tissue extensibility, and/or altered movement patterns associated with the injury. Further, the traditional criteria used to determine the readiness of the athlete to return to sport may be insensitive to these persistent deficits, resulting in a premature return. There is mounting evidence that the risk of reinjury can be minimized by utilizing rehabilitation strategies that incorporate neuromuscular control exercises and eccentric strength training, combined with objective measures to assess musculotendon recovery and readiness to return to sport. In this paper, we first describe the diagnostic examination of an acute hamstring strain injury, including discussion of the value of determining injury location in estimating the duration of the convalescent period. Based on the current available evidence, we then propose a clinical guide for the rehabilitation of acute hamstring injuries, including specific criteria for treatment progression and return to sport. Finally, we describe directions for future research, including injury-specific rehabilitation programs, objective measures to assess reinjury risk, and strategies to prevent injury occurrence.

Rectus femoris/quadriceps injuries

Domain 1: diagnostic tests

One study including primarily male football players was included. However, it should be noted that this study only included athletes with acute onset of groin pain, and thus only encompass proximal rectus femoris injuries. High diagnostic effectiveness was observed for proximal rectus femoris palpation in predicting a rectus femoris injury in MRI-positive cases, that is cases are only included if they had positive MRI. The test showed a substantial shift in pre-test to post-test probability from 13% to 62% for a positive test and from 13% to 0% for a negative test. Although the test showed high diagnostic effectiveness, the post-test probability of 62% suggest that a positive test is still associated with large uncertainties in the diagnosis; that is one out of three athletes with a positive palpation test do not have an injury. Conversely, the clinician can be fairly certain that no injury is present if the athlete report no pain on palpation. Currently, no evidence is available concerning potential implications for return-to-play prognosis, and thus all tests were downgraded due to indirectness (clinical value of a negative or positive test unknown).

Domain 2: prevention

The highest quality of evidence for a preventive effect was observed for the FIFA 11+ programme compared with usual care, which resulted in a 27% lower risk (non-significant) of quadriceps/anterior thigh injuries (low quality of evidence). Since the FIFA 11+ programme improve hip and knee strength, the preventive effect could result from this. It should, however, be noted that anterior thigh injuries may encompass different injury locations, and thus the effect on rectus femoris injuries is uncertain. Furthermore, none of the included studies investigated the preventive effect on rectus femoris/quadriceps injuries as the primary outcome measure.

Domain 3: treatment

Limited literature was found to guide treatment of rectus femoris/quadriceps injuries. Thus, a single small case-series in male Australian rules football observed no reinjuries after a two-phase criteria-based intervention with increasing running and kicking intensity (very low quality of evidence). It should, however, be noted that assessment of reinjury rate was not the purpose of the study, and thus these findings should be treated with caution.

### Hamstring muscle strain recurrence and strength performance disorders [^27482578]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We determined the frequency of strength disorders in 26 athletes with a history of hamstring muscle injury and recurrent strains and discomfort. We also assessed the effectiveness of rehabilitation to correct muscle performance. After concentric and eccentric isokinetic assessment, 18 athletes were found to have strength deficits, as determined by statistically selected cutoffs of peak torque, bilateral differences, and the flexors/quadriceps ratio. The discriminating character of the eccentric trial was demonstrated, combining a preferential eccentric peak torque deficit and a significant reduction of the mixed eccentric flexors/concentric quadriceps ratio. The athletes with muscle imbalances followed a rehabilitation program individually adapted from their strength profile. Treatment length was from 10 to 30 sessions and resulted in isokinetic parameter normalization in 17 of 18 subjects. Isokinetically corrected subjects were observed for 12 months after return to athletics. None sustained a clinically diagnosed hamstring muscle reinjury. Subjective intensity of pain and discomfort were significantly reduced, and they all returned to their prior level of competition. These results demonstrate that persistent muscle strength abnormalities may give rise to recurrent hamstring injuries and discomfort. An individualized rehabilitation program emphasizing eccentric training based on specific deficits contributes to a decrease in symptoms on return to sports.

Domain 2: prevention

Several interventions for prevention of groin injuries have been investigated primarily in football including both males and females, however, no RCT's have specifically reported on adductor strain injuries. Thus, the quality of evidence for all studies/outcomes have been downgraded due to indirectness. The highest quality of evidence for a preventive effect was observed for an adductor strengthening programme consisting of the Copenhagen adduction exerciseperformed at different levels of intensity (moderate quality of evidence). The outcome measure in the study was the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center Overuse Injury Questionnaire, which captures all problems rather than only time-loss injuries. Thus, the risk reduction of 41% following the adductor strengthening programme encompass all groin problems from delayed onset muscle soreness to more severe injuries, hence the preventive effect specifically on acute adductor strain injures is uncertain. The FIFA 11+ programme also showed a medium risk reduction of 42% in football players and is a viable option for prevention of groin injuries. The preventive effect of an adductor strengthening programmeindicates the importance to focus on hip adduction strength gains for prevention. These findings are partly in line with prevention practices of groin injuries in football, with a recent survey of 64 professional youth academies demonstrating focus on adductor strengthening, although only few academies specifically performed the Copenhagen adduction exercise.

Domain 3: treatment

No studies were identified for treatment of acute adductor injuries, which is remarkable since acute adductor injuries are considered a common muscle injury in football. However, based on current literature concerning long-standing adductor-related pain, an exercise-based approach with a large focus on strengthening the adductor muscles has been recommended.

### Hamstring strain injury in athletes [^ee077bbf]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Hamstring strain injury clinical diagnosis — presentation and directive: Clinicians should make a diagnosis of HSI when an individual presents with a sudden onset of posterior or thigh pain during activity, pain reproduced with hamstring stretching and/or activation, muscle tenderness with palpation, and loss of function. Although evidence for the use of clinical examination to diagnose an HSI is limited, an individual with an acute injury typically presents with a sudden onset of well-localized posterior thigh pain, muscle tenderness, and loss of function, and hamstring group stretching and/or activation may reproduce the pain.

### Traumatic muscle injury [^85c58440]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Traumatic muscle injury represents a collection of skeletal muscle pathologies caused by trauma to the muscle tissue and is defined as damage to the muscle tissue that can result in a functional deficit. Traumatic muscle injury can affect people across the lifespan and can result from high stresses and strains to skeletal muscle tissue, often due to muscle activation while the muscle is lengthening, resulting in indirect and non-contact muscle injuries (strains or ruptures), or from external impact, resulting in direct muscle injuries (contusion or laceration). At a microscopic level, muscle fibres can repair focal damage but must be completely regenerated after full myofibre necrosis. The diagnosis of muscle injury is based on patient history and physical examination. Imaging may be indicated to eliminate differential diagnoses. The management of muscle injury has changed within the past 5 years from initial rest, immobilization and (over)protection to early activation and progressive loading using an active approach. One challenge of muscle injury management is that numerous medical treatment options, such as medications and injections, are often used or proposed to try to accelerate muscle recovery despite very limited efficacy evidence. Another challenge is the prevention of muscle injury owing to the multifactorial and complex nature of this injury.

### Hamstring strain injury in athletes [^cd8b0577]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for hamstring injury, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, APTA 2022 guidelines recommend to diagnose hamstring strain injury in patients presenting with a sudden onset of posterior thigh pain during activity, with pain reproduced when the hamstring is stretched and/or activated, muscle tenderness with palpation, and loss of function.

### Vastus lateralis strain associated with patellofemoral pain syndrome: a report of 2 cases [^ac4783da]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Muscle strains of the quadriceps group are common, and occur mostly in the rectus femoris. Strains occur most often when muscles are suddenly activated while on stretch, during either eccentric or concentric contraction. We report 2 cases of vastus lateralis strain that occurred in association with clinical histories of patellofemoral pain syndrome. Symptoms described included anterior knee pain associated with prolonged sitting with the knee flexed, and anterior knee pain associated with running, stair climbing, and jumping. These symptoms preceded the acute strain by at least 1 year. These cases emphasize a clinician's need to understand knee biomechanics, and the need to consider the entire kinetic chain when managing pain and injury in an extremity.

### Muscle contusion injuries: current treatment options [^0c87c682]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

Muscle contusion is second only to strain as the leading cause of morbidity from sports-related injuries. Severity depends on the site of impact, the activation status of the muscles involved, the age of the patient, and the presence of fatigue. The diagnosis has traditionally been one of clinical judgment; however, newer modalities, including ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and spectroscopy, are becoming increasingly important in both identifying and delineating the extent of injury. Although controlled clinical studies are scarce, animal research into muscle contusions has allowed the description of the natural healing process, which involves a complex balance between muscle repair, regeneration, and scar-tissue formation. Studies are being performed to evaluate the effects of anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroids, operative repair, and exercise protocols. Prevention and treatment of complications such as myositis ossificans have also been stressed, but recognition may improve the outcome of these ubiquitous injuries.

### 'Serious thigh muscle strains': beware the intramuscular tendon which plays an important role in difficult hamstring and quadriceps muscle strains [^5d09bb61]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The study demonstrated that injuries that extend into the tendon were associated with a substantial increased risk of recurrence of injury and an increased time to return to full training.

There was a significant difference within classifications 1a–3c for time to return to full training. Separate linear regression analysis of grade and site demonstrated that grade 3 severity (p < 0.001) and intratendinous (c) site (p = 0.008) were associated with an increase in the time to return to full training. Grade 3c injuries (N = 7) had a mean return time of 84 days (SD 49.4, range 40–128) compared with grade 2b injuries (N = 17) with return time of 21 days (SD 10.2, range 12–49) and 2c injuries (N = 8) of 27 days (SD 49.4, range 40–128). No significant differences were found between grades 1 and 2 (t = −1.138, p = 0.263) or between classifications (a) and (b) (t = −0.240, p = 0.812).

There was also a significant difference within classifications 1a–3c with respect to injury recurrence. Separate binary logistic analysis of grade and site suggested that grade was not associated with recurrence (p = 0.133–0.968), but that intratendon injuries (c) were associated with a higher risk of recurrence (p = 0.002). This significantly increased repeat injury rate was 63% in 2c injuries and 57% in 3c injuries. In comparison, the repeat injury rate in 2b injuries was only 6% (p < 0.001) and there were no recurrences in any myofascial (a) injury class.

Prolonged recovery time and higher rate of injury recurrence both have enormous clinical implications especially for the elite athlete. There is a vigorous debate about the utility of MRI in hamstring strain. In this clinical setting, we argue that high-quality MRI is indicated to identify possible tendon disruption that accompany biceps femoris injuries. A positive diagnosis would influence management.

Imaging appearance

MRI of the disrupted intramuscular tendon demonstrates a wavy retracted appearance as opposed to the normal taut cord-like appearance (figure 2 A). Sometimes, as the tendon fails, the tendon strands unravel and give way similar to a piece of intertwined rope. The tendon consequently loses its taut appearance, but there is no gap in the tendon, despite it losing its tensile strength (figure 2 B). In some cases, there is longitudinal delamination and splitting of the intramuscular tendon (figure 2 C), which otherwise appears continuous. In other cases, the tendon may retract and create a gap (figure 2 D).

Tendon failure. (A) Coronal fat suppressed image of a 23-year-old footballer with sudden onset of anterior thigh pain when sprinting for the ball, demonstrates myofibril tearing (solid arrow) on either side of the intramuscular tendon rachis of the rectus femoris to create a feather-like appearance. The intramuscular tendon is intact but has a wavy contour (open arrow) suggesting the rachis has begun to fail.(B) Coronal fat-saturated sequence of a 19-year-old footballer with sudden hamstring failure when running, demonstrates failure of the proximal intramuscular tendon rachis (arrow) with tendon strands unravelling. However, given that the tendon remained broadly contiguous (with no tendon gap), the athlete was treated in a conservative manner with return to competition 6 weeks later. (C) Axial fat-suppressed image demonstrates longitudinal delamination and splitting of the biceps femoris intramuscular tendon (open arrow). However, no gap is seen. Note haemorrhage surrounding the muscle (solid arrows).(D) A 29-year-old footballer with a history of a rectus femoris strain returns to competition only to sustain another injury. On examination, there is a palpable defect in the anterior thigh at the junction of the middle and distal thirds of the thigh. Coronal fat suppressed image demonstrates failure of the intramuscular tendon rachis of rectus femoris with tendon retraction filled with blood products to create a 'bull's eye' or 'target' lesion (arrow). Note the torn adjacent muscle fibres with no connective scaffold to hang on to. The defect will take some time for granulation tissue to fill, and indeed may never completely do so, leaving the athlete with a residual defect.

### The efficacy of acupuncture, exercise rehabilitation, and their combination in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis: a randomized controlled trial [^89068bcc]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

According to our research, manual acupuncture combined with exercise rehabilitation is highly effective at reducing pain and symptoms associated with KOA. The positive effects of this treatment approach were observed both during the treatment period and in the subsequent eight weeks. Notably, our results indicate that acupuncture is more efficacious in alleviating pain compared to exercise rehabilitation. Among the three groups studied, the group receiving both acupuncture and exercise rehabilitation exhibited the highest response rate, surpassing the other groups significantly. Specifically, the response rate in the AE group was notably higher than the AP group at both the second and twelfth weeks. Additionally, the AE group demonstrated a significantly higher response rate compared to the ER group in the fourth and eighth weeks.

Researchers have demonstrated a lack of discernible differences between manual acupuncture and sham acupuncture in previous studies, which indicates a placebo effect in acupuncture. This study utilized manual acupuncture exclusively, without the use of additional stimuli such as moxibustion or electric pulse stimulation, and the needles were not left in place to extend the duration of stimulation. Additionally, he frequency of therapy was lower compared to other similar trials, with sessions occurring only twice a week for a total of eight sessions. Still, the results of manual acupuncture are fascinating. What is the cause of this phenomenon? The efficacy of KOA treatment is significantly impacted by the choice of acupuncture points and stimulation techniques. The selection of acupoints in this study deviates from previous semi-quantitative methods, we stimulate the quadriceps femoris Ashi point. With a focus on stimulating the quadriceps femoris Ashi point similar to dry acupuncture at the Myofascial Trigger Point. Given the quadriceps muscle's substantial size and role in knee joint biomechanical stability, alterations in its size and mass have been associated with KOA development. The straining of the quadriceps muscle can lead to knee joint instability, misalignment of the lower extremities, and the development of symptoms such as joint effusion, bone hyperplasia, and cartilage degeneration. Therefore, improving the condition of the quadriceps is crucial in the management of knee osteoarthritis. Utilizing acupuncture at the Ashi point has been identified as an effective method for alleviating muscle strain. In contrast to the conventional technique involving "lifting, inserting, and twisting", our manual acupuncture procedure does not prioritize the attainment of "deqi" or "muscle twitches". Rather, we employ specific acupuncture techniques to target the Ashi point from various angles, resulting in a more pronounced therapeutic outcome.

### Quadriceps strain and TKA: contribution of the tourniquet and intramedullary rod to postoperative thigh pain: a randomized controlled trial [^fe56a934]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Thigh pain is relatively common after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and has been attributed to compression of the thigh muscles by the tourniquet used during surgery. Thigh pain that occurs after a TKA that was performed without a tourniquet may be due to a strain of the quadriceps muscle or insertion of the intramedullary (IM) rod. The purpose of the present study was to determine the cause of thigh pain after TKA in a randomized controlled trial evaluating tourniquet use, IM rod use, and quadriceps strain.

Methods

This prospective randomized controlled trial enrolled 97 subjects undergoing primary knee arthroplasty into 4 groups according to tourniquet use (yes or no) and IM rod use (yes or no). Quadriceps strain was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on postoperative day 1 (POD 1). Data collected preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively until the 6-week clinical visit included pain levels for the knee and thigh (recorded separately) and knee range of motion.

Results

Regardless of tourniquet or IM rod use, 73 (75%) of the 97 patients reported thigh pain on POD 1. Thigh pain at 2 weeks postoperatively was indicative of a quadriceps strain. Use of a tourniquet and patient-reported thigh pain at 2 weeks increased the odds of a quadriceps strain, whereas IM rod use did not significantly contribute to thigh pain.

Conclusions

The etiology of thigh pain after TKA may be multifactorial; however, an iatrogenic quadriceps strain is one source of thigh pain after TKA, especially if the pain persists 2 weeks after surgery.

### Resistive exercise for arthritic cartilage health (REACH): a randomized double-blind, sham-exercise controlled trial [^b7e95598]. BMC Geriatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A rationale for implementing progressive resistance training as a disease-modifying treatment for knee osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders in the world, affecting 9.6% of men and 18.0% of women ≥ 60 years of age worldwide. In 1997, arthritis and other rheumatic conditions cost the United States (US) $86 billion dollars (equating to approximately 1% of the US gross domestic product). The development and progression of OA is multifactorial, with quadriceps weakness, joint malalignment, obesity, and abnormal mechanical joint forces particularly relevant to this study.

Is quadriceps weakness a cause or a consequence of knee OA?

Some studies conclude that quadriceps weakness is a possible preceding factor in the development of OA, while other studies support the possibility that quadriceps weakness contributes to disease progression. Irrespective of the timing, once OA has developed, quadriceps weakness reduces the ability to decelerate leg movement and the leg is less able to absorb impulse loads transmitted through the tibiofemoral joint; leading to an acceleration of cartilage degeneration.

Medial compartment OA is associated with varus malalignment, and lateral compartment OA is associated with valgus malalignment. A vicious cycle of malalignment then exists, whereby joint malalignment worsens the underlying excessive joint compartment forces (i.e. varus alignment increases the medial compartment load, and valgus alignment increases lateral compartment load in the knee during gait) which contribute to OA progression in the respective compartments. Knee malalignment is also considered to be a likely mediator of the OA-obesity relationship, as increased loading of malaligned, weakly supported joints accentuates the malalignment. Tendon stiffness is directly associated with muscle strength; having stiffer tendons (less tendon elongation) improves the overall function and efficiency of the tendon as a stabilizer of the joint. By contrast, human studies have shown strengthening muscles (an adaptation to progressive resistance training (PRT)) increases stiffness and Young's Modulus in tendons around the knee joint which reduces the risk of tendon strain, and increases joint stability.

### Chronic tears of the reflected head of the rectus femoris: results of operative treatment [^00d395bd]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

While the majority of quadriceps muscle strains can be managed nonoperatively, rare cases remain symptomatic despite nonoperative treatment.

Purpose

The purpose of this study is to report on results of surgical treatment of a limited number of cases of persistently symptomatic tears of the reflected head of the rectus femoris.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

The records of 5 patients with chronic tears of the rectus femoris treated with excision of the reflected head were reviewed. A telephone interview regarding return to sport and current limitations was completed if patients were available for further follow-up.

Results

A review of 5 cases of surgical treatment of chronic tears of the reflected head of the rectus was completed. Patients included 1 woman and 4 men with an average age of 21 years (range, 18–24 years). Three patients played football (2 kickers) and 2 played soccer at a collegiate level. All 5 reported a significant decrease in pain during sport and activities of daily living and were able to return to collegiate athletics. Two patients had a late recurrence of pain with kicking that resolved with nonoperative treatment, 1 had residual thigh pain with intense play, 1 had no pain but noted decreased kicking accuracy, and 1 patient returned to play without symptoms.

Conclusion

Strain injuries to the reflected head of the rectus femoris can benefit from delayed excision in rare cases that fail nonoperative management. High-level kicking athletes are likely to experience significant reduction in pain, but may have some residual or recurrent symptoms that limit competitive level of play postoperatively.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^4f52cb30]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.4 radiculopathy mimics

4.4.1 Quadriceps muscle contusions or strains

Quadriceps contusion, strain, or conceivably tendon rupture could mimic lumbar radiculopathy based on knee extension weakness and/or the localization of pain in the anterior thigh. Quadriceps strains commonly occur at the musculotendinous junction at the distal anterior thigh, where there may be palpation tenderness, and typically occur as a result of forceful and often eccentric loads. Contusions are often associated with a direct trauma with hard objects, such as with sports injuries. In patients with quadriceps strains, pain can often be produced with active or passive lengthening of the quadriceps muscles by knee flexion or hip extension. In patients with quadriceps contusions, pain is typically worsened with knee flexion and there is often a palpable protuberance and tenderness at the site of contusion. Symptoms with both conditions can be aggravated by weightbearing and ambulation, which can be contrasted with lumbar radiculopathy. The presence of bruising should also lead the clinician to favor the diagnosis of quadriceps musculotendinous pathology over radiculopathy. The diagnosis is clinical but can be confirmed with US or MRI.

4.4.2 Knee osteoarthritis

Knee OA is highly prevalent especially with advancing age. Approximately one in eight adults ≥ 55 years of age experience knee pain attributable to knee OA. The clinical history is often described as slowly progressive non‐radiating whole knee pain that is worse with walking and weightbearing and improved with rest. Patients with knee OA may report knee instability or weakness, which may also be present on examination. By history, knee pain worse with use has a sensitivity of 0.95 and a specificity of 0.19.

Typical examination findings include bony enlargement (sensitivity 0.55, specificity 0.95), joint line tenderness, malalignment (e.g. varus or valgus), crepitus with ROM (sensitivity 0.89, specificity 0.60), and restricted range of motion, especially knee flexion (sensitivity 0.17, specificity 0.96). It is important for the clinician to also assess passive range of motion of the hip given the well‐known yet often overlooked phenomenon of hip OA with pain that localizes to the knee rather than the hip itself.

Plain radiographs can confirm the diagnosis, assign severity, and offers clinicians guidance on expected symptom progression.

Hamstring strain injury in athletes — Appendix E procedures for assigning levels of evidence state that level of evidence is assigned based on study design using the levels-of-evidence table (APPENDIX D) assuming high quality (eg, for intervention, randomized clinical trial starts at level I), that study quality is assessed using a critical appraisal tool with the study assigned 1 of 4 overall quality ratings based on critical appraisal results, and that the level-of-evidence assignment is adjusted based on the overall quality rating. For high quality (high confidence in the estimate/results), the study remains at its assigned level of evidence, and high quality should include randomized clinical trial with greater than 80% follow-up, blinding, and appropriate randomization procedures; cohort study includes greater than 80% follow-up; diagnostic study includes a consistently applied reference standard and blinding; and prevalence study is a cross-sectional study using a local and current random sample or censuses. Acceptable quality (the study does not meet requirements for high quality and weaknesses limit the confidence in the accuracy of the estimate): downgrade 1 level; low quality: the study has significant limitations that substantially limit confidence in the estimate: downgrade 2 levels; and unacceptable quality entails serious limitations — exclude from consideration in the guideline.

Groin pain is a common cause of pain in the athlete and may be the result of a variety of causes. Musculoskeletal groin injuries are often associated with muscle strain, particularly the adductor and abdominal muscles, termed "core muscle injury" (CMI). Since the early 1960s, there have been a growing number of articles intending to identify, define, prevent, and treat this condition; to date, however, the lack of a universal definition and treatment approach has complicated the narrative around CMI. This article intends to review the recent literature surrounding CMI, identifying common defining characteristics, as well as delineating treatment protocols that benefit the injured patient populations. Emphasis is placed on the clinical outcomes of different treatment methodologies and failure rates.

Rupture of the quadriceps tendon is an uncommon yet serious injury requiring prompt diagnosis and early surgical management. It is more common in older (> 40 years) individuals and sometimes is associated with underlying medical conditions. In particular, bilateral spontaneous rupture may be associated with gout, diabetes, or use of steroids. Clinical findings typically include the triad of acute pain, impaired knee extension, and a suprapatellar gap. Imaging studies are useful in confirming the diagnosis. Although incomplete tears may be managed nonsurgically, complete ruptures are best treated with early surgical repair.

Scope and rationale — The hamstring muscle group consists of 3 muscles in the posterior thigh (semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris), and hamstring strain injury (HSI) may cause considerable impairment, activity limitation, and participation restriction, including time lost from competitive sports; in professional sports, HSIs may be associated with significant financial costs, the high reinjury rate is also an important issue, and classification typically considers involved muscle, anatomical location, and severity of damage with possible myofascial, musculotendinous, and/or intratendinous involvement; mechanisms for HSIs have been described as eccentric overloading and/or overstretching in hip flexion and knee extension, and different mechanisms may be associated with unique injury locations and characteristics.

### Fifteen-week window for recurrent muscle strains in football: a prospective cohort of 3600 muscle strains over 23 years in professional Australian rules football [^f9f57f36]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the rates of muscle strain injury recurrence over time after return to play in Australian football and to quantify risk factors.

Methods

We analysed Australian Football League player data from 1992 to 2014 for rates of the four major muscle strain injury types (hamstring, quadriceps, calf and groin) diagnosed by team health professionals. Covariates for analysis were: recent history (≤ 8 weeks) of each of the four muscle strains; non-recent history (> 8 weeks) of each; history of hip, knee anterior cruciate ligament, knee cartilage, ankle sprain, concussion or lumbar injury; age; indigenous race; match level and whether a substitute rule was in place.

Results

3647 (1932 hamstring, 418 quadriceps, 458 calf and 839 groin) muscle strain injuries occurred in 272759 player matches. For all muscle strains combined, the risk of injury recurrence gradually reduced, with recurrence risks of 9% (hamstring), 5% (quadriceps), 2% (calf) and 6% (groin) in the first match back and remaining elevated for 15 weeks after return to play. The strongest risk factor for each muscle injury type was a recent history of the same injury (hamstring: adjusted OR 13.1, 95%CI 11.5 to 14.9; calf OR 13.3, 95%CI 9.6 to 18.4; quadriceps: OR 25.2, 95%CI 18.8 to 33.8; groin OR 20.6, 95%CI 17.0 to 25.0), followed by non-recent history of the same injury (hamstring: adjusted OR 3.5, 95%CI 3.2 to 3.9; calf OR 4.4, 95%CI 3.6 to 5.4; quadriceps OR 5.2, 95%CI 4.2 to 6.4; groin OR 3.5, 95%CI 3.0 to 4.0). Age was an independent risk factor for calf muscle strains (adjusted OR 1.6, 95%CI 1.3 to 2.0). Recent hamstring injury increased the risk of subsequent quadriceps (adjusted OR 1.8, 95%CI 1.2 to 2.7) and calf strains (OR 1.8, 95%CI 1.2 to 2.6). During the 'substitute rule' era (2011–2014), hamstring (adjusted OR 0.76, 95%CI 0.67 to 0.86), groin (OR 0.78, 95%CI 0.65 to 0.93) and quadriceps (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.53 to 0.92) strains were less likely than outside of that era but calf (OR 1.6, 95%CI 1.3 to 1.9) strains were more likely than before the substitute rule era.

Conclusion

Recent injury is the greatest risk factor for the four major muscle strains, with increased risk persisting for 15 weeks after return to play.

Grading and prognosis

Muscle injuries in athletes are quite diverse and challenging to precisely define. So far, a clear consensus on a clinical grading system does not exist. Every grading system has its strengths and weaknesses. The term muscle strain, though it is not consistently interpreted, is often used. In order to determine the most suitable therapy and to estimate the time to return to play, a clinical examination is performed. It is generally based on a grading into three levels, considering bulge and loss of strength. One of the most commonly used clinical grading systems was introduced by O'Donoghue in 1962. Since then, several other muscle injury classifications were proposed, as presented in Table 2.

Table 2
Clinical grading systems for muscle injuries

The most common MRI-based grading system of muscle injuries, modified by the ultrasound-based Peetrons classification, distinguishes four grades (Table 3). It provides only a rough estimate, and it suffers from the drawback of the wide range of grade 2 injuries and the non-existence of a rating for the tendon's intramuscular component. Grade 0 is used in cases with a normal MRI. Grade 1 includes all cases with an MRI showing edema, but no structural damage or hemorrhage (Fig. 2). Grade 2 is a partial and grade 3 a complete tear of the muscle (Fig. 3). The time to return to play is closely correlated to the grade — the higher the grade, the longer the time to return to play. The MRI correlate of a grade 1 muscle strain is an intramuscular hyperintensity on fluid-sensitive sequences without evidence of muscle fiber disruption (Fig. 2). The wide range of grade 2 injuries comprises tiny fiber discontinuities (Fig. 3) to large subtotal muscle ruptures (Fig. 4). A grade 3 injury represents a complete muscle tear (Fig. 5). In grade 3 injuries, the extent of muscle retraction needs to be determined and reported. Grade 3 injuries may require surgery.

Type of injury

Ligament sprains were the most common type of injury in elite adult women's football (34%, 617/1810), followed by muscle strains (27%, 482/1810) and blunt soft tissue trauma (contusions & haematomas) (21%, 387/1810). In domestic club football, ligament sprains (37%, 517/1413) were the most common type of injury, followed by muscle strains (31%, 441/1413) and blunt soft tissue trauma (contusions and haematomas) (15%, 214/1413). (online supplemental appendix S9).

In football tournaments, using a medical attention injury definition, blunt soft tissue trauma (contusions and haematomas) was the most common type of injury (44%, 165/378) followed by ligament sprains (25%, 96/378) and muscle strains (10%, 38/378) (online supplemental appendix S9). Blunt soft tissue trauma (42%, 8/19), ligament sprains (21%, 4/19) and muscle strains (16%, 3/19) were the most common types of injury in tournament football utilising a time-loss injury definition.

Ankle ligament sprains (43%, 131/308) was the most common injury diagnosis, followed by quadriceps muscle strains (16%, 48/308) and knee ligament sprains (12%, 38/308) where available injury diagnosis data was gleaned from the following studies.

### Efficacy of ultrasound elastography in detecting active myositis in children: can it replace MRI? [^61f2c8e5]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathy is a rare yet potentially debilitating condition. MRI is used both for diagnosis and to assess response to treatment. No study has evaluated the performance of US elastography in the diagnosis of this condition in children.

Objective

To assess the performance of compression-strain US elastography in detecting active myositis in children with clinically confirmed juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathy and to compare its efficacy to MRI.

Materials and Methods

Children with juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathy underwent non-contrast MR imaging as well as compression-strain US elastography of the quadriceps muscles. Imaging findings from both modalities were compared to each other as well as to the clinical determination of active disease based on physical examination and laboratory data. Active myositis on MR was defined as increased muscle signal on T2-weighted images. Elastography images were defined as normal or abnormal based on a previously published numerical scale of muscle elastography in normal children. Muscle echogenicity was graded as normal or abnormal based on gray-scale sonographic images.

Results

Twenty-one studies were conducted in 18 pediatric patients (15 female, 3 male; age range 3–19 years). Active myositis was present on MRI in ten cases. There was a significant association between abnormal MRI and clinically active disease (P = 0.012). US elastography was abnormal in 4 of 10 cases with abnormal MRI and in 4 of 11 cases with normal MRI. There was no association between abnormal elastography and either MRI (P > 0.999) or clinically active disease (P > 0.999). Muscle echogenicity was normal in 11 patients; all 11 had normal elastography. Of the ten patients with increased muscle echogenicity, eight had abnormal elastography. There was a significant association between muscle echogenicity and US elastography (P < 0.001). The positive and negative predictive values for elastography in the determination of active myositis were 75% and 31%, respectively, with a sensitivity of 40% and specificity of 67%.

Conclusion

Compression-strain US elastography does not accurately detect active myositis in children with juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathy and cannot replace MRI as the imaging standard for detecting myositis in these children. The association between abnormal US elastography and increased muscle echogenicity suggests that elastography is capable of detecting muscle derangement in patients with myositis; however further studies are required to determine the clinical significance of these findings.

### Chronic sequelae after muscle strain injuries: influence of heavy resistance training on functional and structural characteristics in a randomized controlled trial [^ede2664c]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Muscle strain injury leads to a high risk of recurrent injury in sports and can cause long-term symptoms such as weakness and pain. Scar tissue formation after strain injuries has been described, yet what ultrastructural changes might occur in the chronic phase of this injury have not. It is also unknown if persistent symptoms and morphological abnormalities of the tissue can be mitigated by strength training.

Purpose

To investigate if heavy resistance training improves symptoms and structural abnormalities after strain injuries.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

A total of 30 participants with long-term weakness and/or pain after a strain injury of the thigh or calf muscles were randomized to eccentric heavy resistance training of the injured region or control exercises of the back and abdominal muscle. Isokinetic (hamstring) or isometric (calf) muscle strength was determined, muscle cross-sectional area measured, and pain and function evaluated. Scar tissue ultrastructure was determined from biopsy specimens taken from the injured area before and after the training intervention.

Results

Heavy resistance training over 3 months improved pain and function, normalized muscle strength deficits, and increased muscle cross-sectional area in the previously injured region. No systematic effect of training was found upon pathologic infiltration of fat and blood vessels into the previously injured area. Control exercises had no effect on strength, cross-sectional area, or scar tissue but a positive effect on patient-related outcome measures, such as pain and functional scores.

Conclusion

Short-term strength training can improve sequelae symptoms and optimize muscle function even many years after a strain injury, but it does not seem to influence the overall structural abnormalities of the area with scar tissue.

### Treatment… [^d3f97dcd]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy typically report weakness, stiffness, constant pain that is exacerbated with certain movements, and pain that makes it difficult to sleep on the affected side. The mainstay of treatment is rehabilitative exercise focusing on scapular stabilization and biomechanics to decrease subacromial impingement. 59 Eccentric exercise has not been proven superior to conventional exercise in treating rotator cuff tendinopathy, and home-based programs are as effective as clinic-based programs. 55, 60 Subacromial corticosteroid injections are commonly used to provide short-term pain relief, which can be useful when initiating physical therapy. 61 If the patient remains symptomatic after six months of therapy, other treatments such as extracorporeal shock wave therapy, platelet-rich plasma injections, or dextrose prolotherapy can be considered. If these treatments are ineffective, surgery may be a consideration. 33, 62.

Therapeutic injections may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of LHB tendinopathy vs. rotator cuff pathology. Persistent pain of the LHB tendon after a subacromial injection or improvement in pain after an injection directly into the bicipital groove can confirm LHB tendinopathy. Because of the high correlation with rotator cuff pathology, most rehabilitative exercises for LHB tendinopathy also focus on addressing problems with the rotator cuff. Primary LHB tendon rehabilitation focuses on range of motion, muscle balance, and dynamic stability of the shoulder. There is no universally accepted physical therapy program for GTPS. Therapy should focus on patient-specific deficits in combination with stretching of the piriformis and iliotibial band and strengthening of the gluteal and core muscle groups. In addition to therapy, corticosteroid injections provide short- and medium-term pain control, and extracorporeal shock wave therapy provides medium- to long-term pain control.

Initial management of patellar tendinopathy includes relative rest and pain control with NSAIDs or cryotherapy. A patellar counterforce brace, which works by positively altering tendon biomechanics, helps decrease pain and increase function. 2 If the location is uncertain based on examination findings, ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging can be performed. 54, 79 Initial management of Achilles tendinopathy begins with risk factor modification, relative rest, and location-specific rehabilitative exercise. Midportion tendinopathy is treated with an eccentric exercise program initially, then a combination of eccentric and concentric exercises.

### Sports-related lower limb muscle injuries: pattern recognition approach and MRI review [^10c11d46]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms of injury and muscle anatomical features

Muscle injuries in professional players are usually indirect injuries that occur during eccentric muscle contraction. Striated muscle tissue stands out for its great contractile function related to the connective tissue. The connective tissue distribution is different in each muscle, varying in location and thickness depending on the muscle's function. However, in addition to being a force transmitter during contraction, the connective tissue acts as a structural component in the case of fascias or raphes. The tendon and aponeurosis are the connective tissues that contribute mainly to the transmission of force, instead of providing structural muscle framing. This differentiation is of great clinical relevance in determining the significance and prognosis of muscle injuries.

The most frequent mechanism of lower limb muscle injuries is an indirect injury (muscle strain) associated with both sprinting and stretching activities. The myotendinous or the myofascial/myoaponeurotic junction that represents the structurally weakest portion of the muscle is usually affected. Clinically, muscle strains are characterized by a sudden onset of pain usually localized in a specific muscle compartment during a period of eccentric contraction, which, depending on severity, may immediately prevent the athlete from continuing the sports activity. By contrast, blunt trauma is the most common mechanism of direct muscle injuries in sports that involve collisions such as soccer, football, or rugby. Injuries due to contusion involve isolated muscle fibers or fascias. Muscle contusions tend to manifest fewer symptoms than muscle strains. Acute or recent muscle injuries are characterized by edema, vascular engorgement, and inflammatory cellular infiltration.

Independent of the mechanism of injury, more than 90% of muscle injuries of the lower limb in football players affect four muscle groups (hamstrings, quadriceps, adductors, and calf muscles). Clinically, it is sometimes difficult to precisely locate the lesion, and in these circumstances MRI plays a key role. Knowledge of some anatomical characteristics of the distribution of connective tissue and the orientation of fascicles/fibers in these muscle groups is crucial for accurately interpreting the MRI findings in the diagnosis of muscle injuries of the lower limbs.

### Diagnosis and prognosis of acute hamstring injuries in athletes [^3c5b2157]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Prognostic factors

An accurate prognosis can be obtained on the basis of a thorough clinical assessment.

Different classification systems are provided in the literature. A clinical classification system resulting from the treatment for 165 elite track and field athletes with acute, first-time unilateral hamstring muscle strains was proposed in 2010. Strains were classified into 4 grades (I, II, III and IV) based on knee active range of motion deficit at 48 h.

Imaging is a valuable addition. There is the classic radiological grading system of a hamstring injury with grade I (minimal muscle damage with < 5% of muscle length involved) or II (partial rupture with 5–50% of muscle length involved) on MRI or US to correspond with the rehabilitation period. Grade III hamstring injuries (complete rupture or avulsion fracture) are serious injuries resulting in a convalescent period of 3 months up to 1.5 years, often requiring surgery. In 2002, an additional grading systems was introduced, specifically for US, grade 0 (normal US appearance), grade 1 (subtle ultrasound findings), grade 2 and grade 3 injuries (partial and complete muscle tears). In general, the grading should be done by a team consisting of an orthopaedic surgeon and/or a sports medicine physician and a radiologist.

A substantial part of supposed hamstring injuries are negative on MRI (14–45%). In these cases, the symptoms are probably not the result of muscle fibre disruption, but are caused by referred pain (e.g. from the lumbar spine) or abnormal neural tension).

It has been described that hamstring injuries that result from excessive slow-speed stretching require a much longer convalescent period compared to hamstring injuries sustained during high-speed running. In the former type of injury, the m. semimembranosus and the free proximal tendon are often involved, resulting in a rehabilitation period of 31–50 weeks.

Athletes sustaining a recurrent hamstring injury have a longer convalescent period compared to a first-time hamstring injury. The time to return to sports after re-injury was — depending on the injury grade — on average 1.9–11 days longer. Over 50% of re-injuries occur within 1 month after the initial injury. This emphasises the risk of an early return to sport after a hamstring injury.

### Intrinsic risk factors of non-contact quadriceps and hamstring strains in soccer: a prospective study of 100 professional players [^478be167]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify the intrinsic risk factors of non-contact strains in the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles of professional soccer players via a cohort prospective design.

Methods

A total of 100 professional soccer players (aged 19.4–27.8 years) from four professional teams underwent a composite musculoskeletal assessment at preseason. Intrinsic risk factors included dichotomies of asymmetries in muscle strength, flexibility, proprioception, anthropometry and knee joint stability, and of previous injuries. Muscle strains were prospectively monitored during the subsequent season using questionnaires. The data were analysed via binary logistic regression.

Results

Thirty-eight percent of the players sustained one or more lower-extremity muscle strains. Sixteen (42.1%) and seven (18.4%) of them were clinically diagnosed as having non-contact muscle strains at their hamstrings and quadriceps, respectively. Players with eccentric hamstring strength asymmetries (OR = 3.88; 95% CI 1.13 to 13.23), functional leg length asymmetries (OR = 3.80; 95% CI 1.08 to 13.33) and no previous hamstrings injuries (OR = 0.15; 95% CI 0.029 to 0.79) were at greater risk of sustaining a hamstring muscle strain. Players with eccentric strength (OR = 5.01; 95% CI 0.92 to 27.14) and flexibility asymmetries (OR = 4.98; 95% CI 0.78 to 31.80) in their quadriceps as well as heavier (OR = 10.70; 95% CI 0.73 to 156.37) and shorter players (OR = 0.08; 95% CI 0.00 to 1.35) were at greater risk of sustaining a strain in this muscle group.

Conclusions

Professional soccer players with functional asymmetries possess a higher risk of sustaining hamstring strains. Previous injury seems not to constitute a risk factor.

Hamstring strain injury return to play (RTP) recommendations — Clinicians should assess the history of an HSI when deciding to return an athlete to play, as the previous occurrence of an HSI is a risk factor for a future reinjury. Clinicians should use caution in RTP decisions for individuals who did not complete an appropriately progressed, comprehensive impairment-based functional exercise program that specifically included eccentric training. Clinicians should use hamstring strength, pain level at the time of injury, number of days from injury to pain-free walking, and area of tenderness measured at initial evaluation to estimate time to RTP.

### Infective myositis [^9eeb61e8]. Brain Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinically, three stages of the evolution of pyomyositis have been described. The first stage (subacute) referred to as the invasive stage, occurs over 1 to 3 weeks characterized by swelling, variable texture with pain (often dull and crampy) associated with low‐grade fever and malaise. This stage may be mistaken for thrombotic conditions, hematoma, muscle strain/tear, osteomyelitis, or trauma (contusion). In the second stage, the suppurative phase develops between ten to twenty‐one days characterized by prominent tenderness, swelling, and severe myalgia. Diagnosis is often made at this stage since a definite abscess is recognized by imaging or by the pathological study. Muscle from the affected region histologically shows suppuration with numerous degenerating polymorphonuclear leukocytes admixed with necrotic cellular debris. A rim of histiocytes along with peripheral neovascularization, perivascular inflammation forming granulation tissue, fibrosis, and scarring is seen. Since the pathological changes are within the muscle, the overlying skin may not show erythema commonly noted with soft tissue infections. The third stage is a severe stage with evidence of sepsis and fever. The tenderness may be severe with apparent fluctuating character. The mean age at diagnosis ranges from 2 weeks to 92 years with male preponderance both in tropical and temperate regions. Usually, a single muscle group is involved, while it may be diffuse in around 10‐20% of cases. The lower limb muscles with large bellies (e.g. quadriceps and gluteus group, calf muscles) are commonly affected due to their proneness to injury and constant stress and strain. The other muscle groups that can also be affected are psoas muscles, iliacus, pectoralis major followed by sternocleidomastoids, and upper extremity muscles. The lesion may be solitary (seen in a quarter of cases), or multiple.

### Guidelines from the American Physical Therapy Association… [^182ef0ec]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- PFP presents with retropatellar or peripatellar pain with knee flexion.
- PFP is unlikely if squatting does not reproduce pain.
- The most effective treatment for PFP are exercises that target muscles of the posterior hip and quadriceps.
- Adding patellar taping and foot orthoses to exercise improves short-term pain. Diagnosis PFP presents with retropatellar or peripatellar pain on knee flexion, such as with squatting, stair climbing, or prolonged sitting. With this type of pain, these activities are the most accurate diagnostic tests. Lack of pain with squatting makes PFP unlikely. Reduced lateral patellar mobility with patellar tilt testing is highly specific but cannot rule out PFP. Other proposed tests have insufficient accuracy. General Treatment Approaches The primary treatment for PFP is a combination of posterior hip and quadriceps exercises, which reduce pain and improve function for at least five years.

Weight-bearing and non–weight-bearing exercises are similarly effective. These exercises include single-leg squats, step downs, squats, lunges, and hip exercises using resistance bands. Specific Treatments Based on Assessment Studies of PFP show four patterns of injury that can guide treatment. SOLITARY OVERUSE Many cases of PFP are primarily caused by increasing joint load from acute overexertion or rapid increases in training. Injury prevention programs do not prevent these injuries, but reducing activity followed by gradual return can be beneficial. With a history of overexertion or overtraining, relative rest may be the first intervention. MUSCLE PERFORMANCE DEFICITS Some people with PFP have notable weakness in knee and hip extension. Although hip weakness appears to be a result of PFP, training focused on hip and quadriceps resistance exercises can improve symptoms.

MOVEMENT COORDINATION DEFICITS Although dynamic knee valgus does not predict PFP risk, a subset of people with PFP who demonstrate knee valgus with a single-leg squat appear to benefit from gait retraining. MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS People with mobility impairment caused by PFP have hypermobility of the foot with hypomobility of the hamstrings, quadriceps, gastrocnemiussoleus complex, patellar retinaculum, or iliotibial band. Prefabricated foot orthoses may be beneficial for this group.

### Clinical and anatomical considerations for management of a complete tear of the distal rectus femoris myotendinous junction: a rare knee extensor mechanism injury [^c1e4a580]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The knee extensor mechanism is a highly complex multilayered and reinforced structure. Quadriceps muscle injuries are considered to be common, particularly among athletes; however isolated rectus femoris injuries involving the distal myotendinous junction are considered to be exceedingly rare with very few case reports published to date. Thus, the presentation and diagnosis of this injury can be elusive and treatment is nonuniform. There is limited literature published advocating both nonsurgical and surgical management. We illustrate the clinical and radiologic presentation of a traumatic, nonsport-related distal rectus femoris muscle injury treated operatively. The presentation of this injury along with anatomical and clinical considerations is portrayed in detail. This case report contributes to the sparse literature regarding this injury and delineates management considerations.

### Hamstring strain injury in athletes [^fcc9fe56]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Clinical course of hamstring strain injury (HSI) — presentation and healing phases — includes typical onset features and timelines: An HSI can occur anywhere along the length of the muscle, but occurs most frequently in the proximal biceps femoris at the musculotendinous junction, with an individual experiencing a sudden, sharp pain in the posterior thigh and often an audible or palpable popping sensation during overloading and/or overstretching activity; the recurrence rate of HSI ranges between 13.9% and 63.3% when followed over the same and subsequent seasons. The healing process includes 3 phases: inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling; the inflammation phase occurs immediately after HSI and lasts approximately 3 to 5 days, with phagocytic cells entering 2 to 4 days after injury; the proliferation phase may overlap with inflammation and last up to several weeks; and depending on the extent of the HSI, the remodeling phase can continue for up to 2 years. Early range of motion (ROM) and soft tissue mobilization after injury may help promote more organized scar formation, with fewer adhesions to surrounding tissue, and early hip and knee ROM may contribute to less disorganized scar formation and a lower reinjury rate.

### Is there a potential relationship between prior hamstring strain injury and increased risk for future anterior cruciate ligament injury? [^60da5ab7]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Hamstring strain injuries (HSIs) are the most prevalent injury in a number of sports, and while anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are less common, they are far more severe and have long-term implications, such as an increased risk of developing osteoarthritis later in life. Given the high incidence and severity of these injuries, they are key targets of injury preventive programs in elite sport. Evidence has shown that a previous severe knee injury (including ACL injury) increases the risk of HSI; however, whether the functional deficits that occur after HSI result in an increased risk of ACL injury has yet to be considered. In this clinical commentary, we present evidence that suggests that the link between previous HSI and increased risk of ACL injury requires further investigation by drawing parallels between deficits in hamstring function after HSI and in women athletes, who are more prone to ACL injury than men athletes. Comparisons between the neuromuscular function of the male and female hamstring has shown that women display lower hamstring-to-quadriceps strength ratios during isokinetic knee flexion and extension, increased activation of the quadriceps compared with the hamstrings during a stop-jump landing task, a greater time required to reach maximal isokinetic hamstring torque, and lower integrated myoelectrical hamstring activity during a sidestep cutting maneuver. Somewhat similarly, in athletes with a history of HSI, the previously injured limb, compared with the uninjured limb, displays lower eccentric knee flexor strength, a lower hamstrings-to-quadriceps strength ratio, lower voluntary myoelectrical activity during maximal knee flexor eccentric contraction, a lower knee flexor eccentric rate of torque development, and lower voluntary myoelectrical activity during the initial portion of eccentric contraction. Given that the medial and lateral hamstrings have different actions at the knee joint in the coronal plane, which hamstring head is previously injured might also be expected to influence the likelihood of future ACL. Whether the deficits in function after HSI, as seen in laboratory-based studies, translate to deficits in hamstring function during typical injurious tasks for ACL injury has yet to be determined but should be a consideration for future work.

Nonmodifiable risk factors — previous injury and other prior injuries indicate that previous injury is consistently a risk factor for subsequent hamstring strain injury (HSI), that risk of recurrent HSI may be greatest in the same season, that a history of anterior cruciate ligament injury and calf strain are risk factors for HSI along with other knee injuries and ankle ligament sprains, and that a history of quadriceps strain or chronic groin pathology were not identified as risk factors.

### Predicting hamstring strain injury in elite athletes [^2f044367]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

Eccentric exercise, where the contracting muscle is lengthened, produces microscopic damage in muscle fibers, and sensations of stiffness and soreness, the next day. These normally resolve within a week. A more major sports injury is the muscle strain. Because strain injuries are known to occur during eccentric contractions, it is hypothesized that the microscopic damage from eccentric exercise can, at times, progress to a muscle strain. As the amount of microscopic damage depends on the muscle's optimum length for active tension, it is further proposed that optimum length is a measure of susceptibility for muscle strains. The athletes most at risk of a hamstring strain are those with a previous history of such injuries. Here the prediction is tested that optimum lengths of previously injured hamstrings are shorter and therefore more prone to eccentric damage than uninjured muscles.

Methods

Mean optimum angle for peak torque in a previously injured muscle of nine athletes with a history of unilateral hamstring strains was compared with the uninjured muscle of the other leg and with muscles of 18 uninjured athletes. Optimum angle was determined with isokinetic dynamometry.

Results

In previously injured muscles, torque peaked at significantly shorter lengths than for uninjured muscles. Peak torque and quadriceps:hamstrings torque ratios were not significantly different.

Conclusions

The shorter optimum of previously injured muscles makes them more prone to damage from eccentric exercise than uninjured muscles and this may account for the high reinjury rate. The shorter optimum may reflect the muscle's preinjury state or be a consequence of the healing process. To reduce the incidence of strain injuries, it is recommended that a combined program of eccentric exercise and muscle testing be carried out.

### Hamstring strain injury in athletes [^2013ee2c]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Hamstring strain injury (HSI) imaging — imaging is typically not needed in those diagnosed with a grade I or II HSI based on clinical examination, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment is recommended in those with a suspected grade III HSI. The role of MRI in helping to determine the clinical course, including return to play (RTP) and risk of reinjuries, is unclear, and evidence suggests that the addition of MRI does not improve the prediction of RTP beyond clinical examination. With suspicion of a nonmusculoskeletal pain source, such as a thrombosis, imaging may be indicated, and although the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria do not specifically outline guidelines for those with an HSI, the criteria for chronic hip pain note that MRI and ultrasound (US) are "usually appropriate" in those with chronic symptoms and suspected extra-articular noninfectious soft tissue abnormalities. Therefore, MRI or US imaging can be useful in decision making in individuals with an atypical presentation of symptoms or who do not have satisfactory results with nonsurgical care, and radiographs are usually not required unless symptoms are proximal and radiographs may be useful to rule out avulsion fractures.

Hamstring strain injury rehabilitation — exercise initiation and dosing: Evidence supports initiating hamstring-strengthening exercises, including eccentrics, early in the rehabilitation process, guided by patient pain tolerance, with successful interventions included 6 to 12 repetitions, depending on the intensity of the exercise, with both load and ROM increased as tolerated; patients should perform the exercises 2 to 3 times per week. Evidence also supports progressive agility and trunk stabilization exercises and a running program involving acceleration and deceleration phases, with a progressive increase in speed and distance, throughout the rehabilitation process as tolerated, and the benefits of eccentric training, added to stretching, strengthening, stabilization, and progressive running programs, are improved RTP times and reduced reinjury rates, while potential harms include a potential to aggravate symptoms and load the activity that was causative.

### Physical examination and patellofemoral pain syndrome [^9d80f6f1]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Patellofemoral pain syndrome, which accounts for 25% of all sports-related knee injuries, is multifactorial in origin. A combination of variables, including abnormal lower limb biomechanics, soft-tissue tightness, muscle weakness, and excessive exercise, may result in increased cartilage and subchondral bone stress, patellofemoral pain, and subtle or more overt patellar maltracking. Because of the multiple forces affecting the patellofemoral joint, the clinical evaluation and treatment of this disorder is challenging. An extensive search of the literature revealed no single gold-standard test maneuver for that disorder, and the reliability of the maneuvers described was generally low or untested. An abnormal Q-angle, generalized ligamentous laxity, hypomobile or hypermobile tenderness of the lateral patellar retinaculum, patellar tilt or mediolateral displacement, decreased flexibility of the iliotibial band and quadriceps, and quadriceps, hip abductor, and external rotator weakness were most often correlated with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

Domain 3: treatment

Several interventions for treatment of hamstring injuries have been investigated, including targeted hamstring exercises and running, stretching, agility and trunk exercisesand injection therapy. The majority of included subjects were male football playersor track and field athletes. For the outcome measure 'time to return-to-play,' large heterogeneity in the outcome definitions (eg, criteria-based vs self-reported vs medical clearance) preclude any clear recommendations of a superior rehabilitation strategy for return to play. However, rehabilitation programmes with a focus on progressive targeted eccentric hamstring exercises supplemented with progressive running drills seems to result in the shortest return-to-play times with an associated low reinjury risk. Thus, lengthening hamstring exercises showed significant faster return to play and no reinjuries compared with conventional exercises in elite football playersand track and field athletes. However, in a recent study, lengthening hamstring exercises showed a substantial higher reinjury rate of 25% compared with a multifactorial criteria-based programme with a reinjury rate of 4% with only small, and non-significant, differences in return-to-play time. Interestingly, the return-to-play times were markedly faster in the latter study, suggesting that longer return-to-play times may decrease risk of reinjury. It should however be noted, that due to the small absolute number of reinjuries in the above studies the effect of the interventions on reinjury risk is associated with substantial imprecision of the estimate leading to a downgrade of the evidence.

Finally, moderate quality of evidence was observed for a trivial, non-significant, effect of platelet-rich plasma on time to return-to-play and reinjury risk.

### Hamstring injuries: prevention and treatment-an update [^e5d54863]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Implications for clinical management

What are the implications of this research for clinical practice? Perhaps more emphasis should be placed on reduction of pain in the early days after hamstring injury to reduce the neuromuscular inhibition associated with pain, while at the same time encouraging early muscle activation, particularly eccentric exercise at longer muscle lengths, and early return to running with rapid progression to high-speed running.

While the concept of eccentric muscle training as an important component of the rehabilitation process has been with us for many years, it now appears that these exercises must be in the lengthened position. This makes sense when you think that the majority of hamstring muscle injuries are located in the long head of biceps femoris, a muscle that straddles both the hip and knee joints. The standard leg curl exercise, therefore, does not work the long head sufficiently. As a result, lengthening eccentric exercises such as the Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE), the Romanian dead lift and Askling's 'extender', 'diver' and 'glider' exercisesare now becoming the mainstay of postinjury rehabilitation.

Two papers have proposed parameters by which hamstring rehabilitation programmes can be created. Malliaropoulos et al suggested the following parameters — injury mechanism, hip or knee dominant, location, targeted muscle, length rather than strength, training parameters — should be considered when devising a rehabilitation protocol.

Guex and Milletsuggested a conceptual framework for strengthening exercises for hamstring muscles specific to the terminal swing phase of sprinting based on six key parameters (contraction type, load, range of motion, angular velocity, unilateral/bilateral exercises, kinetic chain) for strain prevention. They advocated that in sprinting sports, high-load eccentric contractions should be performed at a slow to moderate angular velocity and focused at the knee joint, while the hip is kept in a large flexion position (80°) in order to expose the hamstrings to a greater elongation stress than occurs in the terminal swing phase. They postulated that as a result, during sprinting, athletes would be better trained to brake knee extension effectively in the whole range of motion without overstretch of the hamstrings.

They also advocated unilateral open kinetic chain exercises based on their functional application. After analysing some of the frequently used hamstring strengthening exercises, they came to the conclusion that the 'optimal exercise had not been designed yet'. Finally, they noted that strain prevention is not only a question of strength, but also depends on the timing of contraction, or a combination of both.

### Point-of-care ultrasound diagnosis of proximal hamstring rupture [^620b8da0]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute proximal hamstring ruptures can be a diagnostic challenge in the emergency department. The revealing sign of large posterior thigh ecchymosis is typically not yet present; the physical examination is limited due to pain, radiographs can be unremarkable, and definitive testing with magnetic resonance imaging is not practical. These avulsions are often misdiagnosed as hamstring strains and treated conservatively. The diagnosis is made after failed treatment, often months after the injury. Surgical repair at that time can be technically challenging and higher risk due to tendon retraction and adhesion of the tendon stump to the sciatic nerve.

Case Reports

The first case illustrates an example of how delay in diagnosis can occur in both emergency medicine and outpatient primary care settings. It also shows complications and morbidity potential for patients who warrant and do not receive timely surgical repair. The second case illustrates physical examination findings obtainable during the acute setting, and the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in facilitating an expedited diagnosis and treatment plan. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Timely diagnosis of hamstring rupture is paramount to optimize patient outcomes for this serious injury. The best results are obtained with surgical repair within 3–6 weeks of injury. POCUS evaluation can aid significantly in the timely diagnosis of this injury. If the POCUS examination raises clinical concern for a proximal hamstring rupture, this may allow for earlier diagnosis and definitive treatment of proximal hamstring rupture.

### Clinical principles in the management of hamstring injuries [^66595167]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hamstring injuries are among the most common muscle injuries seen in sports clinical practice. This narrative review covers essential knowledge of hamstring injuries, ranging from strains to total proximal three-tendon ruptures. The primary aim is to provide basic information for clinicians and sports medicine therapists dealing with hamstring problems.

Methods

In this review, existing literature of hamstring injuries was taken together. Emphasis was given to subjects less well covered in previous reviews, such as preventive measures, as well as the most relevant information needed in the treatment of these injuries.

Results

Occasionally, symptoms remain after hamstring injuries which can be successfully treated with surgery. Knowledge of the effectiveness of preventive measures and nonsurgical and surgical treatment is limited by small studies of low evidence level.

Conclusions

Evidence-based treatment algorithms are not available. Larger studies of better quality with more concrete grading of hamstring tears are needed to improve knowledge in prevention and treatment of hamstring injuries.

### Acute proximal hamstring rupture [^93436888]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Hamstring strain is common in athletes, and both diagnosis and surgical treatment of this injury are becoming more common. Nonsurgical treatment of complete ruptures has resulted in complications such as muscle weakness and sciatic neuralgia. Surgical treatment recently has been advocated to repair the complete rupture of the hamstring tendons from the ischial tuberosity. Surgical repair involves a transverse incision in the gluteal crease, protection of the sciatic nerve, mobilization of the ruptured tendons, and repair to the ischial tuberosity with the use of suture anchors. Reports in the literature of surgical treatment of proximal hamstring rupture are few, and most series have had a relatively small number of patients. Surgical repair results project 58% to 85% rate of return to function and sports activity, near normal strength, and decreased pain.
