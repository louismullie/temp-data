## Question

time to heal wrist fracture

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long it takes for a wrist fracture to heal and what factors influence that timeline. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes a "wrist fracture" and the typical healing biology. Then, I should verify standard immobilization durations for nonoperative care. Next, I will examine postoperative timelines and when early motion is safe after surgery. After that, I need to consider pediatric versus adult healing and remodeling. I should also review factors that delay healing and how to monitor progress. Finally, I will synthesize a practical timeline and counseling points, making sure I cross-check each claim against guidelines and trials as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and baseline expectations. Most "wrist fractures" in adults are distal radius fractures, which typically heal within a few months, though the exact trajectory depends on stability, treatment, and patient factors; I should confirm that this "few months" heuristic aligns with contemporary guidance and epidemiology before proceeding [^116bjLch].

> Now, for nonoperative management, I need to check the standard immobilization window. Wait, let me verify the cast duration: guidelines consistently indicate 4 to 6 weeks of immobilization for stable distal radius fractures treated in a cast, with mobilization beginning after that period if healing is satisfactory; I should confirm that this applies to both initial casting and after closed reduction when maintained in a cast [^114mMEkt] [^115L8KkH] [^111xU6z4].

> Next, I should review postoperative timelines. Hold on, I should verify whether early motion is safe after volar plating. Contemporary rehabilitation guidance supports initiating hand, wrist, and shoulder active range of motion within the first 1–3 weeks after volar locking plate fixation, with strengthening often starting around 2 weeks in appropriately selected patients; randomized data show accelerated strengthening at 2 weeks improves early function without compromising union, and systematic reviews suggest early therapy yields faster gains that persist up to 6 months, though a small, nonsignificant trend toward more complications with very early starts has been noted and warrants cautious selection [^1136aPfE] [^113DB7gj] [^116uNnaB] [^113y1fv2] [^113jgVDw].

> I will now examine pediatric healing, because I need to ensure I distinguish remodeling from true healing. Children's distal radius fractures, especially buckle injuries, often heal clinically in about 4–6 weeks, but remodeling of deformity can continue for months; importantly, many displaced pediatric fractures still recover full function with casting alone due to remodeling, so the "time to heal" functionally may be shorter than the time to radiographic remodeling, and I should be careful not to overstate the need for surgery in skeletally immature patients [^111qCVwJ] [^112ArHGE].

> But wait, what if healing is delayed? I should double-check risk factors and monitoring. Older age, osteoporosis, poor alignment, smoking, diabetes, and certain medications can slow healing; nonunion of distal radius fractures is uncommon but more likely with unstable patterns or inadequate immobilization, and persistent pain with progressive deformity should prompt reassessment; serial radiographs are reasonable, though high-frequency imaging has not clearly improved long-term outcomes, so follow-up imaging should be individualized rather than routine-heavy [^114F14Ec] [^1156jNw8].

> Let me consider pharmacologic modifiers, because I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize. Early bisphosphonate initiation after distal radius fracture has been studied; randomized trials and cohort data suggest no meaningful delay in radiographic union or worse clinical outcomes when started about 2 weeks or more post-fracture, so if osteoporosis therapy is indicated, it can proceed without undue concern for impaired healing; conversely, long-term proton pump inhibitor use is associated with increased wrist fracture risk, which is a separate issue from acute healing but relevant to overall bone health counseling [^112CRsMr] [^114z2Ta2] [^115Df7L1].

> Next, I should review how to monitor recovery milestones. I need to ensure we track pain, function, and objective measures. Validated patient-reported measures such as PRWE or DASH, along with grip and pinch strength and wrist/forearm range of motion, should be assessed at baseline and at key follow-ups; therapy intensity should be tailored, with supervised therapy prioritized for older adults or those with comorbidities, while many older patients recover comparably with home-based programs, so shared decision-making about therapy intensity is prudent [^113bcQ7R] [^111uTmPy] [^1174D6je] [^114jertj].

> I should now synthesize a practical timeline, but let me verify each step against the evidence before I commit. For a typical adult with a stable distal radius fracture treated in a cast, expect 4–6 weeks of immobilization, then gradual wrist motion and light activities, with strengthening beginning around 6–8 weeks; most patients achieve union by about 6–8 weeks, though functional recovery often continues for 3–6 months and may lag in older adults; for volar plating, early protected motion can start within 1–2 weeks and strengthening around 2 weeks in suitable patients, with union typically by 6–8 weeks and earlier functional gains that converge with nonoperative outcomes by 6–12 months; in children, clinical healing is often 4–6 weeks, with remodeling continuing thereafter, and many displaced fractures still do well with casting alone [^114mMEkt] [^114yLWG5] [^111xU6z4] [^116uNnaB] [^112a3bza] [^111qCVwJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the long-term perspective so I do not overpromise early results. High-quality randomized data in older adults show that despite faster early recovery with internal fixation, long-term patient-reported outcomes at 12–24 months are similar across casting, percutaneous pinning, external fixation, and volar plating, and even malunion after casting does not necessarily translate to worse long-term function; this supports offering nonoperative care when acceptable alignment can be maintained and the patient values avoiding surgery [^112a3bza] [^111xNacX].

> Finally, I need to ensure the counseling is realistic and actionable. I should confirm that patients understand expected timelines, red flags for delayed healing, and activity progression; early, light daily activity after surgical fixation is safe and may hasten functional recovery when guided by pain and stability, and consistent education reduces fear-avoidance; for nonoperative care, I should emphasize adherence to immobilization and timely initiation of motion after cast removal to mitigate stiffness and edema [^113wGiHM] [^113s9PcZ] [^114mMEkt].

Wrist fractures, especially distal radius fractures, typically heal in **6–8 weeks** for adults, with immobilization for 4–6 weeks [^114mMEkt] followed by gradual rehabilitation [^111xU6z4]. Healing is slower in older adults or those with osteoporosis [^notfound] and may take **10–12 weeks or longer** [^1166Yar2]. Operative fixation allows earlier motion [^111xU6z4], but full recovery still takes 3–6 months. Children heal faster, often in **4–6 weeks**, due to remodeling [^111qCVwJ]. Nonunion is rare [^114F14Ec] but more likely with poor alignment, smoking, or diabetes [^notfound]; persistent pain or instability after 3 months warrants further evaluation [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing healing time

Several factors influence **healing time** in wrist fractures:

- **Age**: Older adults heal more slowly due to reduced bone turnover and osteoporosis [^notfound].
- **Bone quality**: Osteoporosis or osteopenia delays healing [^notfound].
- **Fracture type and severity**: Displaced, comminuted, or intra-articular fractures heal more slowly [^notfound].
- **Treatment method**: Nonoperative care with cast immobilization (4–6 weeks) [^114mMEkt] vs operative fixation allowing earlier motion [^111xU6z4].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Smoking, diabetes, and poor nutrition delay healing [^notfound].

---

## Typical healing timeline

| **Phase** | **Duration** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Inflammatory phase | Days 1–7 | - Initial bleeding <br/> - Inflammation <br/> - Formation of hematoma [^notfound] |
| Reparative phase | Weeks 2–6 | - Callus formation <br/> - Fibrous tissue development [^notfound] |
| Remodeling phase | Weeks 6–12 | - Bone remodeling <br/> - Restoration of strength [^116uNnaB] |

---

## Healing time by treatment method

- **Nonoperative treatment (cast immobilization)**: 4–6 weeks immobilization [^114mMEkt], followed by 2–4 weeks of rehabilitation; total healing time is typically 6–8 weeks [^114yLWG5].
- **Operative treatment (internal fixation)**: Early motion within 1–2 weeks [^111xU6z4], but full healing still requires 6–8 weeks; total recovery time is 3–6 months.
- **External fixation**: Similar to internal fixation, with early motion and total healing time of 6–8 weeks.

---

## Healing time by patient population

- **Adults**: 6–8 weeks on average, with full recovery in 3–6 months.
- **Elderly patients**: Longer healing time (10–12 weeks or more) due to osteoporosis and comorbidities [^notfound].
- **Children**: Faster healing (4–6 weeks) due to higher bone turnover and remodeling capacity [^notfound].

---

## Complications affecting healing time

Complications can significantly prolong **healing**:

- **Nonunion**: Rare but serious, often due to poor alignment, smoking, or diabetes [^114F14Ec].
- **Malunion**: Improper alignment causing functional impairment [^111VdXvL].
- **Infection**: Particularly in operative cases, delaying healing [^114SLz86].
- **Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)**: Chronic pain condition delaying recovery [^113jdMo8].

---

## Clinical outcomes and functional recovery

Functional recovery typically takes **3–6 months**, with most patients regaining 80–90% of pre-injury function. Long-term outcomes are generally favorable, though some patients experience chronic pain or stiffness [^115f9TTi].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized treatment** based on patient-specific factors, fracture type, and severity. Early mobilization after stable fixation is recommended to improve functional outcomes [^111xU6z4] [^1136aPfE].

---

## Conclusion

Wrist fractures typically heal within **6–8 weeks**, but healing time varies with age, bone quality, fracture severity, and treatment method. Complications can prolong healing, and functional recovery may take several months. Individualized treatment and early mobilization are key to optimizing outcomes.

### Distal radius fracture clinical practice guidelines-updates and clinical implications [^116bjLch]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on distal radius fracture:

- **Definition**: A DRF refers to a fracture of the radius near the wrist, typically within 2–3 cm of the distal end.
- **Pathophysiology**: The most common mechanism of injury for DRFs is a fall onto an outstretched hand with the wrist in extension. When the wrist is in dorsiflexion during the fall, it can lead to a Colles fracture, characterized by dorsal displacement of the distal fragment. Other mechanisms include a fall onto a flexed wrist, resulting in a Smith's fracture, characterized by volar displacement of the distal fragment, and a Barton's fracture, characterized by intra-articular involvement. High-energy trauma, such as motor vehicle accidents or sports injuries, and low-energy falls in older adults can also result in DRFs.
- **Epidemiology**: DRFs are among the most common fractures in the US, with an estimated incidence of 643,000 cases per year.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for DRFs include advanced age, osteoporosis, and participation in high-impact activities or sports.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with a DRF typically present with pain, swelling, and bruising in the wrist area, along with a limited ROM. In some cases, an obvious deformity may be present if the fracture is severe or displaced. In some cases, patients may also develop nerve complications, such as ulnar nerve palsy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for a DRF largely depends on the severity of the fracture and the patient's overall health. Generally, these fractures heal within a few months.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^114mMEkt]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Distal radius fracture (DRF) interventions — initial protection and timing of mobilization are outlined as follows: nonoperatively managed individuals with DRF are typically immobilized in a cast for 4 to 6 weeks before they initiate wrist mobilization exercises; following DRF surgery (ie, open reduction internal fixation, external fixation, or percutaneous pinning), the early protective immobilization period is variable (ie, a few days to several weeks) depending on fracture healing and stability, as well as surgeon's preference; timing for initiating wrist exercises after surgery is not universally agreed upon and typically starts when the physician verifies that a satisfactory healing level has been attained via radiographic evidence and exercise loading can be safely imposed across the fracture site; once proper healing has occurred, 3 rehabilitation approaches have been proposed: SupT with advice for an iHEP, an iHEP alone, or no therapy.

Strengthening phase initiation and content — The strengthening phase typically starts around 6 to 8 weeks following the initiation of fracture treatment and requires adequate fracture healing and stability, and usually encompasses progressive resistance exercises via isotonic, eccentric, power gripping, and perturbation training with increasing loading levels through the wrist and the entire upper extremity.

### The management of wrist injuries: an international perspective [^114HREAe]. Injury (2006). Low credibility.

Wrist injury is common and may significantly impair the overall function of the upper extremity unless properly managed. Fractures of the distal radius are particularly common among the aging population, accounting for nearly 1/6 of all fractures, often as a result of increased longevity with the subsequent underlying osteoporosis. New diagnostic tools, including wrist arthroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography, are increasingly available in developed countries allowing accurate recognition and more effective resolution of lesions which would be otherwise missed using conventional methods. First world treatment standards, however, can scarcely be introduced in developing countries owing to, among other factors, different prevalence of problems, and the lack of resource to implement most modern technologies. If any program needs to be introduced that meets the demands of wrist injury management in the third world, aside from a better regionalisation of trauma care, it should emphasise adequate training of professionals in the use of more cost effective techniques of fracture reduction and stabilisation, applicable everywhere, with the minimum possible morbidity.

Key Points

Question

Do rates or types of complications after distal radius fractures depend on treatment type?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of 304 adults from 24 health systems, the method of treatment participants received was associated with the rate or type of complications. Compared with participants who received internal fixation, participants who received any other treatments experienced complications at significantly higher rates.

Meaning

Choice of distal radius fracture treatment method in older patients should be specific to individual goals to minimize complication risks and improve outcomes.

Introduction

Distal radius fractures are among the most common skeletal injuries, with a high incidence across all age groups, from children to the elderly. Although distal radius fracture outcomes are often less severe than fractures at axial sites, such as the hip and spine, they still have important clinical implications and can be indicative of osteoporosis in adults over 50 yr. Radius fractures result in loss of function, pain, and, if complications arise, can require extensive rehabilitation. Moreover, distal radius fractures serve as an important predictor of future fracture risk, particularly in older individuals with osteopenia or osteoporosis. The standard treatment for most radial fractures is cast immobilization, typically for a period of 4–6 weeks. However, the optimal timing for cast removal remains uncertain and can significantly influence patient outcomes. Factors such as age and bone quality further contribute to the variability observed in the healing process, underscoring the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying bone healing and post-fracture function to guide clinical decision-making and improve patient care.

### Comparison of 24-month outcomes after treatment for distal radius fracture: the WRIST randomized clinical trial [^112HWQCu]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

More than 85 000 Medicare beneficiaries sustain distal radius fracture (DRF) annually. Despite more than 200 years of experience in treating this injury since it was first described by Collesin 1812, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines published in 2009 indicated that there is insufficient evidence to justify any particular DRF treatment over another for older adults. The lack of evidence for comparative efficacy stems from the difficulty in conducting clinical trials when the treatment options are so disparate that recruiting a sufficient sample size can be difficult. This is particularly true for older adults, who resist being randomized and may experience barriers to follow-up such as lack of transportation.,

Literature is sparse regarding long-term, posttreatment DRF outcomes in older populations. Few studies followed older adults longer than 12 months, and those that did only reported results from the final assessment; intermediate outcomes to track the trajectory of recovery were missing. Long-term outcomes on injuries in older adults are especially germane because today's older generation is living longer and leading more active lives than previous generations. In this era of value-based care and shared decision-making, long-term outcomes help to guide surgeons, patients, and their families through understanding the benefits and risks of each treatment.

To derive level 1 evidence for DRF treatment, we conducted the Wrist and Radius Injury Surgical Trial (WRIST). WRIST compared the 4 most commonly used treatments for DRF: open reduction and internal fixation with a volar locking plate system (VLPS), closed reduction and external fixation with a bridging fixator with or without supplemental k-wire fixation (EFP), closed reduction and k-wire fixation with percutaneous pinning (CRPP), and closed reduction and casting. WRIST has previously reported no clinically meaningful differences in hand outcomes by treatment groups at 12-month follow-up. The primary aim of this analysis is to examine 24-month outcomes of patients aged 60 years and older with DRF as a long-term outcomes aim stipulated by the National Institutes of Health. We hypothesized that 24-month outcomes would differ by the 4 treatment groups and that patients with malunion would have worse outcomes than those without malunion.

### Bone morphogenic protein for upper extremity fractures: a systematic review [^1129rKEw]. Hand (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

This review discusses success, time to healing, and complications of bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) 7 and 2 in treating upper extremity nonunions.

Methods

Systematic review identified 26 of 479 studies that met inclusion criteria. Publications described application of BMPs to acute and chronic upper extremity delayed unions/nonunions. Unions, complications, patient demographics, and fracture/healing patterns were pooled and analyzed.

Results

Nonunions treated with BMP-7 (n = 302) involved the humerus (64%), forearm (22%), clavicle (11%), and hand/wrist (3%), with prior surgical correction attempted in 84%. Nonunions treated with BMP-2 (n = 96) involved the humerus (58%), hand/wrist (27%), forearm (14%), and clavicle (1%), with prior surgical correction attempted in all. Most nonunions (80%) were present for over 12 months before BMP application. Union rates of BMP-7 varied according to site: hand/wrist (95%), humerus (74%), forearm (29%), and clavicle (6.2%) nonunions achieved union as defined by study authors in 232 days (confidence interval = 96–369, Q < 0.001) on average. While not significant across studies, BMP-2 union rates were 71% of hand/wrist and 75% of humerus nonunions. Comparison of the BMPs demonstrates different proportions of success in humerus and hand/wrist fractures (P < .001) but not forearm fractures (P < .77) and longer time to radiographic union with BMP-7 (P < .011).

Conclusions

Most hand/wrist and humerus nonunions treated with BMP-7 and BMP-2 achieved union, with significant similarity among BMP-7 studies not observed in BMP-2 studies. Nonunions treated with BMP-7 have longer healing times yet similar complication rates compared with BMP-2. Overall, BMPs are an effective adjunct to fracture healing with acceptable complication profile.

### The history of fracture fixation of the hand and wrist [^112Gu6wP]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The treatment of fractures of the hand and wrist has evolved over the centuries from one of rest and immobilization to internal fixation and early motion. Although today's technology (anesthesia, antibiotics, metal implants) has allowed us more freedom in treating these injuries, a number of our patients continue to experience stiffness, nonunion, malunion, and chronic pain. We explore the techniques used to treat hand and wrist fractures throughout the centuries and determine what beneficial aspects of fracture care have been maintained and those that have changed as a result of new technology. We are now realizing that rigid immobilization of fractures at the expense of the soft tissues can be just as damaging as the ancient physician's techniques of prolonged immobilization with frequent dressing changes. New implants and lighter cast materials have allowed improved digital motion and early functional use of the extremity. This has become especially important in the treatment of the aging population, which demands improved function and a quicker return to activities. The optimal treatment of these fractures for each patient remains elusive, however, and there remains a tendency to rely on technology at the expense of sound clinical care. We must not loose sight of the goals of fracture treatment and should heed the lessons learned throughout centuries of treating these injuries.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons / American society for surgery of the hand clinical practice guideline summary management of distal radius fractures [^1156jNw8]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Serial radiography — distal radius fractures: Limited evidence suggests no difference in outcomes based on frequency of radiographic evaluation for patients treated for distal radius fractures, and Strength of Recommendation: Limited. In a randomized comparison, control group patients received x-rays of the wrist at 1,2,6, and 12 weeks post injury, whereas the experimental group received x-rays of the wrist at 1 and 2 weeks; patients were followed for 52 weeks and at no time during the 52-week study were there statistically significant differences between groups in patient reported measures (DASH, PRWHE), quality of life (EQ5), or pain (VAS). At 52 weeks there were minimally statistically significant differences in total range of motion favoring the more frequent x-ray group, with total flexion/extension arc 10 degrees better (123 vs 113) and pronation/supination also better (175 degrees vs 155 degrees), but there was no difference in the complication rate; patients in the control group received four sets of wrist radiographs, while the experimental group received an average of three. The benefits of implementing this strategy of eliminating routine radiographs of distal radius fractures after the two-week follow up include reduced radiation to the patient and reduced cost to patient, payer, and society, and there may be some possible value in obtaining a final radiograph outside of the time frame addressed within this PICO to establish a healed baseline for comparison against future wrist pain; longer term follow-up, (5 and 10 year) will be useful to determine if non-inferiority of the reduced radiograph group is maintained.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^111xU6z4]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Wrist-mobilization phase timing and early motion — The wrist mobilization phase is initiated when a satisfactory DRF healing level has been confirmed by the orthopaedic surgeon; for conservatively managed DRFs it is initiated immediately after the 4 to 6 weeks cast immobilization period, whereas with rigid internal fixation it may begin within the first 2 weeks (accelerated) or at 4 to 6 weeks (delayed-standard) following surgery depending on healing and stability; at minimum, early digital range of motion should be emphasized, early wrist ROM should also be considered after operative stabilization, and urgent referral is warranted for extreme digital stiffness, hand hypersensitivity, and/or trophic skin changes.

### Comparison of 24-month outcomes after treatment for distal radius fracture: the WRIST randomized clinical trial [^115TsJVX]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

For patients aged 60 years and older with unstable distal radius fractures, are there 24-month outcome differences across the 4 treatment strategies of volar locking plates, external fixation, percutaneous pinning, and casting?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 182 adults from 24 health systems, there were no significant differences in any 24-month outcome by treatment.

Meaning

These findings suggest that there are no differences in 24-month outcomes based on treatment and that patients with unstable distal radius fractures treated with casting can experience good outcomes despite malunion, while avoiding the risks of surgery.

### Timing of bisphosphonate initiation after fracture: what does the data really say? [^117E6Ls8]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Other Antiresorptives

RANK-L Inhibitor (Denosumab)

The RANK Ligand inhibitor denosumab (Prolia) inhibits osteoclast precursors from differentiating into mature osteoclasts. This causes an antiresorptive effect. While less data has been published on denosumab than bisphosphonates, it appears to have similar effects on bone healing, with one study demonstrating increased callus formation, increased bone mineral density, and no delay in fracture healing in mice. The Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every 6 Months (FREEDOM) trial examined the rate of delayed unions following fractures among individuals taking denosumab for primary fracture prevention and did not find an increase in delayed unions relative to placebo, but the small number of cases of delayed unions (2 in denosumab group, 4 in placebo) makes this result difficult to extrapolate.

Strontium Ranelate

Strontium ranelate has not been approved by the US FDA for use in osteoporosis but is in use in Europe and elsewhere. Its mechanism is not well understood. It is postulated to have a mixed mechanism of action including antiresorptive and anabolic mechanisms, but most available data suggest a predominantly antiresorptive mechanism. - A 2007 study of tibia fracture healing in rats suggested strontium ranelate did not impact fracture healing in either direction. A 2016 study of fracture healing in rabbits treated with strontium ranelate raised concerns that it might interfere with the acute phase of fracture healing. A 2016 level I study investigating the use of strontium ranelate as an adjuvant to accelerate fracture healing in wrist fractures did not demonstrate a benefit and did not assess for inhibition of fracture healing. Overall data on the impact of strontium ranelate on fracture healing are unclear and caution should be used in considering the use of this medication in the acute post-fracture period.

### Timing of bisphosphonate initiation after fracture: what does the data really say? [^114z2Ta2]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Kim et al found mean time to fracture healing did not differ significantly between individuals starting risedronate 1 week after surgery, 1 month after surgery, or 3 months after surgery (p = 0.42) in a multicenter prospective trial investigating the timing of bisphosphonate initiation following internal fixation of intertrochanteric femur fractures in 90 patients. Gong et al found no differences in clinical outcomes or radiographic parameters, including time to radiographic union, between individuals randomized to start bisphosphonates at 2 weeks vs 3 months post-fracture (6.7 vs 6.8 weeks, p = 0.65) in a randomized controlled trial of 50 osteoporotic women 50 years of age and older undergoing volar locking plate fixation for distal radius fracture. Clinical outcomes were measured using wrist motion, grip strength and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score. Seo et al found no delay in radiographic fracture union or clinical outcomes between those who started a bisphosphonate 2 weeks post fracture compared to those who began a bisphosphonate 3 months post-fracture in a level III retrospective review of 82 patients treated with locking plate fixation for proximal humerus fractures at a single institution. Clinical outcomes were measured using Constant and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores.

These studies collectively suggest starting bisphosphonates 2 weeks or more after a fracture does not increase the rate of non-unions, mal-unions, or the time to radiographic union among patients who were not previously on a bisphosphonate. While the published clinical data suggest starting bisphosphonates in the first 2 weeks post fracture may be safe, the relatively paucity of data from this early time period makes us hesitant to recommend initiating bisphosphonates during the first 2 weeks post fracture.

### Interventions for treating wrist fractures in children [^111qCVwJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Wrist fractures, involving the distal radius, are the most common fractures in children. Most are buckle fractures, which are stable fractures, unlike greenstick and other usually displaced fractures. There is considerable variation in practice, such as the extent of immobilisation for buckle fractures and use of surgery for seriously displaced fractures.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions for common distal radius fractures in children, including skeletally immature adolescents.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries and reference lists to May 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing interventions for treating distal radius fractures in children. We sought data on physical function, treatment failure, adverse events, time to return to normal activities (recovery time), wrist pain, and child (and parent) satisfaction.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently performed study screening and selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We pooled data where appropriate and used GRADE for assessing the quality of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Of the 30 included studies, 21 were RCTs, seven were quasi-RCTs and two did not describe their randomisation method. Overall, 2930 children were recruited. Typically, trials included more male children and reported mean ages between 8 and 10 years. Eight studies recruited buckle fractures, five recruited buckle and other stable fractures, three recruited minimally displaced fractures and 14 recruited displaced fractures, typically requiring closed reduction, typically requiring closed reduction. All studies were at high risk of bias, mainly reflecting lack of blinding. The studies made 14 comparisons. Below we consider five prespecified comparisons:Removable splint versus below-elbow cast for predominantly buckle fractures (6 studies, 695 children)One study (66 children) reported similar Modified Activities Scale for Kids - Performance scores (0 to 100; no disability) at four weeks (median scores: splint 99.04; cast 99.11); low-quality evidence. Thirteen children needed a change or reapplication of device (splint 5/225; cast 8/219; 4 studies); very low-quality evidence. One study (87 children) reported no refractures at six months. One study (50 children) found no between-group difference in pain during treatment; very low-quality evidence. Evidence was absent (recovery time), insufficient (children with minor complications) or contradictory (child or parent satisfaction). Two studies estimated lower healthcare costs for removable splints. Soft or elasticated bandage versus below-elbow cast for buckle or similar fractures (4 studies, 273 children)One study (53 children) reported more children had no or only limited disability at four weeks in the bandage group; very low-quality evidence. Eight children changed device or extended immobilisation for delayed union (bandage 5/90; cast 3/91; 3 studies); very low-quality evidence. Two studies (139 children) reported no serious adverse events at four weeks. Evidence was absent, insufficient or contradictory for recovery time, wrist pain, children with minor complications, and child and parent satisfaction. More bandage-group participants found their treatment convenient (39 children). Removal of casts at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (2 studies, 404 children, mainly buckle fractures)One study (233 children) found full restoration of physical function at four weeks; low-quality evidence. There were five treatment changes (home 4/197; hospital 1/200; 2 studies; very low-quality evidence). One study found no serious adverse effects at six months (288 children). Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There was no evidence of a difference in pain at four weeks (233 children); low-quality evidence. One study (80 children) found greater parental satisfaction in the home group; low-quality evidence. One UK study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. Below-elbow versus above-elbow casts for displaced or unstable both-bone fractures (4 studies, 399 children)Short-term physical function data were unavailable but very low-quality evidence indicated less dependency when using below-elbow casts. One study (66 children with minimally displaced both-bone fractures) found little difference in ABILHAND-Kids scores (0 to 42; no problems) (mean scores: below-elbow 40.7; above-elbow 41.8); very low-quality evidence. Overall treatment failure data are unavailable, but nine of the 11 remanipulations or secondary reductions (366 children, 4 studies) were in the above-elbow group; very low-quality evidence. There was no refracture or compartment syndrome at six months (215 children; 2 studies). Recovery time and overall numbers of children with minor complications were not reported. There was little difference in requiring physiotherapy for stiffness (179 children, 2 studies); very low-quality evidence. One study (85 children) found less pain at one week for below-elbow casts; low-quality evidence. One study found treatment with an above-elbow cast cost three times more in Nepal. Surgical fixation with percutaneous wiring and cast immobilisation versus cast immobilisation alone after closed reduction of displaced fractures (5 studies, 323 children)Where reported, above-elbow casts were used. Short-term functional outcome data were unavailable. One study (123 children) reported similar ABILHAND-Kids scores indicating normal physical function at six months (mean scores: surgery 41.9; cast only 41.4); low-quality evidence. There were fewer treatment failures, defined as early or problematic removal of wires or remanipulation for early loss in position, after surgery (surgery 20/124; cast only 41/129; 4 studies; very low-quality evidence). Similarly, there were fewer serious advents after surgery (surgery 28/124; cast only 43/129; 4 studies; very low-quality evidence). Recovery time, wrist pain, and satisfaction were not reported. There was lower referral for physiotherapy for stiffness after surgery (1 study); very low-quality evidence. One USA study found similar treatment costs in both groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Where available, the quality of the RCT-based evidence on interventions for treating wrist fractures in children is low or very low. However, there is reassuring evidence of a full return to previous function with no serious adverse events, including refracture, for correctly-diagnosed buckle fractures, whatever the treatment used. The review findings are consistent with the move away from cast immobilisation for these injuries. High-quality evidence is needed to address key treatment uncertainties; notably, some priority topics are already being tested in ongoing multicentre trials, such as FORCE.

### Protecting my injured child: a qualitative study of parents' experience of caring for a child with a displaced distal radius fracture [^112ArHGE]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Childhood fractures are common with around one-third of children suffering at least one fracture before the age of 17 years old. Childhood fractures have a significant effect on families altering children's sleep, daily activities, independence and play. Parents can be required to miss work, change their household routines and experience concerns about how the fracture is healing and potential complications.

The wrist is the most common part of the body for children to break. The more serious wrist fractures (displaced distal radius fractures) often look visibly deformed. The children's radius acute fracture fixation trial (CRAFFT) is a multicentre randomised non-inferiority trial of surgical reduction (surgery) versus casting without surgery (cast) for displaced distal radius fractures. In the UK, these fractures are typically treated with surgery to realign the bones. The bones are sometimes held in position temporarily by wires (Kirschner wires or K-wires) or plates and screws. K-wires are stiff straight wires that pierce the skin, though protrude through the skin and are usually removed in outpatient clinics. However, surgery may not always be necessary in children as their bones are still growing. The growth of bones enables a process called 'remodelling' to occur. Remodelling allows deformity caused by fractures to self-correct as the bone grows.

Evidence regarding parent and children's experience of orthopaedic injuries and treatment decision-making is limited. After a medial epicondyle fracture, parents' endeavoured to make a decision about the best treatment for their child and facilitate their child's recovery but they struggled to accept treatment uncertainty.

Recruiting children to clinical trials is challenging, particularly trials comparing operative vs non-operative treatments. Parents can be uncomfortable making a decision on behalf of their child. They worry about the consequences of making the wrong decision, self-recrimination, unknown future complications and their child receiving the least effective treatment. Parents' moral obligation to be a good parent can exacerbate the challenge of making a decision about trial participation. Children are valued not just for the people that they are but also for the people that they will become. Parents are therefore not only responsible for their child's current wellbeing but also their future wellbeing. Parents desire to be a good parent and protect their child and their child's future self as well as concerns about the appearance of their child's wrist may influence their decision to participate in CRAFFT.

### Comparison of 24-month outcomes after treatment for distal radius fracture: the WRIST randomized clinical trial [^111xNacX]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this randomized clinical trial, there were no differences among the 4 treatment groups according to outcomes 24 months after fracture. Therefore, long-term outcomes are not a factor in selecting the optimal DRF treatment. The insight from these 24-month data is that older patients who chose nonoperative treatment adapted to their deformity and functioned similarly to those who chose an operative treatment, despite malunion. This effect was maintained at 2 years, which assures the lack of deterioration of overall function over time. If older patients understand the ramification of malunion and observed wrist deformity, it is appropriate to offer patients casting as a rational treatment option over the need for ideal radiographic correction with an operative approach.

### Early daily activity: development and description of an occupation-based intervention for surgically repaired distal radius fractures [^113wGiHM]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Principle One: Activity during early rehabilitation is safe within defined parameters

The first principle to underpin the EDA-intervention is that performance of light daily activities by 2 weeks after surgery without a wrist orthosis is safe. Systematic reviews and expert opinion show that commencing light daily activities by 2 weeks after surgery is commonly recommended and with complication rates similar to immobilisation. Biomechanical studies support early light loading of the operated wrist by consistently demonstrating the strength of volar locking plates in withstanding the forces of early mobilisation and active use. –

Due to the lack of a clear definition of what light activity means, we developed a set of parameters for safe activity. These parameters are intended to assist patients and therapists in deciding which activities can be safely commenced within 2 weeks of surgery. An activity should involve non-forceful grip, involve only light lifting, be non-weight-bearing, be comfortable to perform, provide appropriate challenge, and be valued. These parameters are detailed in Table 2.

Table 2.
Parameters for safe activities that can be commenced within 2 weeks of a surgically repaired distal radius fracture.

Principle Two: Activity during early rehabilitation is appropriately self-determined

The second principle of the EDA-intervention asserts that patients can be trusted to make decisions about types of appropriate daily activities. Despite recommendations for early commencement of daily activity, our clinical observations suggested that hand surgeons or therapists may distrust their patient's ability to modulate activity levels. Our research therefore explored how patients make decisions about which activities to perform without a wrist orthosis during the early weeks of rehabilitation. Patient narratives illustrated that people use strategies such as pain thresholds, testing-out, and task analysis to select activities that challenge range of motion, without overloading healing bone.

We found that while participants were able to make safe decisions about performing light activities, many people were hindered by conflicting advice from their hand surgery and therapy team. Participants were often given contrary advice about whether to use their wrist without an orthosis. This led to fear of daily activity and slow progress with using the affected wrist. For this reason, a key component of our intervention is clear and consistent education about active use of the hand and wrist without an orthosis. We recommend the use of occupationally positive language that frames daily activities as beneficial and an expected component of postoperative rehabilitation. In this context, people are able to make safe decisions about activity performance.

### The relationship between hand therapy and long-term outcomes after distal radius fracture in older adults: evidence from the randomized wrist and radius injury surgical trial [^114jertj]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Older patients are frequently referred to hand therapy after distal radius fracture. Supervised therapy sessions place a transportation burden on patients and are costly on both the individual and systematic levels. Furthermore, there is little evidence that supervised therapy or home exercises improve long-term outcomes.

Methods

Data were collected for the Wrist and Radius Injury Surgical Trial, a multicenter, international, pragmatic, randomized trial of distal radius fracture treatment in patients aged 60 years and older. Referral to therapy and therapy protocol were at the discretion of the treating surgeon and therapist. The authors examined outcomes between participants who underwent therapy and those who did not and assessed the duration of therapy. The authors also analyzed the effect of therapy on subgroups at risk for poor outcomes: older participants and those who had more comorbidities or lower baseline activity.

Results

Eighty percent of participants underwent therapy; 70 percent participated in both supervised therapy and home exercises. Participants had a mean 9.2 supervised sessions over 14.2 weeks. There were no differences in patient-reported outcomes between participants who underwent therapy and those who did not. Participants who did not have therapy recovered more grip strength. Participants who engaged in therapy for a shorter time reported greater function, ability to work, and satisfaction. There were no relationships revealed in subgroup analyses.

Conclusions

Hand therapy after distal radius fracture may not be necessary for older patients. Encouraging participants to resume activities of daily living as soon as possible may be as effective as formal therapy.

### Reflections 1 year into the 21-center National Institutes of Health – funded WRIST study: a primer on conducting a multicenter clinical trial [^111J7C5H]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The Wrist and Radius Injury Surgery Trial (WRIST) study group is a collaboration of 21 hand surgery centers in the United States, Canada, and Singapore, to showcase the interest and capability of hand surgeons to conduct a multicenter clinical trial. The WRIST study group was formed in response to the seminal systematic review by Margaliot et al and the Cochrane report that indicated marked deficiency in the quality of evidence in the distal radius fracture literature. Since the initial description of this fracture by Colles in 1814, over 2,000 studies have been published on this subject; yet, high-level studies based on the principles of evidence-based medicine are lacking. As we continue to embrace evidence-based medicine to raise the quality of research, the lessons learned during the organization and conduct of WRIST can serve as a template for others contemplating similar efforts. This article traces the course of WRIST by sharing the triumphs and, more important, the struggles faced in the first year of this study.

### Transitioning from hurting to healing: self-management after distal radius fracture [^113s9PcZ]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Chronic pain and disability after musculoskeletal trauma support the need for non-biomedical perspectives to frame experiences of recovery. Self-management is a specific holistic lens with implications for improving health outcomes. This qualitative study explored how adults made meaning of self-management after distal radius fracture (DRF).

Methods

Thirty-one individuals aged 45–72 with a unilateral DRF participated in a semi-structured interview 2–4 weeks after discontinuing full-time wrist immobilization. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed, and constructivist grounded theory techniques were used to analyze the data.

Results

Participants made meaning of self-management as a process of "transitioning from hurting to healing", which occurred via three underlying processes. "Learning because of my injury" included gaining information for empowerment and understanding by physically living through the experience. "Working and hoping toward healing" involved taking active steps to recovery in the face of uncertainty. "Getting back to my normal self" comprised reconnecting to one's body and identity after injury.

Conclusions

Participants' lived experiences overlapped with those of self-managing chronic conditions, highlighting the need to consider how individuals actively engage in their recovery after DRF. Findings suggest using supportive interventions to facilitate patients' understanding, activation, and engagement in meaningful activity after DRF. Implication for rehabilitationTo maximize health outcomes after distal radius fracture, clinicians should move beyond impairment remediation to supporting multiple dimensions of recovery, including emotional distress and functional limitations. Clinicians should routinely provide early and ongoing information, such as expected symptoms and recovery time frames, to minimize loss of control related to uncertainty. Clinicians should emphasize active interventions, such as collaborative goal setting and functional tasks, that engage patients in their own healing. Clinicians should support patients' early return to meaningful activity to maintain or restore connection to the body and identity.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^113y1fv2]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Distal radius fracture (DRF) postoperative rehabilitation timing — Early exercise initiation within 1–3 weeks appears safe and may lead to noticeably quicker functional gains versus a delayed ≥ 4 weeks approach; reviews including 8 level I-II, and 1 level III RCTs indicated that starting at 3 weeks improves short-term (6–12 weeks) function, wrist active range of motion (AROM), and grip strength and long-term (6 months) outcomes compared with delaying to ≥ 6 weeks. Additional evidence (2 level I and 2 level IV) supports initiation within the first 2 weeks for superior 6-week functional, wrist AROM, and grip strength outcomes versus ≥ 4 weeks, though one level I trial found no extra benefits for starting within the first postoperative week versus 2 weeks; gains may persist up to 6 months and AROM/grip gains up to 1 year. Two level IV case-control studies showed no benefit when starting in the first postoperative week versus ≥ 4 weeks, although one study found fewer therapy visits when starting at week 1 rather than 6 weeks. Two systematic reviews indicated a trend to higher postoperative complication or union-adverse effect risk (RR = 3.0%-3.3%) with earlier starts than 4 or more weeks, but this increase was not to be significant.

### Soft tissue injuries: chapter 8 forearm, hand and wrist [^112gxJiE]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Hand, wrist and forearm injuries are common presentations to the emergency department. There is a huge variation of severity from small lacerations involving only skin to extensive upper limb composite loss. There is no minor injury in upper limb trauma. Even the most trivial of wounds may be associated with major tendon or nerve damage which, if missed, may have life-long functional implications for the patient. Although this review concentrates on soft tissue injury and not bony injury, it is not possible to separate the two completely. It is important to realise that all fractures have a soft tissue injury component that needs to be assessed and correctly treated. In some instances the soft tissue component is much more important than the fracture, and failure to recognise it will result in a poor outcome.

### Short term outcomes following open reduction internal fixation surgery for a distal radius fracture: 2 week versus 4 week immobilization. A retrospective analysis [^114YvySB]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A distal radius fracture (DRF) is defined as a fracture occurring in the distal radius within 3 cm of the radio-carpal joint.DRF are one of the most common fractures that occur in adults, accounting for approximately 15% of all fractures. The incidence is increasing with an aging population. It is predicted that wrist fractures will increase by 25% in the next 4 years in people aged over 50. A large percentage of the annual health cost is utilized by DRF patients; as a result of the initial assessment and investigation, surgery, treatment materials, therapy costs and time at work lost. The determination of the most efficient and effective care available is of benefit to the patient and health provider combined.

Surgery offers an obvious increased potential risk of infection and soft tissue damage, therefore internal or external fixation is reserved for more complex injuries. Fracture fixation using a VLP is currently the most common surgical treatment for this population. Studies by McCamley et al, Wigg et al, Wilcke et al.and Rozental et al.have compared VLP to other fixation methods (external fixation, k wires, non-locking plates and bridging external fixation). These studies indicate that earlier function is obtained if a VLP is used surgically.

Early movement post surgery is beneficial in prevention of adherence of the tendons to the metal work or skin, reducing joint adhesions and finger stiffness, reducing neural tightness, and preventing unnecessary muscle atrophy. It has been shown that patients with finger stiffness (following a DRF) have a greater pain intensity score and disability than those without stiffness. Motion will aid reduction of swelling and stiffness that is a result of oedema. This enables the patient to experience a return of motion to the hand; improved motion will allow functional gains.

Therapy that is begun too early post surgery may disrupt the inflammatory phase and early proliferative phase of healing. Proliferation of the repair material peaks at approximately 2 to 3 weeks post surgery, this is when the bulk of the scar tissue is formed. Beginning motion around this time will allow the collagen to respond favorably to the mechanical stress applied to it. Delaying motion for longer than this period may result in adherence of the soft tissues and joint stiffness. The optimum period to begin therapy post fracture and fracture fixation remains inconclusive, despite several small studies.-

### Treatment of distal radius fracture: does early activity postinjury lead to a lower incidence of complex regional pain syndrome? [^113jdMo8]. Hand (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Study Protocol

This clinical observation study was designed as a continuation of the proof-of-concept cohort study, which was started in December 2012. The study was performed between December 2012 and July 2017 in a level 1 trauma center in the Netherlands. The local ethical committee approved the study (NL2014–1361).

Participants

Adult patients (age > 18 years) who were undergoing nonoperative treatment for a DRF were asked to participate in this study by their physicians. Patients predisposed to unreliably answering questions due to intellectual or language problems were excluded. Patients who gave informed consent received, after fracture reduction and plaster cast immobilization, an information leaflet with instructions for a home exercise program and an explanation about the role of pain. Moreover, they were informed that they would be approached for a telephone interview after at least 2 to 3 months following the fracture. When necessary, patients were invited for a visit to the outpatient clinic.

Clinical Treatment Procedure

The Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) system was used for the classification of DRFs. After removal of the plaster cast (after 4–6 weeks of plaster cast immobilization), patients were taught how to exercise their fingers, forearm, and wrist. They were allowed to resume normal activities, gradually increasing the amount of weight and force the affected arm and wrist used, based on the expected course of fracture healing explained by the home exercise leaflet (Figure 1). The instructions instructed the patients on the importance of using and safely strengthening the arm and/or wrist for proper healing of the fracture and for optimizing arm-hand function. The patients were strictly instructed to perform all exercises on a daily basis at home as soon as possible for a 6-week period.

### ESR essentials: imaging of suspected child abuse-practice recommendations by the European society of paediatric radiology [^1178KFRT]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Metaphyseal injury

In the appropriate clinical setting, classic metaphyseal fractures (corner/chip or bucket handle fractures) are considered the most specific radiographic injury of physical abuse. They are most frequently seen in the distal femur, the tibia, and the proximal humerus, but also occur in the elbow, wrist (Fig. 5), and shoulder. Small undisplaced classic metaphyseal fractures tend to heal within 4 weeks without callus formation by gradual bone consolidation, whereas healing of larger or displaced fractures may take 6–8 weeks. When the adjacent periosteum is injured, subperiosteal haemorrhage occurs, which, during the healing process, is evident as a periosteal reaction. Classic metaphyseal fractures must be differentiated from normal growth variations, which may take the form of subtle irregularities, 'step-off' (also termed a metaphyseal collar) or even mimic a small avulsion. In children over the age of 12–15 months with genu vara, metaphyseal fragmentation can be seen due to abnormal stresses associated with early weight bearing.

Long bone fractures

In cases of suspected child abuse, long bone fractures have been documented in 26% of infants. Fractures to the long tubular bones in physically abused children most commonly involve the femur and tibia, followed by the forearm (Fig. 5). Mid-shaft fractures of the humerus in infants are more common in cases of physical abuse than non-abuse. Without a plausible explanation of a significant high-energy impact (e.g. a road traffic accident), discovering a long bone fracture in a pre-ambulant infant should always raise suspicion of physical abuse. Physiological periosteal new bone formation along the shaft of the long bones is a common feature in infants between the ages of 1–4 months of age, and should be differentiated from isolated subperiosteal new bone formation.

### A scoping review of operative and non-invasive management in the treatment of non-unions [^116nST6W]. Injury (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-union occurs when a fracture fails to adequately heal, and requires additional intervention to achieve union. The purpose of this scoping review is to provide a high-level overview of the existing non-union management literature. This review aims to highlight the current literature on non-union management, as well as identify key areas that require future research to provide a better understanding of potential non-union management strategies.

Methods

This study utilized the scoping review framework from Arksey and O'Malley All relevant literature on non-union management was systematically searched for within the OVID Medline, OVID Embase, and Web of Science databases. As a scoping review, this study aimed to identify the high-level trends in non-union literature. This was assessed through a visual and numerical summary of the general themes in non-union literature, as well as the timeline in which these trends have occurred.

Results

The literature search identified 8081 articles, of which 2210 articles were included. There is a large body of evidence for various surgical treatment options for non-union. The literature suggests healing rates between 80 and 100 percent for commonly utilized surgical procedures, such as plating with bone graft for long bones. Despite these beneficial healing rates, the requirement of a surgery creates a large socioeconomic burden. The possibility for bone growth stimulator (BGS) options to achieve non-union healing rates in a similar realm as surgical options suggests that the use of a BGS may be a beneficial option prior to surgical intervention, as this would potentially reduce the number of patients who would otherwise require surgery.

Conclusion

A large body of evidence exists on non-union management, which is largely comprised of case series and reports. The most commonly assessed non-unions include the tibia, wrist, and femur. Bone grafting, plating, and nailing are the most investigated treatment options. BGS are a non-operative treatment options for non-union that provide similar healing rates to surgical options in certain indications within initial observational data. BGS are a potential option for non-operative management of non-unions to reduce socioeconomic burdens of surgical intervention, with a need for further high-quality investigation in this therapeutic area.

### Assessment of distal radius fracture complications among adults 60 years or older: a secondary analysis of the WRIST randomized clinical trial [^117T6YPf]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Results

The WRIST enrolled a total of 304 participants (187 randomized [65 to VLPS, 58 to percutaneous pinning, 64 to external fixation with or without supplemental pinning]; 117 who opted to not have surgery and were enrolled for casting), of whom 8 casting group participants were later found to be ineligible and were excluded from the analysis, leaving 296 participants (Figure). Randomized participants' mean (SD) age was 68 (7.2) years (163 [87%] were female and 165 [88%] were white). Treatment groups were balanced with respect to most measured baseline characteristics, except casting participants were older (mean [SD] age, 75.6 [9.6] years; P < .001) and completed fewer follow-up visits (mean [SD], 3.7 [1.4]; P < .001) (Table 1). Among casting participants, 93 (84%) were female and 85 (85%) were white. Time interval from injury to enrollment was similar across all participants with a mean (SD) of 5 (4.2) days, and the mean (SD) time interval from injury to surgery was 8 (9.8) days for randomized participants. Nine participants withdrew from the study soon after enrollment (2 external fixation, 2 pinning, and 5 casting), leaving 287 participants with complication data (65 participants in VLPS, 62 in external fixation, 56 in pinning, and 104 in casting).

### Ibandronate sodium (Boniva) [^114M8pzz]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Rarely, patients have reported severe bone, joint, and/or muscle pain
starting within one day to several months after beginning to take, by mouth,
bisphosphonate drugs to treat osteoporosis (thin bones). This group of drugs
includes BONIVA. Most patients experienced relief after stopping the drug.
Contact your health care provider if you develop these symptoms after starting
BONIVA.

Rarely, patients taking bisphosphonates have reported serious jaw problems
associated with delayed healing and infection, often following dental procedures
such as tooth extraction. If you experience jaw problems, contact your health
care provider and dentist.

What is osteoporosis?

Osteoporosis is a disease that causes bones to become thinner. Thin bones can
break easily. Most people think of their bones as being solid like a rock.
Actually, bone is living tissue, just like other parts of the body, such as your
heart, brain, or skin. Bone just happens to be a harder type of tissue. Bone is
always changing. Your body keeps your bones strong and healthy by replacing old
bone with new bone.

Osteoporosis causes the body to remove more bone than it replaces. This means
that bones get weaker. Weak bones are more likely to break. Osteoporosis is a
bone disease that is quite common in women after menopause. At first,
osteoporosis has no symptoms, but people with osteoporosis may develop loss of
height and are more likely to break (fracture) their bones, especially the back
(spine), wrist, and hip bones.

### Effect of alendronic acid on fracture healing: a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial [^112CRsMr]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

There is a concern that bisphosphonates may impair fracture healing because of their inhibitory effects on bone turnover. Here we evaluated the effects of early bisphosphonate therapy on fracture healing and functional outcome following a fracture of the distal radius. The fracture and bisphosphonates (FAB) trial was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 15 trauma centers in the United Kingdom. We enrolled 421 bisphosphonate-naive patients aged ≥ 50 years with a radiographically confirmed fracture of the distal radius and randomized them in a 1:1 ratio to receive alendronic acid 70mg once weekly (n = 215) or placebo (n = 206) within 14 days of the fracture. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of fractures that had radiologically united at 4 weeks as assessed by an observer, blinded to treatment allocation. Secondary outcomes included the Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, range of wrist movement and grip strength, pain and analgesia requirements, and the rate of malunion. The mean ± SD age of participants was 63 ± 8.5 years and 362 (86%) were female. At 4 weeks, 48 of 202 (23.8%) fractures had united in the alendronic acid group compared with 52 of 187 (27.8%) in the placebo group (observed absolute proportion difference 4.0%; 95% CI, -4.7% to 12.8%; p = 0.36). The absolute proportion difference between groups based on imputed data was 4.5% (95% CI, -4.7% to 13.8%; p = 0.30). There was no significant difference in the proportion of fractures that had united at any other time point and no differences in the DASH score, pain at the fracture site, grip strength, or any other clinical outcome. We conclude that among patients aged 50 years and above with a distal radius fracture, early administration of alendronic acid does not adversely affect fracture union or clinical outcome. These findings suggest bisphosphonate therapy can be safely commenced early after fracture if clinically indicated. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Comparison of distal radius fracture outcomes in older adults stratified by chronologic vs physiologic age managed with casting vs surgery [^1121AkAG]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is recovery after distal radius fracture managed with casting vs surgery different in patients stratified by physiologic vs chronologic age?

Findings

This secondary analysis of the Wrist and Radius Injury Surgical Trial demonstrated that older adults with high preinjury activity levels and few comorbidities had clinically significant improvement in short-term patient-reported outcomes after surgical treatment of distal radius fractures.

Meaning

These findings suggest that surgeons should place emphasis on a patient's baseline activity level and number of comorbidities to guide operative treatment decisions of distal radius fractures in older adults, even if these individuals have an advanced chronologic age.

### Wrist fracture and risk of subsequent fracture: findings from the women's health initiative study [^115HgqdY]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2015). Low credibility.

Wrist fractures are common in postmenopausal women and are associated with functional decline. Fracture patterns after wrist fracture are unclear. The goal of this study was to determine the frequency and types of fractures that occur after a wrist fracture among postmenopausal women. We carried out a post hoc analysis of data from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study and Clinical Trials (1993–2010) carried out at 40 US clinical centers. Participants were postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years at baseline. Mean follow-up duration was 11.8 years. Main measures included incident wrist, clinical spine, humerus, upper extremity, lower extremity, hip, and total non-wrist fractures and bone mineral density (BMD) in a subset. Among women who experienced wrist fracture, 15.5% subsequently experienced non-wrist fracture. The hazard for non-wrist fractures was higher among women who had experienced previous wrist fracture than among women who had not experienced wrist fracture: non-wrist fracture overall (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33–1.48), spine (HR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.32–1.66), humerus (HR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.57–2.02), upper extremity (non-wrist) (HR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.70–2.07), lower extremity (non-hip) (HR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.26–1.48), and hip (HR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.32–1.71) fracture. Associations persisted after adjustment for BMD, physical activity, and other risk factors. Risk of non-wrist fracture was higher in women who were younger when they experienced wrist fracture (interaction p value 0.02). Associations between incident wrist fracture and subsequent non-wrist fracture did not vary by baseline BMD category (normal, low bone density, osteoporosis). A wrist fracture is associated with increased risk of subsequent hip, vertebral, upper extremity, and lower extremity fractures. There may be substantial missed opportunity for intervention in the large number of women who present with wrist fractures.

### Assessment of distal radius fracture complications among adults 60 years or older: a secondary analysis of the WRIST randomized clinical trial [^114SLz86]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

The study's analysis of older patients showed that external fixation treatment was associated with more moderate complications than VLPS, and so its use should be carefully considered. Pinning can be reserved for those who can diligently practice pin care. Patients who are willing to receive invasive surgery and need quicker return of function can be treated with VLPS, taking into account its intense resource use with regard to surgical time and cost. Overall, choice of DRF treatment method in older patients should be specific to individual goals to balance functional outcomes and complication risks as advocated by precision health.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^1157R3Br]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Distal radius fracture rehabilitation — therapeutic exercises: Therapeutic exercises following DRF are typically implemented regardless of the type of fracture management, with early active range of motion (AROM) for the involved hand and other proximal joints potentially starting during the initial wrist immobilization phase and AROM and passive range of motion (PROM) for the involved wrist initiated when proper fracture healing has been attained; in a comparison of standard therapy to standard therapy plus a scapular exercise program after cast immobilization, the control group received 12 visits of AROM in whirlpool, radiocarpal mobilizations, grip strengthening, and reverse dart throwing exercises, while the scapular exercise group received low-intensity scapular positioning exercises below shoulder level, resulting in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful change in DASH scores at 6 weeks favoring the scapular exercise group, with no differences in AROM or PRWE scores.

### Bone turnover markers: basic biology to clinical applications [^115rivVg]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Fracture

Fracture healing leads to an increase in BTMs. This increase reflects the formation of a callus and the modeling and remodeling involved in bone repair. Ivaska et al have shown that a few hours after a fracture, no change is observed in PINP, OC, CTX, and TRACP5b and therefore immediate postfracture sampling may provide baseline information on these BTMs. Both formation and resorption markers increase after a fracture; however, the timing of the peak differs between BTMs, reflecting the specific phases of bone modeling and remodeling reflected by each BTM (Fig. 16). For example, after a distal forearm fracture, bone ALP peaks after 2 to 4 weeks, PINP peaks at 6 weeks and OC at 26 weeks. Bone resorption markers seem to peak a bit earlier, with CTX peak reported as early as 2 weeks, uNTX peak at 6 weeks, and TRACP5b peak at 12 weeks. However, no increase in uNTX was observed after an ankle fracture. BTMs have been reported to return to baseline after 1 year following a wrist or ankle fracture but some of them might remain high. These findings suggest that increased remodeling and mineralization continue after fracture healing, probably as a response to the fracture and immobilization. After a fracture, the amount of increase in BTMs varies over time between the different BTMs and depends on the size of the bone that was fractured. Some studies suggest that the size of the fractured bone is the main determinant of the increase, but other features such as BMD of the fractured bone, the fracture's bone surface, the need for surgery, and the degree of immobilization also play a role. Therefore, an increase in most BTMs is observed up to 1 year after a fracture.

### Timing of osteoporosis therapies following fracture: the current status [^116VJvp9]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)

PTH and PTHrP both bind to the same receptor (PTH1R) with similar bioactivity in their N-terminal region. Although Abaloparatide has been shown to increase BMD at various sites in RCT, data are lacking about its effect on fracture healing in humans.

Drug with anabolic and antiresorptive action

Strontium ranelate

Strontium ranelate has a dual function. It activates osteoblasts and increases bone formation and inhibits osteoclasts and reduces bone absorption. Animal models have shown that strontium ranelate enhances callus strength in osteoporotic ratsand could promote tibial fracture healing. However, an RCT conducted by Scaglione et al. in 40 patients older than 60 years with wrist fracture, failed to show any benefit. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: both groups (A and B) received calcium and vitamin D supplements. Group B additionally received strontium ranelate 2 g daily. In this study, strontium ranelate administered in acute phase neither improved nor accelerated fracture healing.

### The impact of wrist fracture, surgical repair and immobilization on patients: a qualitative study [^112K3h8j]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate patients' experience following wrist fracture, surgical repair and immobilization.

Design

A qualitative investigation involving individual participant interviews.

Setting

A metropolitan trauma service.

Subjects

In all, 31 participants were consecutively recruited from three groups within a randomized controlled trial comparing immobilization for one (n = 11), three (n = 10) or six weeks (n = 10) following surgical treatment for wrist fracture.

Intervention

Individual interviews were conducted within three months of cast removal. Questions prompted discussion of the experience of fracture, surgery and immobilization. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim. At least two independent researchers performed coding and theming following principles of thematic analysis.

Results

Two themes were identified: (1) impact of the injury varies widely and (2) health care consumers want trustworthy dialogue. Participant reports indicated that recovery from wrist fracture, surgery and immobilization is challenging with significant changes to social role and increased dependence. For many, lack of empathy from health professionals and limited acknowledgement of the personal impact of injury led to dissatisfaction. Health professionals did not consistently tailor communication or adopt strategies to address specific needs for pain management, education and support requirements. There was no evidence that processes were implemented to enhance participant recall and comprehension. Most participants experienced their cast as a barrier to function. However, within the group of participants immobilized for one week, a number felt the cast was removed too soon.

Conclusion

Participant reports indicate that recovery from surgically repaired wrist fracture is challenging. Opportunities exist to refine care in pain management, education and active engagement of patients in their care.

Statistical Analysis

The Data Safety and Monitoring Board–approved statistical analysis plan is available in the study protocol (Supplement 1). The analytical cohort was intention-to-treat. The primary aim of WRIST was to compare MHQ summary and domain scores and clinical functional outcomes by treatment group 12 months after surgery or fracture. The present analysis represents the fourth aim of the funded proposal: to compare 24-month outcomes by the 4 treatment groups. We first reported crude means at 24 months for all outcomes by treatment group. We compared 24-month outcomes across the 4 groups using a mixed-effects model with follow-up data at all assessment times as the response variable. The model for each outcome variable included participants nested within sites as random intercepts, and treatment group indicators, time indicators, time by treatment group indicators, and baseline values of the outcome measure (or baseline MHQ pain scores for the analysis of MHQ summary and domain scores) were included as factors associated with outcomes. The model also included as covariates baseline factors found to be associated with missing 24-month follow-up data: age, race, smoking status, and baseline Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity score. Race was assessed because it has been associated with missing visits. Participants self-identified their race and other demographic information. Assuming missing-at-random, we expect the mixed model to provide unbiased estimates. Marginal means at month 24 based on the model were compared across the treatment groups. Because missing-at-random cannot be tested, we also assessed whether results across treatment groups depended on the pattern of missingness by graphically examining the means of outcome measures at each assessment time based on all observations (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2) and also by the missing data pattern (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2).

### Effect of early administration of alendronate after surgery for distal radial fragility fracture on radiological fracture healing time [^1166Yar2]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2013). Low credibility.

This multicentre prospective clinical trial aimed to determine whether early administration of alendronate (ALN) delays fracture healing after surgical treatment of fractures of the distal radius. The study population comprised 80 patients (four men and 76 women) with a mean age of 70 years (52 to 86) with acute fragility fractures of the distal radius requiring open reduction and internal fixation with a volar locking plate and screws. Two groups of 40 patients each were randomly allocated either to receive once weekly oral ALN administration (35 mg) within a few days after surgery and continued for six months, or oral ALN administration delayed until four months after surgery. Postero-anterior and lateral radiographs of the affected wrist were taken monthly for six months after surgery. No differences between groups was observed with regard to gender (p = 1.0), age (p = 0.916), fracture classification (p = 0.274) or bone mineral density measured at the spine (p = 0.714). The radiographs were assessed by three independent assessors. There were no significant differences in the mean time to complete cortical bridging observed between the ALN group (3.5 months (SE 0.16)) and the no-ALN group (3.1 months (SE 0.15)) (p = 0.068). All the fractures healed in the both groups by the last follow-up. Improvement of the Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) score, grip strength, wrist range of movement, and tenderness over the fracture site did not differ between the groups over the six-month period. Based on our results, early administration of ALN after surgery for distal radius fracture did not appear to delay fracture healing times either radiologically or clinically.

### The wrist and radius injury surgical trial: 12-month outcomes from a multicenter international randomized clinical trial [^112a3bza]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal treatment for distal radius fractures in older adults remains uncertain. No randomized trials comparing the most frequently used treatments in this population have been conducted. Surgical treatment rates vary widely, and the sustained benefits of surgery are uncertain.

Methods

The Wrist and Radius Injury Surgical Trial, a randomized, multicenter trial, enrolled 304 adults aged 60 years and older with isolated, unstable distal radius fractures at 24 institutions. Patients who wanted surgery (n = 187) were randomized to internal fixation, external fixation, or percutaneous pinning; patients who preferred conservative management (n = 117) received casting. The primary outcome was the 12-month Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) summary score.

Results

At 12 months, there were no differences by treatment in primary outcome. Twelve-month MHQ summary scores differed between internal fixation and external fixation by 3 points (97.5 percent CI, 6.0 to 11.5) and between internal fixation and pinning by -0.14 (97.5 percent CI, -9.2 to 8.9). However, at 6 weeks, the mean MHQ summary score for internal fixation was greater than for external fixation by 19 (p < 0.001), pinning by 11 (p < 0.001), and casting by 7 (p = 0.03). Internal fixation participants demonstrated significantly better radiologic alignment throughout the follow-up period. Malunion was experienced by 48 percent of casting participants.

Conclusions

Recovery was fastest for internal fixation and slowest for external fixation according to most measures, but by 12 months there were no meaningful differences in outcomes. Casting participants experienced satisfactory results despite loss of radiologic alignment.

### Timing of osteoporosis therapies following fracture: the current status [^1159ZAgw]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In a meta-analysis of two RCTs and four retrospective studies comprising 607 patients, Han et al. assessed the role of teriparatide in improving hip fracture healing. Compared with the control group (n = 338), teriparatide (n = 269) reduced the time to union [weighted mean difference (WMD) = −1:95; 95% CI: −3.23 to −0.68; p = 0:003] but did not improve the rate of fracture union at 3 months (OR: 1:46; 95% CI: 0.50–4.24; p = 0:49) or at 6 months (OR: 0:89; 95% CI: 0.44–1.81; p = 0:75). Inclusion of both RCTs as well as observational studies, heterogeneity due to different treatment protocols (daily or weekly doses of teriparatide) and dissimilar study durations (from 6 weeks to 18 months) were the major limitations of this meta-analysis.

Effect on distal radius fracture

In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, multinational study, Aspenberg et al. analyzed the effect of teriparatide on distal radial fractures. A total of 102 postmenopausal women with a unilateral dorsally angulated fracture of the distal radius (Colles' fracture) were randomized within 10 days of fracture to receive either 8 weeks of once-daily placebo injections or teriparatide 20 mcg or teriparatide 40 mcg. The estimated median time from fracture to radiographic healing was 9.1, 7.4, and 8.8 weeks for placebo, teriparatide 20 mcg, and teriparatide 40 mcg, respectively. When compared with placebo, the radiographic healing time was significantly shorter in the teriparatide 20 mcg group (p = 0.006). In a post hoc subgroup analysis of this trial, Aspenberg and Johansson, studied the qualitative appearance of the callus 5 weeks after the fracture in 27 patients recruited at Linkoping University hospital. In this analysis, they concluded that teriparatide improves early callus formation in distal radial fractures.

### What is the probability of radial nerve recovery after surgical repair of humerus fractures accounting for time since injury? [^112fdhdp]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Radial nerve injury after operative treatment of humeral shaft fracture usually improves, but a subgroup of patients does not recover. Understanding the probability of recovery over time is important in deciding on watchful waiting, nerve exploration, or tendon or nerve transfer. Bayesian analysis is helpful in estimating such probabilities. This type of analysis is predicated on estimating the probability that an event will occur and subsequently updating that estimate as new information becomes available-for instance, when nerve recovery does not occur over time.

Questions/Purposes

Using Bayesian methods applied to a previously studied cohort, we asked: (1) Over time, up to the end of 18 months, what is the probability of radial nerve motor recovery after surgical fixation of humerus fractures? (2) What variables are associated with the timing of radial nerve recovery?

Methods

Between January 2002 and November 2014, we treated 375 patients with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for a traumatic diaphyseal humeral fracture at six urban hospitals (two Level 1 trauma centers, two Level 2 trauma centers, and two community hospitals). From this previously studied cohort, we lost access to one hospital's data, leaving us with 295 records to screen for eligibility. We considered patients with an isolated preoperative or postoperative radial nerve palsy, defined as an inability to extend the wrist against gravity (Medical Research Council grade < 3), as potentially eligible. Based on that, 24% (72 of 295) were eligible; of those, 2.8% (2 of 72) were excluded because a nerve disruption was repaired during ORIF. Another 24% (17) had incomplete data sets, leaving 74% (53) for analysis here. Patients with incomplete data sets did not differ from analyzed patients with respect to demographics or injury characteristics. The median (IQR) age was 43 years (25 to 61), and 49% (26 of 53) of patients were male. Most palsies presented preoperatively (83% [44]). Motor recovery was defined as the ability to extend the wrist against gravity (Medical Research Council grade ≥ 3). We conceptualized the probability of radial nerve recovery over time as two conditional probabilities: (1) the probability that the nerve injury is recoverable (neuropraxia, or recoverable axonotmesis), and (2) the probability that it did not recover at a certain point in time. We used a Bayesian network analysis to model these two probabilities. We based our estimate of the probability of a recoverable nerve injury on the largest systematic review, in which 90% (438 of 488 [95% confidence interval (CI) 87% to 92%]) recovered. To reflect uncertainty, we repeated the analysis for the upper and lower limits of its CI. To estimate the probability that recovery did not happen yet at a certain point in time, we used the timing of recovery from the patients in our cohort. We used Cox proportional hazards analysis to examine associations between time to recovery and demographic and injury variables, including age, sex, fracture type and location, vascular injury, type of fixation, and timing of palsy (preoperative versus postoperative).

Results

If a nerve has not recovered by 7 months, the probability of nerve recovery by 18 months was still better than chance, at 56% (range 48% to 62%). If the nerve had not recovered by 1 year, then the probability of recovery was 17% (range 13% to 21%). No variables (such as age, fracture location, vascular injury, or fixation type) were associated with timing of radial nerve recovery.

Conclusion

Providers can use our findings to counsel patients on the expected probability of nerve recovery, which might reduce anxiety while patients await recovery. These probabilities can aid in the decision whether and when nerve reconstruction, nerve transfers, or tendon transfers may be beneficial. Because the probability of recovery remains relatively high for at least 7 months after injury, early surgery is unlikely to be beneficial in patients with radial nerve motor injury after surgical fixation of humerus fractures. Future studies can provide more specific recovery probabilities by including findings on electrodiagnostic studies and patients treated nonoperatively.

### Protecting my injured child: a qualitative study of parents' experience of caring for a child with a displaced distal radius fracture [^116ReeNH]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Childhood fractures can have a significant impact on the daily lives of families affecting children's normal activities and parent's work. Wrist fractures are the most common childhood fracture. The more serious wrist fractures, that can look visibly bent, are often treated with surgery to realign the bones; but this may not be necessary as bent bones straighten in growing children. The children's radius acute fracture fixation trial (CRAFFT) is a multicentre randomised trial of surgery versus a cast without surgery for displaced wrist fractures. Little is known about how families experience these wrist fractures and how they manage treatment uncertainty. This study aimed to understand families' experience of this injury and what it is like to be asked to include their child in a clinical trial.

Methods

Nineteen families (13 mothers, 7 fathers, 2 children) from across the UK participated in telephone interviews. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.

Results

Our findings highlight parents' desire to be a good parent through the overarching theme "protecting my injured child". To protect their child after injury, parents endeavoured to make the right decisions about treatment and provide comfort to their child but they experienced ongoing worry about their child's recovery. Our findings show that parents felt responsible for the decision about their child's treatment and their child's recovery. They also reveal the extent to which parents worried about the look of their child's wrist and their need for reassurance that the wrist was healing.

Conclusion

Our findings show that protecting their child after injury can be challenging for parents who need support to make decisions about treatment and confidently facilitate their child's recovery. They also highlight the importance of providing information about treatments, acknowledging parents' concerns and their desire to do the right thing for their child, reassuring parents that their child's wrist will heal and ensuring parents understand what to expect as their child recovers.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^112p7hio]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Therapy initiation timing in distal radius fracture (DRF) — operative and nonoperative care: Traditional postoperative therapy approaches delay initiation of therapy until after 4 to 5 weeks of immobilization, and strengthening exercises start after 6 weeks postoperatively. Conversely, an accelerated therapy approach has been described as initiating wrist active range of motion (AROM) and strengthening exercises within the first 2 to 3 weeks after surgery. For nonoperative DRF treatment, strengthening usually starts after the end of a 6-week cast-immobilization period.

Defining the strength of the recommendations — judging the strength of evidence is only a steppingstone towards arriving at the strength of a systematic literature review recommendation. The strength of recommendation also takes into account the quality, quantity, and the trade-off between the benefits and harms of a treatment, the magnitude of a treatment's effect, and whether there is data on critical outcomes. The recommendations and their strength were voted on by the guideline development group members during the final meeting, and recommendations were approved and adopted in instances where a simple majority (60%) of the guideline development group voted to approve. All databases were last searched on February 19, 2020 with limits for publication dates from 2000-the date of the last search and English language.

### Carpal fractures in children [^11637pdt]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2005). Low credibility.

Carpal injuries in children are relatively rare. Diagnosis is likely to be missed, or the severity of the injury might not fully be appreciated at the time of presentation. Fortunately, in the majority of cases the fracture heals uneventfully with a low incidence of complications. As in adults, the scaphoid is most susceptible to injury and the capitate, which often presents in association with other carpal bone injuries, the next most susceptible. Other carpal bone fractures are very unusual and the literature largely is confined to case reports or very small series. This review article lists the common carpal injuries in children and suggests a treatment plan in each case, emphasizing the importance of having a high index of suspicion when faced with a child with a wrist injury and seemingly normal radiographs.

### Should acute scaphoid fractures be fixed? A randomized controlled trial [^112Q6nq6]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2005). Low credibility.

Background

With the proliferation of different fixation screws, there is an increasing trend to recommend early internal fixation of the broken scaphoid even if the fracture is not displaced. The benefits and risks of early fixation of scaphoid fractures have not been established. These were investigated in eighty-eight patients who were of working age with clearly defined minimally displaced or undisplaced bicortical fractures of the waist of the scaphoid.

Methods

Patients who provided informed consent were randomized to treatment with early internal fixation with use of a Herbert screw without a cast (forty-four patients) or to nonoperative treatment for eight weeks with immobilization in a below-the-elbow plaster cast with the thumb left free (forty-four patients). The patients were evaluated at two, eight, twelve, twenty-six, and fifty-two weeks with respect to the severity of pain; tenderness; swelling; wrist movement; grip strength; and symptoms and disability, which were assessed with the Patient Evaluation Measure. In addition, radiographs were made and assessed at each visit.

Results

No difference was detected between the groups with respect to age, sex, hand dominance, side of injury, mechanism of injury, or the occupation of the patients. The range of motion, score on the Patient Evaluation Measure, and grip strength were significantly better in the group managed operatively than in the group managed nonoperatively at the eight-week follow-up evaluation, which corresponded with the visit when the cast was removed in that group. Patients returned to work at five to six weeks after the injury in both groups. At twelve weeks, grip strength was better in patients who had had surgery. No significant difference was detected between the two groups with respect to any other outcome measure at any other time. Ten of the forty-four fractures treated nonoperatively had not healed radiographically at twelve weeks, and, as a consequence, the treatment was altered. Complications occurred in thirteen patients who had been managed operatively. All complications were minor, and ten were related to the scar.

Conclusions

This study did not demonstrate a clear overall benefit of early fixation of acute scaphoid fractures beyond the decrease in the rate of a change in treatment because of a delayed union at twelve weeks. Early internal fixation of minimally displaced or nondisplaced fractures of the scaphoid waist, which would heal in a cast, could lead to overtreatment of a large proportion of such fractures, exposing such patients to avoidable surgical risk. Thus, we have adopted a program of so-called aggressive conservative treatment, whereby we carefully assess fracture-healing with plain radiographs, and computed tomography scans if necessary, after six to eight weeks of cast immobilization and recommend surgical fixation with or without bone-grafting at that time if a gap is identified at the fracture site. Such an approach should result in fracture union in over 95% of such patients.

### Common complications of distal radial fractures [^1111MEqp]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Distal radial fractures are associated with good outcomes; however, although they occur at low rates, complications can significantly impair treatment success. Therefore, the treating surgeon should be aware of potential complications associated with each treatment type and how to best prevent them. Although certain patient-specific and fracture-specific factors may increase the risk of adverse outcomes, most are nonmodifiable risk factors at the time of presentation, so it is imperative that every effort is made to mitigate these risk factors to prevent long-term morbidity. Patients should be well-informed about these complications and potential symptoms so that they can be addressed expeditiously.

### Management of a 15-year-old scaphoid non-union [^117CCNTB]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Scaphoid non-union affects wrist joint function and is often associated with a predictable pattern of degenerative change. A 30-year-old man presented with a symptomatic 15-year-old right scaphoid fracture with secondary scaphoid non-union advanced collapse of his right wrist. There was no evidence of avascular necrosis. The initial injury was from a fall onto his outstretched hand. We performed a right scaphoid open reduction, internal fixation and iliac crest bone graft. One year after the operation, the patient had good wrist function and grip strength. A CT scan showed union of the fracture. Studies have shown that if the time between initial fracture and treatment of non-union exceeds 5 years, the chances of healing of the non-union are markedly reduced. In our case, despite the long duration between timing of injury and surgery, there was union and good return of function.

### Protecting my injured child: a qualitative study of parents' experience of caring for a child with a displaced distal radius fracture [^113YuaVg]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Childhood fractures can have a significant impact on the daily lives of families affecting children's normal activities and parent's work. Wrist fractures are the most common childhood fracture. The more serious wrist fractures, that can look visibly bent, are often treated with surgery to realign the bones; but this may not be necessary as bent bones straighten in growing children. The children's radius acute fracture fixation trial (CRAFFT) is a multicentre randomised trial of surgery versus a cast without surgery for displaced wrist fractures. Little is known about how families experience these wrist fractures and how they manage treatment uncertainty. This study aimed to understand families' experience of this injury and what it is like to be asked to include their child in a clinical trial.

Methods

Nineteen families (13 mothers, 7 fathers, 2 children) from across the UK participated in telephone interviews. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.

Results

Our findings highlight parents' desire to be a good parent through the overarching theme "protecting my injured child". To protect their child after injury, parents endeavoured to make the right decisions about treatment and provide comfort to their child but they experienced ongoing worry about their child's recovery. Our findings show that parents felt responsible for the decision about their child's treatment and their child's recovery. They also reveal the extent to which parents worried about the look of their child's wrist and their need for reassurance that the wrist was healing.

Conclusion

Our findings show that protecting their child after injury can be challenging for parents who need support to make decisions about treatment and confidently facilitate their child's recovery. They also highlight the importance of providing information about treatments, acknowledging parents' concerns and their desire to do the right thing for their child, reassuring parents that their child's wrist will heal and ensuring parents understand what to expect as their child recovers.

### Comparison of 24-month outcomes after treatment for distal radius fracture: the WRIST randomized clinical trial [^113L9Z4N]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Barton et alreported an association between radial shortening and Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation score at a mean of 29 months after treatment with k-wire fixation among patients aged 55 years and older. Likewise, Brogren et alreported worse Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores among adult patients with malunion diagnosed 2 years after treatment with casting or pinning. Our results are more similar to previous investigations, that reported no association between fracture alignment and PROs in older patients. The WRIST trial provided evidence that, although more than 50% of casting participants experience malunion, casting provides long-term outcomes that are indistinguishable from those of participants treated with surgical procedures. Furthermore, casting patients experienced these outcomes with fractures of equal severity compared with surgical participants.

Although the 24-month EFP outcomes were no different than those for the other treatments, for Colles type fractures that are common in older adults with osteoporosis, EFP is not ideal. EFP is inadequate in restoring anatomic alignment and is cumbersome for older adults. Furthermore, pin site infection is a constant concern with the exposed pins. Finally, the WRIST investigators experienced difficulty enrolling eligible participants because they did not want to risk randomization into EFP. Avoiding randomization was cited by 46% of declining patients, and 4 enrolled participants who were randomized to EFP refused to have the procedure. However, EFP is still applicable for severely comminuted fractures or for those requiring temporary stabilization during infection.

Limitations

One limitation of this study is low participant retention, in particular for the casting group. Participants who did not complete follow-up assessments were also older, less active, current smokers, more likely to be Asian, and tended to be in worse health, and their exclusion may result in an overestimation of any improvements between 12 and 24 months. Despite adjusting for baseline characteristics that are associated with missing 24-month outcomes, the differential missingness associated with these measured and unmeasured baseline characteristics could have made our results appear more favorable for casting than may actually have been the case. Conversely, patients who did not return for 24-month assessments may have done so because they were satisfied with their recovery, thus underestimating 12- to 24-month improvements. Despite the limitation, similar profiles in mean MHQ summary scores over time across missing data patterns within each treatment groups suggest no evidence for biases.

### Comparison of 24-month outcomes after treatment for distal radius fracture: the WRIST randomized clinical trial [^113pmvJx]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

We had 2 secondary aims. First, we determined changes in patient-reported and functional outcomes between the 12- and 24-month assessments. For each of the outcome measures, means across groups at 12 and 24 months were compared using the aforementioned mixed model. Second, we evaluated whether outcomes differed between participants who experienced malunion vs those who did not. Malunion was defined on the basis of radiographic data at 24 months. For those without radiographic data at 24 months, we used the 12-month data because previous investigators have found that radiographic alignment does not change after 12 months. In WRIST, 92 participants had both 12- and 24-month radiographic data; malunion status did not change from 12 to 24 months in any of these 92 participants. We compared patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at 24 months between the 2 groups of those with malunion vs those without malunion using 2-sample t test. Significance was set at P < .05 for all analyses. We used Stata statistical software version 15.1 (StataCorp) for our analyses. Data analysis was performed from March 2019 to March 2021.

### Protecting my injured child: a qualitative study of parents' experience of caring for a child with a displaced distal radius fracture [^111GQ9ut]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Parents could be relieved their child was randomised to surgery even if it was not their initial preference. Surgery guaranteed their child's wrist was fixed and it was felt to be the right treatment for their child. They subsequently questioned the non-surgical treatment.

"Once I did know she was having the surgery I felt more relieved. I thought she needs the surgery and at least we're coming out at the end of the day with a straight arm. On reflection I don't think she would have coped that well if she'd have just been in the cast… she's been very conscious the whole time of how it looks and how it's going to look when the cast comes off". (Interview#7, Mother of a 10-year-old child)

Parents could regret their decision to take part in CRAFFT. One parent felt their child had not benefitted from surgery as their wrist was not straight. Another parent felt uninformed and under pressure when making the decision.

"I think if I did it again I'd want a cast rather than surgery and we've come to where we thought we'd be with the cast anyway, and we'd be better off not having the surgery in the first place. We still had a lump afterwards anyway". (Intervirew#10, Father of a 5-year-old child)

Theme 2: worrying about recovery

Parents worried about how their child's wrist was healing, some encouraged their child to use their wrist while others restricted activities to prevent further injury. Parents needed more information about recovery to help their child and reassurance from clinicians.

### Malunion of the distal radius [^111VdXvL]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Fractures of the distal radius are common injuries. Acceptable results typically can be obtained with appropriate surgical or nonsurgical management. However, a small percentage of these fractures can progress to symptomatic malunion, which traditionally has been treated with osteotomy of the distal radius. Proper understanding of anatomy, biomechanics, indications, and contraindications can help guide patient selection for surgery. In formulating a treatment plan, the surgeon also must consider such technical variables as the type of osteotomy, the use of bone graft or bone-graft substitute, and the means of fixation to stabilize the osteotomy. Simultaneous implementation of an ulnar-side procedure, an intra-articular osteotomy, and soft-tissue releases also may be necessary. Some cases may be more appropriate for wrist fusion or other salvage procedures.

The clinical practice guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on the treatment of distal radius fractures in adults. None of the 29 recommendations made by the work group was graded as strong; most are graded as inconclusive or consensus; seven are graded as weak. The remaining five moderate-strength recommendations include surgical fixation, rather than cast fixation, for fractures with postreduction radial shortening > 3 mm, dorsal tilt > 10 degrees, or intra-articular displacement or step-off > 2 mm; use of rigid immobilization rather than removable splints for nonsurgical treatment; making a postreduction true lateral radiograph of the carpus to assess dorsal radial ulnar joint alignment; beginning early wrist motion following stable fixation; and recommending adjuvant treatment with vitamin C to prevent disproportionate pain.

### Omeprazole, sodium bicarbonate [^115Df7L1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.5 Bone Fracture

Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer).

Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.

Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to the established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.6 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including omeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE.

The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.

Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate capsules, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons / American society for surgery of the hand clinical practice guideline summary management of distal radius fractures [^112p3NRV]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Distal radius fractures — epidemiology, burden, risk factors, impact, and decision-making: Distal radius fractures account for almost 20% of fractures seen by physicians and is the second most common fracture experienced by older adults, and in 2005 alone the treatment for distal radius fractures in the elderly was estimated at $500 million with this burden expected to increase by 20% by 2025; they are one of the most common fractures seen by orthopaedic surgeons with an incidence of 195.2/100,000 persons per year. Distal radius fractures occur as a result of both high energy and low energy trauma with a bimodal distribution where high-energy fractures occur in younger persons (predominately male) and high and low-energy fractures occur in older persons (predominately female), and age (e.g. older women with osteoporosis) and sex (e.g. young males) are known risk factors for distal radius fracture in adults. Acute distal radius fracture results in pain, limitations in function, stress, and the potential inability to work, and the time to return to normal function after appropriate treatment can be prolonged and, in some cases, never return to normal. The aim of treatment is pain relief and return of function while weighing the risks and benefits of nonoperative and operative treatment, and therefore an open shared decision-making process should be undertaken that includes available treatments and their respective risks and benefits in the setting of the values and preferences of the individual patient; adoption of technology and novel treatments requires evidentiary support of efficacy and effectiveness while acknowledging cost and value.

### Fracture non-union: can biomarkers predict outcome? [^112Rhk8c]. Injury (2013). Low credibility.

Delayed bone healing and non-union occurs in approximately 10–15% of long bone fractures. Both pathologies may result in prolonged period of pain, disability and repetitive operative interventions. Despite intense investigations and progress done in understanding the pathophysiologic processes governing bone healing, the diagnostic tools have not been altered. The clinical findings and radiographic features remain the two important landmarks of diagnosing non-union and even when the diagnosis is established there is debate on the ideal timing and mode of intervention. Emerging evidence suggest that there are certain molecules and genes that can serve as predictors of potentially unsuccessful fracture union. This article summarises the current evidence on the available 'bio-markers'to predict fracture non-union.

### An analysis of the impact of timing and technique on outcomes after surgery for distal radius fractures: the wrist and radius injury surgical trial collaborative study [^115webc6]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical treatment of closed distal radius fractures varies based on treatment, surgeon schedule, and patient preferences. The authors examined how timing and technique impact surgeon-perceived procedural difficulty and quality of reduction, outcomes, and complications.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of participants in the randomized, multicenter Wrist and Radius Injury Surgical Trial with isolated unstable distal radius fractures. Participants were randomized to treatment with a volar locking plate system, closed reduction and percutaneous pinning, or external fixation. The authors analyzed surgeon-perceived procedural difficulty and reduction quality based on time to operation.

Results

Of 184 participants, 88 underwent surgery less than 7 days after fracture (mean, 4.6 days) and 96 underwent surgery at more than 7 days after fracture (mean, 12.3 days). Surgery performed at more than 7 days was rated more difficult versus surgery at less than 7 days [4.6 versus 3.8 of 10 (1 = easiest); p = 0.05]. When the volar locking plate technique was performed, there was no difference in surgeon-perceived difficulty or reduction quality between the groups; however, surgeons performing closed reduction and percutaneous pinning more than 7 days after injury reported greater procedure difficulty (4.1 versus 2.9; p = 0.05) and poorer reduction quality compared to less than 7 days (7.2 versus 8.1; p = 0.03). Participants who underwent surgery at less than 7 days scored 8 and 7 points greater on the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire Satisfaction (p = 0.05) and Activities of Daily Living (p = 0.03) domains, respectively.

Conclusions

Surgery performed less than 7 days after fracture leads to better surgeon-perceived reduction quality and less procedural difficulty. If surgery cannot be performed before 7 days, the authors recommend patients undergo treatment with the volar locking plate system, given the comparable level of surgeon-perceived procedural difficulty and reduction quality when surgery was performed less than 7 days after injury.

### Protecting my injured child: a qualitative study of parents' experience of caring for a child with a displaced distal radius fracture [^116modNT]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Parents felt CRAFFT was introduced before they knew enough about their child's injury. They wanted more information including statistics and pictures of children whose wrists have healed in a cast.

"Almost the first thing that was mentioned was the CRAFFT study and she (my wife) felt that got in the way of clinical advice. I'm not saying the problem wasn't described at all and the treatments weren't set out but the CRAFFT study and whether or not we wanted to take part in it came really early on in the conversation". (Interview#14, Father of a 10-year-old child)

Parents were reassured about taking part when clinicians explained the long-term outcomes were similar. However, they tended to have a treatment preference. Preferences evolved while parents considered the risks and benefits or were based on "gut feelings" about which treatment was best.

"I felt very pressured to make a decision within a certain amount of time and I didn't have all the information, I just went with my gut that's all". (Interview#17, Mother of a 4-year-old child)

Parents who preferred casting worried about the trauma of an operation, anaesthetic, infection, and staying in hospital. Several families participated in CRAFFT for a chance to avoid surgery.

"It kind of made sense to me that a child's bone would be able to heal itself and that the surgery sounded more of an aggressive fix to the problem really and I was a bit nervous about my child going for an operation anyway". (Interview#18, Mother of a 6-year-old child)

Those preferring surgery trusted the standard treatment perceiving surgery to guarantee their child's wrist would heal and would 'be straight' (Interview#10, Father of a 5-year-old child). Parents needed reassurance that if their child was treated with the cast their wrist would not look broken forever, there were alternatives should the wrist not straighten, and their child would not experience more pain or a slower return to sport.

"The doctor was quite reassuring and saying that if it didn't work then there were other things that they could do and that they could still fix it. Her arm wouldn't be bent forever". (Interview#13, Mother of an 8-year-old child)

### Nonunion of distal radius fractures [^114F14Ec]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Nonunion of a distal radius fracture is extremely uncommon. Healing problems in the distal radius seem to be related to unstable situations, such as concomitant fracture of the distal radius and ulna, and to an inadequate period of immobilization. Nonunion should be suspected if there is continuing pain after remobilization of the wrist in combination with a progressing deformity. The diagnosis may be confirmed by showing movement at the fracture site on lateral radiographs of the wrist in flexion and extension. Because of the rarity of distal radius fracture nonunion, it is not surprising that there is no consensus on the optimum mode of operative treatment. Based on our experience with reconstruction surgery in 23 patients, we think that most nonunions of the distal radius are amenable to attempts to re-align and heal the fracture even when the distal fragment is small. Therefore, surgeons should try to preserve even a small amount of wrist motion and reserve wrist fusion as a final resort.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^115L8KkH]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Distal radius fracture — initial management with casting specifies that initial treatment of a DRF depends on the overall bony alignment; if alignment is deemed acceptable, immobilization is indicated and typically achieved with a short arm cast for 4 to 6 weeks, whereas if alignment is not acceptable, a closed reduction will be performed before casting; if reduction can be maintained with casting alone, 6 weeks of immobilization is typically sufficient to achieve bony union; when treating fractures with casting only there can be a risk of redisplacement, and based on subsequent radiographs, a decision may be made to abandon cast treatment and shift to operative intervention.

### Wrist fractures and their impact in daily living functionality on elderly people: a prospective cohort study [^112wF7XB]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Patients sustaining wrist fractures are mostly women, of advanced age but independent in BADL and IADL prior to the fracture. This profile of patients is markedly different from other falling patients. For example, those with hip fractures caused by falls show a higher degree of dependence prior to the fracture. Also, patients of the same age and sex who have not suffered fractures caused by falls, have a lower prevalence of comorbidity and polypharmacy.

The results show that most elderly patients that sustained a wrist fracture after a traumatic fall completely recovered their functionality, based on their BADL and IADL performance reported six months after the traumatic event. Nevertheless, wrist fractures have a notable impact on the overall functional capacity of a third (33%) of patients. Considering BADL and IADL separately the impact is still remarkable with a 24 and 23% of patients presenting losses respectively. And this impact is still evident six months after the accidental fall that caused the fracture. The magnitude of the impact of wrist fracture has been measured in terms of functional and HRQoL decline and persistence of pain. The occurrence of this traumatic event transforms the daily lives of these patients, shifting them from autonomy towards disability and dependence. Indeed, it has been hypothesized that wrist fractures may be a trigger for progressive functional decline.

According to our findings, significant baseline differences may be found among fractured patients when their functional decline (basic or instrumental) is assessed six months after the fracture. Functional recovery (improvement or maintenance of previous BADL or IADL performance, versus deterioration, as defined in the methods section) is associated with a series of factors related to the patient, both in the health status sphere (comorbidity, polypharmacy, severe chronic conditions and low HRQoL) and the social sphere (lower educational level and social support), and also to the type of treatment (surgery and lack of referral for rehabilitation). Additionally, patients presenting decline in BADL, but not in IADL had a history of repeated falls. These results are consistent with previously published articles where functional outcome after a wrist fracture has shown to be associated with age, educational level and treatment procedure.

### Topology-optimized splints vs casts for distal radius fractures: a randomized clinical trial [^115DyokB]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is a topology-optimized splint more effective than traditional cast therapy in reducing wrist pain and enhancing wrist function for patients with distal radius fractures, including those who did and did not undergo closed manual reduction?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial involving 110 participants with distal radius fractures, the intervention group received topology-optimized splint immobilization and the control group received cast immobilization after closed manual reduction for 6 weeks. The topology-optimized splint group exhibited better wrist functional outcomes than the traditional cast group for the treatment of distal radius fractures, with no clinically significant difference at 12 weeks of follow-up.

Meaning

The results suggest that the topology-optimized splint provides early relief from pain and improved function for patients, offering effective treatment while mitigating the risks associated with surgery.

Clinical applicability — interpreting the strength of a recommendation links strength categories to patient counseling (time), decision aids, and the anticipated impact of future research as follows: For "Strong", patient counseling is "Least", decision aids are "Least Important, unless the evidence supports no difference between two alternative interventions", and impact is "Not likely to change"; "Moderate" pairs with "Less", "Less Important", and "Less likely to change"; "Limited" pairs with "More", "Important", and "Change possible/anticipated"; and "Consensus" pairs with "Most", "Most Important", and "Impact unknown".

### A unified approach to outcomes assessment for distal radius fractures [^116sqmfU]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures are one of the most common upper extremity injuries. Currently, outcome assessment after treatment of these injuries varies widely with respect to the measures that are used, timing of assessment, and the end points that are considered. A more consistent approach to outcomes assessment would provide a standard by which to assess treatment options and best practices. In this summary, we review the consensus regarding outcomes assessment after distal radius fractures and propose a systematic approach that integrates performance, patient-reported outcomes, pain, complications, and radiographs.

Strengthening initiation timing after distal radius fracture repair with volar plating — an RCT found that accelerated wrist strengthening at 2 weeks improved early outcomes versus delaying until 6 weeks. The accelerated group began at 2 weeks (N = 36; 73% female; mean age, 49.8 years) compared with a standard protocol delaying to 6 weeks (N = 45; 73% female; mean age, 55.3 years); both groups initiated early finger exercises 3 to 5 days following surgery, performed hand therapy up to 12 weeks, and used a thermoplastic orthosis until strengthening began. Function (DASH) showed significant differences between 2 and 12 weeks (MD range, 3% and 10%; P < .05) that were clinically meaningful (MCID, 10%) at 4 and 6 weeks, but DASH scores were comparable at 6 months (MD, 2%; p = 0.19). The accelerated group had better AROM for flexion (MD range, 5°-8°) between 3 and 12 weeks and extension (MD range, 5°-6°) between 3 and 8 weeks, and greater strength at 6 (MD, 12 lb; p = 0.02) and 12 weeks (MD, 12 lb; p = 0.02); no adverse effects to fracture alignment were reported and all fractures were healed by 3 months.

Supracondylar humerus fractures — patients with displaced supracondylar humerus fractures (Gartland Type II or III and displaced flexion type fractures) without neurologic or vascular compromise should be considered for closed or open reduction followed by pin fixation in the operating room; for these fractures, closed reduction is typically attempted first, and when closed reduction is unsuccessful, open reduction should be performed; nonoperative management of these types of displaced supracondylar humerus fractures is not recommended; and treatment within 12 to 18 hours of the injury for Gartland Type III fractures is recommended. For perfusion concerns, all patients with supracondylar humerus fractures with evidence of decreased perfusion to the hand should undergo an immediate emergent closed reduction of the fracture; when signs of compromised perfusion persist after closed reduction and pinning in the operating room, urgent operative exploration of the vessel in the antecubital fossa is recommended; and when pulses in the wrist remain absent following reduction but the hand is well perfused, the decision to explore the antecubital fossa should be made on a case-by-case basis. For nerve injuries after a supracondylar fracture, there is not strong enough evidence to support specific recommendations; while evidence is limited, strong consideration should be given to rapidly taking these patients to the operating room; recommendations regarding the indications/timing for electro diagnostic studies and nerve exploration cannot be made; and the diagnostic and management of these nerve injuries should be handled on an individual basis.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^115hVgG5]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Distal radius fracture rehabilitation — multimodal and accelerated approaches: A multimodal rehabilitation approach (modalities for pain and edema control; AROM exercises at the hand, wrist, and other proximal joints; joint mobilization; strengthening and proprioceptive exercises; functional retraining; advice for self-care and daily activity; and iHEP instructions) may offer the strongest merit toward optimal recovery following DRF, and regardless of fracture-treatment type, an accelerated rehabilitation approach with wrist AROM initiation within the first 2–3 weeks after surgery may lead to better outcomes; for the more stable fracture types, the initiation of submaximal hand grip strengthening exercises could be safely implemented around 2 to 3 weeks postoperatively or even during cast immobilization.

### Comparison of 24-month outcomes after treatment for distal radius fracture… [^113BXikd]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Pain scores also did not differ across groups at 24 months. MHQ summary scores changed from 82 to 85 between 12 and 24 months across groups. The hand and wrist strength and motion of the participants reached nearly 100% of the contralateral uninjured hand and wrist by 24 months. Overall from 12 to 24 months, the estimated grip strength improvement was 8%, pinch strength improvement was 9. %, and wrist flexion improvement was 7%.

Earlier analyses of WRIST data have shown similar results; early in the follow-up period, participants treated with VLPS reported better ability to perform activities of daily living and satisfaction and recovered more strength and wrist motion, but by 6 months any differences had disappeared and all participants showed satisfactory outcomes. 17 Similar results have been demonstrated. by other investigators. 8, 27, 28 We found all hand outcomes, including the MHQ summary measure, to have generally improved from 12 to 24 months across treatment groups; however, only function and pain improved significantly between 12- and 24-month assessments, and the magnitude of the improvement was not clinically meaningful. In addition, we did not find improvements seen in PROs to differ by treatment groups. Our results are similar to studies29–32 of younger adults, in which no change in PROs including pain was observed after 12 months.

WRIST participants also did not show significant improvement between 12 and 24 months in most PROs, but exhibited improvements in hand function and pain. Both flexion and grip strength improved, although neither reached the level of the contralateral, uninjured wrist or hand. This corroborates with previous studies that reported slower recovery after DRF for older patients. 33, 34.

are in the correct position, then they are usually treated by applying a plaster or fibreglass cast. This works by holding the broken sections of bone together so that they heal in the right position. The cast usually stays in place for at least 6 weeks, to give the bones a. chance to heal. Once the cast is removed, many doctors recommend physiotherapy, to help restore strength in the arm muscles and to restore full movement. Physiotherapy is not always available and can be very expensive however, and many health professionals do not feel that it is a necessary part of recovery for those with a broken wrist. It can be argued that many patients. could benefit equally well from managing their rehabilitation themselves, such as through self- directed exercises at home. The aim of this study is to compare the long-term effects of having physiotherapy to self-directed exercises on long-term recovery following a distal radius fracture. Who can participate.
