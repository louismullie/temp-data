## Question

at what egfr is losartan contraindicated

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking at what eGFR losartan is contraindicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal, labeled contraindications for losartan. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about use in advanced CKD and whether they recommend stopping at low eGFR. Next, I will examine the evidence base, including randomized trials and meta-analyses, to see if there is a kidney-function threshold where harm outweighs benefit. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with monitoring advice and exceptions where losartan should be reduced or stopped despite eGFR.

> Let me first confirm the labeled contraindications, because I need to ensure I'm not missing a formal eGFR-based prohibition. The FDA labeling lists hypersensitivity to any component and coadministration with aliskiren in patients with diabetes as the only absolute contraindications; there is no eGFR threshold listed as a contraindication, though monitoring for renal function and hyperkalemia is advised in renal impairment [^bdbfc64a] [^874acc47] [^214ef890].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing language in renal impairment, because sometimes "start low" is misread as "contraindicated". The FDA materials suggest starting at 25 mg in patients with eGFR 10–20 or < 10 mL/min/1.73 m², and the same 25 mg starting dose applies to intermittent hemodialysis; this is a dose-modification approach, not a contraindication, and it underscores that use is acceptable with close monitoring rather than prohibited [^26fcb196] [^20a59844] [^a756ca71].

> Next, I should review guideline positions, because they carry more weight than labeling for clinical practice. KDIGO 2024 explicitly recommends continuing ACEi or ARB therapy in people with CKD even when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and it advises considering dose reduction or discontinuation only for specific adverse scenarios such as symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite therapy, or to reduce uremic symptoms when treating kidney failure, typically when eGFR is less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m² [^718fbb8b] [^fd5c3ae5] [^d2ae4f43].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the strength of evidence in advanced CKD. The STOP-ACEi randomized trial in patients with mean eGFR around 13 mL/min/1.73 m² showed that a policy of discontinuing RAS blockade did not improve kidney or cardiovascular outcomes, supporting continuation of ARBs like losartan even at very low eGFR when clinically tolerated [^718fbb8b]. A 2024 meta-analysis of 18 RCTs in participants with baseline eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² found that initiating ACEi/ARB reduced kidney failure requiring replacement therapy by about 40% without a mortality benefit, again arguing against a categorical eGFR threshold for avoidance [^b4a59aac].

> I need to ensure I capture the monitoring thresholds that trigger action, because clinicians often conflate "stop if eGFR drops" with "contraindicated". KDIGO advises checking serum creatinine and potassium 2–4 weeks after starting or up-titrating RASi, and to investigate if eGFR declines by more than 30% on subsequent testing; transient dips of 10–30% are expected and should not prompt automatic discontinuation, whereas persistent larger declines warrant evaluation for other causes before changing therapy [^fe58085c] [^caafd5df]. ACC/AHA guidance similarly treats a greater than 30% eGFR decline as a signal to reassess rather than a reason to stop by default, reinforcing continuation unless there is a safety issue or an alternate explanation for the decline [^b931bdf0].

> But wait, what if the patient is on dialysis or has extremely low eGFR; does that change the calculus? Even in dialysis, the FDA materials describe losartan use with a 25 mg starting dose and careful monitoring, again reflecting acceptable use rather than contraindication; guidelines still anchor decisions in symptomatic hypotension, refractory hyperkalemia, or uremic symptom burden rather than a numeric eGFR cutoff alone [^a756ca71] [^fd5c3ae5].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating anything. Losartan is not absolutely contraindicated at any specific eGFR; it can be used down to very low kidney function, including dialysis, with dose caution and vigilant lab monitoring. The practical thresholds for reconsidering therapy are eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m² for potential dose reduction or discontinuation due to uremic symptoms, and a greater than 30% decline in eGFR shortly after initiation or up-titration that persists on repeat testing, which should prompt evaluation for other causes before stopping the ARB [^fd5c3ae5] [^fe58085c] [^b931bdf0].

> Final answer: Losartan is not contraindicated at any eGFR; it may be continued even when eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and in many cases below 15 mL/min/1.73 m², provided there is no symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite management, or a persistent eGFR decline greater than 30% that remains unexplained after appropriate evaluation. In advanced CKD, start low, titrate cautiously, and monitor renal function and potassium closely [^718fbb8b] [^fd5c3ae5] [^fe58085c] [^b4a59aac].

Losartan is **not absolutely contraindicated at any specific eGFR** [^718fbb8b]. It can be used in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², including those on dialysis, with close monitoring for hyperkalemia and renal function changes [^a756ca71] [^d2ae4f43]. The main reasons to reduce or stop losartan are **symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite treatment, or a persistent eGFR decline > 30%** from baseline [^fd5c3ae5] [^fe58085c]. In advanced CKD (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²), use the lowest effective dose and monitor labs frequently [^fd5c3ae5].

## Pharmacokinetics of losartan in renal impairment

Losartan is metabolized to its active metabolite, E3174, which is renally cleared; therefore, **renal impairment increases exposure** to both losartan and E3174 [^214ef890]. Despite this, the FDA labeling states that no dose adjustment is generally required solely for renal impairment, except in patients who are volume depleted or at risk of hypotension [^214ef890].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting losartan use in reduced eGFR

Several studies and guidelines support the use of losartan in patients with reduced eGFR:

- **KDIGO 2024 guidelines**: Recommend continuing ACE inhibitors or ARBs, including losartan, even when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², unless there is symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia, or a persistent decline in eGFR > 30% from baseline [^718fbb8b] [^fd5c3ae5].

- **STOP-ACEi trial**: Found no kidney or cardiovascular benefit to discontinuing RAS blockade in patients with advanced CKD (mean eGFR ~13 mL/min/1.73 m²), supporting continuation of therapy in this population [^718fbb8b].

- **Meta-analysis**: Initiating ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) significantly reduced the risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation, without increasing mortality [^b4a59aac].

---

## Risks associated with losartan use in reduced eGFR

While losartan can be beneficial in patients with reduced eGFR, there are **important risks** to consider:

- **Hyperkalemia**: Increased risk, especially in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or those on potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or NSAIDs [^4a725aeb].

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Transient declines in eGFR (up to 30%) are common after initiation but are usually reversible and not harmful; persistent declines > 30% warrant evaluation and may necessitate dose adjustment or discontinuation [^fe58085c] [^b931bdf0].

- **Hypotension**: Symptomatic hypotension can occur, particularly in patients who are volume depleted or on multiple antihypertensives [^4a725aeb].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines provide the following **recommendations** for losartan use in patients with reduced eGFR:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| KDIGO 2024 | - Continue ACE inhibitors or ARBs, including losartan, even when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² <br/> - Reduce dose or discontinue only if symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia, or persistent eGFR decline > 30% occurs [^718fbb8b] [^fd5c3ae5] |
| ACC/AHA 2024 | - ACE inhibitors or ARBs are recommended for patients with hypertension and CKD with albuminuria ≥ 30 mg/g <br/> - Monitor renal function and potassium within 2–4 weeks of initiation or dose escalation [^4f124da3] [^b931bdf0] |
| VA/DoD 2025 | - ARBs, including losartan, are recommended for CKD patients with albuminuria <br/> - Monitor renal function and potassium regularly [^ca90969c] |

---

## Practical clinical approach

Given the evidence and guidelines, the following **practical approach** is recommended:

- **Initiation**: Start losartan at a low dose (e.g. 25 mg daily) in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², especially if they are elderly, volume depleted, or on multiple antihypertensives [^26fcb196].

- **Monitoring**: Check serum creatinine and potassium within 2–4 weeks of initiation or dose escalation, then monitor periodically based on stability [^fe58085c].

- **Dose adjustment**: If eGFR declines by > 30% from baseline or hyperkalemia occurs, evaluate for other causes (e.g. NSAID use, volume depletion, renal artery stenosis) and consider dose reduction or temporary discontinuation [^fe58085c].

- **Discontinuation**: Stop losartan if symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite treatment, or persistent eGFR decline > 30% occurs [^fd5c3ae5].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Losartan is not absolutely contraindicated at any specific eGFR** [^718fbb8b].

- **It can be used in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²**, including those on dialysis, with close monitoring [^a756ca71].

- **The main reasons to reduce or stop losartan are symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite treatment, or a persistent eGFR decline > 30% from baseline** [^fd5c3ae5].

- **In advanced CKD (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²), use the lowest effective dose and monitor labs frequently** [^fd5c3ae5].

### A multi-center phase II randomized clinical trial of losartan on symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 [^44427165]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

Trial design: This was a multicenter prospective double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial for the treatment of symptomatic outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 conducted across 3 hospital systems in Minnesota, United States (MHealth Fairview, Hennepin Healthcare, and Mayo Clinic) between April and November 2020 adhering to CONSORT guidelines. Each of these healthcare systems serves between one and over a dozen hospitals, as well as dozens of clinic sites. All patients seeking testing at any of these locations had their results routed to central laboratories at each system. Specific eligibility for clinical testing varied over the course of the pandemic, with early restrictions based on limited availability following Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance, with later more widespread availability that varied by site.

Ethical approval and patient consent: The protocol was approved by a central institutional review board (Advarra Pro00042760) and underwent local context review. The study was conducted following good clinical practice guidelines under the oversight of an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB). Participants provided written electronic informed consent prior to enrollment. The trial was conducted under the authority of the Food and Drug Administration (IND 148365), was registered on clinicaltrials.gov prior to study initialization (NCT04311177), and full protocol available from the corresponding author on request.

Participants: Consecutive patients presenting to a participating institution with a positive clinical SARS-CoV-2 result were screened for eligibility. Participants were eligible if they tested positive, were at least 18 years old, and were symptomatic within 24 h of informed consent. Eligibility initially required fever or upper respiratory symptoms, but this was expanded in July 2020 to include any CDC recognized symptoms. Patients were excluded if they had > 7 days of symptoms, were already taking an ACE-inhibitor or ARB, had prior adverse reactions to those medications, were pregnant or breastfeeding, were unwilling to use contraception or abstain from sex, had a history of dialysis, stage IV chronic kidney disease, or an estimated eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2, a potassium > 5.0 mmol/L, reported severe dehydration or reduced urine output over the prior 72 h, a history of cirrhosis, hepatitis B or C, or other severe liver disease expected to impair study drug metabolism, were prescribed aliskiren, had a measured systolic blood pressure of < 110 mmHg at randomization, were enrolled in another blinded randomized clinical trial for COVID-19, or were unable to provide informed consent.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Kidney dysfunction/injury — monitoring and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) effects are outlined with explicit thresholds. Estimated GFR using serum creatinine should be measured 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of antihypertensive medications. RAASi may cause an expected short-term dip in eGFR of up to 30% that is associated with preservation of kidney function and should not lead to discontinuation unless the decline in eGFR is persistently > 30%. A referral to a nephrologist is appropriate to evaluate other causes, and new dysfunction after adding or increasing diuretics should prompt evaluation of volume status; it may be appropriate to initially hold or reduce the diuretic dose and then advance more slowly.

Renin-angiotensin-system inhibitor (RASi) algorithm threshold and discontinuation evidence — KDIGO notes a trigger for further evaluation and reports trial data on stopping therapy. "The algorithm has been updated to suggest a ≥ 30% decrease in eGFR (rather than increase in creatinine) should be a trigger to investigate for an underlying other condition". Supporting evidence includes: "In a recent STOP-ACEi trial of 411 participants with mean eGFR of 13 ml/min per 1.73 m2, a policy of discontinuing RASi in CKD G4–G5 did not result in any kidney or cardiovascular benefits". The text also states, "Lastly, it should be noted that restricting salt intake may help ensure maximal effects of RASi".

### An acute fall in estimated glomerular filtration rate during treatment with losartan predicts a slower decrease in long-term renal function [^6a7297bd]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Intervention in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) is associated with slowing the progressive loss of renal function. During initiation of therapy, however, there may be an acute fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We tested whether this initial fall in GFR reflects a renal hemodynamic effect and whether this might result in a slower decline in long-term renal function. We performed a post hoc analysis of the Reduction of Endpoints in Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) trial. Patients assigned to losartan had a significantly greater acute fall in estimated (eGFR) during the first 3 months compared to patients assigned to placebo, but a significantly slower long-term mean decline of eGFR thereafter. A large interindividual difference, however, was noticed in the acute eGFR change. When patients were divided into tertiles of initial fall in eGFR, the long-term eGFR slope calculated from baseline was significantly higher in patients with an initial fall compared to those with an initial rise. When eGFR decline was calculated from 3 months to the final visit, excluding the initial effect, patients with a large initial fall in eGFR had a significant lower long-term eGFR slope compared to those with a moderate fall or rise. This relationship was independent of other risk markers or change in risk markers for progression of renal disease such as blood pressure and albuminuria. Thus, the greater the acute fall in eGFR, during losartan treatment, the slower the rate of long-term eGFR decline. Hence, interpretation of trial results relying on slope-based GFR outcomes should separate the initial drug-induced GFR change from the subsequent long-term effect on GFR.

Table 4 — Sacubitril/valsartan contraindications and cautions list absolute exclusions and dose-adjusted cautions. Contraindications include "Within 36 h of ACE inhibitor use", "Any history of angioedema", "Pregnancy", "Lactation (no data)", "Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C)", "Concomitant aliskiren use in patients with diabetes", and "Known hypersensitivity to either ARBs or ARNIs". Cautions specify renal and hepatic dosing: "Mild-to-moderate (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m2): no starting dose adjustment required"; "Severe (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2): reduce starting dose to 24 mg/26 mg twice daily; double the dose every 2–4 weeks to target maintenance dose of 97 mg/103 mg twice daily, as tolerated". For hepatic impairment, "Mild (Child-Pugh class A): No starting dose adjustment required"; "Moderate (Child-Pugh class B): Reduce starting dose to 24/26 mg twice daily; double the dose every 2–4 weeks to target maintenance dose of 97/103 mg twice daily". Additional cautions include "Renal artery stenosis", "Systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg", and "Volume depletion".

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) provide dosing ranges with safety notes. Examples include: Losartan initial 25mg once daily with dosing range 25mg-100mg daily; Olmesartan initial 20mg daily with dosing range 20mg-40mg daily; Telmisartan initial 20mg daily with dosing range 20mg-80mg daily; Valsartan initial 40mg-80mg divided into 1 or 2 doses daily with dosing range 80mg-320mg divided into 1 or 2 doses daily. Class considerations list: "Teratogenic"; "Contraindications: Concurrent use with aliskiren"; "History of angioedema"; "ARBs do not require washout period with neprilysin inhibitor"; "May cause: Angioedema (less likely than ACEI), hyperkalemia, hypotension, increase in serum creatinine"; and "Monitor: Blood pressure, potassium, kidney function".

### A multi-center phase II randomized clinical trial of losartan on symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 [^c55a85ac]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The pharmacist logged into the secure pharmacy website using a unique user name and strong password, from which they printed out a report of the patient's treatment assignment and dosage schedule. A pharmacist had access only to treatment assignments for patients randomized at their site. This pharmacist then prepared study drug and directly shipped to the patient within 24 h. Losartan tablets were over-encapsulated in microcrystalline methylcellulose in opaque capsules, while placebo tablets were matched capsules containing only methylcellulose. Apart from statisticians preparing the randomization schema (HV), all other study members including participants, research personnel, and clinical teams were blinded.

Intervention: The intervention was losartan 25 mg versus equally appearing placebo. Losartan was chosen given lower rates of associated cough compared to ACE inhibitors, and a well-established safety profile. Participants self-administered study drug orally twice daily for 10 days for participants with eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and once daily for those with eGFR 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The threshold for angiotensin receptor blockade is 20 mg daily, with twice daily dosing more effective than once daily due to a 6–9 h half-life of the active metabolite. This dose was chosen in lieu of a 50 mg twice daily (maximum) dose after the FDA raised safety concerns regarding the higher dose regimen. This dose is expected to provide 37% inhibition of the angiotensin receptor. A lower dose (once daily) was chosen in those with renal dysfunction due to an altered risk/benefit ratio due to delayed clearance. Ten days was chosen based on the assumption that patients would take 2–7 days from symptom onset until diagnosis, and that early data suggested most hospitalizations occurred within 15 days of symptom onset. This duration maximized doses administered in this time frame, while mitigating risk of longer unnecessary treatment. Study drug was discontinued if the patient met the primary outcome of hospital admission or by a blinded investigator if serious drug-related adverse effects were suspected.

HFrEF — kidney function changes during therapy and dose adjustment triggers: During initiation and titration of agents that affect kidney function, a decrease in eGFR of > 30% or development of hyperkalemia should alert clinicians that a dose reduction may be necessary; short-term, transient eGFR changes during intense diuretic therapy or initiation of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitor do not predict longer-term adverse outcomes nor necessitate dose reduction; in hypovolemia, the dose of diuretic agents should be reduced, and the ARNI dose may also need to be reduced in kidney insufficiency or hypotension; although trial experience is lacking for those with < 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, consensus has developed around continuing SGLT inhibitors even below this eGFR threshold.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^33d4853d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — supportive evidence and ACEi/ARB monitoring: SPRINT data demonstrated adults with CKD and hypertension can be effectively and safely treated to SBP < 130 mm Hg, and meta-analyses have shown benefit of treating SBP < 130 mm Hg versus higher SBP targets. An analysis of CKD patients from 4 trials found that an SBP target of < 130 mm Hg (versus < 140 mm Hg) decreased all-cause mortality; a meta-analysis of the CKD subsets from 18 trials reported that more-intensive SBP (mean SBP 132 mm Hg) versus less-intensive SBP (mean SBP 140 mm Hg) control resulted in 14% reduction in all-cause mortality. While < 120 mm Hg is more effective at preventing CVD events, meta-analyses of trial data support an SBP < 130 mm Hg to balance the benefits of intensive BP-lowering with the risks of adverse events. ACEi or ARB reduce intraglomerular pressure, which may cause a transient decrease, or dip, in eGFR up to 30%, and this short-term decline in eGFR is not associated with decreased long-term outcomes and should not prompt discontinuation of the ACEi or ARB. Electrolytes should be rechecked 2 to 4 weeks after initiating or intensifying ACEi or ARB dosage, monitoring for hyperkalemia or a decline in eGFR of > 30%, which may require reducing or holding the agent temporarily or additional evaluation. ACEi or ARB can be continued in people with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 as an RCT found that discontinuation was not associated with a significant difference in long-term decrease in eGFR, and the combined use of an ACEi and an ARB should be avoided because of increased harm.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^ca579b2b]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — hemodynamically active therapies and eGFR change: Practice Point 2.1.4 states that among people with chronic kidney disease who initiate hemodynamically active therapies, "GFR reductions of > 30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation". Acute eGFR decline after intensive blood pressure control shows "reductions of 10%–20% being typical within the first 3 months of treatment", and "acute rises in SCr (or declines in eGFR) of < 20%–30% are expected and do not warrant changes in therapeutic agents". Trials of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) suggest participants with " > 10% initial drop in eGFR" have similar outcomes "except in unusual cases when the acute "dip" in eGFR was > 30% from baseline". A "significant drop in eGFR (> 30%)" during initiation of antihypertensives, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, or SGLT2i "should prompt a review into other causes and warrants close monitoring", and providers "should avoid the urge to stop these kidney-protective agents" because early dips are "typically reversible and not an indication of drug toxicity".

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^4a725aeb]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) — usual dose ranges and key precautions are as follows: Azilsartan 40–80 mg daily (40 mg with diuretic); Candesartan 8–32 mg daily; Eprosartan 400–800 mg daily (daily or divided bid); Irbesartan 75–300 mg daily; Losartan 25–100 mg/day (daily or divided bid); Olmesartan 20–40 mg daily; Telmisartan 20–80 mg daily; Valsartan 80–320 mg daily. Avoid in women who are planning to become pregnant or who are pregnant; when pregnancy is contemplated or detected, discontinue as soon as possible. Avoid concomitant use of ACEI with an ARB or direct renin inhibitor due to increased risk of hypotension, syncope, increased K+, and changes in kidney function. In general, the lower doses should be considered in patients receiving diuretics. Monitor K+ and kidney function; use caution if combined with K+ sparing diuretic, or K+ supplement. Consider interruption or discontinuation in patients who develop clinically significant decline in kidney function after initiation of therapy, until further work-up, as indicated. Compelling indications include: CKD with albuminuria; HFrEF; recent MI.

Objectives

This study investigated the dose-related effect of losartan on changes in renal function using data from the HEAAL (Heart failure Endpoint evaluation of Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan) trial.

Background

Angiotensin receptor blockers adversely affect renal function in patients with heart failure (HF). The time course and dose dependency of this time course, as well as the clinical implications of these changes in renal function, are not well described.

Methods

Subjects in the HEAAL dataset (n = 3,843) were studied. Changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over time were compared between dose groups. The association between the timing of incident increases in serum creatinine (SCr) > 0.3 mg/dl and clinical outcomes was explored.

Results

Compared with 50 mg, 150 mg losartan led to a greater reduction in eGFR across time (mean difference:-3.76 ml/min/1.73 m(2); p < 0.0001). This difference was driven by early changes, and differences in eGFRafter 4 months were not significant (mean difference: 0.42 ml/min/1.73 m(2); p = 0.15). Although an increase in SCr > 0.3 mg/dl from baseline was associated with increased risk of death or hospitalization for HF (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.36; p < 0.0001), the relationship was not significant if the change occurred before 4 months (HR: 1.09; p = 0.20). Despite increased risk of worsening renal function, 150 mg losartan was associated with reduced risk of death or hospitalization for HF compared with 50 mg (HR: 0.85; p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Compared with 50 mg, 150 mg losartan is associated with an increased risk of acute rise in SCr, as well as with greater long-term reductions in eGFR. Despite these effects, high-dose losartan retains its net clinical benefit and is associated with reduced risk of death or hospitalization for HF.

Purpose Of Review

To present the available data on the risks and benefits for ACEi/ARB usage in patients with advanced CKD.

Recent Findings

It has been well established that ACEi/ARB use is beneficial in patients with mild-to-moderate CKD, especially in patients with proteinuria. The majority of available data includes patients with diabetes mellitus. However, data in individuals with advanced CKD are limited. Additionally, data available for this subset of patients is conflicting and the definition of advanced CKD varies across clinical trials.

Summary

On the basis of our literature review, evidence suggests continuing ACEi/ARB therapy in patients with advanced CKD (eGFR less than 15ml/min/1.73m) unless hyperkalemia ensues unresponsive to therapy, hypotension develops or have unusually rapid worsening of eGFR (not usual progressive decline). These patients should be monitored closely. There is not enough data to support starting ACEi/ARBs de novo in patients with advanced CKD (eGFR less than 15ml/min/1.73m). If RAS blockade is started de novo in this subgroup, we recommend close monitoring.

Practice Point 2.1.4 — hemodynamically active therapies and estimated GFR (eGFR) changes in CKD — states that GFR reductions of > 30% on subsequent testing exceed expected variability and warrant evaluation; early after intensive blood pressure (BP) control, reductions of 10%–20% within the first 3 months are typical, and acute rises in serum creatinine (SCr) or declines in eGFR of < 20%–30% are expected and do not warrant changes; post hoc SGLT2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) analyses found similar trajectories with > 10% initial drops except when the acute "dip" was > 30% from baseline; during initiation of anti-hypertensive agents, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), or SGLT2i, a significant drop in eGFR (> 30%) should prompt a review into other causes and warrants close monitoring, and healthcare providers should avoid the urge to stop these kidney-protective agents as earlier "dips" are typically reversible and not an indication of drug toxicity.

### Impact of baseline renal function on the efficacy and safety of aliskiren added to losartan in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy [^d24a821b]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this post hoc analysis of the results of the AVOID study, we demonstrate that the reduction in UACR from add-on aliskiren treatment was independent of baseline renal function, and, thus, aliskiren can be of added benefit to standard treatment (including the optimal dose of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan) in patients with stage 1–3 CKD. In addition, the proportion of aliskiren-treated patients achieving a 50% reduction in UACR was similar in all three stages, approximately twice the proportion of placebo-treated patients. There were no significant differences in systolic or diastolic blood pressure change from baseline in any eGFR subgroup, but overall the reduction in systolic blood pressure was associated with a reduction in eGFR in both aliskiren- and placebo-treated groups.

From a safety point of view, we found that hyperkalemia, based on a single measurement of serum potassium, was more common in aliskiren-treated patients with stage 3 CKD. This result represents a side effect to this therapy that must be considered, given the above-noted benefit. It is possible that more frequent serum potassium control and concomitant use of loop diuretics in these patients would ameliorate this. We were not able to investigate in detail the influence of other concomitant medications on the levels of potassium, but the use of potassium-sparing diuretics and ACE inhibitors was not allowed in the study. Severe hyperkalemia, defined as a single serum potassium result > 6.0 mmol/l, was also more common in stage 3 CKD; however, 9 of the 11 aliskiren-treated patients in stage 3 CKD with severe hyperkalemia were randomly assigned despite violating the exclusion limit of serum potassium > 5.1 mmol/l stated in the study protocol.

Despite the guideline recommendations advocating the use of ACEis/ARBs in patients with T2D and CKD, reported rates of the use of these agents remain low. Although specific data regarding the use of ACEis/ARBs in patients with T2D and CKD are lacking, rates of use in patients with CKD and hypertension are low (only 36% of patients received an ACEi/ARB between 2010 and 2014) and have decreased since 2006. There is evidence to suggest that patients with CKD who are comanaged by a PCP and a nephrologist have higher ACEi/ARB prescription rates and that patients with more severe renal impairment are more likely to receive an ACEi/ARB when they have received care from both a PCP and a nephrologist compared with a PCP alone. Notably, PCPs may have reservations about prescribing ACEis/ARBs given the potential risk for developing hyperkalemia. To mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines recommend starting ACEi/ARBs at a lower dose and titrating upwards in patients with an eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Importantly, eGFR and serum potassium should be monitored within a few weeks of a patient starting an ACEi/ARB. If hyperkalemia develops, consideration for a nephrology referral is appropriate. Additional strategies that can be considered include identification and restriction of dietary potassium, treatment of metabolic acidosis where required, initiation/up titration of thiazide or loop diuretic(s) to increase potassium excretion, and treatment with a potassium-binding exchange resin.

### G protein-coupled receptors: a century of research and discovery [^582df4ea]. Circulation Research (2024). Medium credibility.

AT 1 Rs can signal through a wide range of pathways. – Upon activation by its endogenous ligand, AngII, the AT 1 R signals through G⍺ q, but can also couple to other G proteins, such as G⍺ 12/13 and G⍺ i/o. In addition, the AT 1 R can signal via β-arrestins to multiple effectors, such as MAP kinases. Furthermore, the AT 1 R is also capable of promoting signaling through other transmembrane receptors, such as the EGFR through β-arrestin-dependent and -independent mechanisms. –

FDA-approved RAAS inhibitors include direct renin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), AT 1 R antagonists (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. ACEIs and ARBs are central to the treatment of hypertension, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and chronic kidney disease. One advantage of ARBs over ACEIs is the lower risk of side effects such as cough and angioedema, the latter of which can be life-threatening due to swelling and obstruction of the airway. In 1987, there was great optimism surrounding ACEIs for their use in congestive heart failure following the CONSENSUS trial.(Table 1). This study showed that adding enalapril to a conventional heart failure regimen that at the time was typically furosemide and digoxin, reduced mortality by 40% at 6 months and 27% compared to the end of the 12-month study. Following the positive studies and enthusiasm for ACEIs, there was interest that ARBs could block RAAS more effectively compared to ACEIs. In 1997 the ELITE trial, compared the ARB losartan, with the ACEI captopril. There was a 32% reduction in death and hospital admissions for heart failure treated with losartan compared with those treated with captopril. In addition, losartan was better tolerated compared to captopril, with fewer patients discontinuing therapy. More recently, the combination of the ARB valsartan with a neprilysin inhibitor (sacubitril) has demonstrated superiority to enalapril in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in the PARADIGM-HF trial.

### Impact of baseline renal function on the efficacy and safety of aliskiren added to losartan in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy [^7a794d58]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Proteinuric diabetic patients with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are at high risk of renal and cardiovascular disease progression and treatment-related adverse events. This post hoc analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of aliskiren added to the maximal recommended dose of losartan according to baseline estimated GFR (eGFR) (stage 1–3 chronic kidney disease [CKD]).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

In the Aliskiren in the Evaluation of Proteinuria in Diabetes (AVOID) study, 599 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy received 6 months of aliskiren (150 mg daily titrated to 300 mg daily after 3 months) or placebo added to 100 mg losartan and optimal antihypertensive therapy. Exclusion criteria included eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and serum potassium > 5.1 mmol/l.

RESULTS

Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups in all CKD stages. The antiproteinuric effects of aliskiren were consistent across CKD stages (19, 22, and 18% reduction). In the stage 3 CKD group, baseline serum creatinine levels were equal, but renal dysfunction, prespecified as a postrandomization serum creatinine elevation > 176.8 μmol/l (2.0 mg/dl) occurred more frequently in the placebo group (29.2 vs. 13.6%, P = 0.032). Serum potassium elevations > 5.5 mmol/l (based on a single measurement) were more frequent with aliskiren (22.5 vs. 13.6%) in stage 3 CKD. Adverse event rates were similar between treatments, irrespective of CKD stage.

CONCLUSIONS

Aliskiren added to losartan reduced albuminuria and renal dysfunction and was well tolerated, except for hyperkalemia (stage 3), independent of baseline CKD stage in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and nephropathy.

KDIGO 2021 — Administration and monitoring of RASi in CKD — It may be reasonable to treat people with high BP, CKD, and no albuminuria, with or without diabetes, with RASi (ACEi or ARB). RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated, and changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 2–4 weeks of initiation or dose increase. Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation or an increase in dose. Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB for symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are effective for management of refractory hypertension but may cause hyperkalemia or a reversible decline in kidney function, particularly among patients with low eGFR.

Follow-up assessments

Study follow-up visits are scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after randomization. At all visits, study staff systematically seek the information on all serious adverse events, any non-serious adverse events considered by participants to be related to study treatment; and on symptoms of hepatitis. Compliance with study treatment is assessed and participants unable to tolerate the maximum dose of study treatments are encouraged to continue on the lower dose of study drug (i.e. sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg or irbesartan 150 mg daily) for the remainder of the trial. If relevant, a reason for discontinuation or dose reduction is recorded. Participants prescribed contraindicated medications (ACEi, ARB or DRI) have their randomized treatment stopped. Weight and blood pressure are measured (three times after sitting for at least 5 minutes) at all visits. In both treatment groups, blood pressure is to be controlled according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines, with the initiation and choice of additional anti-hypertensive treatment being at the discretion of the responsible clinician. Within the 2 weeks before their 12-month visit participants have their second GFR measurement (using the same method as at baseline). Copies of results of both measurements of GFR are sent to the coordinating centre so the results entered by site staff can be verified by clinical study staff blind to the treatment allocation.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — blood pressure (BP) targets and renin–angiotensin system therapy: The prevalence of hypertension is 67% to 92% among people with CKD, and in SPRINT intensive BP treatment with mean achieved SBP 121 mm Hg versus standard treatment with mean achieved SBP 136 mm Hg reduced the risk of CVD, including among those with CKD. The recommendation in this guideline is for a treatment goal SBP < 130 mm Hg. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is recommended for initial treatment of hypertension in CKD when albuminuria is moderate or severe (≥ 30 mg/g) and may be considered for lower level albuminuria (< 30 mg/g) based on expert opinion; these recommendations refer to people with nondialysis-requiring CKD, and ACEI or ARB is also appropriate for less-severe CKD (stage 1 or 2) when moderate or severe albuminuria is present. Supporting data include an analysis of CKD patients from 4 trials finding an SBP target of < 130 mm Hg (versus < 140 mm Hg) decreased all-cause mortality and a meta-analysis of CKD subsets from 18 trials where more-intensive SBP (mean SBP 132 mm Hg) versus less-intensive SBP (mean SBP 140 mm Hg) control resulted in 14% reduction in all-cause mortality; while < 120 mm Hg is more effective at preventing CVD events, meta-analyses support SBP < 130 mm Hg to balance benefits and risks. With ACEI/ARB therapy, these agents reduce intraglomerular pressure and may cause a transient dip in eGFR up to 30%; this short-term decline is not associated with decreased long-term outcomes and should not prompt discontinuation of the ACEI or ARB. Electrolytes should be rechecked 2 to 4 weeks after initiating or intensifying ACEI or ARB dosage, monitoring for hyperkalemia or a decline in eGFR of > 30%, which may require reducing or holding the agent temporarily or additional evaluation; ACEI or ARB can be continued in people with eGFR < 30 mL/ min/1.73 m2, and the combined use of an ACEI and an ARB should be avoided because of increased harm.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The trial enrolled hypertensive patients, ranging in age from 18 to 85 years, with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy (early morning urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR]) > 300 mg/g or > 200 mg/g in patients receiving blockade of the RAAS). The criteria for exclusion were known nondiabetic kidney disease, UACR > 3,500 mg/g, eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, chronic urinary tract infection, serum potassium > 5.1 mmol/l at time of randomization, severe hypertension, or major cardiovascular disease within the last 6 months.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 15 countries and 150 centers worldwide, we evaluated the possible renoprotective effect of aliskiren in 599 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. The methods have been described in detail in the main publication. In brief, we screened 1,892 eligible patients at an enrollment visit. Subsequently 805 patients entered a 3-month open-label period during which all previous drugs that block the RAAS were discontinued, except for β-blockers, and treatment was initiated with the maximal recommended renoprotective dose of losartan (100 mg daily) plus additional antihypertensive therapy aiming for an optimal target blood pressure, i.e. < 130/80 mmHg. During the 3-month open-label treatment period, 206 patients were excluded, leaving 599 randomly assigned patients who were followed for a median of 6 months. Patients were randomly assigned to receive aliskiren at a dose of 150 mg once daily for 3 months, followed by aliskiren at 300 mg daily for another 3-month period or matching placebo once daily. The study protocol was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2002) and was approved by local and central review boards. All patients provided written informed consent.

The trial was conducted under the authority of the Food and Drug Administration and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov prior to initialization. This study is reported following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Participants

Consecutive patients presenting to a participating institution with a reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result positive for SARS-CoV-2 were assessed for eligibility. Participants were eligible if they had at least 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention–recognized symptom of COVID-19, a positive clinical RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 result, and a respiratory sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of 1 or higher. Exclusion criteria included active outpatient treatment with an ACEI, ARB, or aliskiren; prior adverse reaction to ACEIs or ARBs; pregnancy, breastfeeding, or lack of contraception; history of dialysis, stage IV chronic kidney disease, or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2; potassium level greater than 5.0 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1); history of severe liver disease; enrollment in another blinded clinical trial for COVID-19; lack of informed consent; inability to randomize within 48 hours of admission or positive test result; no decrease in 2 saturation from baseline; or respiratory SOFA score of less than 1 (defined as Pa 2 :Fi 2 < 400, using arterial oxygen saturation if Pa 2 data were unavailable). Race and ethnicity were self-identified by the patient at the time of hospital admission. Race and ethnicity were analyzed based on prior literature demonstrating differential outcomes associated with these factors.

Screening and Consent

Electronic health records (EHRs) were manually screened by trained research personnel. Owing to limitations in personal protective equipment, informed consent was typically conducted remotely via telephone or video teleconference, and documentation was maintained using a 21 CFR part 11–adherent electronic consent platform (REDCap).

### Summary of revisions for the 2009 clinical practice recommendations [^0873324b]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Prevention and Management of Diabetes Complications:

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) cut points for use of thiazide or loop diuretics have been revised.
Pharmacologic therapy for patients with diabetes and hypertension should be with a regimen that includes either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. If needed to achieve blood pressure targets, a thiazide diuretic should be added to those with an estimated GFR (see below) ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and a loop diuretic for those with an estimated GFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. (C)
Several dyslipidemia recommendations have been revised. If drug-treated patients do not reach the above targets on maximal tolerated statin therapy, a reduction in LDL cholesterol of ∼30–40% from baseline is an alternative therapeutic goal. (A) If targets are not reached on maximally tolerated doses of statins, combination therapy using statins and other lipid-lowering agents may be considered to achieve lipid targets but have not been evaluated in outcome studies for either CVD outcomes or safety. (E)
Several antiplatelet agent recommendations have been revised and/or the level of evidence has been changed. Use aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) as a primary prevention strategy in those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes at increased cardiovascular risk, including those who are > 40 years of age or who have additional risk factors (family history of CVD, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria). (C) For patients with CVD and documented ASA (acetylsalicylic acid, aspirin) allergy, clopidogrel (75 mg/day) should be used. (B) Combination therapy with aspirin (75–162 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) is reasonable for up to a year after an acute coronary syndrome. (B)
Coronary heart disease treatment recommendations have been revised and/or the level of evidence has been changed. In patients with known CVD, ACE inhibitor (C), aspirin (A), and statin therapy (A) (if not contraindicated) should be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. In patients > 40 years of age with another cardiovascular risk factor (hypertension, family history, dyslipidemia, microalbuminuria, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, or smoking), aspirin and statin therapy (if not contraindicated) should be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. (B) In patients with coronary heart failure (CHF), thiazolidinedione use is contraindicated. (C) Metformin may be used in patients with stable CHF if renal function is normal. It should be avoided in unstable or hospitalized patients with CHF. (C)
The recommendation in the "Retinopathy screening and treatment" section has been revised. Adults and children aged 10 years or older with type 1 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist within 5 years after the onset of diabetes. (B)
One recommendation in the "Neuropathy screening and treatment" section has been moved to the "Foot care" section, and one has been revised. Screening for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy should be instituted at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes. (E)
The "Foot care" section has been extensively revised, including the recommendations. For all patients with diabetes, perform an annual comprehensive foot examination to identify risk factors predictive of ulcers and amputations. The foot examination should include inspection, assessment of foot pulses, and testing for loss of protective sensation (10-g monofilament plus testing any one of: vibration using 128-Hz tuning fork, pinprick sensation, ankle reflexes, or vibration perception threshold).

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to RAAS inhibitors, ACEis/ARBs, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine increases by > 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^aa1c4b84]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

KDOQI US commentary — RAS inhibitor safety, monitoring, and hyperkalemia management: Since RAS inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia, monitoring for hyperkalemia within 1–2 weeks after initiation remains appropriate. Although serum creatinine concentrations often increase acutely with RAS inhibitor initiation, an initial increase of ≤ 30% followed by stabilization within 2 months is associated with long-term preservation of kidney function. Therefore, every effort to maintain adequate dosing of RAS inhibitors, even in individuals more likely to develop hyperkalemia, could be useful, and an approach to maintain adequate RAS inhibition may be facilitated by dietary restrictions and/or potassium binders. The guideline also notes that the concurrent use of ACEIs and ARBs or inclusion of direct renin inhibitors in conjunction with an ACEI or ARB increases adverse outcomes and should be avoided. Consistent with practice point 1.2.6, ACEIs or ARBs should only be reduced or discontinued as a last resort in patients with hyperkalemia, and a recent retrospective cohort study found a higher risk of death and major cardiovascular outcomes after discontinuation of ACEI or ARB therapy in individuals who reached eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

### New warning and contraindication for blood pressure… [^3c106da4]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Safety Announcement Additional Information for Patients Additional Information for Healthcare Professionals Data Summary The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is warning of possible risks when using blood pressure medicines containing aliskiren with other drugs called angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with diabetes or kidney impairment. These drug combinations should not be used in patients with diabetes. In addition, a new warning is being added to avoid use of these drug combinations in patients with kidney impairment. The labels for the aliskiren drugs are being updated based on preliminary data from a clinical trial, "Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardio-Renal Endpoints".

The following recommendations are being added to the drug labels for aliskiren-containing products as of 4/20/12:
- A new contraindication against the use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs in patients with diabetes because of the risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.
- A warning to avoid use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.
- Concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs in patients with diabetes is contraindicated because of the risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.
- Avoid use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs in patients with renal impairment where GFR < 60 mL/min.
- Valturna should not be used in patients with diabetes.
- Valturna will no longer be marketed after July 2012. See Novartis's website for more information.
- Be aware of the preliminary findings from the ALTITUDE trial for death and stroke; FDA has not concluded that there is a link between these drugs and death or stroke. After a median patient follow up of about 27 months, the trial was terminated early for lack of efficacy. Greater risks of renal impairment, hypotension and hyperkalemia were observed in aliskiren- compared to placebo-treated patients, as shown in the Table 1 below. Table 1. Incidence of Selected Adverse Reactions in ALTITUDE 1.

### Losartan potatssium [^7fdbc562]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Hypertension:

Losartan potassium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, including diuretics.

Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy:

Losartan potassium tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, but there is evidence that this benefit does not apply to Black patients (see PRECAUTIONS, Race and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects, Reduction in the Risk of Stroke, Race).

Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients

Losartan potassium tablets are indicated for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy with an elevated serum creatinine and proteinuria (urinary albumin to creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg/g) in patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of hypertension. In this population, losartan potassium reduces the rate of progression of nephropathy as measured by the occurrence of doubling of serum creatinine or end stage renal disease (need for dialysis or renal transplantation) (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects).

Defining CKD progression

Classically, rapid CKD progression has been defined as a loss of > 5 mL/min/year. The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline avoids defining any thresholds, arguing that any worsening could reflect deteriorating kidney health. Instead, advice is provided to better appreciate the intraindividual random biological variation in eGFR and albuminuria: a change in eGFR of > 20% or a doubling of uACR on a subsequent test exceeds the expected variability and warrants evaluation. While this definition focuses more broadly on how to interpret the changes in kidney function during patient monitoring, we may miss the denominator of time. Without considering the time between both subsequent tests, we do not have an impression on the speed of this decline.

The initiation of haemodynamically active therapies, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRA), GLP-1ra and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) results in transient short-term 'dips' in eGFR of a magnitude of 10%–30%. The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline recommends review of underlying causes and close monitoring in patients with eGFR reductions of > 30% during the first 3 months of therapy with these agents. However, providers should avoid the urge to stop these kidney-protective agents, particularly since these earlier 'dips' are typically reversible and not an indication of drug toxicity, especially as the potential clinical benefits are considerable.

### Is there added value to adding ARB to ACE inhibitors in the management of CKD? [^7c256799]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Antagonism of the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) decreases BP and reduces proteinuria in chronic kidney disease. BP is decreased approximately 5 mmHg when angiotensin II blockers are added to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and is less than typically seen when other agents are added to existing ACE inhibitor regimens. Dual RAAS blockade results in additional reduction in proteinuria. Clinically insignificant increases in hyperkalemia and modest decreases in GFR occur. Data regarding long-term preservation of renal function are lacking. We suggest dual RAAS blockade be used in patients with chronic kidney disease with residual proteinuria on maximal ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II blocker therapy, anticipating additional data with ongoing trials.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^99e7da96]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2023 ESH Guidelines highlight also the main therapeutic challenges with ACEi or ARB treatment. As the vasodilating effect of ACEis or ARBs on the efferent arteriole reduces intraglomerular pressure, eGFR drops commonly by an average of 10%–15% in the first weeks of treatment with these agents (eGFR dip). A similar hemodynamic effect can be seen with large BP reductions offered by any antihypertensive agent. Thus, repeated monitoring of eGFR and blood electrolytes within 4–8 weeks (depending on baseline kidney function) is important when treatment is initiated. Clinicians should not be alarmed by this early GFR drop, but if the decline in GFR continues or is more severe (> 30%), the RAS blocker should be stopped, and the patient should be investigated for the presence of renovascular disease. Use of RAS blockers in CKD patients further increases the risk of hyperkalemia. Incident hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality and is the most frequent reason for dose reduction or discontinuation of ACEis and ARBs in CKD patients. However, reducing the dose or discontinuing RAS blockers has been associated with increased risk of CV events in large observational studies and should be avoided. Novel potassium binders (patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) were shown to effectively normalize elevated serum potassium and chronically maintain normal levels in CKD patients treated with ACEis, ARBs or spironolactone, with good tolerability. Thus, these agents can be used to maintain serum potassium < 5.5 mmol/L in individuals with CKD (CoR II; LoE B).

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what is the 'right' dose? [^a0c1c6ce]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

What was the rate of 'target dose' achievement in trials?

Tables 1, 2, 3 show the proportion of patients achieving the 'target dose' of treatment in trials, with all the caveats described above. As can be seen in trials using an ACE inhibitor or ARB, on average approximately 50%–70% of patients achieved a target dose, although the placebo‐controlled trials showed that the proportion of patients attaining the target dose in the placebo group was not 100% (Table 1). Indeed, in CONSENSUS, the trial that included patients with the most advanced heart failure, only 45% of patients in the placebo group were titrated to the target dose, indicating that failure to successfully up‐titrate therapy is often because of the patient's underlying condition, and changes in condition over time, or physician perception, independent of the effect of treatment. The data for beta‐blockers are generally similar with the exception of CIBIS‐ELD, a trial designed to compare target dose attainment and tolerability of bisoprolol and carvedilol. It is not clear why only 31% of patients reached the target dose, although all participants were aged 65 years or older. Importantly, the low rate of target dose attainment was despite the prescription of a beta‐blocker in 60% of participants before trial entry (Table 2). Similarly, the achievement of target dose appears to differ greatly between RALES and EMPHASIS‐HF. However, target dose achievement with MRAs is particularly hard to assess given the protocol mandated reasons not to increase dose and the higher rate of target dose achievement in EMPHASIS‐HF likely reflected the stratification of dose by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline in that trial.

These trials included very few normotensive participants, but overall evidence for ACE-inhibitor or ARB treatment in macroalbuminuric patients with normal blood pressure was considered moderate to weak; nevertheless, the Work Group recommends treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB in this group, and there was no significant difference in treatment effect between normotensive and hypertensive individuals.

The non-steroidal MRA finerenone reduced CKD progression and cardiovascular events (predominantly HF) in people with T2D and UACR ≥ 30 mg/g when added to standard of care, including a RAS inhibitor. Hyperkalemia occurred at higher rates with finerenone than placebo, but 99% of patients completed the trials. – Finerenone can be added to standard of care treatment (including a RAS inhibitor and SGLT2 inhibitor) for people with T2D and CKD.

2.3.5. Management of Comorbid Heart Failure and CKD

HF and CKD frequently intersect in clinical practice and have unique diagnostic, management, and monitoring considerations. Patients with comorbid HF and CKD face markedly elevated risks of clinical progression and mortality yet are often inadequately treated with disease-modifying therapies targeting each condition ("a risk-treatment parado").

Guideline-recommended HF therapies have been studied across a broad range of patients with comorbid CKD. The SGLT2 inhibitors have been studied and demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated in patients with HF at eGFRs as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Other therapeutic classes, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, ARNI, and steroidal MRAs (spironolactone and eplerenone) have been mostly studied at eGFR as low as 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Although limited evidence exists for use of beta-blockers among those who require kidney-replacement therapy, no overt safety risks have been identified, and their use in those with HF may be considered.

Considering the Safety of MRAS in Glomerular Disease

People with CKD have an increased risk of hyperkalemia, which can lead to serious issues such as cardiac arrhythmia episodes and sudden death.MRA treatments can potentially cause or worsen hyperkalemia in patients with kidney impairment, (Table 2) and is a pressing safety concern of these drugs. As per prescribing information, eplerenone is contraindicated for treating hypertension in patients with a creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, and steroidal MRAs are not indicated for treatment of CKD with or without diabetes. A meta-analysis of data from studies of spironolactone and eplerenone has indicated that these agents conferred no significant risk of hyperkalemia in patients with nondiabetic proteinuric CKD, but this needs further investigation. The advantages of ns-MRAs include possibly lower risk of hyperkalemia (as seen with finerenone), having potency similar to spironolactone and greater than eplerenone, and greater selectivity for the MR, translating to its more specific anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects versus steroidal MRAs. It has been suggested that as finerenone increases potassium levels in a predictable way, patients at risk of hyperkalemia can be identified early in clinical practice and monitored for an easy management. Nonetheless, precautions are advised when prescribing finerenone. Serum potassium and eGFR should be measured in all patients before initiating treatment and should be monitored periodically during treatment, with the dose modified accordingly. Treatment should not be started if serum potassium is > 5.0 mEq/L. Finally, more frequent monitoring may be necessary for patients at risk for hyperkalemia, including those on concomitant medications that impair potassium excretion or increase serum potassium.

As noted, potassium binders such as patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are available to manage hyperkalemia. The ongoing MorphCKD trial is exploring the feasibility of adding patiromer to allow for improved renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade (including use of an MRA), thereby reducing albuminuria in patients with albuminuric CKD where full treatment might otherwise be limited by hyperkalemia. As noted in the KDIGO 2022 guidelines, "hyperkalemia associated with the use of an ACEi or ARB can often be managed by measures to reduce serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping the ACEi or ARB immediately"; these measures include a low potassium diet and the use of diuretics and potassium binders.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future? [^7e312784]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Since 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulators have mandated that all new glucose-lowering agents undergo long-term cardiovascular outcome trials to demonstrate safety, primarily in response to concerns that drugs (notably rosiglitazone) that were effective in improving glycaemic control could increase cardiovascular risk. Just over a decade later, almost 20 large-scale cardiovascular or kidney outcome trials have been completed, resulting in an explosion of evidence that has transformed diabetes care. Of the newer classes of glucose-lowering agents, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to consistently reduce the risk of clinically important, patient-level cardiovascular outcomes, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and hospitalization for heart failure (HF). The advent of SGLT2 inhibitors thus represents a major advance for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and those who care for them.

The emergence of evidence for the SGLT2 inhibitor class has been watched with great anticipation in the nephrology community. It has been almost two decades since the benefits of renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockade were confirmed in Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) and Reduction of Endpoints in Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus with Angiotensin 2 Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL); however, despite this, growth in the global burden of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has continued unabated. The capacity of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce albuminuria created hope for a clinically meaningful kidney benefit. This optimism was further reinforced by secondary analyses of the SGLT2 cardiovascular outcome trials, which demonstrated that these drugs consistently reduced the risk of serum creatinine-based kidney outcomes. However, most participants in these trials were at low risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and thus the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the most important patient-level kidney outcome — namely the need for dialysis or transplantation — was uncertain.

### Effect of losartan on prevention and progression of early diabetic nephropathy in American Indians with type 2 diabetes [^e95ea3df]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Study design.

A planned 6-year, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial compared the effect of losartan (Cozaar; Merck) versus placebo on development and progression of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes. Subjects were stratified at baseline by albumin excretion category (normoalbuminuria: albumin/creatinine ratio [ACR] < 30 mg/g; microalbuminuria: ACR 30–299 mg/g) based on the geometric mean of three screening measurements and were allocated randomly to receive either losartan or placebo within each category. The prespecified primary study outcome was a decline in GFR to ≤ 60 mL/min or to half the baseline value in subjects who entered the study with GFR < 120 mL/min. Another study outcome was the difference between treatment groups in predefined glomerular structural variables measured on kidney biopsy samples obtained at the end of treatment. Subjects were enrolled between 1996 and 2001, the last biopsy was performed in 2007, and morphometric evaluation was completed in 2012. Progression to macroalbuminuria (ACR ≥ 300 mg/g) also was examined as an outcome.

Treatment group was assigned by computer-generated random blocks of < 10 subjects stratified by albuminuria category. Treatment with losartan began at 50 mg daily, with the dose increasing to 100 mg daily after 1 week if symptomatic hypotension did not develop. A placebo corresponding to each dose of losartan was supplied. Compliance was assessed by pill counts, and subjects were considered compliant if ≥ 50% of study drug was used. Clinical care was provided outside the study in accordance with existing clinical care guidelines while avoiding the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs for management of hypertension. In 2000, changes in standards of care and new evidence of cardiovascular protection by treatment with ACE inhibitors in similar patients threatened continuation of the study, because treatment with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB was recommended for patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria. Accordingly, the protocol was modified to suggest that primary care providers consider adding inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to the masked treatment regimen of study subjects.

### Long-term effect of losartan on kidney disease in American Indians with type 2 diabetes: a follow-up analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^36ed6fea]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether early administration of losartan slows progression of diabetic kidney disease over an extended period.

Research Design and Methods

We conducted a 6-year clinical trial in 169 American Indians with type 2 diabetes and urine albumin/creatinine ratio < 300 mg/g; 84 participants were randomly assigned to receive losartan and 85 to placebo. Primary outcome was a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR; iothalamate) to ≤ 60 mL/min or to half the baseline value in persons who entered with GFR < 120 mL/min. At enrollment, GFR averaged 165 mL/min (interquartile range 49–313 mL/min). During the trial, nine persons reached the primary outcome with a hazard ratio (HR; losartan vs. placebo) of 0.50 (95% CI 0.12–1.99). Participants were then followed posttrial for up to 12 years, with treatment managed outside the study. The effect of losartan on the primary GFR outcome was then reanalyzed for the entire study period, including the clinical trial and posttrial follow-up.

Results

After completion of the clinical trial, treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors was equivalent in both groups. During a median of 13.5 years following randomization, 29 participants originally assigned to losartan and 35 to placebo reached the primary GFR outcome with an HR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.44–1.18).

Conclusions

Long-term risk of GFR decline was not significantly different between persons randomized to early treatment with losartan and those randomized to placebo. Accordingly, we found no evidence of an extended benefit of early losartan treatment on slowing GFR decline in persons with type 2 diabetes.

2.1 Hypertension

Adult Hypertension

The usual starting dose of losartan potassium tablets is 50 mg once daily. The dosage can be increased to a maximum dose of 100 mg once daily as needed to control blood pressure [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. A starting dose of 25 mg is recommended for patients with possible intravascular depletion (e.g., on diuretic therapy).

Pediatric Hypertension

The usual recommended starting dose is 0.7 mg per kg once daily (up to 50 mg total) administered as a tablet or a suspension [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. Doses above 1.4 mg per kg (or in excess of 100 mg) daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Losartan potassium tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age or in pediatric patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14)].

2.2 Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy

The usual starting dose is 50 mg of losartan potassium tablets once daily. Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily should be added and/or the dose of losartan potassium tablets should be increased to 100 mg once daily followed by an increase in hydrochlorothiazide to 25 mg once daily based on blood pressure response [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

2.3 Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients

The usual starting dose is 50 mg once daily. The dose should be increased to 100 mg once daily based on blood pressure response [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

2.4 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

In patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment the recommended starting dose of losartan potassium tablets is 25 mg once daily. Losartan potassium tablet has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Special Populations (8.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^39f4eb3a]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension has a major associated risk for organ damage and mortality, which is further heightened in patients with prior cardiovascular (CV) events, comorbid diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria and renal impairment. Given that most patients with hypertension require at least two antihypertensives to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals, identifying the most appropriate combination regimen based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action offer potential advantages over free-drug combinations, including simplification of treatment regimens, convenience and reduced costs. The improved adherence and convenience resulting from SPC use is recognised in updated hypertension guidelines. Despite a wide choice of SPCs for hypertension treatment, clinical evidence from direct head-to-head comparisons to guide selection for individual patients is lacking. However, in patients with evidence of renal disease or at greater risk of developing renal disease, such as those with diabetes mellitus, microalbuminura and high-normal BP or overt hypertension, guidelines recommend renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker-based combination therapy due to superior renoprotective effects compared with other antihypertensive classes. Furthermore, RAS inhibitors attenuate the oedema and renal hyperfiltration associated with calcium channel blocker (CCB) monotherapy, making them a good choice for combination therapy. The occurrence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced cough supports the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for RAS blockade rather than ACE inhibitors. In this regard, ARB-based SPCs are available in combination with the diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or the calcium CCB, amlodipine. Telmisartan, a long-acting ARB with preferential pharmacodynamic profile compared with several other ARBs, and the only ARB with an indication for the prevention of CV disease progression, is available in two SPC formulations, telmisartan/HCTZ and telmisartan/amlodipine. Clinical studies suggest that in CV high-risk patients and those with evidence of renal disease, the use of an ARB/CCB combination may be preferred to ARB/HCTZ combinations due to superior renoprotective and CV benefits and reduced metabolic side effects in patients with concomitant metabolic disorders. However, selection of the most appropriate antihypertensive combination should be dependent on careful review of the individual patient and appropriate consideration of drug pharmacology.

### Antihypertensive treatment in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus: what guidance from recent controlled randomized trials? [^2da2e2b7]. Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with type-2 diabetes have a high prevalence of hypertension and show an elevated incidence of cardiovascular events and nephropathy.

Objectives

Recent randomized trials of antihypertensive therapy providing information about cardiovascular and renal risk in diabetes, blood pressure goals and best suitable drugs were reviewed.

Findings

Evidence that association of type-2 diabetes with hypertension markedly increases cardiovascular and renal risk is incontrovertible: even blood pressure values in the high-normal range represent a more relevant risk than in non-diabetics. More versus less intensive blood pressure lowering or active versus placebo treatment can significantly prevent cardiovascular and renal events, with a particularly consistent reduction of proteinuria and microalbuminuria. Although several of the trials showing significant reduction of cardiovascular or renal risk achieved diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 75 and 82 mmHg, systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 mmHg was never achieved in trials showing cardiovascular benefits and SBP 130 mmHg was only achieved in two trials in normotensive subjects showing proteinuria reduction. The recommendation given by all major guidelines to lower SBP 130 mmHg appears to be difficult to comply with. Evidence of the superiority or inferiority of different drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, diuretics and beta-blockers) is rather vague, especially for cardiovascular protection. As to angiotensin-receptor antagonists, losartan has shown significant cardiovascular protection over a beta-blocker, and irbesartan, although not showing cardiovascular benefits over a calcium antagonist, was significantly better in retarding renal dysfunction and failure.

Conclusions

In most trials on hypertensive diabetics, the large majority of patients were on two, three and even four-drug therapy. Therefore, it appears reasonable that all effective and well tolerated antihypertensive agents can be used in association to achieve DBP 80 mmHg and, whenever possible, SBP 130 or 135 mmHg, with the regular inclusion of an angiotensin-receptor antagonist for its proven renoprotective action. Hopefully, better guidance will be provided by further trials.

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Developing guidelines on a subject as broad as hypertension is difficult, especially when the guidance relates to hypertension in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Guideline Development Group has applied a rigorous methodology in reviewing all available evidence, and their recommendations are consistent with the evidence-based approach. As a result, the European Renal Best Practice endorses most of its recommendations. However, the Work Group feels that some additional advice could help clinicians in daily practice: (i) individualization of treatment should be taken into account, especially (cardiovascular) co-morbidities, age, gender and race; (ii) side-effects, such as postural dizziness should be monitored closely, particularly in elderly, diabetics and patients with arterial stiffness; (iii) the importance of salt restriction should not be neglected; (iv) although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs) remain a cornerstone in the management of hypertension, and especially cardiovascular protection, in some particular situations such as in advanced CKD and in patients without proteinuria, their role is less well defined; (v) as most CKD patients need more than one antihypertensive drug to achieve blood pressure control, the specific (renal) (dis)advantages of other classes than ACE-I or ARB should be taken into account.

Study enrolment and randomization

Following informed consent and completion of the baseline assessments, participants will be randomized into the trial in a 1∶1 ratio to either continue with their ACEi and/or ARB treatment (control arm) or to discontinue their ACEi and/or ARB treatment (experimental arm). Randomization will be provided by a computer-generated programme at the Clinical Trials Unit, using a minimization algorithm to ensure balance between the arms with regard to important clinical variables. The minimization variables will be diabetes (Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes or non-diabetic), BP {mean arterial pressure [MAP] measured as [(2 × diastolic) + systolic]/3; < 100 or ≥ 100}, age (< 65 or ≥ 65 years), proteinuria (protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) < 100 or ≥ 100) and eGFR (< 15 or ≥ 15 mL/min).

Study treatment

Active treatment (experimental)

All ACEi and/or ARB treatment will be discontinued. In order to compensate for the loss of antihypertensive activity, additional antihypertensive treatment will be commenced to keep BP within recommended guidelines. Any antihypertensive agents used in routine clinical practice are permitted to control BP throughout the trial, but excluding ACEi or ARBs. The choice of antihypertensive will depend on other treatment being taken by the participant and will be at the discretion of the responsible clinician. Any antihypertensive agent used in routine clinical practice is permitted, but excluding ACEi and ARBs except as a last resort.

Control arm

Participants will continue on 'standard' care and will continue with their ACEi and/or ARB treatment. The choice and dose of ACEi and/or ARB will be at the discretion of the responsible clinician.

Both treatment groups

In both groups, BP will be controlled to the target pressure outlined in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Hypertension guideline and NICE CKD guideline of ≤ 140/85 mmHg. The monitoring of BP will be as per the NICE CKD guideline.

Blinding

Trial treatment will be open label, due to the practical difficulties and costs associated with using placebo in a trial of drug withdrawal. However, the primary outcome measure is an objective laboratory measure that reduces the need for blinding. Additionally, investigators taking part in the trial will remain blind to all trial outcome data for the duration of the trial to minimize bias, with un-blinded data presented only to the independent Data Monitoring and Ethical Committee (DMEC).

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers for advanced chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and retrospective individual participant-level meta-analysis of clinical trials [^b4a59aac]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), the effects of initiating treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) on the risk for kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT) and death remain unclear.

Purpose

To examine the association of ACEi or ARB treatment initiation, relative to a non-ACEi or ARB comparator, with rates of KFRT and death.

Data Sources

Ovid Medline and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration Clinical Trials Consortium from 1946 through 31 December 2023.

Study Selection

Completed randomized controlled trials testing either an ACEi or an ARB versus a comparator (placebo or antihypertensive drugs other than ACEi or ARB) that included patients with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

Data Extraction

The primary outcome was KFRT, and the secondary outcome was death before KFRT. Analyses were done using Cox proportional hazards models according to the intention-to-treat principle. Prespecified subgroup analyses were done according to baseline age (< 65 vs. ≥ 65 years), eGFR (< 20 vs. ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2), albuminuria (urine albumin-creatinine ratio < 300 vs. ≥ 300 mg/g), and history of diabetes.

Data Synthesis

A total of 1739 participants from 18 trials were included, with a mean age of 54.9 years and mean eGFR of 22.2 mL/min/1.73 m 2, of whom 624 (35.9%) developed KFRT and 133 (7.6%) died during a median follow-up of 34 months (IQR, 19 to 40 months). Overall, ACEi or ARB treatment initiation led to lower risk for KFRT (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.55 to 0.79]) but not death (hazard ratio, 0.86 [CI, 0.58 to 1.28]). There was no statistically significant interaction between ACEi or ARB treatment and age, eGFR, albuminuria, or diabetes (P for interaction > 0.05 for all).

Limitation

Individual participant-level data for hyperkalemia or acute kidney injury were not available.

Conclusion

Initiation of ACEi or ARB therapy protects against KFRT, but not death, in people with advanced CKD.

### Losartan potassium (losartan) [^214ef890]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

8.6 Race

In the LIFE study, Black patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy treated with atenolol were at lower risk of experiencing the primary composite endpoint compared with Black patients treated with losartan potassium (both cotreated with hydrochlorothiazide in the majority of patients). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death, analyzed using an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. In the subgroup of Black patients (n = 533, 6% of the LIFE study patients), there were 29 primary endpoints among 263 patients on atenolol (11%, 26 per 1000 patient-years) and 46 primary endpoints among 270 patients (17%, 42 per 1000 patient-years) on losartan potassium. This finding could not be explained on the basis of differences in the populations other than race or on any imbalances between treatment groups. In addition, blood pressure reductions in both treatment groups were consistent between Black and non-Black patients. Given the difficulty in interpreting subset differences in large trials, it cannot be known whether the observed difference is the result of chance. However, the LIFE study provides no evidence that the benefits of losartan potassium on reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy apply to Black patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

Patients with renal insufficiency have elevated plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite compared to subjects with normal renal function. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment unless a patient with renal impairment is also volume depleted [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Hepatic Impairment

The recommended starting dose of losartan potassium is 25 mg in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. Following oral administration in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite were, respectively, 5 times and 1.7 times those seen in healthy volunteers. Losartan potassium has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Synopsis of BP target evidence in adults with hypertension highlights risk relationships, targets, adverse effects, and monitoring: BP is associated with CVD risk in a progressive, log-linear fashion from low to high levels (eg, SBP 100–180 mm Hg); the evidence to support an SBP goal < 130 mm Hg is strong, and there is also evidence for an SBP goal < 120 mm Hg versus < 140 mm Hg. Adverse effects of intensive antihypertensive therapy — hypotension, syncope, injurious falls, electrolyte abnormalities, and reduction in eGFR — are noted but described as infrequent and usually mild. Overall, clinical trials provide strong support for an SBP goal < 130 mm Hg and, when feasible, SBP < 120 mm Hg; generalization to practice warrants careful monitoring, and achievement of target BP should be based on an average of ≥ 2 readings at ≥ 2 visits, with an SBP/DBP target of < 130/80 mm Hg seeming reasonable for those not at high risk for CVD.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^4108b39e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease with a major associated risk for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with hypertension require more than one antihypertensive agent to achieve and maintain guideline-recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. Identifying the most appropriate combination therapy for each patient based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Increasingly, single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are available. These offer potential advantages, including simplification of treatment regimens, more convenient drug administration and reduced healthcare costs. Evidence from meta-analyses has shown that the use of antihypertensive SPCs compared with corresponding free-drug combinations is associated with significantly greater rates of treatment adherence to medication and potential advantages in terms of BP improvements and adverse effects. A large retrospective database study of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in two-drug SPCs has also shown greater levels of adherence compared with the corresponding free-pill ARB/CCB regimens. Treatment adherence is an important issue for a chronic disease such as hypertension, with improvements in adherence expected to result in better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced CV and renal morbidity/mortality. This review will consider the choice of agents for combination therapy using two-drug SPCs and the rationale for using particular combinations in patients with hypertension and renal impairment.

Why should early combination therapy be considered?

Worldwide guidelines recommend combination therapy as a first-line treatment option for hypertension likely not to be controlled on monotherapy (e.g. 20/10 mmHg above target BP) because of evidence showing that only a minority of patients will achieve and maintain BP goals on monotherapy. The recent re-appraisal of the European guidelines also recommended the preferential use of SPCs to improve adherence.

There are a number of compelling reasons why early combination therapy should be used in patients with hypertension (Table 1), including lack of efficacy with monotherapy, greater BP control and attenuation of side effects associated with monotherapeutic treatment. In addition, hypertensive patients with comorbidities, such as renal disease, might benefit from additional effects of multiple antihypertensive agents, beyond those related to BP lowering.

ADD-ON THERAPY

In the treatment of patients with escape, reduction in salt intake, increased diuretic treatment, and an increased dose of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) above the recommended doses for antihypertensive treatment is a logical first step. The study of Mehdi et al. showed that in proteinuric patients who were treated with 80 mg/day lisonopril and in whom escape had occurred, the addition of 25 mg/day spironolactone was more effective than 100 mg/day losartan. The results of the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) study indicate that the combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs does not provide additional benefit. In diabetic patients with escape, spironolactone or eplerenone has been shown to cause secondary reduction of proteinuria.

An additional intervention is the renin blocker aliskiren, which when given in addition to ARBs caused in the Aliskiren in the Evaluation of Proteinuria in Diabetes (AVOID) study significant further reduction of albuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients. Studies on hard renal end points are forthcoming.

Wenzel et al. reported that in early stages of type 2 diabetes with nephropathy, the endothelin (ET A) receptor blocker avosentan reduced albuminuria, but in more advanced kidney disease, avosentan caused an unacceptable rate of heart failure and pulmonary edema. Therefore, avosentan is clearly contraindicated in advanced diabetic nephropathy.

Preliminary data show that the vitamin D receptor activator paricalcitol at a dose of 1 μg and 2 μg/day reduces albuminuria further by ∼20% in type 2 diabetic patients with CKD.
