## Question

Medication for dizziness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medication for dizziness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the etiologic framework for dizziness and how that drives treatment. Then, I should verify the evidence for vestibular suppressants across common causes like BPPV, vestibular neuritis, Ménière's disease, and vestibular migraine. Next, I will examine safety, especially fall risk and anticholinergic burden. After that, I should review guideline positions and reconcile them with real-world practice. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, diagnosis-specific approach and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework, because medication choice hinges on cause. Dizziness is not a single entity; it includes vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and lightheadedness, and the timing and triggers guide the differential toward peripheral vestibular, central, cardiovascular, metabolic, or psychiatric etiologies, so I need to ensure I'm anchoring recommendations to the underlying diagnosis rather than treating the symptom alone [^4f91cf15] [^7114b900].

> Now, I will examine vestibular suppressants for BPPV, since this is where misuse is most common. Wait, let me verify the comparative effectiveness: multiple guidelines and meta-analyses consistently recommend canalith repositioning maneuvers as first-line and advise against routine vestibular suppressants, which show no durable benefit and may delay compensation; a meta-analysis of RCTs found no improvement in symptom resolution at 14–31 days with suppressants versus placebo, whereas CRMs were superior, and a JAMA Neurology meta-analysis found single-dose antihistamines outperform benzodiazepines at 2 hours but no sustained benefit at 1 week to 1 month, reinforcing that suppressants are not definitive therapy for BPPV [^e7cdb4bf] [^f133c6f1] [^05c556eb] [^d3e9e47c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about acute vertigo in general. I should review vestibular neuritis. Guidelines suggest that while vestibular suppressants may be used for a very short course (several days) for symptomatic relief, there is low-certainty evidence and a risk of delaying vestibular compensation; shared decision-making is advised, and prolonged use is discouraged, so I need to emphasize early mobilization and vestibular rehabilitation rather than ongoing pharmacologic suppression [^07f9aa2d] [^692f0554].

> Next, I should review Ménière's disease. Let me verify the role of suppressants here. Guidelines support a limited course of vestibular suppressants only during acute vertigo attacks, with chronic use discouraged because it impedes central compensation; beyond acute attacks, evidence for systemic agents like betahistine and diuretics is low to very low certainty, so I should frame suppressants as rescue-only and pivot to lifestyle and disease-specific therapies for prophylaxis [^6d1ed493] [^2cdea7dd] [^5431048b].

> I will now examine vestibular migraine. The evidence base for acute and preventive pharmacotherapy is sparse and low quality; triptans show little to no acute benefit at 1 hour in a recent RCT, and Cochrane reviews find very low-certainty evidence for beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers in prevention, so I should avoid overpromising medication benefits and instead individualize based on comorbidities, side-effect profiles, and patient preference, reserving vestibular sedatives for occasional rescue and limiting frequency to avoid medication-overuse headache and withdrawal [^a0df7c58] [^f1caff38] [^313dbbd1] [^8b16d69a].

> But wait, what about persistent postural-perceptual dizziness? I need to check the pharmacologic evidence. The Cochrane review found no eligible RCTs for SSRIs or SNRIs in PPPD, so medication decisions remain uncertain; nonpharmacologic vestibular rehabilitation is the cornerstone, and if serotonergic agents are tried, it should be with careful monitoring and shared decision-making given the evidence gap [^290d551d] [^1812ef34].

> I should double-check safety, especially fall risk and anticholinergic burden. Large observational cohorts show that vestibular suppressants, particularly meclizine and benzodiazepines, are associated with a 2.5–3.3-fold increased risk of injurious falls in older adults with dizziness, and the AGS Beers Criteria advise against routine use of meclizine and benzodiazepines in older adults due to anticholinergic effects, sedation, cognitive impairment, and dependence; this risk signal persists even after adjustment, so I need to prioritize de-implementation and safer alternatives [^1bb4153a] [^6f56d064] [^f6b7ee53].

> Let me consider real-world practice and guideline concordance. Despite strong recommendations against routine suppressants for BPPV, ED and outpatient prescribing remains common, with meclizine frequently used; this represents low-value care that increases costs and adverse events without improving definitive outcomes, so I should incorporate education, decision support, and direct access to vestibular rehabilitation to close the evidence-practice gap [^10d60616] [^7cbfe659] [^b02e51fe].

> I should confirm a practical, diagnosis-specific approach. For BPPV, perform Dix-Hallpike and treat with CRMs; avoid suppressants except for very short-term rescue in exceptional cases. For vestibular neuritis, consider a 1–3 day suppressant taper while initiating vestibular rehabilitation. For Ménière's, use suppressants only during acute attacks and pursue salt restriction and evidence-uncertain prophylaxis thereafter. For vestibular migraine, prioritize prevention with migraine agents and limit acute vestibular sedatives to occasional use. For PPPD, emphasize rehabilitation and reserve SSRIs/SNRIs for select cases with shared decision-making. For nonvestibular dizziness, treat the underlying cause rather than adding suppressants [^4f91cf15] [^07f9aa2d] [^6d1ed493] [^8b16d69a] [^290d551d].

> Hold on, I should verify key knowledge gaps so I don't overstate certainties. We need higher-quality RCTs for vestibular suppressants in acute vertigo beyond 2 hours, head-to-head comparisons with rehabilitation, and standardized outcomes; for Ménière's, consensus core outcome sets and larger, methodologically aligned trials are needed; for vestibular migraine and PPPD, placebo-controlled trials of SSRIs/SNRIs and clearer phenotyping are priorities, and current low-certainty evidence should temper strong pharmacologic claims [^d3e9e47c] [^5431048b] [^290d551d] [^f1caff38].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: vestibular suppressants can offer transient symptom relief in select acute settings but are not disease-modifying and carry meaningful risks, especially falls and anticholinergic toxicity; definitive therapies like canalith repositioning, vestibular rehabilitation, and etiology-specific management should be prioritized, and routine suppressant use should be de-implemented through guideline-concordant care and patient education [^e7cdb4bf] [^4f91cf15] [^1bb4153a].

Medications can provide short-term relief for dizziness, but **most are not recommended for long-term use** because they can delay vestibular compensation and increase fall risk, especially in older adults [^2cdea7dd] [^1bb4153a]. The main classes are **vestibular suppressants** (antihistamines, benzodiazepines, antiemetics) for acute vertigo, and **preventive agents** (betahistine, diuretics, SSRIs/SNRIs, migraine prophylaxis) for chronic or episodic causes like Ménière's disease or vestibular migraine [^b90ba3fa]. For BPPV, medications are ineffective; **canalith repositioning maneuvers are first-line** [^e7cdb4bf] [^e8734f5a]. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, avoid sedatives in older adults, and tailor therapy to the underlying cause [^f6b7ee53] [^4f91cf15].

## Medications for acute dizziness and vertigo

### Vestibular suppressants

Vestibular suppressants reduce vestibular input and are used for **short-term relief** of acute vertigo and nausea [^d3e9e47c].

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Antihistamines | - Meclizine <br/> - Dimenhydrinate <br/> - Promethazine | - H1 blockade <br/> - Vestibular suppression | - Effective for acute vertigo <br/> - Sedating <br/> - Anticholinergic <br/> - Avoid in older adults [^f6b7ee53] |
| Benzodiazepines | - Diazepam <br/> - Lorazepam | - GABA-A agonism <br/> - CNS depression | - Rapid relief <br/> - Risk of dependence <br/> - Sedation <br/> - Falls <br/> - Avoid in older adults [^f6b7ee53] |
| Antiemetics | - Prochlorperazine <br/> - Ondansetron | - Dopamine antagonism <br/> - 5-HT3 antagonism | - Control nausea/vomiting <br/> - Extrapyramidal effects with prochlorperazine <br/> - QT prolongation with ondansetron |

---

### Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Antihistamines**: Single-dose antihistamines provide greater vertigo relief at 2 hours than benzodiazepines; evidence for longer-term benefit is limited [^d3e9e47c].
- **Benzodiazepines**: No evidence of superiority over antihistamines; significant risks of dependence, sedation, and falls, especially in older adults [^d3e9e47c] [^f6b7ee53].
- **Antiemetics**: Useful for nausea/vomiting control; ondansetron preferred in older adults due to fewer extrapyramidal effects.

## Medications for chronic dizziness and vestibular disorders

### Ménière's disease

For Ménière's disease, **betahistine** is commonly used to reduce vertigo frequency and severity, though evidence quality is low to moderate [^b90ba3fa] [^5431048b]. Diuretics (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide) are also used, with similarly limited evidence [^5431048b]. Vestibular suppressants are reserved for acute attacks only, as chronic use can delay compensation [^2cdea7dd].

---

### Vestibular migraine

Preventive options include **beta-blockers** (e.g. metoprolol), calcium channel blockers (e.g. flunarizine), and antidepressants (e.g. venlafaxine, amitriptyline); evidence quality is low, and choices should be individualized [^f1caff38] [^3a5b1fa7]. For acute attacks, triptans may be used, though evidence for vertigo relief is limited and mixed [^8911636a] [^a0df7c58].

---

### Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD)

SSRIs and SNRIs (e.g. sertraline, venlafaxine) are **first-line** for PPPD, with moderate evidence supporting symptom improvement [^bca98cfd].

---

## Medications for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)

Medications are **not recommended** for BPPV because they do not address the underlying canalithiasis and can delay compensation [^f133c6f1]. Canalith repositioning maneuvers (e.g. Epley) are first-line and highly effective [^e8734f5a].

---

## Risks and adverse effects

- **Fall risk**: Vestibular suppressants, especially benzodiazepines and antihistamines, significantly increase fall risk, particularly in older adults [^1bb4153a] [^f6b7ee53].
- **Cognitive impairment**: Chronic benzodiazepine use is associated with cognitive decline and dependence [^f6b7ee53].
- **Delayed compensation**: Prolonged use of vestibular suppressants can impair central compensation, worsening chronic dizziness [^2cdea7dd].

---

## Special populations

In older adults, **avoid benzodiazepines and anticholinergic antihistamines** due to fall and cognitive risks; use ondansetron for nausea when needed [^f6b7ee53]. In pregnancy, meclizine is generally considered safe, but benzodiazepines should be avoided. In pediatrics, vestibular suppressants are rarely indicated; vestibular rehabilitation is preferred.

---

## Non-pharmacological alternatives

- **Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT)**: Effective for chronic dizziness, PPPD, and residual symptoms after acute vestibular disorders [^75cdf4e7] [^1812ef34].
- **Canalith repositioning maneuvers**: First-line for BPPV [^e8734f5a].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Salt restriction, caffeine reduction, and stress management for Ménière's and vestibular migraine [^b93248fa].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Condition** | **First-line treatment** | **Medication role** |
|-|-|-|
| BPPV | Canalith repositioning maneuvers | Not recommended |
| Vestibular neuritis | Vestibular rehabilitation | Short-term vestibular suppressants |
| Ménière's disease | - Salt restriction <br/> - Diuretics | - Betahistine <br/> - Acute suppressants |
| Vestibular migraine | - Preventive therapy <br/> - Lifestyle | - Beta-blockers <br/> - Calcium channel blockers <br/> - Antidepressants |
| PPPD | Vestibular rehabilitation | SSRIs/SNRIs |
| Acute vertigo | Vestibular suppressants | Short-term use only |

---

Medications can provide short-term relief for dizziness, but **most are not recommended for long-term use** due to risks of delayed compensation, falls, and cognitive effects. Treatment should be individualized, with non-pharmacological therapies like vestibular rehabilitation prioritized whenever possible [^4f91cf15].

With increased medication use among the older adult population, adverse drug events and polypharmacy can be significant causes of dizziness in the elderly. The evidence evaluated in this review is helpful in clinical practice but requires an additional detailed investigation into the agents discussed to understand the risk/benefit ratio associated with medications. Examples of medications highly associated with dizziness in older adults and discussed in this review include cardiovascular and central nervous system agents. Several other medication classes associated with dizziness are among the medications most commonly used by older patients.

This paper presents an evidence-based introduction to assessing and managing the dizzy patient. It is based upon a literature review highlighting current best practice and the clinical experience of the author. Dizziness is common, often chronic and largely untreated, resulting in great personal and economic loss. Serious pathological causes of dizziness may be quickly and effectively screened by a simple ocular motor examination, differentiating these from peripheral vestibular lesions. A triage, differentiating dizziness into either acute onset, intermittent episodes or continuous symptoms is proposed, along with management strategies for the commonest causes of dizziness. Vestibular suppressant medication should be restricted to the acute phase of a vestibular episode. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy is the most effective treatment for continuous or chronic dizziness.

### Efficacy of benzodiazepines or antihistamines for patients with acute vertigo: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d3e9e47c]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Acute vertigo can be disabling. Antihistamines and benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed as "vestibular suppressants", but their efficacy is unclear.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of antihistamines and benzodiazepines in the treatment of acute vertigo from any underlying cause.

Data Sources

We searched the PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases from inception to January 14, 2019, without language restrictions. Bibliographies of the included studies and relevant reviews were also screened.

Study Selection

We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing antihistamine or benzodiazepine use with another comparator, placebo, or no intervention for patients with a duration of acute vertigo for 2 weeks or less. Studies of healthy volunteers, prophylactic treatment, or induced vertigo were excluded, as were studies that compared 2 medications from the same class.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, data were extracted and risk of bias was assessed by 2 authors independently for each study. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The predefined primary outcome was change in 10- or 100-point vertigo or dizziness visual analog scale (VAS) scores at 2 hours after treatment. Secondary outcomes included change in nausea VAS scores at 2 hours, use of rescue medication at 2 hours, and improvement or resolution of vertigo at 1 week or 1 month.

Results

Of the 27 trials identified in the systematic review, 17 contributed to the quantitative meta-analysis and involved a total of1586 participants. Seven trials with a total of 802 participants evaluated the primary outcome of interest: single-dose antihistamines resulted in significantly more improvement on 100-point VAS scores compared with benzodiazepines (difference, 16.1 [95% CI, 7.2 to 25.0]) but not compared with other active comparators (difference, 2.7 [95% CI, -6.1 to 11.5]). At 1 week and 1 month, neither daily benzodiazepines nor antihistamines were reported to be superior to placebo. RCTs comparing the immediate effects of medications (at 2 hours) after a single dose generally had a low risk of bias, but those evaluating 1-week and 1-month outcomes had a high risk of bias.

Conclusions and Relevance

Moderately strong evidence suggests that single-dose antihistamines provide greater vertigo relief at 2 hours than single-dose benzodiazepines. Furthermore, the available evidence did not support an association of benzodiazepine use with improvement in any outcomes for acute vertigo. Other evidence suggested that daily antihistamine use may not benefit patients with acute vertigo. Larger randomized trials comparing both antihistamines and benzodiazepines with placebo could better clarify the relative efficacy of these medications.

### Vestibular suppressant utilization and subsequent falls among patients 65 Years and older with dizziness in the United States [^731e9068]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Falls pose a significant public health threat to older adults, leading to widespread disability, severe injuries, and substantial healthcare expenditures. These incidents annually impact approximately 4.5 million older residents of the United States and incur significant costs for Medicare, ranging from $15 to $30 billion annually. The risk of injurious falls is heightened among older individuals experiencing dizziness, a common, debilitating, and often difficult to control symptom. Notably, previous studies examining trends in fall‐related injuries among individuals with dizziness have been hampered by the reliance on self‐reported survey data, which tends to underestimate the true prevalence of fall‐related injuries.

Medications used to reduce the intensity of symptoms of dizziness, vertigo, and associated motion sensitivity and motion sickness are known as vestibular suppressants. The major drug classes that provide vestibular suppression are antihistamines including meclizine, promethazine, and dimenhydrinate, anticholinergics, and benzodiazepines. These drugs also may have anti‐emetic properties that alleviate autonomic complaints of nausea and vomiting that can accompany vestibular symptoms. Vestibular suppressant medications may provide initial relief for acute dizziness symptoms; however, the American Geriatric Society (AGS) has made recommendations against the routine prescription of several medications commonly used for vestibular suppression, including meclizine, due to its anticholinergic properties, and benzodiazepines, due to risk of dependence, cognitive impairment, falls, and physical injury. Nevertheless, empirical evidence suggests that clinicians in emergency departments and outpatient clinics frequently prescribe vestibular suppressant medications for conditions such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and other dizziness symptoms in upwards of 50% of presentations. This disparity between published recommendations and clinical practice remains inadequately documented in the literature, and there is a notable gap in our understanding of the potential impact of such prescriptions on subsequent falls among adults ≥ 65 years old.

The primary objectives of this study were to harness a comprehensive real‐world cohort of individuals over the age of 65 years to explore the factors associated with the utilization of vestibular suppressants following the onset of dizziness and to illuminate the potential association between vestibular suppressant utilization and the likelihood of experiencing subsequent falls within this population. By bridging this critical knowledge gap, we aim to provide valuable insights that can inform clinical practice and enhance the overall well‐being of individuals grappling with dizziness and its associated risks. We anticipate that this research will foster informed discussions with patients regarding the potential detrimental consequences of vestibular suppressant use, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^0aae1bb9]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Vestibular suppressants for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in the ED — meclizine is the most commonly administered medication for dizziness in the ED, but with respect to BPPV the guideline authors agree with 2008 and 2017 society guidelines that discourage their use. In select patients after a successful canalith repositioning maneuver with conversion of the Dix–Hallpike from positive to negative, a few days of vestibular suppressants may help reduce symptoms but should not be used for longer periods of time. If a vestibular suppressant is used, single-dose antihistamines were more effective than single-dose benzodiazepines at reducing vertigo at 2 h after administration; overall, we do not recommend use of these medications as the primary treatment for patients with BPPV.

### Pharmacological interventions for persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) [^290d551d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Persistent postural‐perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a chronic balance disorder, which is characterised by subjective unsteadiness or dizziness that is worse on standing and with visual stimulation. The condition was only recently defined and therefore the prevalence is currently unknown. However, it is likely to include a considerable number of people with chronic balance problems. The symptoms can be debilitating and have a profound impact on quality of life. At present, little is known about the optimal way to treat this condition. A variety of medications may be used, as well as other treatments, such as vestibular rehabilitation.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions for persistent postural‐perceptual dizziness (PPPD).

Search methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 21 November 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with PPPD, which compared selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies that did not use the Bárány Society criteria to diagnose PPPD and studies that followed up participants for less than three months.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vestibular symptoms (assessed as a dichotomous outcome ‐ improved or not improved), 2) change in vestibular symptoms (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease‐specific health‐related quality of life, 5) generic health‐related quality of life and 6) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We identified no studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Authors' conclusions

At present, there is no evidence from placebo‐controlled randomised trials regarding pharmacological treatments ‐ specifically SSRIs and SNRIs ‐ for PPPD. Consequently, there is great uncertainty over the use of these treatments for this condition. Further work is needed to establish whether any treatments are effective at improving the symptoms of PPPD, and whether their use is associated with any adverse effects.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^07f9aa2d]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Vestibular neuritis — corticosteroids and vestibular suppressants: In patients with vestibular neuritis, improvement in dizziness is an important outcome, and given the very low certainty of the evidence for this intervention, the authors state that clinicians should weigh the pros and cons of steroid treatment and engage patients in shared decision making; harms noted include one case of gastrointestinal bleeding that required intervention and several cases of hyperglycemia. For symptomatic relief, emergency clinicians commonly use vestibular suppressants, but a formal evidence-based recommendation cannot be made; committee experts felt it is reasonable to use these medications for a very short period of time (several days) to reduce acute symptoms, while longer use beyond several days is discouraged, and the American Geriatrics Society recommends against using meclizine in older individuals due to its anticholinergic side effects. Research needs include testing whether earlier corticosteroid treatment within 2–3 days of onset shows a signal for efficacy compared to later treatment.

### Vestibular suppressant utilization and subsequent falls among patients 65 Years and older with dizziness in the United States [^2ea082e6]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the patterns of vestibular suppressant use among older adults with dizziness and their potential impact on falls. Our findings emphasize an association between these medications and falls above that ascribed to dizziness alone, but further research is needed to understand the complex interplay between medication use and fall risk comprehensively. This study serves as a foundation for future de‐implementation efforts to engage healthcare providers and patients to optimize the use of vestibular suppressants while considering the broader spectrum of safety and care.

### Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease [^f8e4a1f2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Balance disorders can be difficult to diagnose and treat. There are few specific diagnostic tests, a variety of related disorders with similar symptoms and a limited number of interventions that are known to be effective. To determine which topics within this area should be addressed with new or updated systematic reviews we conducted a scoping and prioritisation process, involving stakeholders. Ménière's disease was ranked as one of the highest priority topics during this process (along with vestibular migraine and persistent postural perceptual dizziness).

Although Ménière's disease is a relatively uncommon condition, the significant impact it has on quality of life demonstrates the clear importance of identifying effective interventions to alleviate the symptoms. There is considerable variation in the management of Ménière's disease on both a national and international scale, with a lack of consensus about appropriate first‐line and subsequent therapies.

This review is part of a suite of six that consider different interventions for Ménière's disease. Through these reviews, we hope to provide a thorough summary of the efficacy (benefits and harms) of the different treatment options, to support people with Ménière's disease (and healthcare professionals) when making decisions about their care.

### Current and emerging medical therapies for dizziness [^b90ba3fa]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Medical therapies for dizziness are aimed at vertigo reduction, secondary symptom management, or the root cause of the pathologic process. Acute peripheral vertigo pharmacotherapies include antihistamines, calcium channel blockers, and benzodiazepines. Prophylactic pharmacotherapies vary between causes. For Meniere disease, betahistine and diuretics remain initial first-line oral options, whereas intratympanic steroids and intratympanic gentamicin are reserved for uncontrolled symptoms. For cerebellar dizziness and oculomotor disorders, 4-aminopyridine may provide benefit. For vestibular migraine, persistent postural perceptual dizziness and mal de débarquement, treatment options overlap and include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and calcium channel blockers.

### Vestibular suppressant utilization and subsequent falls among patients 65 Years and older with dizziness in the United States [^cd22940a]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Key points ○ This study underscores the potential association between guideline discordant use of vestibular suppressant utilization and the likelihood of experiencing subsequent falls. ○ Of 190,348 individuals ≤ 65 years old who presented with dizziness, 60,658 (32%) filled a vestibular suppressant prescription (27% anti‐emetics, 73% anxiolytics). ○ Our findings may inform clinical practice and foster shared decision‐making between clinicians and individuals grappling with dizziness.
Why does this paper matter? ○ Falls pose a significant public health threat to older adults, leading to widespread disability, severe injuries, and substantial healthcare expenditures. ○ This study serves as a foundation for future de‐implementation efforts to engage healthcare providers and patients to optimize the use of vestibular suppressants while considering the broader spectrum of safety and care. ○ We anticipate that this research will foster informed discussions with patients regarding the potential detrimental consequences of vestibular suppressant use, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.

### Vestibular suppressants for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^e7cdb4bf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common cause of acute dizziness. Medication use for its treatment remains common despite guideline recommendations against their use.

Objectives

The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vestibular suppressants in patients with BPPV compared to placebo, no treatment, or canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRMs).

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception until March 25, 2022. for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antihistamines, phenothiazines, anticholinergics, and/or benzodiazepines to placebo, no treatment, or a CRM.

Results

Five RCTs, enrolling 296 patients, were included in the quantitative analysis. We found that vestibular suppressants may have no effect on symptom resolution at the point of longest follow-up (14-31days in four studies) when evaluated as a continuous outcome (standardized mean difference -0.03 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.53 to 0.47). Conversely, CRMs may improve symptom resolution at the point of longest follow-up as a dichotomous outcome when compared to vestibular suppressants (relative risk [RR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.78). Vestibular suppressants had an uncertain effect on symptom resolution within 24h (mean difference [MD] 5 points, 95% CI -16.92 to 26.94), repeat emergency department (ED)/clinic visits (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.15), patient satisfaction (MD 0 points, 95% CI -1.02 to 1.02), and quality of life (MD -1.2 points, 95% CI -2.96 to 0.56). Vestibular suppressants had an uncertain effect on adverse events.

Conclusions

In patients with BPPV, vestibular suppressants may have no effect on symptom resolution at the point of longest follow-up; however, there is evidence toward the superiority of CRM over these medications. Vestibular suppressants have an uncertain effect on symptom resolution within 24h, repeat ED/clinic visits, patient satisfaction, quality of life, and adverse events. These data suggest that a CRM, and not vestibular suppressants, should be the primary treatment for BPPV.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^692f0554]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for dizziness and vertigo, more specifically with respect to management of vestibular neuritis, SAEM 2023 guidelines recommend to consider ensuring shared decision-making with patients to weigh the risks and benefits of short-term corticosteroid treatment in adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of vestibular neuritis presenting within 3 days of symptom onset.

### Medical management of Ménière's disease [^90a64987]. The Laryngoscope (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Ménière's disease (MD) is poorly understood with respect to its etiology, pathophysiology, clinical course, and treatment. Furthermore, in the absence of controlled clinical studies, empiric treatments have been used with varying degrees of success. In this paper, the authors review the current medical management of MD.

Study Design

Literature review.

Results

Because of a dearth of well-controlled studies, the medical management of MD remains empirical and is largely restricted to lifestyle changes, pharmacotherapy, and office-based procedures. The development of transtympanic therapies represents a true therapeutic advance that has largely supplanted surgical intervention. A treatment algorithm for acute and chronic medical management is reviewed.

Conclusions

Despite absence of a complete understanding of MD, medical management or its natural history leads to control of vertigo in the majority of patients. Basic research is needed to understand its pathophysiology so that directed therapies can be developed and can be tested in well-controlled clinical trials.

### Vestibular suppressant utilization and subsequent falls among patients 65 Years and older with dizziness in the United States [^6f56d064]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Falls pose a significant public health threat to older adults. Due to potential fall risk, guidelines recommend against the routine prescription of several medications commonly used for vestibular suppression, including meclizine and benzodiazepines.

Aims

We aimed to determine the factors associated with vestibular suppressant utilization among patients with dizziness ≥ 65years of age and subsequent falls.

Methods and Results

A retrospective longitudinal database of US commercial insurance and Medicare beneficiaries was used to study medical claims data (January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2015). Of 190,348 individuals ≥ 65years old who presented with dizziness, 60,658 (32%) filled a vestibular suppressant prescription (27% anti-emetics, 73% anxiolytics), of which 20,448 were women (34%) within a month after their dizziness diagnosis. Of those individuals using suppressants, 8% experienced a fall resulting in a medical encounter within 60days of filling the prescription. After adjusting for sociodemographics and comorbidity, individuals with dizziness who received vestibular suppressants were more likely to experience recorded fall incidents (hazard ratio (HR) 3.33, confidence interval (CI) 1.93–5.72, p < 0.0001), than those who did not receive vestibular suppressants.

Conclusions

Although vestibular suppressants may provide immediate relief from symptoms during an acute vestibular crisis, use is incongruent with guideline-concordant care for most vestibular diagnoses and is also potentially counterproductive and injurious. Multi-faceted interventions that engage clinicians and patients are needed to improve the value of care for patients with vestibular disorders to de-implement the routine use of suppressants for dizziness.

Methods and Results

A retrospective longitudinal database of US commercial insurance and Medicare beneficiaries was used to study medical claims data (January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2015). Of 190,348 individuals ≥ 65 years old who presented with dizziness, 60,658 (32%) filled a vestibular suppressant prescription (27% anti‐emetics, 73% anxiolytics), of which 20,448 were women (34%) within a month after their dizziness diagnosis. Of those individuals using suppressants, 8% experienced a fall resulting in a medical encounter within 60 days of filling the prescription.

Conclusions

Although vestibular suppressants may provide immediate relief from symptoms during an acute vestibular crisis, use is incongruent with guideline‐concordant care for most vestibular diagnoses and is also potentially counterproductive and injurious. Multi‐faceted interventions that engage clinicians and patients are needed to improve the value of care for patients with vestibular disorders to de‐implement the routine use of suppressants for dizziness.

### Current validated medical treatments: pharmacologic interventions [^5cdd3c12]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The search for an effective medication that will eliminate tinnitus has a long history. Currently, no drugs exist that universally cure tinnitus. Pharmacologic interventions that have been investigated can be divided into those that attempt to eliminate the perception of tinnitus, and those that are designed to treat the negative comorbidities associated with tinnitus, thereby mitigating tinnitus' negative impact on quality of life. A third category of drugs can also be considered that addresses an identified pathologic condition that has tinnitus as an associated symptom (for example, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, migraine-associated vertigo). This third category is not addressed.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^ab81d69a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) guideline scope and outcomes — the guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV in any setting, targets patients aged ≥ 18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV, and identifies the primary outcome as resolution of BPPV symptoms; secondary outcomes include increased accurate diagnoses, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduced recurrence, reduced adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV, and other outcomes such as minimizing costs, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing health-related quality of life.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^e8734f5a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) management — repositioning maneuvers are emphasized with defined effectiveness and precautions: "medications are not used other than for relief of immediate distress", and most cases "can be corrected with bedside repositioning exercises that take only a few minutes to complete" with "high success rates (around 80%) with only 1–3 treatments". Maneuvers can be performed at the time of diagnostic testing or by health professionals, and patients can be taught supervised "self-repositioning". Brief distress during treatment can include vertigo, nausea, and disorientation, and "These symptoms can take a few hours or a few days to go away". While untreated BPPV "can go away within weeks", the text warns that "your unsteadiness can increase your risk for falling", states "You will need to take precautions not to fall", and notes "Seniors are encouraged to seek professional help quickly to help to resolve symptoms".

### Medications associated with dizziness or hypotension and adverse outcomes: an electronic health record study in older adults with dementia [^ed766b72]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Within individuals with dementia, polypharmacy and ADRs are frequent phenomena. Dizziness is a common medication side effect and has itself been linked to hospitalisations and falls. Findings from this cohort study suggest that the number of medications received with a side effect of dizziness or hypotension is associated with an incrementally increased risk of emergency hospitalisation across a range of common discharge diagnoses and not specifically fall-related hospitalisations. No consistent associations were found with mortality or subsequent cognitive decline. The findings highlight the complexity of dizziness as a side effect. Enhancing knowledge on the outcomes of medications with dizziness as a side effect may assist in minimising risk events particularly in people with dementia and patients who are more likely to receive polypharmacy. These findings provide empirical evidence and can be integrated into clinical decision-making tools such as Medichec to help identify individuals who might be at higher risks of ADRs. As mentioned in Methods, Medichec is an application that provides information on the adverse effects of medication. This can assist in reducing challenges of medication management in people with dementia. Further research is needed to detangle other medication properties, coprescribing profiles and adverse outcomes.

### Medications associated with dizziness or hypotension and adverse outcomes: an electronic health record study in older adults with dementia [^5b5ea65f]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Comorbidities and polypharmacy are common in people with dementia, leading to a higher risk of adverse outcomes. While the impact of anticholinergic properties has been extensively investigated, less is known about other cross-category properties of medications.

Objective

To investigate whether medications with dizziness or hypotension as a side effect are associated with adverse outcomes in older adults with dementia.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting and Participants

From a South London catchment, 15 210 patients diagnosed with dementia between 2008 and 2017.

Methods

Medications with dizziness and/or hypotension listed as a side effect were compiled and quantified in the cohort. Multivariable Cox regression models were run to determine the risk of mortality, all-cause emergency hospitalisation and hospitalisation due to falls. Generalised estimating equations were applied to investigate cognitive decline. The final model adjusted for 19 potential confounders, including physical and mental health measures.

Results

Of the patients, 82.2% were receiving at least one dizziness-associated medication and 71.2% at least one hypotension-associated medication. For each additional medication associated with dizziness or hypotension, there was a 4% increased risk of all-cause emergency hospitalisation. No associations were found with hospitalised falls specifically or with mortality or cognitive decline.

Conclusion

Medications that potentially cause dizziness or hypotension were associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation, although not specifically hospitalisation caused by falls. More systematic attention should be paid to coprescribing around the time of dementia diagnosis and the potential for rationalising this to minimise adverse drug events.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) executive summary [^b6581d79]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery featuring the "Clinical Practice Guideline: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (Update)". To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 14 recommendations developed emphasize diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing, and increasing the appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Vestibular migraine: a critical review of treatment trials [^2a563541]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Vestibular migraine (VM), also known as migraine-associated vertigo, is a common cause of dizziness in adults. We performed a comprehensive literature search regarding treatment for VM or migraine-associated vertigo during the period of 1990–2008 and used, individually or in combination, the search terms VM, migraine-associated vertigo, migraine-associated dizziness, migrainous vertigo, migraine and vertigo, migraine and disequilibrium, and headache and vertigo. We found nine publications that address treatment strategies for VM. One small randomized clinical trial found some benefit from the use of zolmitriptan for abortive treatment of VM. The other eight observational studies showed marginal improvement with migraine prophylactic medications such as nortriptyline, verapamil, or metoprolol. Until more specific treatment options become available, patients with VM need to be managed with similar prophylactic and abortive strategies as those used for migraine in adults.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^fdea0fd8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

There is a paucity of evidence about all of these interventions, despite some of them being in common use for Ménière's disease. All the evidence we found was of very low or low certainty, showing that we are unsure of the effects of the interventions, and future research may change the effect estimates a great deal.
We were unable to carry out many meta‐analyses. Although we identified 10 studies for inclusion, there were often differences in the actual outcomes assessed in the study, or the time points for follow‐up. Therefore, we were unable to pool the data to achieve a more precise estimate of any effect. Finally, study authors often used different ways of measuring the same outcome, which prevented data from being combined. For example, vertigo was assessed with either a global score, or a frequency score, which could not be combined, or hearing was assessed using a continuous scale or as an improvement above a certain threshold.
Certain outcomes were only assessed by some included studies. Many studies did not assess the impact of the disease on quality of life or tinnitus at all. Potential adverse effects of the interventions were also often poorly reported or simply not assessed.
We noted that unvalidated rating scales were commonly used in the studies included, particularly when looking at the global impact of treatments for vertigo. When such scales are used, it is difficult to know if they are accurately assessing the outcome, and also what size of change on this scale represents a meaningful difference in the outcome (the minimally important difference).
Finally, studies often failed to report clearly what treatments participants received before joining the trial, what maintenance treatment they continued on during the trial, and whether they received any additional treatments over the course of the trial. The impact of these additional treatments may be considerable, particularly for those studies with longer‐term follow‐up. Without knowing the background details of study participants (for example, the duration of their Ménière's disease, or what treatments they have tried in the past) it is difficult to identify the groups of people who may benefit from these treatments.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^b68c4541]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Ménière's disease (MD) symptomatic management of vertigo — clinicians should offer a limited course of vestibular suppressants for management of vertigo only during MD attacks; this recommendation is supported by nonrandomized or historically controlled studies (case-control and observational), with aggregate evidence quality Grade C and medium confidence; benefits are better symptom control and improved QOL, whereas risks and costs include side effects (urinary retention, dry mouth, visual changes, sedation, addiction) and impaired vestibular compensation; overall, the benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm, and value judgments note vertigo's detrimental impact on QOL and patient preference for symptom relief.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^b93248fa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Management of Ménière's disease — treatment goals and selection emphasize that the goals of MD treatment are to prevent or at least reduce the severity and frequency of vertigo attacks and to relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness and improve overall quality of life; notably, some vertigo control (up to 60%) has been documented in the placebo groups of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Some of the traditional treatment approaches for MD include dietary/lifestyle and/or trigger management approaches, medical, surgical, complementary/alternative, allergy, immunomodulatory, vestibular, and aural therapy, and oral or intratympanic (IT) medications — all with variable results. For those MD patients with persistent and disabling attacks after several months of conservative therapy, other more invasive or involved treatments can be considered, and treatment choice is guided by hearing status: in those patients with usable hearing, nonablative procedures have been advocated, whereas in those patients with no meaningful/useful hearing, surgical or chemical inner ear ablative treatments are implemented.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^15a3dbaf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Balance disorders can be difficult to diagnose and treat. There are few specific diagnostic tests, a variety of related disorders, and a limited number of interventions that are known to be effective. To determine which topics within this area should be addressed with new or updated systematic reviews, we conducted a scoping and prioritisation process, involving stakeholders. Vestibular migraine was ranked as one of the highest priority topics during this process (along with persistent postural‐perceptual dizziness and Ménière's disease).

The impact of vestibular migraine is considerable, with 40% of sufferers reporting sickness from work, and over 70% reporting the impact of their symptoms on daily activities as either moderate or severe (Neuhauser 2006). At present, there are no national or international guidelines to inform the management of this condition, therefore up‐to‐date, reliable evidence syntheses are required to help patients and healthcare professionals determine the benefits and harms of different interventions used for the condition.

### Vestibular suppressant utilization and subsequent falls among patients 65 Years and older with dizziness in the United States [^b02e51fe]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Both implementation and de‐implementation efforts are essential in managing care for patients with dizziness. Implementation efforts include achieving an accurate diagnosis and initiating the correct, etiologically based therapy to address the underlying disease, which is ultimately more patient‐centered than managing symptoms with vestibular suppressants. Although the AGS Beer's criteria underscore the risks of vestibular suppression among individuals over age 65, other interventions may also be effective. Since we observed that vestibular suppressants are associated with fall risk for individuals with dizziness, de‐implementation efforts are also warranted. De‐implementation focuses on reducing low‐value care, especially treatments that are harmful or lack evidence of effectiveness.

De‐implementation strategies may be most effective when employing multi‐component interventions that engage both clinicians and patients in reducing overuse. Clinicians may benefit from education, feedback, and clinical decision support. For instance, disseminating diagnosis‐based clinical practice guidelines, such as those for BPPV, has been shown to reduce inappropriate prescribing. Following the 2008 BPPV guideline publication, research by Dunlap et al. noted a drop in antivertigo or anti‐emetic prescriptions during adult ambulatory visits from 50% in 2007–2009 to 16% in 2013–2015. However, many patients initially presenting with dizziness receive non‐specific diagnoses, and no current guideline exists for managing acute vertigo, which leaves clinicians without a clear course of action. Offering alternatives to medication, like vestibular physical therapy, could be beneficial. In the US, the AGS has joined the Choosing Wisely campaign, advising against benzodiazepine use in older adults for insomnia, agitation, or delirium. However, attempts to implement this guidance through behavioral economics approaches in US clinics have highlighted the challenges of reducing low‐value medications in busy clinical settings. Comprehensive and nuanced efforts will be necessary to effectively address this issue.

### Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease [^5431048b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. A number of pharmacological interventions have been used in the management of this condition, including betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medications and corticosteroids. The underlying cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, as is the way in which these treatments may work. The efficacy of these different interventions at preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic pharmacological interventions versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable Ménière's disease comparing betahistine, diuretics, antihistamines, antivirals or systemic corticosteroids with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow-up of less than three months, or with a cross-over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease-specific health-related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 studies with a total of 848 participants. The studies evaluated the following interventions: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals and corticosteroids. We did not identify any evidence on antihistamines. Betahistine Seven RCTs (548 participants) addressed this comparison. However, we were unable to conduct any meta-analyses for our primary outcomes as not all outcomes were considered by every study, and studies that did report the same outcome used different time points for follow-up, or assessed the outcome using different methods. Therefore, we were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. Some data were available for each of our primary outcomes, but the evidence was low- or very low-certainty throughout. One study reported on the outcome 'improvement in vertigo' at 6 to ≤ 12 months, and another study reported this outcome at > 12 months. Four studies reported on the change in vertigo, but again all used different methods of assessment (vertigo frequency, or a global score of vertigo severity) or different time points. A single study reported on serious adverse events. Diuretics Two RCTs addressed this comparison. One considered the use of isosorbide (220 participants), and the other used a combination of amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide (80 participants). Again, we were unable to conduct any meta-analyses for our primary outcomes, as only one study reported on the outcome 'improvement in vertigo' (at 6 to ≤ 12 months), one study reported on change in vertigo (at 3 to < 6 months) and neither study assessed serious adverse events. Therefore, we were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. The evidence was all very low-certainty. Other pharmacological interventions We also identified one study that assessed antivirals (24 participants), and one study that assessed corticosteroids (16 participants). The evidence for these interventions was all very low-certainty. Again, serious adverse events were not considered by either study.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease is very uncertain. There are few RCTs that compare these interventions to placebo or no treatment, and the evidence that is currently available from these studies is of low or very low certainty. This means that we have very low confidence that the effects reported are accurate estimates of the true effect of these interventions. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta-analyses of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.

### Vertigo and motion sickness. part II: pharmacologic treatment [^1076b694]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Vertigo is a sensation of movement when no movement is actually occurring. It is often accompanied by visceral autonomic symptoms including pallor, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. Vertigo is similar to motion sickness in that both may be caused by vestibular stimulation that does not match an internal model of expected environmental stimuli. Indeed, a functioning vestibular system is necessary for the perception of motion sickness. For this reason, many of the same drugs are used to treat both conditions. The investigation of drugs that treat motion sickness helps to discover medications that may treat vertigo caused by disease of the vestibular system. In this article, we discuss the pharmacologic agents that are now available for the treatment of vertigo and those agents that are still under study.

### Dizziness: state of the science [^bf3d6274]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Dizziness is prevalent in all adult populations, causing considerable morbidity and utilization of health services. In the community, the prevalence of dizziness ranges from 1.8% in young adults to more than 30% in the elderly. In the primary care setting, dizziness increases in frequency as a presenting complaint; as many as 7% of elderly patients present with this symptom. Classification of dizziness by subtype (vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and other) assists in the differential diagnosis. Various disease entities may cause dizziness, and the reported frequency of specific diagnoses varies widely, depending on setting, patient age, and investigator bias. Life-threatening illnesses are rare in patients with dizziness, but many have serious functional impairment. Dizziness can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in elderly persons, in whom it often represents dysfunction in more than one body system. Given the relatively underdeveloped state of the empirical literature on dizziness, investigators would benefit from use of consistent criteria to describe dizziness symptoms and establish diagnoses. Investigation of the effects of testing and treatment should focus on diagnoses that are life threatening or lead to significant morbidity. In the elderly, a function-oriented approach should be studied and compared with current diagnosis-focused strategies. Alternative therapies for chronic and recurrent dizziness also merit investigation.

### Dizziness: evaluation and management [^4f91cf15]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is a common but often diagnostically difficult condition. Clinicians should focus on the timing of the events and triggers of dizziness to develop a differential diagnosis because it is difficult for patients to provide quality reports of their symptoms. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes peripheral and central causes. Peripheral etiologies can cause significant morbidity but are generally less concerning, whereas central etiologies are more urgent. The physical examination may include orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (for patients with triggered dizziness), and the HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination when indicated. Laboratory testing and imaging are usually not required but can be helpful. The treatment for dizziness is dependent on the etiology of the symptoms. Canalith repositioning procedures (e.g. Epley maneuver) are the most helpful in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation is helpful in treating many peripheral and central etiologies. Other etiologies of dizziness require specific treatment to address the cause. Pharmacologic intervention is limited because it often affects the ability of the central nervous system to compensate for dizziness.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^816c77b0]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Classification of evidence-based statements — principles and interpretation emphasize that guidelines aim to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, produce optimal health outcomes, and minimize harm, with statements reflecting both quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm. Guidelines are never intended to supersede professional judgment and may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinical discretion; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than for a recommendation, whereas options offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that best serves their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations, and guidelines represent the best judgment of a team addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^86a0846d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is the most common vestibular disorder in adults, with a lifetime prevalence of 2.4 percent. The guideline targets patients aged 18 years or older with a potential diagnosis of BPPV, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with BPPV.

Purpose

The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary tests such as radiographic imaging and vestibular testing, and to promote the use of effective repositioning maneuvers for treatment. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of audiology, chiropractic medicine, emergency medicine, family medicine, geriatric medicine, internal medicine, neurology, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, physical therapy, and physical medicine and rehabilitation.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The panel made recommendations against 1) radiographic imaging, vestibular testing, or both in patients diagnosed with BPPV, unless the diagnosis is uncertain or there are additional symptoms or signs unrelated to BPPV that warrant testing; and 2) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines or benzodiazepines. The panel made recommendations that 1) if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test is negative, clinicians should perform a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV; 2) clinicians should differentiate BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; 3) clinicians should question patients with BPPV for factors that modify management including impaired mobility or balance, CNS disorders, lack of home support, and increased risk for falling; 4) clinicians should treat patients with posterior canal BPPV with a particle repositioning maneuver (PRM); 5) clinicians should reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to confirm symptom resolution; 6) clinicians should evaluate patients with BPPV who are initial treatment failures for persistent BPPV or underlying peripheral vestibular or CNS disorders; and 7) clinicians should counsel patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may offer vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, for the initial treatment of BPPV and 2) clinicians may offer observation as initial management for patients with BPPV and with assurance of follow-up. The panel made no recommendation concerning audiometric testing in patients diagnosed with BPPV.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgement or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Vestibular suppressant utilization and subsequent falls among patients 65 Years and older with dizziness in the United States [^33b79a98]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the compelling findings, this study is not without limitations. The claims‐based nature of the research focused on dizziness and falls resulting in medical encounters, potentially selecting patients with more severe symptoms or injuries. E‐codes are frequently missing in claims data and reliance on E‐codes alone to indicate fall severity is insufficiently sensitive. While we employed an established method that captures injuries attributable to falls, we cannot definitively attribute all injuries to falls, potentially leading to an overestimation of fall prevalence. However, falls not captured in claims data may translate to an underestimation of falls. In order to maintain consistent billing and dizziness diagnoses codes throughout the course of this study we restricted the date range of the data from 2006 to 2015. However, we believe our results remain relevant for several reasons. The medications of focus — benzodiazepines and anti‐emetics — are still commonly prescribed, and their potential to contribute to falls among older adults remains a critical issue. Furthermore, risks associated with these medications, particularly in vulnerable populations, have not significantly changed. Additional limitations include unmeasured confounding, such as by prior falls, or by indication, as individuals who received medication may have had more severe dizziness, although use may reflect complex practice patterns that differ between clinicians. Our study concentrated on filled prescriptions of vestibular suppressants, and we could not ascertain medication adherence rates or over‐the‐counter use. We were also unable to capture the chronic use of suppressants prior to dizziness diagnosis. Although others have focused on polypharmacy rates, which would undoubtedly compound fall risk and outcomes depending on the mix of medications, future research should delve deeper into the pharmacological aspects that might influence fall risk among vestibular suppressant users.

### Vertigo and dizziness: understanding and managing fall risk [^96a1b066]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Vertigo and dizziness are common conditions among older adults. They are closely associated with fall risk and portend major implications for geriatric injury and disability. Management can be particularly challenging, because symptoms are often nonspecific and may reflect multiple etiologies. Chronic dizziness can reflect dysfunction in the vestibular, somatosensory, or visual systems or in their central integration. Systemic processes, such as postural hypotension, arrhythmias, heart failure, medication use, and lower extremity weakness or frailty, also contribute. Management of acute vestibular syndrome requires ruling out dangerous causes, such as stroke. This article reviews relevant definitions, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical management.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^f1caff38]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. These unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. A number of pharmacological interventions have been used or proposed to be used as prophylaxis for this condition, to help reduce the frequency of the attacks. These are predominantly based on treatments that are in use for headache migraine, with the belief that the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions is similar.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments used for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine comparing beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptics, antidepressants, diuretics, monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (or its receptor), botulinum toxin or hormonal modification with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with a cross-over design, unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease-specific health-related quality of life, 5) improvement in headache, 6) improvement in other migrainous symptoms and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: < 3 months, 3 to < 6 months, > 6 to 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included three studies with a total of 209 participants. One evaluated beta-blockers and the other two evaluated calcium channel blockers. We did not identify any evidence for the remaining interventions of interest. Beta-blockers versus placebo One study (including 130 participants, 61% female) evaluated the use of 95 mg metoprolol once daily for six months, compared to placebo. The proportion of people who reported improvement in vertigo was not assessed in this study. Some data were reported on the frequency of vertigo attacks at six months and the occurrence of serious adverse effects. However, this is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was low or very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. Calcium channel blockers versus no treatment Two studies, which included a total of 79 participants (72% female), assessed the use of 10 mg flunarizine once daily for three months, compared to no intervention. All of the evidence for this comparison was of very low certainty. Most of our outcomes were only reported by a single study, therefore we were unable to conduct any meta-analysis. Some data were reported on improvement in vertigo and change in vertigo, but no information was available regarding serious adverse events. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results, as these data come from single, small studies and the certainty of the evidence was very low.

Authors Conclusions

There is very limited evidence from placebo-controlled randomised trials regarding the efficacy and potential harms of pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine. We only identified evidence for two of our interventions of interest (beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers) and all evidence was of low or very low certainty. Further research is necessary to identify whether these treatments are effective at improving symptoms and whether there are any harms associated with their use.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^ea92652d]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Vestibular migraine is an underdiagnosed but increasingly recognized neurological condition that causes episodic vertigo associated with other features of migraine. It is now thought to be the most common cause of spontaneous (non-positional) episodic vertigo, affecting up to 1% of the population. A meta-analysis of preventative treatments for vestibular migraine was published in 2021, but the authors were unable to establish a preferred treatment strategy due to low quality of evidence and heterogeneity of study design and outcome reporting. Therefore, there remains a clinical need for pragmatic management guidelines specific to vestibular migraine using the available evidence. Here, we provide a practical review utilizing a systematic qualitative assessment of the evidence for abortive and preventative interventions in adults. The overall evidence base for vestibular migraine treatment is of low quality. Nevertheless, we provide practical treatment recommendations based on the available evidence and our experience to help guide clinicians treating patients with vestibular migraine. We also discuss how future clinical trials could be designed to improve the quality of evidence in this condition.

### Meclizine use and subsequent falls among patients with dizziness [^1bb4153a]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Among adults who present with dizziness, there is a critical need to identify and deimplement low-value and guideline-discordant care to mitigate the risk of falls over time. Meclizine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, is the most used antiemetic vestibular suppressant in the US.

Objective

To determine the factors associated with meclizine use and subsequent falls among patients aged 18 to 64 years and those aged 65 years or older with dizziness.

Design, Setting, and Population

This cohort study assessed US commercial and Medicare Advantage claims among 805 454 adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with new diagnoses of dizziness between 2006 and 2015. Data were analyzed from July 2024 to February 2025.

Exposure

Prescription of meclizine within 30 days of a new dizziness diagnosis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome measure was falls resulting in medical evaluation. Fall outcomes were attributed to meclizine use if they occurred within 60 days of a meclizine prescription. Associations of falls and meclizine with presentation setting, diagnoses, and sociodemographic characteristics were estimated with multivariable analyses.

Results

Of 805 454 individuals with dizziness (502 055 women [62%]; median age, 52 years [range, 18–87 years]), 8% received a meclizine prescription. Among those prescribed meclizine, 5792 (9% overall; 10% [2189/21 700] aged 18–64 years and 9% [3603/40 138] aged ≥ 65 years) experienced an injurious fall. When adjusting for sociodemographics and clinical factors, a filled meclizine prescription was associated with subsequent falls in those aged 18 to 64 years (hazard ratio, 2.94; 95% CI, 2.81–3.08) and those aged 65 years or older (hazard ratio, 2.54; 95% CI, 2.42–2.66).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that although meclizine may offer immediate vertigo relief, use is incongruent with guideline-concordant care for common vestibular diagnoses. Receipt of a meclizine prescription was associated with an increased risk of injurious falls among both patients aged 65 years or older and those aged 18 to 64 years with dizziness, who are already fall prone. Future prospective and mechanistic studies may further elucidate the relationship between vestibular suppressants and fall risk, and future guidelines that engage clinicians and patients to deimplement routine vestibular suppressant use for dizziness may be warranted.

### Acute adverse effects of therapeutic doses of psilocybin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^716aa949]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Dizziness

Although a recent meta-analysis focused on dose-dependent response did not report dizziness as an adverse effect of psilocybin, our analysis found it statistically significant. Two studies identified dizziness as an adverse effect. One study reported 6% dizziness with high-dose psilocybin, 1% with moderate dose and none with low dose. The other study reported 8% of participants with dizziness after administration of psilocybin. Both studies stated dizziness resolved between 24 and 48 hours. Neither study used any medication to treat dizziness, and both reported it was a nonserious adverse effect. None of the study protocols defined any medications to treat severe dizziness. Similar to their interventions with other adverse effects, the role a therapist has in managing dizziness (eg, asking patients to lie down, encouraging them to trust the experience) is also unknown. Some protocols state that a patient should lie down with eye coverings, and therefore such measures may be enough to decrease the severity of the dizziness and avoid requiring any medications.

These are predominantly based on treatments that are in use for headache migraine, with the belief that the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions is similar. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions used to relieve acute attacks of vestibular migraine.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine comparing triptans, ergot alkaloids, dopamine antagonists, antihistamines, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, gepants (CGRP receptor antagonists), magnesium, paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with either placebo or no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease-specific health-related quality of life, 5) improvement in headache, 6) improvement in other migrainous symptoms and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: < 2 hours, 2 to 12 hours, > 12 to 72 hours. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included two RCTs with a total of 133 participants, both of which compared the use of triptans to placebo for an acute attack of vestibular migraine. One study was a parallel-group RCT (of 114 participants, 75% female). This compared the use of 10 mg rizatriptan to placebo. The second study was a smaller, cross-over RCT (of 19 participants, 70% female). This compared the use of 2.5 mg zolmitriptan to placebo. Triptans may result in little or no difference in the proportion of people whose vertigo improves at up to two hours after taking the medication. However, the evidence was very uncertain (risk ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.07; 2 studies; based on 262 attacks of vestibular migraine treated in 124 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any evidence on the change in vertigo using a continuous scale. Only one of the studies assessed serious adverse events. No events were noted in either group, but as the sample size was small we cannot be sure if there are risks associated with taking triptans for this condition (0/75 receiving triptans, 0/39 receiving placebo; 1 study; 114 participants; very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for interventions used to treat acute attacks of vestibular migraine is very sparse. We identified only two studies, both of which assessed the use of triptans. We rated all the evidence as very low-certainty, meaning that we have little confidence in the effect estimates and cannot be sure if triptans have any effect on the symptoms of vestibular migraine. Although we identified sparse information on potential harms of treatment in this review, the use of triptans for other conditions (such as headache migraine) is known to be associated with some adverse effects. We did not identify any placebo-controlled randomised trials for other interventions that may be used for this condition. Further research is needed to identify whether any interventions help to improve the symptoms of vestibular migraine attacks and to determine if there are side effects associated with their use.

### Medications associated with dizziness or hypotension and adverse outcomes: an electronic health record study in older adults with dementia [^2c22ce97]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Older adults with dementia frequently have co-occurring health conditions accompanied by an increase in the number of prescribed medications. Polypharmacy increases the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). ADRs are common in people with dementia and result in unplanned hospitalisation, increased morbidity and mortality. They have been linked to financial pressures and admissions in England projected to result in an annual cost of £2.21 billion.

Dizziness is a commonly reported side effect of many medications received by people with dementia, including psychotropic agents such as antidepressants and antipsychotics and nonpsychotropics such as diuretics and treatments for Parkinson's disease. Medication-associated dizziness can contribute to an increased risk of adverse outcomes and is associated with other co-occurring risk factors such as a decrease in physical activity, heart disease, lower general health and polypharmacy. The experience of dizziness is an independent predictor of future falls in older adults.

When considering their role as risk and/or outcome factors in dementia, medications are most often classified and investigated according to their primary indication — e.g. psychotropics as a group or antidepressants or antipsychotics more specifically. However, this form of categorisation, does not consider the cross-category properties of medications. For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are primarily categorised as antidepressants but have been effective in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and migraines. An alternative approach for understanding the effect of medication is the drug-centred model; this focuses on the modification of normal brain processing and encompasses both beneficial and adverse effects.

Research into cross-category ADRs in dementia has included the measurement and investigation of the anticholinergic burden; e.g. finding no association with hospitalisation and a reduced mortality risk within antidepressant and antipsychotic categories, potentially reflecting selective prescribing, but a higher risk of mortality associated with a high central anticholinergic burden within drugs used for urinary incontinence. As well as the anticholinergic burden, recent work has also considered the use of medication with sedative properties in dementia, reporting an association with hospitalisation and accelerated cognitive decline. However, there are other ADRs such as dizziness and hypotension which have an assumed association with adverse outcomes that has not yet been fully investigated.

### Allergy, immunotherapy, and alternative treatments for dizziness [^10685720]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Allergic reactions may result in central symptoms of dizziness, including nonspecific chronic imbalance, Meniere's disease, and autoimmune inner ear disease. Excepting first-generation antihistamines, and short-term use of steroids, most pharmacotherapies used to treat allergic rhinitis have limited benefit in treating allergically induced or related dizziness. Allergy immunotherapy and/or an elimination diet for diagnosed food allergies have been found to be effective treatments. Individuals diagnosed with autoimmune inner ear disease remain challenging to treat and may require high-dose, long-term steroid treatment, biologics, or immunomodulators for symptom control.

### Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD): a common, characteristic and treatable cause of chronic dizziness [^bca98cfd]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a newly defined diagnostic syndrome that unifies key features of chronic subjective dizziness, phobic postural vertigo and related disorders. It describes a common chronic dysfunction of the vestibular system and brain that produces persistent dizziness, non-spinning vertigo and/or unsteadiness. The disorder constitutes a long-term maladaptation to a neuro-otological, medical or psychological event that triggered vestibular symptoms, and is usefully considered within the spectrum of other functional neurological disorders. While diagnostic tests and conventional imaging usually remain negative, patients with PPPD present in a characteristic way that maps on to positive diagnostic criteria. Patients often develop secondary functional gait disorder, anxiety, avoidance behaviour and severe disability. Once recognised, PPPD can be managed with effective communication and tailored treatment strategies, including specialised physical therapy (vestibular rehabilitation), serotonergic medications and cognitive-behavioural therapy.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) [^1812ef34]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and management

At least two review authors (TK, LS) independently extracted outcome data from each study using a standardised data collection form. Any discrepancies in the data extracted by the two authors were checked against the original reports, and differences were resolved through discussion and consensus, with recourse to a third author (KW) where necessary.

We included key characteristics of the studies, including the following information:

study design, duration of the study, number of study centres and location, study setting and dates of the study;
information on the participants, including the number randomised, those lost to follow‐up or withdrawn, the number analysed, the age of participants, gender, diagnostic criteria used, inclusion and exclusion criteria for the individual studies;
details of the intervention, comparator, and concomitant treatments or excluded medications;
the outcomes specified and reported by the study authors, including the time points;
funding for the study and any conflicts of interest for the study authors;
information required to assess the risk of bias in the study, and to enable GRADE assessment of the evidence.

Once the extracted data were checked and any discrepancies had been resolved, a single author (KW) transferred the information to Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2020).

The primary effect of interest for this review is the effect of treatment assignment (which reflects the outcomes of treatment for people who were assigned to the intervention) rather than a per protocol analysis (the outcomes of treatment only for those who completed the full course of treatment as planned). For the outcomes of interest in this review, we extracted the findings from the studies on an available case basis, i.e. all available data from all participants at each time point, based on the treatment to which they were randomised. This was irrespective of compliance, or whether participants had received the intervention as planned.

In addition to extracting pre‐specified information about study characteristics and aspects of methodology relevant to risk of bias, we extracted the following summary statistics for each trial and outcome:

### Health care utilization, prognosis and outcomes of vestibular disease in primary care settings: systematic review [^e47c3570]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Vertigo and dizziness are frequent complaints in primary care that lead to extensive health care utilization. The objective of this systematic review was to examine health care of patients with vertigo and dizziness in primary care settings. Specifically, we wanted to characterize health care utilization, therapeutic and referral behaviour and to examine the outcomes associated with this. A search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was carried out in May 2015 using the search terms 'vertigo' or 'dizziness' or 'vestibular and primary care' to identify suitable studies. We included all studies that were published in the last 10 years in English with the primary diagnoses of vertigo, dizziness and/or vestibular disease. We excluded drug evaluation studies and reports of adverse drug reactions. Data were extracted and appraised by two independent reviewers; 16 studies with a total of 2828 patients were included. Mean age of patients ranged from 45 to 79 with five studies in older adults aged 65 or older. There were considerable variations in diagnostic criteria, referral and therapy while the included studies failed to show significant improvement of patient-reported outcomes. Studies are needed to investigate current practice of care across countries and health systems in a systematic way and to test primary care-based education and training interventions that improve outcomes.

### Treatment of vestibular migraine: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3a5b1fa7]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of the various therapies used for the prevention of vestibular migraine (VM).

Methods

Primary studies were identified though PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library by two independent investigators for articles published through April 2019. The search identified randomized comparison or observational studies pertaining to vestibular migraine treatment. Meta-analysis was performed on pre- and posttreatment Dizziness Handicap Inventory, vertigo frequency, and percentage of perceived improvement.

Results

Literature search identified 13 studies that reported sufficient outcome measures to be included in the analysis. Patients with VM had a mean age of 43.3years with female-to-male gender ratio of 2.1:1. Classes of therapeutic agents included antiepileptic drugs, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, β-blockers, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and vestibular rehabilitation. All treatment options that were analyzed demonstrated improvement in all of the outcome parameters, but due to significant heterogeneity and lack of standardized reporting on outcomes, establishment of preferred treatment modality could not be determined.

Conclusions

Various treatment modalities have been evaluated for preventative treatment of VM. Physician familiarity, patient comorbidities, and the side-effect profiles of various interventions likely influence the selection of intervention. Future randomized controlled trials with restrictive inclusion criteria and generalizable standardized outcome measures will allow for more robust meta-analyses and for more evidence-based treatment of vestibular migraines.

Parallel work has taken place at SLaM to develop a means of ascertaining and quantifying medications with recognised ADRs in order to assist with clinical evaluation and intervention in polypharmacy and prescribing for vulnerable populations. This underpinned the development of the Medichec site and app — first developed for central anticholinergic properties, subsequently supplemented with drowsiness/sedation and dizziness/hypotension and more recently extended with four other ADRs. The same medication categorisation was deployed within CRIS and the extracted cohort was characterised by the recorded use of medications with dizziness or hypotension properties as a side effect, compiled from information in the British National Formulary. Recorded use of medications was ascertained in the cohort from 6 months prior to 6 months after the index dementia diagnosis date as a proxy for prevalent prescribing at dementia diagnosis. The number of recorded medications with dizziness as a side effect was modelled as a continuous variable and further categorised into an ordinal scale (0, 1, 2, 3–4, 5–6, 7+) representing the primary exposure of interest. The same grouping was used for medication causing hypotension. We had initially planned to examine associations by frequency of dizziness or hypotension according to the BNF, but of patients on at least one medication causing dizziness the vast majority (98.5%) were on a medication with dizziness as a common side effect. Similarly, of patients on at least one medication causing hypotension 73.5% were on at least one medication with hypotension as a common side effect.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^42a27032]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Balance disorders can be difficult to diagnose and treat. There are few specific diagnostic tests, a variety of related disorders and a limited number of interventions that are known to be effective. To determine which topics within this area should be addressed with new or updated systematic reviews, we conducted a scoping and prioritisation process, involving stakeholders. Vestibular migraine was ranked as one of the highest priority topics during this process (along with persistent postural‐perceptual dizziness and Ménière's disease).

The impact of vestibular migraine is considerable, with 40% of sufferers reporting sickness from work, and over 70% reporting the impact of their symptoms on daily activities as either moderate or severe (Neuhauser 2006). At present, there are no national or international guidelines to inform the management of this condition, therefore up‐to‐date, reliable evidence syntheses are required to help patients and healthcare professionals determine the benefits and harms of different interventions used for the condition.

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^14bb66e7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. The unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. A number of pharmacological interventions have been used, or proposed to be used, at the time of a vestibular migraine attack to help reduce the severity or resolve the symptoms. These are predominantly based on treatments that are in use for headache migraine, with the belief that the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions is similar.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions used to relieve acute attacks of vestibular migraine.

Search methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine comparing triptans, ergot alkaloids, dopamine antagonists, antihistamines, 5‐HT3 receptor antagonists, gepants (CGRP receptor antagonists), magnesium, paracetamol or non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with either placebo or no treatment.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome ‐ improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease‐specific health‐related quality of life, 5) improvement in headache, 6) improvement in other migrainous symptoms and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: < 2 hours, 2 to 12 hours, > 12 to 72 hours. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included two RCTs with a total of 133 participants, both of which compared the use of triptans to placebo for an acute attack of vestibular migraine. One study was a parallel‐group RCT (of 114 participants, 75% female). This compared the use of 10 mg rizatriptan to placebo. The second study was a smaller, cross‐over RCT (of 19 participants, 70% female). This compared the use of 2.5 mg zolmitriptan to placebo.

Triptans may result in little or no difference in the proportion of people whose vertigo improves at up to two hours after taking the medication. However, the evidence was very uncertain (risk ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.07; 2 studies; based on 262 attacks of vestibular migraine treated in 124 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We did not identify any evidence on the change in vertigo using a continuous scale. Only one of the studies assessed serious adverse events. No events were noted in either group, but as the sample size was small we cannot be sure if there are risks associated with taking triptans for this condition (0/75 receiving triptans, 0/39 receiving placebo; 1 study; 114 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

The evidence for interventions used to treat acute attacks of vestibular migraine is very sparse. We identified only two studies, both of which assessed the use of triptans. We rated all the evidence as very low‐certainty, meaning that we have little confidence in the effect estimates and cannot be sure if triptans have any effect on the symptoms of vestibular migraine. Although we identified sparse information on potential harms of treatment in this review, the use of triptans for other conditions (such as headache migraine) is known to be associated with some adverse effects.

We did not identify any placebo‐controlled randomised trials for other interventions that may be used for this condition. Further research is needed to identify whether any interventions help to improve the symptoms of vestibular migraine attacks and to determine if there are side effects associated with their use.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^2cdea7dd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Vestibular suppressants for acute vertigo in Ménière's disease — central vestibular suppressants (first-generation antihistamines, benzodiazepines, and anticholinergics) are used for acute vertigo attacks but should be used only to suppress acute vertiginous events; chronic use is undesirable because it can suppress central adaptation/compensation and perpetuate symptoms of chronic imbalance, and there is a paucity of peer-reviewed evidence with insufficient evidence demonstrating the relative efficacy of any given class over another. Benzodiazepines are gamma aminobutyric acid receptor agonists effective at suppressing vertigo and mitigating nausea, yet there is no evidence for the superiority of one benzodiazepine over another or over first-generation antihistamines, and all benzodiazepines carry significant risk for drug dependence. Centrally acting anticholinergic drugs (scopolamine and atropine) and glycopyrrolate can suppress acute attacks, with scopolamine most commonly used in a transdermal formulation created primarily to prevent motion sickness, but anticholinergics can cause blurring of vision, dry mouth, dilated pupils, urinary retention, and sedation, and because of toxicity and withdrawal when used for more than several days they are not commonly prescribed for acute vertigo control associated with MD.

### Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: a practical approach for emergency physicians [^10d60616]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a very common condition in the population and an important cause of acute vertigo or dizziness in patients presenting to an emergency department (ED). Despite this, abundant evidence shows that current ED management of patients with BPPV is suboptimal. Common ED management processes include brain imaging and treatment with vestibular suppressant medications such as meclizine, neither of which is recommended by current guidelines. The most efficient management of BPPV is to perform a bedside test (Dix-Hallpike test) and then to treat the patients with a bedside positional (the Epley) maneuver. In this practical review we emphasize the efficient management for the most common form of BPPV-posterior canal BPPV. Using this management will reduce resource utilization (laboratory testing, brain imaging, specialist consultation), reduce ED length of stay, and reduce use of ineffective mediations that have side effects but little therapeutic effect. Application of these practices would improve important patient-centered outcomes such as symptom reduction, radiation exposure, side effects from medications, and less need for urgent follow-up with another health care provider. The article also discusses the approach to patients in whom the Dix-Hallpike and/or Epley maneuvers do not seem to work. This includes a discussion the second most common variant of BPPV (horizontal canal BPPV) and criteria for safe discharge of patients. Another important advantage of learning BPPV best practices is that it is enormously satisfying for the clinician, not unlike treating a child with a nursemaid's elbow.

### The use of fall risk increasing drugs (FRIDs) in patients with dizziness presenting to a neurotology clinic [^9e056100]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the use of fall risk increasing drugs (FRIDs) in patients with dizziness who presented to a Neurotology academic practice and to evaluate for predictors of FRID use in this population.

Patients

A total of 292 subjects presented with dizziness between July 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013.

Intervention

Demographic information and FRID use were recorded.

Main Outcome Measure

The prevalence and type of FRIDs (psychotropics, antihypertensives, and/or narcotics) used among participants.

Results

The overall prevalence of any FRID use was 40.8%. Thirty-nine percent of patients were on psychotropic medications, 37% on antihypertensives, and 8.2% on narcotics. The proportion of patients on two or more FRIDs at presentation was 34%. When categorizing by age group, 40% of patients aged 50 years or greater versus 24% of younger patients (p = 0.004) were on two or more FRIDs. With every decade increase in age, the odds of being on two or more FRIDs increased by 7%.

Conclusions

Forty percent of all patients presenting to a Neurotology Clinic for dizziness were on a FRID. Older patients were significantly more likely to be on multiple FRIDs, specifically antihypertensives and narcotic medications. These findings suggest that to fully assess and treat older patients with dizziness, the use of these medications should be evaluated.

### Medications associated with dizziness or hypotension and adverse outcomes: an electronic health record study in older adults with dementia [^1df174aa]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study investigated the use of medications with dizziness or hypotension as a side effect in a cohort of 15 210 older adults with a diagnosis of dementia and the extent to which this was associated with subsequent adverse outcomes of hospitalisation, hospitalised falls, mortality and cognitive decline.

Cumulative numbers of medications received with dizziness or hypotension as a side effect were associated with an incremental 4% increased risk of emergency hospitalisation. At the upper end of the exposure distribution, patients receiving seven or more medications causing dizziness were found to have a 38% increased risk of emergency hospitalisation (compared to those receiving none) and those with seven or more medications causing hypotension had a 58% increased risk of emergency hospitalisation. While these findings align with previous research that has linked dizziness to hospitalisation and polypharmacy to a higher risk of hospitalisation, we believe that this study is the first to report a direct association between polypharmacy specifically of dizziness-associated medications and an increased risk of emergency hospitalisation.

Within older adult populations, polypharmacy has been found to be associated with falls and dizziness has been identified to be an independent predictor of future falls. Unexpectedly, in our study no associations were found between medication exposure and hospitalised falls. However, another retrospective investigation of emergency department admission in older adults identified 64 different discharge diagnoses linked to the symptom of dizziness. Therefore, it is reasonable to anticipate that dizziness may influence the risk of hospitalisation for a variety of reason. In support of this, our supplementary analyses indicated nonspecific associations between a unit increase of medication causing dizziness or hypotension and seven different causes of hospitalisation, although circulatory diseases were the most common.

As a symptom, dizziness is complicated, and medications causing dizziness may be one of multiple factors contributing to an outcome of falls. Multiple intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors for falls in people with dementia have been identified. Associations may vary by community or institutional residence and dementia is itself associated with increased risk of falls, particularly vascular dementia, mixed dementia and dementia in other diseases in comparison to Alzheimer's disease. Specific associations of medication use with hospitalised falls might be obscured by both the range of other factors contributing to that outcome and the range of outcomes associated with dizziness. Furthermore, although the current study adjusted for a range of covariates, residual confounding cannot be ruled out entirely and adverse outcomes might be potentially obscured by differential prescribing (medications less likely to be initiated in people judged to be at risk).

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^7cbfe659]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — burden, prevalence, and care patterns include high direct and indirect costs and substantial functional impact: It is estimated that it costs approximately $2000 to arrive at the diagnosis of BPPV and that > 65% of patients will undergo potentially unnecessary testing or interventions, with health care costs associated with the diagnosis alone approaching $2 billion per year. The natural history includes a spontaneous resolution rate ranging from 27% to 50%, yet almost 86% of patients have interrupted daily activities and lost work days; 68% reduce workload, 4% change jobs, and 8% quit jobs. In older adults, 9% of elderly patients undergoing comprehensive geriatric assessment for nonbalance-related complaints have unrecognized BPPV, and BPPV is present in 40% of geriatric patients seen for dizziness, with an overall general prevalence of 3.4% in individuals aged ≤ 60. Among an estimated 7.0 million elderly individuals reporting dizziness in the prior 12 months, 2.0 million (30.1%) reported vertigo, with 230,000 office visits among the elderly with a diagnosis of BPPV. Care is often delayed and inefficient: patients experience delays on the order of months, only 10% to 20% presenting to a physician receive appropriate repositioning maneuvers, and many undergo testing or medications, including 70% magnetic resonance imaging, 45% computed tomography, 41% electrocardiogram, and 53% medication treatment.

### Serotonin reuptake inhibitors for dizziness with psychiatric symptoms… [^79090828]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Medications taken by study patients before their referral to us provided only limited or inconsistent relief from dizziness and psychiatric symptoms. Migraine prophylactic agents included β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and divalproex sodium. Tricyclic antidepressants are listed separately. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Despite these advantages, there were several concerns about prescribing SSRIs for patients with dizziness. Nausea is one of the most common adverse effects of all 5 SSRIs. It occurs at least transiently in about 20% of patients and is a leading cause of medication discontinuation. Dizziness is reported in up to 8% of patients taking an SSRI. 14 Other adverse effects, such as physical fatigue and mental sluggishness, might mimic symptoms that accompany chronic dizziness.

All patients in this study underwent a thorough neurotologic examination as well as balance function tests and neuroimaging, if clinically indicated. Five patients were taking an SSRI at the time of referral. The dosage of their medication was adjusted to the optimal clinical benefit. The dosages of all other psychotropic medications were tapered gradually. The use of vestibular suppressants and other otologic agents was minimized for patients with active neurotologic conditions and discontinued for all others. No other treatments were used during the first 20 weeks of SSRI therapy. The dosages of all other psychotropic medications were tapered in each case in which the patient responded to treatment with an SSRI, with the exception of 5 cases involving individuals with severe anxiety disorders who responded best when a benzodiazepine was used in conjunction with an SSRI.

Patients without active neurotologic conditions successfully discontinued all otologic therapy. Patients with histories of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and vestibular neuronitis were treated with SSRIs alone, while those with Meniere disease, autoimmune ear disease, and migraine headaches were maintained on a regimen of medications typically used for those disorders. At least 1 medication for dizziness was prescribed to 56 of the 60 patients before they were referred to us. Fifty of the 60 patients had taken meclizine hydrochloride and/or benzodiazepines. Three patients, all with active vestibular illnesses, reported that meclizine temporarily reduced their symptoms during periods of acute vertigo.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^2fe2c2a6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Balance disorders can be difficult to diagnose and treat. There are few specific diagnostic tests, a variety of related disorders with similar symptoms, and a limited number of interventions that are known to be effective. To determine which topics within this area should be addressed with new or updated systematic reviews we conducted a scoping and prioritisation process, involving stakeholders. Ménière's disease was ranked as one of the highest priority topics during this process (along with vestibular migraine and persistent postural perceptual dizziness).

Although Ménière's disease is a relatively uncommon condition, the significant impact it has on quality of life demonstrates the clear importance of identifying effective interventions to alleviate the symptoms. There is considerable variation in the management of Ménière's disease on both a national and international scale, with a lack of consensus about appropriate first‐line and subsequent therapies.

This review is part of a suite of six that consider different interventions for Ménière's disease. Through these reviews, we hope to provide a thorough summary of the efficacy (benefits and harms) of the different treatment options, to support people with Ménière's disease (and healthcare professionals) when making decisions about their care.

### Dizziness: approach to evaluation and management [^7114b900]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common yet imprecise symptom. It was traditionally divided into four categories based on the patient's history: vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and light-headedness. However, the distinction between these symptoms is of limited clinical usefulness. Patients have difficulty describing the quality of their symptoms but can more consistently identify the timing and triggers. Episodic vertigo triggered by head motion may be due to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vertigo with unilateral hearing loss suggests Meniere disease. Episodic vertigo not associated with any trigger may be a symptom of vestibular neuritis. Evaluation focuses on determining whether the etiology is peripheral or central. Peripheral etiologies are usually benign. Central etiologies often require urgent treatment. The HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination can help distinguish peripheral from central etiologies. The physical examination includes orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, and the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Laboratory testing and imaging are not required and are usually not helpful. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can be treated with a canalith repositioning procedure (e.g. Epley maneuver). Treatment of Meniere disease includes salt restriction and diuretics. Symptoms of vestibular neuritis are relieved with vestibular suppressant medications and vestibular rehabilitation.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^e386232c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — comparative effectiveness of medications versus repositioning maneuvers: There is no evidence in the literature to suggest that any of these vestibular suppressant medications are effective as a definitive, primary treatment for BPPV or effective as a substitute for repositioning maneuvers. In 1 double-blind controlled trial comparing diazepam, lorazepam, and placebo, all groups showed a gradual decline in symptoms with no additional relief in the drug treatment arms. A small study compared particle repositioning maneuvers to a medication-alone treatment arm and found that particle repositioning maneuvers had substantially higher treatment response rates (78.6%-93.3% improvement) compared with medication alone (30.8% improvement) at 2-week follow-up. Similar findings were noted when comparing canal repositioning maneuvers to betahistine where patients randomized to canal repositioning maneuvers had faster physical and mental recovery than their pharmacologic counterparts. A more recent study showed that patients who underwent the Epley maneuver alone recovered faster than those who underwent the Epley maneuver and concurrently received a labyrinthine sedative, and the addition of an antihistamine to canal repositioning maneuvers demonstrated no change in the Dizziness Handicap Inventory score.

### Management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: a randomized controlled trial [^7d58cfeb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common presenting problem.

Objective

Our aim was to compare the efficacy of vestibular rehabilitation (maneuver) vs. conventional therapy (medications) in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with BPPV.

Methods

This was a prospective, single-blinded physician, randomized pilot study comparing two groups of patients who presented to the ED with a diagnosis of BPPV at a Level 1 trauma center with an annual census of approximately 75,000. The first group received standard medications and the second group received a canalith repositioning maneuver. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory was used to measure symptom resolution.

Results

Twenty-six patients were randomized; 11 to the standard treatment arm and 15 to the interventional arm. Mean age ± standard deviation of subjects randomized to receive maneuver and medication were 59 ± 12.6 years and 64 ± 11.2 years, respectively. There was no significant difference in mean ages between the two treatment arms (p = 0.310). Two hours after treatment, the symptoms between the groups showed no difference in measures of nausea (p = 0.548) or dizziness (p = 0.659). Both groups reported a high level of satisfaction, measured on a 0–10 scale. Satisfaction in subjects randomized to receive maneuver and medication was 9 ± 1.5 and 9 ± 1.0, respectively; there was no significant difference in satisfaction between the two arms (p = 0.889). Length of stay during the ED visit did not differ between the treatment groups (p = 0.873). None of the patients returned to an ED for similar symptoms.

Conclusions

This pilot study shows promise, and would suggest that there is no difference in symptomatic resolution, ED length of stay, or patient satisfaction between standard medical care and canalith repositioning maneuver. Physicians should consider the canalith repositioning maneuver as a treatment option.

### Antidepressants and dizziness [^2b03593f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Despite several evidences supporting a close relationship between dizziness and anxiety symptoms, the role of antidepressants in the treatment of such conditions remains poorly explored. The high prevalence of dizziness during serotonin reuptake inhibitors discontinuation syndrome and the few reports suggesting efficacy of antidepressants in treating some vestibular disorders justify a careful investigation. Neurophysiologic studies suggest possible focus of investigation on mechanisms of drug action. Psychophysiologic studies also suggest a possible role of antidepressant drugs in improving balance control and cognitive functioning. Controlled studies involving antidepressants with selective action in different neurotransmitters systems are necessary to elucidate the complex pathophysiologic mechanisms involving emotional and balance control. For future researches, special attention must be paid to the methodology of balance evaluation and the interaction between posture control and cognitive functioning.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^7c517a7d]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

My patient has VM — what should I do?

The evidence from studies included in this review is of almost universally low quality, making interpretation complex; however, this does not necessarily imply lack of treatment effect. Treatment recommendations (Box 1) summarize the available evidence both in terms of efficacy but also side-effect profile. It seems prudent to highlight that, as for any condition, one should not treat 'vestibular migraine' but rather the patient, and thus an individualized approach may be necessary, considering both the clinical and demographic features, but also psychological variables that commonly coexist in this (and any other) chronic disorder. The sometimes violent and almost always disconcerting and incapacitating loss of control that is associated with unpredictable vertiginous attacks renders this latter point of particular importance. Such an individualized treatment approach that nevertheless utilizes available evidence to fit the particular person can maximize patient acceptance of treatment as well as the chance of a positive response. Examples of real-life scenarios are given in Box 2 and Box 3.

Box 1
Treatment options for management of vestibular migraine based on efficacy and side-effect profile data

All patients

Abortive treatment — use less than 10 days per month

Simple analgesics/NSAIDs/triptans for headache
Vestibular sedatives (cyclizine, prochlorperazine, cinnarizine) for vertigo
Consider prochlorperazine, cyclizine, cinnarizine, or domperidone for nausea

Preventative treatment — best efficacy evidence and lower rates of serious unwanted effects

Tricyclics (amitriptyline, nortriptyline) — consider if comorbid pain or insomnia.

Start 10 mg at night and titrate up in 10 mg increments every 1–2 weeks. Usual dose range 10–150 mg at night. Lower doses are often effective for VM symptoms; higher doses (≥ 75 mg) may benefit patients with anxiety/depression, although in our experience patients with VM rarely tolerate this much.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Prescribing cascade awareness and mitigation highlights that healthcare providers should be aware of the issue of "prescribing cascade", defined as a sequence beginning when an adverse event is misinterpreted as a new condition and a subsequent drug is prescribed to treat this adverse event; before prescribing new medications to address newly reported symptoms, it is important to first assess if the symptoms represent a side effect from an existing medication. An example is peripheral edema because of calcium channel blocker managed by initiation of a diuretic, which can lead to additional adverse reactions such as hypokalemia and dizziness.

### Advances in diagnosis and treatment of vestibular migraine and the vestibular disorders it mimics [^bcac6421]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is one of the most common chief complaints in both the ambulatory care setting and the emergency department. These symptoms may be representative of a broad range of entities. Therefore, any attempt at treatment must first start with determining the etiology. In this current perspective, we focus specifically on the diagnosis of and treatment of vestibular migraine, which is common and overlaps clinically with a variety of other diagnoses. We discuss the traditional treatments for vestibular migraine in addition to the recent explosion of novel migraine therapeutics. Because vestibular migraine can mimic, or co-exist with, a variety of other vestibular diseases, we discuss several of these disorders including persistent postural-perceptual dizziness, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, post-concussive syndrome, Ménière's disease, and cerebrovascular etiologies. We discuss the diagnosis of each, as well as overlapping and distinguishing clinical features of which the reader should be aware. Finally, we conclude with evidence based as well as expert commentary on management, with a particular emphasis on vestibular migraine.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^be39c575]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) implementation and patient counseling — barriers noted include that many clinicians are likely to be unfamiliar with the CRP or other treatment maneuvers and that diagnosing physicians may be unable or unwilling to take additional time to treat BPPV at the same office visit as diagnosis. Access may improve because increasing familiarity with CRP or additional training of clinicians such as audiologists, physical therapists, and other providers may facilitate patients' access to CRP, and training courses on performance of the CRP offered at clinical education meetings will also help overcome this barrier. Patients may seek simpler solutions such as medication therapy for BPPV, but medication therapy has not been shown effective in the treatment of BPPV and clinicians will need to educate patients that these medications offer more harm than benefit; additional education with handouts or brochures describing risks including risks for falls, recurrence of BPPV, and treatment options, plus algorithms for fall assessment and home safety assessment, will allow clinicians to stratify patients about these risks.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^8b16d69a]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abortive treatment

There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific pharmacological therapy for the termination of acute vertigo attacks in VM. Neuromodulation (eTNS and VNS) may be of benefit in some patients but requires further confirmation in placebo-controlled studies. The use of so-called 'vestibular sedatives' (e.g. prochlorperazine, cyclizine, cinnarizine) is widespread across dizziness syndromes and may be of benefit in patients with VM with coexistent motion sickness or nausea, although there is no specific evidence for these agents in VM. It is important to avoid taking these medications more than 10 days per month, because regular use can cause patients to become sensitized to their effects and there is also a risk of withdrawal. Similarly, it is important to avoid taking analgesics or triptans more than 10 days per month due to the risk of analgesic-overuse headache.

Preventative treatment

No one pharmacological therapy has been shown to be clearly superior to another for VM prophylaxis. All before-and-after studies demonstrated clinical improvement, with no serious and usually low rates of adverse effects reported. Where studies involved multiple treatment arms, there was no clear superiority of one agent over another. The American Headache Society recommends starting preventative medication in patients with at least three to six (depending on severity) migraine headaches per month, and while no such recommendations exist for VM, given the relative lack of abortive treatment options, a lower threshold may be applied, in discussion with the patient. In general, medications should be started at a low dose and slowly titrated up to response: this principle was demonstrated in the study of topiramate where higher-dose treatment with was associated with increased side effects and medication discontinuation. In patients who fail a medication, we typically treat with one drug at a time to minimize adverse effects, although some authors have advocated using polytherapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^f3c96ecc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — vestibular suppressants recommendation and limited role: Policy level: Recommendation against and Differences of opinion: None. In summary, vestibular suppressant medications are not routinely recommended for treatment of BPPV, other than for the short-term management of autonomic symptoms, such as nausea or vomiting, in a severely symptomatic patient. A general lack of isolated benefit from vestibular suppressants and inferiority to particle repositioning maneuvers indicates that clinicians should not routinely substitute pharmacologic treatment of symptoms associated with BPPV in lieu of other, more effective treatment modalities. Examples of potential short-term uses include patients who are severely symptomatic yet refuse therapy or patients who become severely symptomatic after a CRP, and antiemetics may also be considered for prophylaxis for patients who have previously manifested severe nausea and/or vomiting with the Dix-Hallpike maneuvers and in whom a CRP is planned.

Improvement in vertigo Measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self‐report, or according to a change of a specified score (as described by the study authors) on a vertigo rating scale.
Change in vertigo Measured as a continuous outcome, to identify the extent of change in vertigo symptoms.
Serious adverse events Including any event that caused death, was life‐threatening, required hospitalisation, resulted in disability or permanent damage, or in congenital abnormality. Measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event during the follow‐up period.

Vertigo symptoms comprise a variety of different features, including frequency of episodes, duration of episodes and severity/intensity of the episodes. Where possible, we included data for the vertigo outcomes that encompassed all of these three aspects (frequency, duration and severity/intensity of symptoms). However, we anticipated that these data may not be available from all studies. If they were unavailable, then we extracted data on the frequency of vertigo episodes as an alternative measure for these outcomes.

### Vestibular suppressant utilization and subsequent falls among patients 65 Years and older with dizziness in the United States [^85cc2134]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Most falls result from an interaction between individual characteristics, such as higher comorbidity, that increases an individual's propensity to fall, and acute mediating risk factors that provide the opportunity to fall. Increased fall risk has previously been reported among community‐dwelling older women compared to men. Dizziness is a well‐documented risk factor for self‐reported falls and falls with injury. Adults aged 60 years or older who fall because of dizziness or loss of balance were observed to be more than twice as likely to be hospitalized than if the fall occurred after slipping or tripping. Others have also found that patient factors including acute and chronic illnesses, abnormalities of gait or balance, and medications can increase the risk of falls and hip fractures in older adults, especially in tertiary care academic medical centers, within 30 days after admission. Our findings in this study illustrate an additional longer‐term association between the use of vestibular suppressants and subsequent falls after either outpatient or emergency department dizziness presentations. Although the medications are typically intended to alleviate symptoms and patient suffering, individuals who received vestibular suppressants were 3–4 times more likely to experience recorded fall incidents in comparison to their counterparts who did not receive such medications. Consistent with observations in general populations, factors such as higher comorbidity scores, age of 74 years or older, female sex, and white race were also identified as contributing to an elevated risk of falls in our cohort.

### Vestibular suppressant utilization and subsequent falls among patients 65 Years and older with dizziness in the United States [^f6b7ee53]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of established guidelines like the AGS Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication (PIM) Use in Older Adults, which have been widely approved by clinicians, educators, researchers, healthcare administrators, and regulators, the use of vestibular suppressants remains prevalent by healthcare providers in both ED and outpatient settings. These criteria, initially implemented over a decade ago in 2011 and updated on a three‐year cycle, aim to guide medication choices for adults aged 65 and older across various care settings, excluding hospice and palliative care. AGS cites moderate evidence in making a strong recommendation against use of meclizine and benzodiazepines among older adults. The antihistamine meclizine is highly anticholinergic and cumulative exposure to anticholinergics is associated with risk of falls, delirium, and dementia. Older adults have increased sensitivity to and decreased metabolism of benzodiazepines, and these drugs also carry risk of physical dependence, cognitive impairment, falls, and injuries. Despite these clear guidelines, frequent provision of vestibular suppressants to older adults persists in clinical practice. We observed a higher (23.3%) prevalence of use of anxiolytics, comprised predominantly of benzodiazepines, in our cohort of dizziness patients, which even more strongly suggests a need for targeted interventions to align prescription practices with evidence‐based recommendations. Additionally, we found that anxiolytics were more strongly associated with the hazard of falling than anti‐emetics (HR 4.13, CI 2.40–7.12 for H2F (anti‐anxiety) vs. no suppressants; HR 2.17, confidence interval (CI) 1.26–3.74 for H6J (anti‐emetic) vs. no suppressants). Additional factors that emerged as being associated with the receipt of vestibular suppressants among older adults with dizziness in our cohort included female sex, higher comorbidity, Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, and dizziness evaluation in the outpatient setting. These factors will be pertinent when designing efforts to decrease inappropriate use.

### Positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease [^ea330429]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. It is often treated with medication, but different interventions are sometimes used. Positive pressure therapy is a treatment that creates small pressure pulses, generated by a pump that is attached to tubing placed in the ear canal. It is typically used for a few minutes, several times per day. The underlying cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, as is the way in which this treatment may work. The efficacy of this intervention at preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of positive pressure therapy versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; CENTRAL; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with a diagnosis of Ménière's disease comparing positive pressure therapy with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow-up of less than three months. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease-specific health-related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included three studies with a total of 238 participants, all of which compared positive pressure using the Meniett device to sham treatment. The duration of follow-up was a maximum of four months. Improvement in vertigo A single study assessed whether participants had an improvement in the frequency of their vertigo whilst using positive pressure therapy, therefore we are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the results. Change in vertigo Only one study reported on the change in vertigo symptoms using a global score (at 3 to < 6 months), so we are again unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. All three studies reported on the change in the frequency of vertigo. The summary effect showed that people receiving positive pressure therapy had, on average, 0.84 fewer days per month affected by vertigo (95% confidence interval from 2.12 days fewer to 0.45 days more; 3 studies; 202 participants). However, the evidence on the change in vertigo frequency was of very low certainty, therefore there is great uncertainty in this estimate. Serious adverse events None of the included studies provided information on the number of people who experienced serious adverse events. It is unclear whether this is because no adverse events occurred, or whether they were not assessed and reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease is very uncertain. There are few RCTs that compare this intervention to placebo or no treatment, and the evidence that is currently available from these studies is of low or very low certainty. This means that we have very low confidence that the effects reported are accurate estimates of the true effect of these interventions. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta-analyses of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.

### Dizziness [^56a519ab]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common symptom encountered by all physicians. Dizziness and related symptoms are frequently linked to 1 or more of a list of contributors that includes benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Ménière disease, migraine, acute peripheral vestibulopathy, cerebral ischemia, and anxiety disorders. Awareness of these common clinical patterns increases the likelihood of making a rapid, accurate diagnosis.

### Acceptability of patient-centered, multi-disciplinary medication therapy management recommendations: results from the INCREASE randomized study [^2ab1376a]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The most common type of baseline recommendation was continuation of therapy with dose adjustment (e.g. decrease pain medication dose, intensify antihypertensive medication dose) (N = 170, 28%). Second most common were therapeutic switches to a less risky pharmacotherapeutic alternative (N = 166, 28%; e.g. de-escalate from a proton pump inhibitor to a H 2 receptor antagonist ± calcium-based antacid; switch from a first-generation to non-sedating second-generation antihistamine). Monitoring (N = 101, 17%) and non-pharmacologic recommendations (N = 76, 13%) accounted for about one-third of all baseline MTM recommendations. The most frequent monitoring recommendations involved recommending objective testing (e.g. blood pressure, blood chemistry/organ function tests) and recording self-reported measures (e.g. dizziness, pain). Non-pharmacologic recommendations most frequently involved counseling for fall prevention strategies with and without physical therapy referral, dietary and lifestyle changes for gastrointestinal conditions, non-pharmacologic pain management, and sleep hygiene.

Although recommendations to discontinue medications were relatively less frequent (N = 46, 8%), those medications most commonly associated with a baseline MTM recommendation to discontinue included vitamins/supplements and medications with therapeutic duplication (e.g. participant was taking two separate antihistamines for seasonal allergies). All recommendations for initiation of a new medication (N = 43, 7%) involved treating an unmet clinical need and/or initiating a preventative medication, most often a guideline-recommended statin or aspirin in the setting of cardiovascular risk factors.

### Medications associated with dizziness or hypotension and adverse outcomes: an electronic health record study in older adults with dementia [^74d8217f]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Sample characteristics and comparisons according to receipt of any dizziness- or hypotension-associated medication.

Cox regression analyses for risk of emergency hospitalisation, hospitalised fall and mortality are presented in Table 2. In the follow-up period, 10 737 (70.6%) had at least one emergency hospitalisation, with a median time to first hospitalisation of 1.4 years [interquartile range (IQR) 0.4–4.3]. Considering medications causing dizziness as a continuous variable, each increment in medication number was associated with a 4% increased risk of emergency hospitalisation with little impact of adjustment for covariates. Considering the same exposure as a categorical variable against a nonuser reference group, associations were found in the fully adjusted model from two medications upward. Findings were similar for hypotension-causing medications as an exposure, both as an ordinal and as a categorical exposure.

Table 2
The effects of medications associated with dizziness or hypotension on emergency hospitalisation, hospitalised falls and mortality (in Cox regression models).

In total, 2917 (19.2%) patients had at least one hospitalised fall in the follow-up period. However, no relationship was found between this outcome and the number of medications causing dizziness or the number of medications causing hypotension and a hospitalised fall in the fully adjusted model. Likewise, no associations were found with mortality risk for either medication exposure as a continuous variable, and categorical exposures showed no evidence of dose–response associations. The output from generalised estimating equation models of cognitive decline is displayed in Table 3 and also showed no significant associations for either medication exposure with trajectory of cognitive decline.

Table 3
Annual cognitive decline and slope differences comparing patients.

Given the associations of both exposures with hospitalisations but not with hospitalised falls, supplementary analyses were carried out to further investigate the associations between medications and specific causes of hospitalisation. Considering the seven most common primary discharge diagnoses grouped by ICD-10 chapter code (see Table 4), in fully adjusted analyses, a significant increased risk for all hospitalisation causes was associated with incremental numbers of medications in either exposure category, apart from an absent association between hypotension-causing drugs and musculoskeletal hospitalisations. The strongest associations were with circulatory disease as the primary cause of hospitalisation.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^1a8a5f46]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — recommended maneuvers and underuse in the ED — Evidence indicates many emergency clinicians are not using bedside canalith repositioning maneuvers such as the Epley maneuver, which are recommended by two different BPPV guidelines by the American Academy of Neurology (Level A recommendation) and the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (strong recommendation). Not recognizing or properly treating these benign conditions can result in unnecessary resource utilization, falls, injuries, lost work, medication side effects, increased recurrent rate, and diminished effectiveness of delayed therapeutic maneuvers, and although less serious than missing a stroke diagnosis, the number of patients affected is far larger.

### Rizatriptan vs placebo for attacks of vestibular migraine: a randomized clinical trial [^a0df7c58]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Vestibular migraine has no established treatments.

Objective

To test the efficacy of rizatriptan for treating vestibular migraine attacks.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, randomized clinical trial of rizatriptan vs placebo was conducted from December 2014 through July 2020 (data analyses in 2021 and sensitivity analyses in 2022 and 2024) at 2 tertiary neurotologic centers. Adults with vestibular migraine were included.

Intervention

All participants underwent prospective observation to confirm diagnosis and illness activity and were then randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive rizatriptan 10 mg or placebo to treat up to 3 vestibular migraine attacks per participant.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Participants rated symptoms as absent, mild, moderate, or severe at scheduled intervals. Primary outcomes were the percentage of attacks with reductions in vertigo and unsteadiness/dizziness from moderate or severe to absent or mild at 1 hour. Secondary outcomes were the percentage of attacks with complete resolution of vestibular symptoms at 1 hour; reductions in headache and associated symptoms at 1 hour; use of rescue medications after 1 hour; reductions in vestibular, headache, and associated symptoms at 24 hours without rescue medications; treatment satisfaction and quality of life at 48 hours; and rates of serious adverse effects and discontinuation due to adverse effects.

Results

Of 222 total participants (mean [SD] age, 42.3 [11.7] years; 70.7% were women), 134 (60.4%) with active illness treated 307 attacks. Efficacy was tested using 240 attacks with vestibular symptoms rated as moderate or severe when participants took study drug. At 1 hour, rizatriptan did not differ from placebo for reducing vertigo (73/151 [48.3%] vs 50/88 [56.8%] attacks; odds ratio [OR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.42–1.21]), unsteadiness/dizziness (29/151 [19.2%] vs 11/89 [12.4%] attacks; OR, 1.69 [95% CI, 0.80–3.57]), or any secondary outcomes. Similar percentages of participants in rizatriptan and placebo groups (26.4% for both groups) added rescue remedies after 1 hour. At 24 hours, rizatriptan had medium effects over placebo for unsteadiness/dizziness (OR, 2.65) and motion sensitivity (OR, 3.58). Post hoc analyses of all treated attacks found a medium effect favoring rizatriptan for headache and photophobia or phonophobia at 24 hours. Treatment satisfaction was equivocal. Quality of life was mixed. No participants experienced serious adverse effects or discontinued treatment for adverse effects.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, rizatriptan was ineffective at 1 hour for treating vestibular migraine attacks and had limited benefit on symptoms at 24 hours. Findings do not support using rizatriptan for vestibular migraine attacks.

Trial Registration

### Still dizzy after all these years: a 90-year-old woman with a 54-year history of dizziness [^ee9b8a0d]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

This report presents the case of a 90-year-old female with a 54-year history of dizziness, which has been exhaustively investigated. Over the years, the patient made 59 visits to her family doctor and 18 visits to various specialists, as well as emergency department visits and hospitalisations. In detailing the exhaustive investigations and referrals that the patient has undergone over many years (with inconclusive results), this case illustrates the myriad challenges in diagnosing and treating chronic dizziness in the older. The authors suggest that, in complex cases characterised by multimorbidity and polypharmacy, a function-oriented approach is indicated. In place of the conventional 'diagnose and treat' model, a functional approach to ongoing care emphasises the symptom management, improvement of function and quality of life. To optimise patient outcomes, an interprofessional team approach is preferred.

### Vestibular migraine: an update on current understanding and future directions [^7f856264]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vestibular migraine is among the most common causes of recurrent vertigo in the general population. Despite its prevalence and high impact on healthcare cost and utilization, it has remained an under-recognized condition with largely unknown pathophysiology. In the present article, we aim to provide an overview of the current understanding of vestibular migraine.

Methods

We undertook a narrative literature review on the epidemiology, presentations, clinical and laboratory findings, pathophysiology, and treatments of vestibular migraine.

Results

Currently, the diagnosis of vestibular migraine relies solely on clinical symptoms since clinical tests of vestibular function are typically normal, or difficult to interpret based on inconsistent results reported in earlier studies. The challenges related to diagnosis of vestibular migraine lie in its relatively broad spectrum of manifestations, the absence of typical migraine headaches with vestibular symptoms, and its very recent definition as a distinct entity. Here, we highlight these challenges, discuss common vestibular symptoms and clinical presentations in vestibular migraine, and review the current aspects of its clinical diagnosis and evaluation. The concepts related to the pathophysiology and treatment of vestibular migraine are also discussed.

Conclusion

Vestibular migraine is still underdiagnosed clinically. Future studies are needed to address the pathophysiological mechanisms and investigate effective treatment regimens.

### Ondansetron or promethazine: which one is better for the treatment of acute peripheral vertigo? [^c70af686]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vertigo is a common annoying complaint needing emergent treatment. There are various treatment options for this condition with different outcomes and side effects.

Objectives

Assessment and comparison of the effectiveness of Ondansetron and Promethazine in the treatment of acute peripheral vertigo.

Materials and Methods

This clinical trial was conducted in an academic hospital in the north of Iran in 2017. A total of 170 eligible patients were randomly allocated to groups A: received intramuscular (IM) promethazine; and B: received intravenous (IV) Ondansetron, using quadripartite blocks. The severity of vertigo, nausea, blood pressure, heart rate, side-effects, need for re-administration, and the time to become asymptomatic were assessed before the injections, 30 min after and 2 h after the injections.

Results

Excellent improvement in vertigo occurred in both groups (P < 0.001), with a more significant reduction in the promethazine-treated group (P < 0.001). Nausea was reduced more significantly in the ondansetron-treated group (P < 0.05). There were more side-effects seen in the promethazine-treated when compared to the group with ondansetron treatment (P < 0.001). No significant differences were seen in the blood pressures between groups (P > 0.05). Heart rates were reduced in both groups but the changes were insignificant (P > 0.05). The ondansetron-treated group showed a greater need for re-administration of the medication (50.6% vs. 27.1%). The relief score was significantly higher in the ondansetron-treated group compared with the group received promethazine (P < 0.001). The time to become asymptomatic showed no statistically significant difference between groups (p = 0.28).

Conclusion

Our results indicated that while promethazine cures peripheral vertigo more efficiently, ondansetron is more beneficial for the improvement of nausea and vomiting.

### Migraine-associated dizziness: patient characteristics and management options [^dfad1087]. Otology & Neurotology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine patient characteristics and effectiveness of therapy for migraine-associated dizziness.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

Patients were identified through a code query of billing records for the diagnosis of migraine-associated vertigo or disequilibrium, based on the International Headache Society criteria. There were 81 patients (61 women, 20 men) with an average age of 36.6 years (range, 8–71 yr); all except four patients were evaluated between 1995 and 1999. Follow-up was obtained from chart review. Mean follow-up time was 54.5 weeks, with a range of 4 to 456 weeks.

Intervention

One or more treatment methods, including dietary manipulation, medication (tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers), and neurology consultation, were applied sequentially as necessary.

Main Outcome Measure

Response to therapy was defined as greater than 75% reduction in symptom recurrence rate.

Results

Overall, 72% of patients experienced resolution or dramatic reduction of their attacks of vertigo or disequilibrium. Of the 13 patients treated with the introduction of dietary manipulation alone, 100% received significant relief. Of the 31 patients treated with dietary manipulation and the addition of a medication, 77% of these patients had significant relief. Of the final group of 37 patients treated with another medication or a neurology consultation, 57% received substantial relief. Of the responders, the majority (> 95%) experienced an equal reduction in both vertigo or disequilibrium and headache symptoms. Interestingly, 100% of the patients in the migraine without active headache group received substantial relief of their vertigo or disequilibrium symptoms with migraine therapy.

Conclusion

We conclude that there is effective therapy for the common problem of migraine-associated dizziness.

### Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease [^82dd23fe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Ménière's disease was first described by Prosper Ménière in 1861 as a condition characterised by episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus (Baloh 2001). Sufferers may also report a feeling of fullness in the affected ear. Typically, it initially affects one ear, although some individuals may progress to develop bilateral disease. A hallmark of the condition is that symptoms are intermittent ‐ occurring as discrete attacks that last from minutes to several hours, then resolve. However, over time there is usually a gradual deterioration in hearing, and there may be progressive loss of balance function, leading to chronic dizziness.

The diagnosis of Ménière's disease is challenging, due to the episodic nature of the condition, clinical heterogeneity and the lack of a 'gold standard' diagnostic test. Even the agreed, international classification system has scope for two categories of diagnosis – 'definite' and 'probable' (Lopez‐Escamez 2015). In brief, a diagnosis of definite Ménière's disease requires at least two episodes of vertigo, each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours, together with audiometrically confirmed hearing loss and fluctuating aural symptoms (reduction in hearing, tinnitus or fullness) in the affected ear. 'Probable' Ménière's disease includes similar features, but without the requirement for audiometry to diagnose hearing loss, and with scope for the vertigo episodes to last longer (up to 24 hours). Both categories ('definite' and 'probable') require that the symptoms are not more likely to be due to an alternative diagnosis, due to the recognised challenges in distinguishing between balance disorders.
