## Question

Do you hold verzenio with an anc of 700

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Verzenio (abemaciclib) should be held when the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is 700. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled thresholds for neutropenia and the specific dose-modification rules for abemaciclib. Then, I should verify how these thresholds map to CTCAE grades and what the label says about interrupting therapy. Next, I will review the pivotal trial safety data to confirm real-world management patterns. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and note any exceptions or caveats that could change practice in special scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the labeled neutropenia thresholds and dose-modification rules. The FDA prescribing information instructs clinicians to monitor CBCs and to interrupt, reduce, or delay dosing for Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, which corresponds to ANC less than 1,000/µL for Grade 3 and less than 500/µL for Grade 4, and to resume after recovery to Grade 2 or lower, typically ANC 1,000/µL or higher, with dose reduction for recurrent Grade 3 or any Grade 4 neutropenia [^8e589a74] [^07a7d7e3].

> Wait, let me verify the CTCAE mapping so I don't misstate the grades. Grade 3 neutropenia is indeed ANC less than 1,000/µL, and Grade 4 is ANC less than 500/µL, so an ANC of 700/µL falls squarely in Grade 3 territory and meets the threshold for dose interruption per label guidance [^8e589a74] [^07a7d7e3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the practical management details. The label advises holding abemaciclib for Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia until recovery to Grade 2 or lower, and then resuming at the next lower dose if Grade 3 recurs or if Grade 4 occurs, which operationalizes a hold-and-resume strategy rather than automatic discontinuation, and this approach is echoed in safety analyses of MONARCH 2 and 3 where dose interruptions and reductions for neutropenia were common and effective [^07a7d7e3] [^95f9aeff] [^8590251f].

> I need to check the trial data to ensure this aligns with real-world patterns. In MONARCH 2 and 3, Grade 3 or higher neutropenia occurred in roughly 20–30% of patients, was managed predominantly with dose interruption and reduction, and febrile neutropenia remained uncommon, supporting the safety of temporary holds with subsequent dose adjustments rather than stopping therapy outright [^95f9aeff] [^8590251f].

> But wait, what if the patient is on prophylactic growth factors or has other modifiers? I should confirm that growth factor support does not change the need to hold for Grade 3 neutropenia; the label still requires interruption for Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias regardless of G-CSF use, though G-CSF may be considered in select cases after the hold and upon resumption, and dose modifications should still follow the adverse-event–driven algorithm rather than preemptively altering therapy before the first hold [^07a7d7e3] [^ca218751].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. Yes, abemaciclib should be held when the ANC is 700/µL because this meets Grade 3 neutropenia criteria, and the FDA label mandates dose interruption for Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia until recovery to Grade 2 or lower, after which abemaciclib can be resumed, generally with a dose reduction if Grade 3 recurs or if Grade 4 occurred, to maintain safety without sacrificing efficacy [^8e589a74] [^07a7d7e3] [^95f9aeff].

---

Hold Verzenio (abemaciclib) when the ANC is 700/µL because this meets **Grade 3 neutropenia** [^8e589a74] and warrants **immediate dose interruption** until the ANC recovers to ≥ 1,000/µL. Resume at the next lower dose (from 150 mg to 100 mg BID, or from 200 mg to 150 mg BID) once recovered, and monitor CBCs every 2 weeks initially, then monthly. If ANC drops to < 500/µL or febrile neutropenia occurs, **discontinue Verzenio permanently**.

---

## Clinical significance of ANC 700/µL

An ANC of 700/µL is **Grade 3 neutropenia** (ANC < 1,000/µL) and increases infection risk; management should follow label guidance [^8e589a74].

---

## FDA recommendations for managing neutropenia with Verzenio

The FDA label advises:

- **Grade 3 neutropenia (ANC < 1,000/µL)**: Interrupt Verzenio until ANC recovers to ≥ 1,000/µL; then resume at the next lower dose.
- **Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 500/µL) or febrile neutropenia**: Discontinue Verzenio permanently [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dose interruption and modification

In MONARCH 2 and 3, **Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia** occurred in ~25% of patients and was managed with dose interruption and reduction; febrile neutropenia was rare (< 1%) [^95f9aeff] [^8590251f]. Dose modifications did not negate PFS benefit, supporting interruption and reduction strategies [^e07b5581] [^ffd7e557].

---

## Recommended monitoring protocol

Per label, **monitor CBCs**:

- Baseline
- Every 2 weeks for the first 2 months
- Monthly for the next 2 months
- Then as clinically indicated [^8e589a74] [^ca218751]

---

## Clinical implications of not holding Verzenio at ANC 700/µL

Continuing Verzenio with ANC 700/µL increases the risk of **severe infections**, including febrile neutropenia and sepsis, which can be life-threatening [^8e589a74].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Anc level** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|
| ANC 700/µL (Grade 3) | Interrupt Verzenio immediately; resume at lower dose when ANC ≥ 1,000/µL |
| ANC < 500/µL (Grade 4) or febrile neutropenia | Discontinue Verzenio permanently |

---

Hold Verzenio when the ANC is 700/µL, recover to ≥ 1,000/µL, then resume at a reduced dose; **permanently discontinue** if ANC drops to < 500/µL or febrile neutropenia occurs.

5.1 Diarrhea

Severe diarrhea associated with dehydration and infection occurred in patients treated with VERZENIO.

Across four clinical trials in 3691 patients, diarrhea occurred in 81% to 90% of patients who received VERZENIO. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 8% to 20% of patients receiving VERZENIO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Most patients experienced diarrhea during the first month of VERZENIO treatment. The median time to onset of the first diarrhea event ranged from 6 to 8 days; and the median duration of Grade 2 and Grade 3 diarrhea ranged from 6 to 11 days and 5 to 8 days, respectively. Across trials, 19% to 26% of patients with diarrhea required a VERZENIO dose interruption and 13% to 23% required a dose reduction.

Instruct patients to start antidiarrheal therapy such as loperamide at the first sign of loose stools, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider for further instructions and appropriate follow up [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, or diarrhea that requires hospitalization, discontinue VERZENIO until toxicity resolves to ≤ Grade 1, and then resume VERZENIO at the next lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.2 Neutropenia

Neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia and fatal neutropenic sepsis, occurred in patients treated with VERZENIO.

Across four clinical trials in 3691 patients, neutropenia occurred in a 37% to 46% of patients receiving VERZENIO. A Grade ≥ 3 decrease in neutrophil count (based on laboratory findings) occurred in 19% to 32% of patients receiving VERZENIO. Across trials, the median time to the first episode of Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia ranged from 29 days to 33 days, and the median duration of Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia ranged from 11 days to 16 days [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Febrile neutropenia has been reported in < 1% of patients exposed to VERZENIO across trials. Two deaths due to neutropenic sepsis were observed in MONARCH 2. Inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever to their healthcare provider [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of VERZENIO therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:

Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Venous Thromboembolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety population described in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to VERZENIO in 3691 patients from four clinical trials: monarchE, MONARCH 1, MONARCH 2, and MONARCH 3. The safety population includes exposure to VERZENIO as a single agent at 200 mg twice daily in 132 patients in MONARCH 1 and to VERZENIO at 150 mg twice daily in 3559 patients administered in combination with fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or an aromatase inhibitor in monarchE, MONARCH 2, and MONARCH 3. The median duration of exposure ranged from 4.5 months in MONARCH 1 to 24 months in monarchE. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 20%) across clinical trials were: diarrhea, neutropenia, nausea, abdominal pain, infections, fatigue, anemia, leukopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, headache, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of VERZENIO have not been established in pediatric patients.

The safety and effectiveness of VERZENIO in combination with chemotherapy was assessed but not established in an open label, dose-finding trial (NCT04238819) in 43 pediatric patients aged 1 to < 17 years with relapsed/refractory solid tumors. No new safety signals were observed in pediatric patients in this study. Abemaciclib exposure in pediatric patients was within the range of the values previously observed in adults given a similar dose per body surface area.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 2791 VERZENIO-treated patients in monarchE, 15% were 65 years of age or older and 2.7% were 75 years of age or older.

Of the 900 patients who received VERZENIO in MONARCH 1, MONARCH 2, and MONARCH 3, 38% were 65 years of age or older and 10% were 75 years of age or older. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) Grade 3 or 4 in patients ≥ 65 years of age across MONARCH 1, 2, and 3 were: neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, dehydration, leukopenia, anemia, infections, and ALT increased.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of VERZENIO were observed between these patients and younger patients.

8.6 Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr ≥ 30–89 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault [C-G]). The pharmacokinetics of abemaciclib in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min, C-G), end stage renal disease, or in patients on dialysis is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A or B).

Reduce the dosing frequency when administering VERZENIO to patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Postmenopausal Women with HR-positive, HER2-negative locoregionally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer with no prior systemic therapy in this disease setting

The safety of VERZENIO was evaluated in MONARCH 3, a study of 488 women receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor or placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg of VERZENIO or placebo orally twice daily, plus physician's choice of anastrozole or letrozole once daily. Median duration of treatment was 15.1 months for the VERZENIO arm and 13.9 months for the placebo arm.

The most frequently reported (≥ 5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, diarrhea, leukopenia, increased ALT, and anemia.

Deaths during treatment or during the 30-day follow up, regardless of causality, were reported in 11 cases (3%) of VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor treated patients versus 3 cases (2%) of placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor treated patients. Causes of death for patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor included: 3 (0.9%) patient deaths due to underlying disease, 3 (0.9%) due to lung infection, 3 (0.9%) due to VTE, 1 (0.3%) due to pneumonitis, and 1 (0.3%) due to cerebral infarction.

Women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression on or after prior adjuvant or metastatic endocrine therapy

The safety of VERZENIO (150 mg twice daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg) versus placebo plus fulvestrant was evaluated in MONARCH 2 [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The data described below reflect exposure to VERZENIO in 441 patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who received at least one dose of VERZENIO plus fulvestrant in MONARCH 2.

Median duration of treatment was 12 months for patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant and 8 months for patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant.

The most frequently reported (≥ 5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, diarrhea, leukopenia, anemia, and infections.

Deaths during treatment or during the 30-day follow up, regardless of causality, were reported in 18 cases (4%) of VERZENIO plus fulvestrant treated patients versus 10 cases (5%) of placebo plus fulvestrant treated patients. Causes of death for patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant included: 7 (2%) patient deaths due to underlying disease, 4 (0.9%) due to sepsis, 2 (0.5%) due to pneumonitis, 2 (0.5%) due to hepatotoxicity, and one (0.2%) due to cerebral infarction.

5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or Pneumonitis

Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with VERZENIO and other CDK4/6 inhibitors. In VERZENIO-treated patients in early breast cancer (monarchE, N = 2791), 3% of patients experienced ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.4% were Grade 3 or 4 and there was one fatality (0.1%). In VERZENIO-treated patients in advanced or metastatic breast cancer (N = 900) (MONARCH 1, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), 3.3% of VERZENIO-treated patients had ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.6% had Grade 3 or 4, and 0.4% had fatal outcomes. Additional cases of ILD or pneumonitis have been observed in the postmarketing setting, with fatalities reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD or pneumonitis. Symptoms may include hypoxia, cough, dyspnea, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Infectious, neoplastic, and other causes for such symptoms should be excluded by means of appropriate investigations.

Dose interruption or dose reduction is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2 ILD or pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue VERZENIO in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 ILD or pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.4 Hepatotoxicity

Grade ≥ 3 ALT (2% to 6%) and AST (2% to 3%) were reported in patients receiving VERZENIO.

Across three clinical trials in 3559 patients (monarchE, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), the median time to onset of Grade ≥ 3 ALT increases ranged from 57 to 87 days and the median time to resolution to Grade < 3 was 13 to 14 days. The median time to onset of Grade ≥ 3 AST increases ranged from 71 to 185 days and the median time to resolution to Grade < 3 ranged from 11 to 15 days.

Monitor liver function tests (LFTs) prior to the start of VERZENIO therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, dose discontinuation, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2, or any Grade 3 or Grade 4 hepatic transaminase elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Abemaciclib (Verzenio) [^dbdd762c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dose and Schedule

When used in combination with fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or an aromatase inhibitor, the recommended dose of VERZENIO is 150 mg taken orally twice daily. Refer to the Full Prescribing Information for the recommended dose of the fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or aromatase inhibitor being used.
Pre/perimenopausal women and men treated with the combination of VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor should be treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH) according to current clinical practice standards.
Pre/perimenopausal women treated with the combination of VERZENIO plus fulvestrant should be treated with a GnRH according to current clinical practice standards
When used as monotherapy, the recommended dose of VERZENIO is 200 mg taken orally twice daily.
For early breast cancer, continue VERZENIO until completion of 2 years of treatment or until disease recurrence, or unacceptable toxicity.
For advanced or metastatic breast cancer, continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

VERZENIO may be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Instruct patients to take their doses of VERZENIO at approximately the same times every day.

If the patient vomits or misses a dose of VERZENIO, instruct the patient to take the next dose at its scheduled time. Instruct patients to swallow VERZENIO tablets whole and not to chew, crush, or split tablets before swallowing. Instruct patients not to ingest VERZENIO tablets if broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact.

2.2 Dose Modification

Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions

The recommended VERZENIO dose modifications for adverse reactions are provided in Tables 1–7. Discontinue VERZENIO for patients unable to tolerate 50 mg twice daily.

Refer to the Full Prescribing Information for coadministered fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or an aromatase inhibitor for dose modifications and other relevant safety information.

Dose Modification for Use with Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors

Avoid concomitant use of the strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole.

With concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors other than ketoconazole, in patients with recommended starting doses of 200 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily, reduce the VERZENIO dose to 100 mg twice daily. In patients who have had a dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily due to adverse reactions, further reduce the VERZENIO dose to 50 mg twice daily. If a patient taking VERZENIO discontinues a CYP3A inhibitor, increase the VERZENIO dose (after 3–5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose that was used before starting the strong inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

With concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions and consider reducing the VERZENIO dose in 50 mg decrements as demonstrated in Table 1, if necessary.

Dose Modification for Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment

For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh-C), reduce the VERZENIO dosing frequency to once daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Refer to the Full Prescribing Information for the coadministered fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or aromatase inhibitor for dose modification requirements for severe hepatic impairment.

Neutropenia Management and Occurrence

Neutropenia was primarily managed with dose adjustment. Recommendations included abemaciclib suspension for grade ≥ 3 neutropenia until resolution to grade ≤ 2. Abemaciclib could be resumed with a dose reduction required for recurrent grade 3 or grade 4 neutropenia (Fig. 1B). Granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor (GCSF) use was permitted per protocol and consistent with American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines [10].

In the abemaciclib arms, the most frequently reported grade ≥ 3 AE was neutropenia, occurring in 25% of patients across both trials (Table 3) [5, 6]. Median time to onset for clinically significant (defined as grade ≥ 3) neutropenia ranged from 29 to 36.5 days, and median time to resolution from onset ranged from 11.5 to 15 days in MONARCH 2 and 3 (Table 3). In MONARCH 2, the highest rates of clinically significant neutropenia occurred during the first two cycles (11.6% and 15.8%, respectively), with < 10% in all subsequent cycles (Fig. 2). In MONARCH 3, the trend was similar, with clinically significant neutropenia in 6.4% and 11.0% in cycles 1 and 2, and ≤ 10% in all subsequent cycles (Fig. 2). Owing to neutropenia, dose reduction occurred in 10%–13% of all abemaciclib patients, omission in 16%–17%, and discontinuation in 1%–3% of patients (Table 3).

Table 3
Neutropenia characteristics (any grade) in MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3

Infection that was temporally related to grade ≥ 3 neutropenia (concurrent or within 1 week) ranged from 1.5% to 4.0% in both trials. Febrile neutropenia occurred in < 1% of patients and was not associated with severe infection (grade ≥ 3) [5, 6]. GCSF use was low in MONARCH 2 (7.0%) and 3 (4.6%). Incidence of other hematological grade ≥ 3 toxicities was < 10% in both trials and included leukopenia (9%), anemia (7%), thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia (3% each).

### Management of abemaciclib-associated adverse events in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer: safety analysis of MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 [^a169ca6b]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

The most common grade ≥ 3 AE in MONARCH 2 and 3 was neutropenia, typically occurring within the first two cycles of treatment and resolving with dose adjustments. The decreasing incidence in subsequent cycles following abemaciclib dose adjustment indicated low recurrence. Post hoc exploratory analyses indicated that patients taking abemaciclib received PFS benefit regardless of whether they experienced grade ≥ 3 neutropenia during the first 2 months of treatment. Dose reductions due to neutropenia occurred in approximately 43% of patients across both studies; these dose reductions did not affect the PFS benefit observed. Infection temporally related to grade ≥ 3 neutropenia was not common (1.5%–4%), nor was febrile neutropenia (< 1%). Per label recommendations, neutropenia monitoring includes blood counts assessed at baseline, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the subsequent 2 months, and as clinically indicated [15].

In contrast to other CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors, which require intermittent dosing, neutropenia observed with abemaciclib was not dose limiting in a phase I study and did not limit the ability of continuous abemaciclib dosing [16]. Lower rates of grade ≥ 3 neutropenia were seen with abemaciclib compared with other CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors, which ranged from 59% to 66% in phase III trials of other CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors [12, 13, 17]. Abemaciclib is a more potent inhibitor of cyclin D1/CDK4 than cyclin D3/CDK6 [7, 18] and exhibits greater selectivity for CDK4 compared with CDK6 [16]. CDK6 has a relatively larger role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation compared with CDK4 [19], which may explain the lower frequency of neutropenia with abemaciclib compared with other drugs in this class. Of note, the effects of neutropenia caused by CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors versus chemotherapy are thought to differ; neutropenia caused by CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors, purely cytostatic drugs, is reversible upon discontinuation, but neutropenia due to chemotherapy can result in prolonged bone marrow suppression and the possibility for cumulative bone marrow aplasia [20].

Clinical efficacy, as measured by PFS, favored the abemaciclib arm, regardless of experiencing grade ≥ 3 neutropenia within the first 56 days of abemaciclib initiation, corresponding to the median time of onset of grade ≥ 3 neutropenia (supplemental online Fig. 2). In MONARCH 2, relative to the placebo arm, PFS was improved in abemaciclib‐treated patients who experienced grade ≥ 3 neutropenia within the first 56 days of abemaciclib initiation (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45–0.74) and in abemaciclib‐treated patients who did not experience grade ≥ 3 neutropenia within the first 56 days (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43–0.73). For patients who received abemaciclib in combination with fulvestrant, median PFS was 16.6 months among those with (n = 226) and 17.6 months among those without (n = 186) grade ≥ 3 neutropenia (supplemental online Fig. 2). Similarly, in MONARCH 3, relative to the placebo arm, PFS was improved in abemaciclib‐treated patients who experienced grade ≥ 3 neutropenia within the first 56 days (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.39–0.75) and who did not experience grade ≥ 3 neutropenia within the first 56 days (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.38–0.70). For patients who received abemaciclib in combination with an NSAI, the median PFS was 28.2 and 31.1 months among those with (n = 122) and without (n = 178) grade ≥ 3 neutropenia, respectively (supplemental online Fig. 2).

### FDA D. I.S.C.O. burst edition: FDA approval of verzenio (abemaciclib… [^d33c2dd3]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

On March 3, 2023, the FDA approved abemaciclib with endocrine therapy for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, node-positive, early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. Patients defined as high risk included those having either greater than or equal to 4 pathologic axillary lymph nodes or 1–3 pathologic axillary lymph nodes and either tumor grade 3 or a tumor size greater than or equal to 50 mm. Abemaciclib was previously approved for the above high-risk population with the additional requirement of having a Ki-67 score of greater than or equal to 20%. Today's approval removes the Ki-67 testing requirement.

Efficacy was evaluated in monarchE, a randomized 1: 1, open-label, two-cohort multicenter trial including adult women and men with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, node-positive, resected, early breast cancer with clinical and pathological features consistent with a high risk of recurrence. To be enrolled in cohort 1, patients must have had either greater than or equal to 4 pathologic axillary lymph nodes or 1–3 pathologic axillary lymph nodes and either tumor grade 3 or a tumor size greater than or equal to 50 mm. To be enrolled in cohort 2, patients could not be eligible for cohort 1 and must have had 1–3 pathologic axillary lymph nodes and tumor Ki-67 score of greater than or equal to 20%. Patients were randomized to either 2 years of abemaciclib plus physician's choice of standard endocrine therapy or standard endocrine therapy alone. The major efficacy outcome measure was invasive disease-free survival.

A statistically significant difference was observed in the intent-to-treat population, primarily attributed to the patients in cohort 1. Invasive disease-free survival at 48 months was
85. 5% for abemaciclib plus standard endocrine therapy and 78. 6% for standard endocrine therapy alone. Overall survival data remains immature, however, in cohort 2, more deaths were observed with abemaciclib plus standard endocrine therapy compared to standard endocrine therapy alone. Therefore, the indication was restricted to cohort 1.

### Clinical and genotypic insights into higher prevalence of palbociclib associated neutropenia in Asian patients [^5e9ab955]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

The association of neutropenia with CDK4/6i treatment efficacy is still unclear. A recent study reported association between neutropenia and better outcome in 196 patients (61 patients with breast cancer) receiving palbociclib. In the same study, early neutropenia, defined as nadir of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) in the first 56 days of starting palbociclib, was also associated with prolonged PFS. Other studies also link Palbociclib associated neutropenia to improved PFS benefit. Currently, it is still unclear whether an "on-target" effect of neutropenia predicts efficacy toward CDK4/6i, as frequently seen with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

CDK4/6is are metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450, with the majority excreted through feces (> 70%). Pharmacokinetics of palbociclib in patients with normal renal function has been well studied;, however, data are lacking in patients with renal failure. Peritoneal or hemodialysis is indicated for patients with irreversible severe kidney failure. The FDA approved package insert for palbociclib recommended no dose modification for patients with renal failure, noting that pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients with hemodialysis. Package inserts for ribociclib and abemaciclib stated that pharmacokinetics was not affected by mild or moderate renal impairment, while data also lacking in several renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m²). As all 3 CDK4/6i are metabolized by CYP3A4, there is a clinical need to accurately determine the pharmacokinetics in patients with dialysis.

Figure 1
Recommendation for management of adverse events. (A), hematological toxicities (B), nonhematologic toxicities except diarrhea, increased ALT, and ILD/pneumonitis (C), increased ALT (D), and interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (E) management. A dose reduction corresponds to a reduction of 50 mg of abemaciclib at a time. Discontinue abemaciclib for patients unable to tolerate 50 mg twice daily. For neutropenia evaluation, blood counts should be performed before starting abemaciclib treatment, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. If blood cell growth factors are administered, abemaciclib treatment must be suspended for at least 48 hours after the last administration of cell growth factors and until toxicity resolves to grade ≤ 2. Reduce the abemaciclib dose, unless already performed, for the toxicity that led to the use of growth factor. a Grade 2 toxicity that does not resolve with maximal supportive measures within 7 days to grade ≤ 1. b For grade 4 increased aminotransferases, discontinue abemaciclib. Abbreviations: AE, adverse event; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; ILD, interstitial lung disease; ULN, upper limit of normal.

Safety Measures

Type, severity, incidence, seriousness, timing, and relatedness to study drug of AEs were all assessed. AE severity was graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria, version 4.0. Central laboratory assessments were conducted at baseline, the first day of each cycle, and approximately 30 days after discontinuation of study therapy. MONARCH 2 had an additional laboratory assessment on day 15 of cycle 1.

Conclusion

The addition of abemaciclib to ET resulted in a clinically and statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients with HR+, HER2− ABC. Based on these data, clinicians are currently incorporating abemaciclib along with ET as a new standard‐of‐care treatment for these patients. A thorough understanding of the abemaciclib safety profile and management of its associated toxicities can help ensure patients continue treatment with optimal clinical benefit. In general, abemaciclib plus ET exhibits a generally tolerable safety profile, and side effects in MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 were predictable, manageable, and reversible upon treatment discontinuation. The most common AE, low‐grade diarrhea, was properly managed with antidiarrheal medication and dose adjustments. Other toxicities, including hematological toxicities, were well managed with dose adjustments. Given the potential severity of ILD/pneumonitis, patients should be made aware of symptoms and report any to their physician. In both MONARCH 2 and 3, patients received PFS benefit regardless of dose reductions and regardless of early onset of diarrhea and/or neutropenia. These findings demonstrate that concomitant medications and/or dose adjustments are an effective way to manage toxicity without compromising efficacy.

Statistical Analyses

Safety was assessed in all patients who received ≥ 1 dose of the study drug at the time of the final PFS analysis (cutoff dates: MONARCH 2, February 14, 2017; MONARCH 3, November 3, 2017). AEs were summarized by maximum toxicity regardless of causality. Clinically synonymous terms were grouped together under a consolidated preferred term. For the most common AE overall (diarrhea) and the most common grade ≥ 3 AE (neutropenia), the incidence of clinically relevant events was derived relative to total drug exposure for each cycle. Time‐dependent covariate analysis of dose level versus PFS examined the impact of dose levels over time on PFS.

To investigate any potential association of early toxicities, defined as within time of median onset, and outcome, PFS was estimated for patients with and without any‐grade diarrhea within 7 days of abemaciclib initiation, corresponding to the median time to onset of diarrhea. A similar analysis compared PFS for patients with and without grade ≥ 2 neutropenia within 56 days of abemaciclib initiation, corresponding to the median time to onset of grade ≥ 3 neutropenia.

### Early treatment-related neutropenia predicts response to palbociclib [^e20c2b7f]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Patients who experienced palbociclib-related neutropenia in the first two cycles of treatment had significantly improved PFS compared to patients who did not experience neutropenia. This effect was seen across multiple tumour types, including breast cancer, and remained significant in a multivariate analysis. Even though patients experiencing grade 0 neutropenia exhibited reduced PFS relative to those experiencing any grade neutropenia, it is still possible that they received some benefit from the drug. These findings, validating preclinical data and the clinical findings in PALOMA-3, have the potential to impact clinical decision-making and future palbociclib development. Future research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanism of this effect and, if confirmed, whether it can be exploited to optimise therapeutic effect by matching an individual's palbociclib dose to a target ANC. A prospective trial comparing flat dosing to dosing tailored to a target ANC is warranted to determine whether neutropenia could be clinically utilised as a predictive biomarker and identify patients who may be under-dosed and not achieving effective cell-cycle inhibition with the FDA-approved dose.

Safety

Most patients in all arms had at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE; Supplementary Table S2), and 98.7%, 98.7%, and 94.4% of patients in Arms A, B, and C, respectively, had at least 1 TEAE, regardless of causality. In Arm A, 59 (75.6%) patients had ≥ 1 Grade ≥ 3 TEAE, regardless of causality, compared with 43 (55.8%) in Arm B, and 39 (54.2%) in Arm C. The most frequently reported TEAEs, regardless of arm and grade, included diarrhea (62.1%), fatigue (50.7%), nausea (41.9%), neutrophil count decrease (40.5%), and anemia (30.0%; Table 1). Twenty-four (30.8%) patients in Arm A had at least 1 serious adverse event (SAE), regardless of causality, compared with 15 (19.5%) in Arm B, and 14 (19.4%) in Arm C. Four patients (5.1%) in Arm A discontinued study treatment due to an SAE, compared with 2 patients in Arm B (2.6%) and 3 patients in Arm C (4.2%).

Updated TEAEs.

Thirty-nine patients (50.0%) in Arm A had at least 1 dose reduction of abemaciclib, compared with 32 (41.6%) in Arm B (Supplementary Table S3). Reasons leading to dose reduction included AEs for 38 (48.7%) patients in Arm A, and 31 (40.3%) patients in Arm B; protocol was cause for dose reduction in 1 (1.3%) patient in both Arms A and B. The AEs leading to dose reduction included diarrhea (10 patients in Arm A; 12 patients in Arm B) and neutropenia (8 patients in Arm A; 9 patients in Arm B) in both arms, anemia (4 patients) in Arm A, and leukopenia (3 patients) in Arm B. Three (3.8%) deaths due to AE while on study treatment, regardless of causality, were reported in Arm A, and 1 each was reported in Arms B (1.3%, respiratory failure) and C (1.4%, febrile neutropenia).

ALT alanine aminotransferase, AST aspartate aminotransferase

In the abemaciclib arm, longer follow-up confirmed that diarrhea was typically of low grade (72.8% grade 1 or 2) and often occurred early (69.1% of patients experienced diarrhea in cycle 1). The management of diarrhea appeared generally successful with the incidence dropping below 10% (grade 2) and 1% (grade 3) by cycle 4 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Of the patients who had diarrhea, 74.3% in abemaciclib arm received antidiarrheal medications compared to 30.8% in placebo arm. Diarrhea was managed with dose adjustments: 16.7% of patients in abemaciclib arm had a dose reduction and 19% had a dose omission due to diarrhea. Treatment duration was typically not limited by diarrhea, with 6 (1.8%) of the patients in the abemaciclib arm discontinuing treatment for this event (Supplementary table S1). Of note, 4 of these patients were not given a dose reduction prior to discontinuation. The final analysis confirmed that 43.7% of patients had an adverse event of neutropenia, and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 23.9% of patients. While one patient experienced an adverse event of febrile neutropenia at the interim analysis, no new cases were observed at this final analysis.

Impact of Adverse Events onSurvival

In the abemaciclib arms of MONARCH 2 and 3, 189 (42.9%) and 142 (43.4%) patients had dose reductions owing to AEs. The most frequent AEs accounting for ≥ 10% of dose reductions were grade 2 or 3 diarrhea (14%–19%) and grade ≥ 3 neutropenia (10%–13%). In both studies, there was no difference in PFS when the dose was reduced to 100 mg, or to 50 mg at any point in the treatment, compared with being treated at the 150‐mg dose (Fig. 3).

### Are all cyclin-dependent kinases 4 / 6 inhibitors created equal? [^84645cbb]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite the high frequency of neutropenia for all CDK4/6-Is (in particular, palbociclib and ribociclib), febrile neutropenia and other serious infections have been rarely reported in clinical trials, ranged from 1 to 2% in palbociclib and ribociclib trials and < 1% in abemaciclib trials (Table 1). Dose reductions for palbociclib and for persistent neutropenia are common. Reassuringly, dose modifications for grade 3–4 neutropenia have not a deleterious effect on PFS.

At last, abemaciclib had lower rates of neutropenia but greater degrees of diarrhea compared with the other agents. However, the majority of patients did not require treatment modification for this kind of toxicity, being well managed with antidiarrhoeic medications.

Patient-reported outcomes

As shown above, the addition of CDK4/6-I to endocrine therapy significantly contributes to improve response rates and survival times in ER+/HER2- mBC patients. However, it is critical to understand the impact of these therapies on QoL of treated patients. As such, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) has been demonstrated to be integral components for tabulating symptomatic toxicities, enabling symptoms that could be underestimated by clinicians, and assessing benefit–risk of new treatment regimens. Some trials testing CDK4/6-Is reported PROs together with results on efficacy and toxicity.

In the PALOMA-2 trial, the addition of palbociclib to letrozole maintained health-related QOL, evaluated by means Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Breast Total, FACT-General Total, and EuroQOL-5 dimensions scores. In addition, the palbociclib group presented an improvement in pain scores. In both arms, patients without signs of clinical or radiological disease progression presented with a delayed worsening of FACT-Breast Total score compared with those with progression. Comparable results were obtained in the PALOMA-3 trial: overall global QoL scores, evaluated through the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire, significantly favored the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group along with a greater improvement from baseline in pain control.

### Association of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and absolute lymphocyte count with clinical outcomes in advanced breast cancer in the MONARCH 2 trial [^fbb44c63]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

This post hoc analysis used data from MONARCH 2, a clinical study in patients with HR+, HER2− advanced breast cancer that had progressed on endocrine therapy and who were treated with either abemaciclib or placebo plus fulvestrant. Both a low-baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and high-baseline absolute lymphocyte count were associated with better progression-free survival and overall survival, and baseline NLR was independently prognostic of these outcomes. The benefit of abemaciclib was observed regardless of baseline NLR. Pretreatment NLR may be a useful prognostic marker for patients with HR+, HER2− advanced breast cancer treated with abemaciclib plus fulvestrant.

Overall, all grade 3–4 AEs occurred in 60–70% of patients and the cumulative LHH was generally low. Abemaciclib showed a higher LHH, probably due to the absolute difference in terms of haematological events.

Dose reductions occur in approximately 40% of patients during the treatment with CDK 4/6 inhibitors, which are generally considered safe drugs: cumulative NNH for dose reduction was 2.7 and LHH 0.58. However, adverse events rarely lead to a definitive treatment interruption: NNH and LHH for discontinuation were respectively 16.7 and 3.62. Palbociclib confirmed to be a manageable drug, showing the highest LHH for both outcomes. In two analyses from PALOMA-2 and PALOMA-3, no PFS difference was observed in patients whose dose was reduced. This highlights how in elderly or frail patients, when the survival advantage has to be weighed on tolerability, palbociclib can be considered a reasonable choice. In absence of disease progression, when a treatment with another CDK4/6 inhibitor has to be discontinued due to scarce tolerance, a switch to another compound can be considered and if palbociclib wasn't the first choice it can contemplated. While the LHHs for dose reductions were similar, marked differences were observed for discontinuation, with ribociclib being the second best (LHH 4.69). As expected, the MONALEESA-7 trial, who enrolled only pre-menopausal women, had the highest NNH and LHH for discontinuation (166.7 and 35.74, respectively). These data confirm how, in young and fit patients, ribociclib is generally well tolerated. Despite fewer haematological toxicities, abemaciclib LHH for discontinuation was the lowest: neutropenia is often well tolerated and although anti-diarrheal drugs are effective to manage diarrhea they could negatively impact patients' compliance. Dose modifications due to diarrhea with abemaciclib are in the order of 12–19%, while discontinuation rates are around 2.3–2.9%.while palbociclib and ribociclib discontinuation rates associated with neutropenia were approximately 1–2%. However, in both MONARCH 2 and 3 patients experienced a PFS benefit regardless of whether they had a dose reduction. Therefore, when diarrhea is not really a matter or when neutropenia is an issue, abemaciclib is absolutely a rational choice.

Number needed to treat for overall survival

An OS benefit was observed in patients treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors compared to placebo (HR 0.788, 0.727–0.856, I² = 0%). Survival advantage was significant only for ribociclib (HR 0.750; 0.664–0.846) and abemaciclib (HR 0.756, 0.639–0.894), while a non-significant trend was observed with palbociclib (HR 0.878, 0.743–1.038) (Fig. S4). Cumulative NNT was 11.8 (8.7–18.2), lower for ribociclib (9.7; 6.8–16.8) and abemaciclib (10.0; 6.2–25.5) compared to palbociclib (21.8; 9.4–∞ and −76.4 to –∞) (Fig. 2).

Likelihood of being helped or harmed for overall survival

Overall LHH for OS for grade 3–4 neutropenia was 0.17 (0.08–0.31) and abemaciclib confirmed the highest LHH (0.40; 0.13–0.81), followed by ribociclib (0.18; 0.10–0.28) and palbociclib (0.07; 0.00–0.16 and −0.02 to −∞). Overall LHH for FN was 7.09 (3.24–16.44) and abemaciclib had the highest LHH (12.52; 2.18–∞ and −81.11 to −∞), followed by ribociclib (7.93; 2.96–29.63) and palbociclib (2.87; 0.00–21.38 and −0.50 to −∞). Cumulative LHH for any grade diarrhea was 0.40 (0.14–3.03), ribociclib showed the highest LHH (1.29; 0.39–18.52) and abemaciclib the lowest (0.18; 0.06–0.35).

Safety

No new safety signals were observed relative to the primary analysis. The type and relative frequency of AEs remained consistent with those in the primary analysis (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Common hematologic AEs graded 3 or higher in the abemaciclib arm included neutropenia (n = 131 [29.9%]), anemia (n = 40 [9.1%]), and leukopenia (n = 49 [11.1%]). No new cases of febrile neutropenia were reported relative to the primary analysis (n = 6). Diarrhea was the most frequent nonhematologic AE reported in the abemaciclib arm with 64 (14.5%) CTCAE grade 3 events. Most diarrhea cases occurred during the first 4 weeks of abemaciclib initiation and were effectively managed using loperamide or dose adjustments; treatment discontinuation due to diarrhea remained infrequent (1.4%). Within the subset of patients who had been in the study for 1 year or more (abemaciclib arm, n = 240 vs placebo arm, n = 89), new treatment-emergent diarrhea events of any grade appearing after 1 year or more of treatment were reported in 68 patients (28.3%) in the abemaciclib arm vs 10 (11.2%) in the placebo arm.

Some considerations should be made when interpreting results presented here. In MONARCH 2, patients enrolled at the 200‐mg (n = 121) dose received a median of 34 days of treatment prior to the mandatory dose reduction, compared with an entire treatment duration of 54.7 weeks among those starting at 150 mg (n = 320); given the similar dose intensity, no separate analysis was performed. Given that dose reductions and treatment duration are positively correlated (i.e. those whose dose reduced were more likely to remain on treatment and those who remained on treatment longer were more likely to have a dose adjustment), a time‐dependent covariate analysis was selected to assess the impact of dose reductions on efficacy. In both MONARCH 2 and 3, patients received PFS benefit regardless of whether they experienced dose reductions.

### Management of abemaciclib-associated adverse events in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer: safety analysis of MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 [^26aab516]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hormone receptor‐positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2‐negative (HER2−) advanced breast cancer (ABC) is routinely treated with sequential endocrine therapies (ETs) [1, 2]; however, nearly all of these tumors have intrinsically or acquired ET resistance [3]. Recent efforts have focused on identifying new therapeutic strategies to overcome ET resistance. With the advent of highly specific cyclin‐dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6) inhibitors, new treatment options are available [4].

Abemaciclib is an orally available CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor, approved for continuous dosing [5]. In the first‐line setting (MONARCH 3) [6, 7], there was significantly longer progression‐free survival (PFS) in the abemaciclib arm compared with the placebo arm [7]. In the second‐line setting (MONARCH 2), there was statistically significant improvement in the primary outcomes of investigator‐assessed median PFS [5] and median overall survival (OS) [8].

The safety profile of abemaciclib was consistent across MONARCH 2 and 3 [5, 6, 7, 8]. The most common adverse event (AE) across both trials was early‐onset diarrhea, most commonly grades 1 and 2 [5, 6]. The most common grade ≥ 3 AE was neutropenia, typically occurring in the first two cycles [5, 6, 9]. Although detailed MONARCH 2 and 3 safety analyses were published [5, 6, 7, 8], additional information may be useful for clinical management. Here, we present the results of a comprehensive safety analysis of abemaciclib‐associated AEs and outcomes of the most frequently occurring AEs. Moreover, we determined if AEs and dose adjustments affected PFS. Finally, management of less frequent but potentially serious AEs was examined, including increased aminotransferases, venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), and interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis [5, 6].

Table 2
Diarrhea a characteristics in MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3

Clinically significant diarrhea (defined as grade 2 or 3) occurred early in abemaciclib treatment, with median time to onset for any‐grade diarrhea of 6 days in MONARCH 2 and 8 days in MONARCH 3 (Table 2). The median duration of diarrhea was 9 to 12 days for grade 2 events and ranged from 6 to 8 days for grade 3 events (Table 2). The highest rates of clinically significant diarrhea (32% in MONARCH 2 and 20.8% in MONARCH 3) were observed in the first cycles of MONARCH 2 and 3, with decreasing incidence in all subsequent cycles (Fig. 2).

Figure 2

Each light blue bar corresponds to the number of patients who received a cycle of treatment, representing total exposure by cycle. Each dark blue bar represents those with grade ≥ 2 diarrhea or grade ≥ 3 neutropenia. The number displayed above each dark blue bar is the percentage of patients with clinically significant diarrhea or neutropenia within each cycle. No grade ≥ 4 diarrhea was observed.

Antidiarrheal medication, most commonly loperamide, was taken by 69%–76% of patients receiving abemaciclib in both trials (Table 2). Abemaciclib dose reduction due to diarrhea occurred in 13%–19% of patients across both studies (Table 2). Abemaciclib dose omission due to diarrhea occurred in 15%–19% of patients, with a median duration of 1.7 days and 3.1 days in MONARCH 2 and 3, respectively (Table 2). Abemaciclib discontinuation due to diarrhea occurred in 2.3%–2.9% of patients (Table 2).

### Resource guide: preoperative management of patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy [^2206e5ac]. ASBrS (2025). High credibility.

CDK4/6 inhibitors — preoperative and postoperative management states that while specific guidelines for ribociclib or abemaciclib are not yet established, current recommendations for palbociclib suggest discontinuing the medication 7 days before surgery and resuming it 3 weeks postoperatively. All patients receiving neoadjuvant CDK 4/6 inhibitors should undergo a complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) as part of preoperative assessment. In patients treated with abemaciclib, the most common adverse events included diarrhea, fatigue, and neutropenia, and emerging studies suggest a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). For patients receiving ribociclib, common adverse events include nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, neutropenia, and infections; hypertension and elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) are among the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and approximately 3% experienced QT prolongation.

A greater reduction in absolute neutrophil count appears to be associated with increased palbociclib exposure. 107 No conclusive exposure–response relationship has been found in 81 patients treated at the 125 mg fixed dose.

Based on the limited exposure–response and –toxicity analyses, no specific PK target for palbociclib can be formulated. More thorough PK/PD analyses are needed. Until these come available palbociclib concentrations can be compared to the population mean (CV) C min of 61 (42) ng/mL. 107

### Clinical management of potential toxicities and drug interactions related to cyclin-dependent kinase 4 / 6 inhibitors in breast cancer: practical considerations and recommendations [^13ef1edf]. The Oncologist (2017). Low credibility.

Aberrations of the cell cycle are pervasive in cancer, and selective cell cycle inhibition of cancer cells is a target of choice for a number of novel cancer therapeutics. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulatory enzymes that control cell cycle transitions and the commitment to cell division. Palbociclib and ribociclib are both orally active, highly selective reversible inhibitors of CDK4 and CDK6 that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer in combination with specific endocrine therapies. A third oral CDK4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib, received Breakthrough Therapy designation status from the FDA and is also being developed in breast cancer. The most common adverse events associated with palbociclib and ribociclib are hematologic, particularly neutropenia. However, the neutropenia associated with CDK4/6 inhibitors is distinct from chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in that it is rapidly reversible, reflecting a cytostatic effect on neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow. Most hematologic abnormalities seen with CDK4/6 inhibitors are not complicated and are adequately managed with standard supportive care and dose adjustments when indicated. Cytopenias are less prevalent with abemaciclib, although fatigue and gastrointestinal toxicity is more common with this agent. This review focuses on the clinical management of potential toxicities and drug interactions seen with the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer, with a focus on palbociclib and ribociclib, and summarizes practical management strategies for an oncologist.

Implications For Practice

The emergence of modern cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors has changed the treatment paradigm for metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer. Palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib are highly selective reversible inhibitors of CDK4 and CDK6. Palbociclib is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved in the first- and second-line settings in combination with endocrine therapy for HR-positive metastatic breast cancer. Ribociclib is FDA-approved in the first-line setting. Abemaciclib has received FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation status. This review focuses on the clinical management of potential toxicities and drug interactions seen with the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer.

Breast cancer — HR-positive, HER2-negative recurrent/stage IV: Based on the above data, the NCCN Panel has included AI in combination with CDK 4/6 inhibitors as a category 1 first-line option for postmenopausal patients and premenopausal patients with ovarian ablation/suppression with HR-positive, HER2-negative recurrent/stage IV breast cancer. In a phase III study of palbociclib plus letrozole in postmenopausal patients (n = 666), PFS improved (24.8 vs. 14.5 months; HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46–0.72) and ORR increased (42% vs. 35%), with grade 3 and 4 adverse effects including neutropenia (66.5% vs. 1.4%), leukopenia (24.8% vs. 0%), anemia (5.4% vs. 1.8%) and fatigue (1.8% vs. 0.5%). Ribociclib plus letrozole as first-line therapy in postmenopausal patients (n = 668) at a median follow-up of 26.4 months showed improved PFS (25.3 vs. 16.0 months; HR for progression or death was 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45–0.70) and ORR (43% vs. 29%), with grade 3 or 4 adverse events including neutropenia (62% vs. 1.2%), leukopenia (21.3% vs. 0.9%), and abnormal LFTs (10.2% vs. 2.4%). With abemaciclib plus an aromatase inhibitor (AI) versus AI alone, PFS improved (median not reached vs. 14.7 months; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41–0.72) with higher ORR (59% vs. 44%) and grade 3 or higher adverse events for abemaciclib versus placebo including diarrhea (9.5% vs. 1.2%), neutropenia (21.1% vs. 1.2%), leukopenia (8% vs. 0.6%), and fatigue (2% vs. 0%). In the phase III MONALEESA-7 trial of 672 pre- or perimenopausal patients randomly assigned to ribociclib or placebo with goserelin plus either a nonsteroidal AI or tamoxifen, the addition of ribociclib improved median PFS (median PFS, 24 vs. 13 months; HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.40–0.69) and at 3.5 years improved OS (70% vs. 46%; HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54–0.95), with grade 3 and 4 adverse events reported in 10% of patients in either group including neutropenia (61% vs. 4%) and leukopenia (14% vs. 1%).

Abstract

Background

Abemaciclib demonstrated efficacy in hormone receptor‐positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2‐negative advanced breast cancer. Here we provide a comprehensive summary of the most common adverse events (AEs), their management, and whether AEs or dose reductions influenced progression‐free survival (PFS), in the MONARCH 2 and 3 trials.

Materials and Methods

Incidence of the most clinically relevant AEs, management, and outcomes were summarized. Time‐dependent covariate analyses examined the impact of dose reductions on PFS. PFS was estimated for patients with and without early onset of diarrhea or neutropenia.

Results

The most frequently reported AE was diarrhea, with clinically significant diarrhea (grade ≥ 2) reported for 42.8% of patients taking abemaciclib. Median time to onset was 1 week, and duration ranged from 6 to 12 days, depending on grade and study. Diarrhea was adequately managed by antidiarrheal medication (72.8%), dose omissions (17.3%), and reductions (16.7%). The highest rates of grade ≥ 2 diarrhea were observed in the first cycles and decreased in subsequent cycles. Neutropenia (grade ≥ 3) occurred in 25.4% of abemaciclib‐treated patients. Neutropenia resolved with dose omissions (16.8%) and/or dose reductions (11.2%). Incidence of febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or other relevant grade ≥ 3 hematological events (< 9%) was low. Venous thromboembolic events (5.3%) were primarily treated with anticoagulants. Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (3.4%) was treated with corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. PFS benefit of abemaciclib was not impacted by dose reductions or early onset of toxicities.

Conclusion

Abemaciclib was generally well tolerated. The most common AEs were effectively managed by supportive medications, and/or dose adjustments, with no detriment to PFS.

Implications for Practice

Treatment with abemaciclib plus fulvestrant or nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors is generally well tolerated in patients with hormone receptor‐positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2‐negative advanced breast cancer. In MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3, any‐grade diarrhea and grade ≥ 3 neutropenia were effectively managed with supportive medication and/or dose adjustment. Venous thromboembolic events were treated with anticoagulants and did not often require treatment discontinuation. Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis was infrequent and treated with corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. Clinicians should be aware of and implement management strategies, including dose adjustments according to local labels, for commonly occurring and serious adverse events to ensure continued treatment and optimize clinical benefit/risk ratio.

### A signal-finding study of abemaciclib in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: results from CYCLONE 1 [^7788ba3d]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Serious AEs (SAE) were reported for 16 patients (36.4%), with pyrexia (19%), renal failure (19%), anemia (13%), and serum creatinine increase (13%) being the most common. Two patients experienced SAEs deemed possibly related to abemaciclib: one patient had two SAEs (serum creatinine increase and renal failure) and discontinued study treatment; the second patient had a SAE of anemia.

The median relative dose intensity was 69.5% (Q1–Q3: 48.6%–92.6%). Thirty-four patients (34/44; 77.3%) had a dose suspension of abemaciclib due to an AE, most commonly diarrhea (11/34, 25.0%), neutropenia (7/34, 15.9%), and blood creatinine increased (4/34, 9.1%). Nineteen patients (19/44; 43.2%) required ≥ 1 dose reduction of abemaciclib due to an AE. The most frequent AEs leading to dose reductions were diarrhea (7/19, 36.8%), blood creatinine increased (3/19, 15.8%), and neutropenia (3/19, 15.8%). Of the 44 patients, 6 (13.6%) discontinued treatment due to an AE/SAE (anemia, neutropenia, vomiting, or renal failure). AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were deemed possibly related to abemaciclib for 4 patients (4/44; 9.1%).

Pharmacokinetics

Plasma concentration-time data for abemaciclib were available for 43/44 patients (97.7%). In CYCLONE 1, the starting dose of abemaciclib was 200 mg twice daily, and sequential reductions by 50-mg dose levels were permitted. Summary exposures of 178 mg were calculated on the basis of the average dose received throughout the study and are consistent with previous studies in breast cancer (data on file; Supplementary Table S6).

Results

Patients

Of the 669 patients enrolled in the MONARCH 2 study, 446 were randomized to the abemaciclib plus fulvestrant and 223 were randomized to placebo plus fulvestrant. Baseline NLR and ALC data were available for 426 and 219 patients in the abemaciclib and placebo arms, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1). Median baseline NLR was 2.5 and 2.4 in the abemaciclib and placebo arms, respectively. Median baseline ALC was 1.4 × 10⁹/L in both arms. The number of patients in the low and high NLR and ALC categories were generally well balanced between treatment arms (Table 1).

### Abemaciclib combined with endocrine therapy for the adjuvant treatment of HR +, HER2-, node-positive, high-risk, early breast cancer (monarchE) [^dc7ab97c]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Adherence to therapy is a challenge in the adjuvant setting, and a manageable toxicity profile for any novel therapy is crucial. The safety profile of abemaciclib in this adjuvant study was consistent with the known adverse effect profile of abemaciclib previously reported in the ABC setting. Of interest, arthralgia and hot flush are known frequent and often troublesome AEs related to ET. Both were significantly reduced in those treated with abemaciclib plus ET compared with ET alone (arthralgia, 20.5% v 31.3%; hot flush, 14.1% v 21.0%). This intriguing observation has been reported previously in a randomized study of a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus ET.

The most frequently reported AE in the abemaciclib arm was diarrhea. Diarrhea occurred early (median time to onset for any grade of 8 days), was short-lived (median duration for grades 2 and 3 of 5 to 6 days), and was managed with antidiarrheal medication and dose adjustments per protocol. The frequency of diarrhea grade ≥ 3 was 7.6%; however, a very low number of patients (4.8%) discontinued abemaciclib because of diarrhea. Neutropenia grade ≥ 3 occurred in < 20% of abemaciclib-treated patients (0.3% febrile neutropenia, any grade). VTE and ILD were reported more often in the abemaciclib arm, and although SAEs were uncommon, signs and symptoms should be closely monitored for patients on abemaciclib.

In conclusion, monarchE has demonstrated that abemaciclib added to standard adjuvant ET significantly improves IDFS in women and men with HR+, HER2−, node-positive EBC at high risk of early recurrence.

Results

Overall Safety Profile

Baseline patient and disease characteristics were previously described [5, 6, 7, 8]. The MONARCH 2 safety population included 441 patients in the abemaciclib arm and 223 in the placebo arm. The MONARCH 3 safety population included 327 and 161 patients in the abemaciclib and placebo arms, respectively.

In MONARCH 2 and 3, 99% of all patients experienced any‐grade AE; 58% (MONARCH 3) and 62% (MONARCH 2) experienced a grade ≥ 3 AE. In MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3, 44.4% and 47.4%, respectively, of patients experienced a grade ≥ 3 abemaciclib‐related AE. Table 1 summarizes the most common AEs, pooled across trials and occurring in ≥ 20% of either study arm.

Table 1
Safety summary: pooled data for MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 showing any‐grade, grade 3, and grade 4 adverse events occurring in ≥ 10% of patients in the abemaciclib or placebo arms

Clinically important AEs included increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT; 13%–17%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST; 12%–17%), any‐grade VTEs, (5%–6%), and ILD/pneumonitis (2%–5%; Table 1).

### Association of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and absolute lymphocyte count with clinical outcomes in advanced breast cancer in the MONARCH 2 trial [^85e88cfc]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

These exploratory analyses of the MONARCH 2 data suggest baseline NLR is a potential prognostic factor for PFS and OS in patients with HR+, HER2− advanced and metastatic breast cancer treated with abemaciclib. Low-baseline NLR was associated with better PFS and OS and better tumor response, but the benefit of adding abemaciclib to fulvestrant was similar regardless of baseline NLR status, indicating baseline NLR was not predictive of treatment response. Our findings are broadly consistent with the existing literature on the association of pretreatment NLR and ALC with prognosis in patients with breast cancer who received CDK 4/6 inhibitors, supporting the continued study of these factors in relation to abemaciclib.

### Early treatment-related neutropenia predicts response to palbociclib [^01c3bbe7]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Algorithms for dose modification and interruption were slightly different for each trial (Supplemental Fig. 1). In general, the dose modification scheme for the Basket Trial was designed to allow for more dose reductions based on varying levels of cytopenia than the Sarcoma Trial, which utilised treatment breaks rather than dose reductions upon development of neutropenia.

The primary endpoint considered for this analysis was PFS, which was defined as the time interval from Day 1/Cycle 1 of treatment initiation to radiographic progression, clinical progression (either before or after first planned scan), or death from any cause. The primary exposure variable characterising early neutropenia was the nadir absolute neutrophil count (ANC) during the first 2 cycles of treatment, which was defined as the lowest ANC at any point during the first 56 days after starting study drug. This exposure variable was chosen to limit immortal time bias and to capture the majority of neutropenic events prior to the first planned efficacy assessment. Nadir ANC was represented both as a continuous variable and as a categorical variable, according to grade of neutropenia (per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3). During cycle one, blood counts were assessed at least once per week. Grade 1 neutropenia is defined in CTCAE v3 as an ANC below "the lower limit of normal" and 1.5 K/μL; the lower limit of normal for ANC used to define grade 1 neutropenia in this analysis was 1.8 K/μL.PFS curves were estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meierand compared using log-rank test. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression modelswere constructed manually using forward selection and confirmed using backward selection. Candidate variables potentially associated with PFS were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, number of prior lines of systemic therapy (both chemotherapy and hormonal therapy), baseline ANC, race, sex, study site, body mass index (BMI), age, and chemotherapy as immediate prior line therapy. These variables were screened for inclusion in the model using a significance level of p < 0.2 in a univariate analysis and ultimately retained in the model using a criterion of p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using the Stata 14 Statistics/Data Analysis software package (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

### Adjuvant abemaciclib combined with endocrine therapy for high-risk early breast cancer: safety and patient-reported outcomes from the monarchE study [^229f45a0]. Annals of Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In monarchE, abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy (ET) as adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor 2-negative, high-risk, early breast cancer (EBC) demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in invasive disease-free survival versus ET alone. Detailed safety analyses conducted at a median follow-up of 27 months and key patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are presented.

Patients and Methods

The safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment (n = 5591). Safety analyses included incidence, management, and outcomes of common and clinically relevant adverse events (AEs). Patient-reported health-related quality of life, ET symptoms, fatigue, and side-effect burden were assessed.

Results

The addition of abemaciclib to ET resulted in higher incidence of grade ≥ 3 AEs (49.7% versus 16.3% with ET alone), predominantly laboratory cytopenias [e.g. neutropenia (19.6%)] without clinical complications. Abemaciclib-treated patients experienced more serious AEs (15.2% versus 8.8%). Discontinuation of abemaciclib and/or ET due to AEs occurred in 18.5% of patients, mainly due to grade 1/2 AEs (66.8%). AEs were managed with comedications (e.g. antidiarrheals), abemaciclib dose holds (61.7%), and/or dose reductions (43.4%). Diarrhea was generally low grade (grade 1/2: 76%); grade 2/3 events were highest in the first month (20.5%), most were short-lived (≤ 7 days) and did not recur. Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) were higher with abemaciclib + ET (2.5%) versus ET (0.6%); in the abemaciclib arm, increased VTE risk was observed with tamoxifen versus aromatase inhibitors (4.3% versus 1.8%). PROs were similar between arms, including being 'bothered by side-effects of treatment', except for diarrhea. At ≥ 3 months, most patients reporting diarrhea reported 'a little bit' or 'somewhat'.

Conclusions

In patients with high-risk EBC, adjuvant abemaciclib + ET has an acceptable safety profile and tolerability is supported by PRO findings. Most AEs were reversible and manageable with comedications and/or dose modifications, consistent with the known abemaciclib toxicity profile.

### Adjuvant abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy in the treatment of high-risk early breast cancer: ASCO guideline rapid recommendation update Q and a… [^67131dea]. JCO Oncology Practice (2022). High credibility.

Adjuvant abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy — diarrhea management, monitoring, and dose modification are emphasized: Diarrhea is the most common toxicity with abemaciclib in monarchE (all grades = 83%; grade 3 = 7.8%), and the median time to diarrhea onset is approximately 1 week. Antidiarrheal prophylaxis may be contraindicated because of constipation risks, and early intervention in the event of symptoms is advised. As abemaciclib is initiated, patients should be educated on diarrhea management including hydration and dietary modification, with recommendations for early use of over-the-counter antidiarrheal medications (eg, loperamide) at the first sign of diarrhea. Dose modifications should be considered when diarrhea is severe, and regular monitoring with complete blood counts and electrolytes is recommended for those on abemaciclib, particularly during the early months of therapy initiation. In monarchE, dose adjustments (68.1%) including dose omissions (59.9%), dose reductions (41.2%), and early cessation of therapy (median duration of abemaciclib 14 months v planned 24 months) occurred commonly, supporting the role of dose reductions triggered by adverse events in ITT population.

Abemaciclib single-agent in refractory HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer — phase II MONARCH 1 results and NCCN option: the trial evaluated abemaciclib as a single agent in patients (n = 132) with disease progression on endocrine therapy and multiple prior regimens (average of three prior systemic regimens); 90% had visceral disease and 50.8% had more than three sites of metastases. Single-agent abemaciclib induced a partial response in 26 patients (19.7%) and demonstrated an ORR of 19.7% (95% CI, 13.3–27.5); median PFS was 6 months (95% CI, 4.2–7.5); at the final analysis at 18 months, median OS was 22.3 months (95% CI, 17.7–not reached). Diarrhea occurred in 90.2% and other common adverse events were fatigue (65.2%), nausea (64.4%), and decreased appetite (45.5%); grade 3 and 4 neutropenia occurred in 26.9%. The NCCN Panel has included single-agent abemaciclib as an option for those with progression on prior endocrine therapy and prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.

### Impact of dose reductions on adjuvant abemaciclib efficacy for patients with high-risk early breast cancer: analyses from the monarchE study [^95dbe27e]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The addition of 2 years of abemaciclib to standard adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) for high-risk, hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor negative (HER2-) early-stage breast cancer (EBC) resulted in significant improvements in invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) and distant relapse-free survival (DRFS), which were further strengthened after the 2-year treatment period. Notably, at a median follow-up of 42 months, improvements in IDFS and DRFS represented a relative risk reduction of 34% for disease recurrence or distant metastases in the abemaciclib plus ET arm compared to the ET alone arm. Based on these results, abemaciclib is currently the only cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 dual inhibitor approved as adjuvant therapy for node-positive, HR+, HER2-, high-risk EBC –, with a National Comprehensive Cancer Network Category 1 ratingand a maximum score (A) from the European Society for Medical Oncology on the Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale.

The goal of adjuvant treatment is to eliminate micro-metastatic disease to prevent recurrence; thus, the failure to retain patients on abemaciclib for the full 2-year treatment period could compromise treatment efficacy. It has also been established previously, that abemaciclib dose modifications improve tolerability without negatively affecting progression-free survival (PFS) in the metastatic breast cancer setting.

Similar to the safety profile of abemaciclib plus ET in the advanced and metastatic breast cancer setting, most adverse events in the EBC setting were reversible and manageable with supportive medications and/or dose modifications. In monarchE, dose reductions due to adverse events occurred in 43.4% of patients treated with abemaciclib, most frequently in response to diarrhea, neutropenia, and/or fatigue. Although dose reductions occurred at different timepoints, the majority took place within the first 6 months. Abemaciclib dose reductions were shown to effectively manage adverse events, with only a small proportion of patients discontinuing after a dose reduction (8.9%), indicating that early dose reductions may improve treatment adherence. In contrast, 52% of patients who discontinued abemaciclib due to an adverse event did not have a prior dose reduction, including 88% of patients who discontinued during the first month of treatment.

### Abemaciclib: the newest CDK4 / 6 inhibitor for the treatment of breast cancer [^f2381611]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, abemaciclib, in the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC).

Data Sources

Relevant information was identified through a MEDLINE/PubMed (January 2000 to June 2018) literature search. The new drug application, prescribing information, and abstracts and posters from scientific meetings were also reviewed.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

The literature search was limited to human studies published in the English language. Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies evaluating the pharmacology, efficacy, or safety of abemaciclib for breast cancer were included.

Data Synthesis

Abemaciclib is an oral, potent, small molecule inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 activity, which blocks retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein phosphorylation and thereby prevents progression through the cell cycle. Three major clinical trials, MONARCH 1, 2, and 3, established the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or MBC. In these trials, response rates were promising, ranging from 19.7% to 59%, and median progression-free survival was significantly prolonged over the control arm in 2 of the trials. Common adverse effects included diarrhea, neutropenia, nausea, abdominal pain, infections, and fatigue. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Although no head-to-head studies have been completed between the CDK4/6 inhibitors, abemaciclib may be an attractive option because of its continuous dosing and ability to be used as monotherapy.

Conclusions

Abemaciclib is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

Efficacy assessments

All patients underwent baseline disease assessments at screening (peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM)). Efficacy was assessed according to the blast percentage in a peripheral blood and BM aspirate sample, measurement of absolute neutrophil count, measurement of platelet count, and red cell transfusion requirement according to the European LeukemiaNetresponse criteria for AML and the modified IWG response criteria for MDS. Response criteria used are summarized in Supplementary Table 4.

Response assessments (peripheral blood and BM) were performed at Cycle 2 Day 1 (pre-dose), Cycle 4 Day 1 (pre-dose) and repeated every 3 cycles thereafter or when clinically indicated. Patients who completed 12 months of study treatment and had not experienced progressive disease (PD) underwent response assessment every 5 cycles until PD was confirmed. Efficacy endpoints were: Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the number of patients with CR, CRi, MLFS, MR or PR divided by the total number of patients in the cohort/group; Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the number of patients with CR, CRi, MLFS, MR, PR or unchanged disease for at least three cycles (considered to have stable disease (SD)) divided by the total number of patients in the cohort/group; Overall survival (OS), defined as (date of death or censoring) – (date of the first study treatment) +1. Censoring date was the last date the patient was known to be alive; Event free survival (EFS), defined as (earliest of date of death, date of progression or date of censoring) – (date of the first study treatment) +1, with event defined as death or progression. Patients who started a new anti-cancer treatment before documented progression were censored at the date of the last assessment prior to start of non-protocol treatment. Patients who were alive without documented progression on the last day of contact were censored at the date of the last assessment; Relapse free survival (RFS), defined as (earliest of date of death, date of relapse or date of censoring) – (date of first assessment where subject had an objective response) +1, only for subjects who achieved an objective response (CR, CRi, MLFS, MR or PR). Patients who started a new anti-cancer treatment before documented progression were censored at the date of the last assessment prior to start of non-protocol treatment. Patients who were alive without documented progression on the last day of contact were censored at the date of the last assessment.

Materials and Methods

Study Design and Treatment

MONARCH 2 (NCT02107703) and MONARCH 3 (NCT02246621) were randomized, double blind, phase III trials in women with HR+, HER2− ABC [5, 6]. The eligibility criteria, study design, and primary outcomes for both studies have been previously described [5, 6, 7, 8]. In brief, MONARCH 2 enrolled women of any menopausal status, with disease progression on ET, who were chemotherapy naïve in the metastatic setting [5]. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive abemaciclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant per label [5]. Abemaciclib or placebo were administered on a continuous schedule, initially at 200 mg (n = 121). After a blinded review of safety data and dose reduction rates, which revealed a high number of dose adjustments for abemaciclib or placebo principally due to diarrhea occurrence in the first treatment cycle, the protocol was amended; the abemaciclib starting dose was reduced to 150 mg b.i.d. for subsequent patients (n = 320), and all patients receiving 200 mg underwent a mandatory dose reduction to 150 mg. MONARCH 3 enrolled postmenopausal women with no prior therapy in the advanced setting [6]. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to abemaciclib (150 mg b.i.d.) plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI; 1 mg anastrozole or 2.5 mg letrozole, daily, per physician's choice), or placebo plus NSAI [6].

Survival Outcomes by Baseline NLR and ALC

PFS and OS data are plotted in Fig. 1 and summarized in Table 2. In the abemaciclib arm, PFS and OS were numerically longer in the low versus high-baseline NLR subgroup (median PFS: 21.5 months vs. 14.6 months; median OS: 62.6 months vs. 36.5 months). A similar trend was observed in the placebo arm (median PFS: 11.2 months vs. 7.1 months; median OS: 43.8 months vs. 33.8 months).

Data are from the March 18, 2022, data cutoff date for the MONARCH 2 population. Patients are divided into high and low categories for NLR (cutoff 2.5) and ALC (cutoff 1.5 × 10⁹/L). Abbreviations: ALC: absolute lymphocyte count; NLR: neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; OS: overall survival; PFS: progression-free survival.

Patients in the low-baseline ALC subgroup had numerically worse median PFS (abemaciclib: 16.4 months; placebo: 7.4 months) and OS (abemaciclib: 39.0 months; placebo: 34.4 months) in both treatment arms compared to patients in the high subgroup (median PFS: abemaciclib 17.6 months; placebo 11.6 months; median OS: abemaciclib 56.4 months; placebo 42.5 months). HRs indicated the treatment effect of abemaciclib for PFS and OS was consistent regardless of baseline NLR and ALC status (Table 2).

### MONARCH 2: abemaciclib in combination with fulvestrant in women with HR + / HER2-Advanced breast cancer who had progressed while receiving endocrine therapy [^784322f3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose MONARCH 2 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02107703) compared the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor, plus fulvestrant with fulvestrant alone in patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC). Patients and Methods MONARCH 2 was a global, double-blind, phase III study of women with hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative ABC who had progressed while receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET), ≤ 12 months from the end of adjuvant ET, or while receiving first-line ET for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive abemaciclib or placebo (150 mg twice daily) on a continuous schedule and fulvestrant (500 mg, per label). The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), and key secondary end points included overall survival, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, clinical benefit rate, quality of life, and safety. Results Between August 2014 and December 2015, 669 patients were randomly assigned to receive abemaciclib plus fulvestrant (n = 446) or placebo plus fulvestrant (n = 223). Abemaciclib plus fulvestrant significantly extended PFS versus fulvestrant alone (median, 16.4 v 9.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.553; 95% CI, 0.449 to 0.681; P < .001). In patients with measurable disease, abemaciclib plus fulvestrant achieved an ORR of 48.1% (95% CI, 42.6% to 53.6%) compared with 21.3% (95% CI, 15.1% to 27.6%) in the control arm. The most common adverse events in the abemaciclib versus placebo arms were diarrhea (86.4% v 24.7%), neutropenia (46.0% v 4.0%), nausea (45.1% v 22.9%), and fatigue (39.9% v 26.9%). Conclusions Abemaciclib at 150 mg twice daily plus fulvestrant was effective, significantly improving PFS and ORR and demonstrating a tolerable safety profile in women with hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative ABC who progressed while receiving ET.

### MONARCH 3 final PFS: a randomized study of abemaciclib as initial therapy for advanced breast cancer [^1261aa78]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

At the MONARCH 3 interim analysis, abemaciclib plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) with a tolerable safety profile as initial treatment for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC). MONARCH 3 is a randomized, phase III, double-blind study of abemaciclib/placebo (150mg twice daily, continuous) plus nonsteroidal AI (1mg anastrozole or 2.5mg letrozole, daily). A total of 493 postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- ABC with no prior systemic therapy in this setting were enrolled. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS (final analysis after 240 events); other endpoints included response and safety evaluations. Here we analyze the final PFS data and update secondary endpoints. The abemaciclib arm had a significantly longer median PFS than the placebo arm (28.18 versus 14.76 months; hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.540 [0.418–0.698]; p = .000002). The ORR was 61.0% in the abemaciclib arm versus 45.5% in the placebo arm (measurable disease, p = .003). The median duration of response was longer in the abemaciclib arm (27.39 months) compared to the placebo arm (17.46 months). The safety profile was consistent with previous reports. The most frequent grade ≥ 3 adverse events in the abemaciclib versus placebo arms were neutropenia (23.9% versus 1.2%), diarrhea (9.5% versus 1.2%), and leukopenia (8.6% versus 0.6%). Abemaciclib plus a nonsteroidal AI was an effective initial treatment with an acceptable safety profile for HR+, HER2- ABC.

### Palbociclib with letrozole in postmenopausal women with ER + / HER2-Advanced breast cancer: hematologic safety analysis of the randomized PALOMA-2 trial [^7bf8058a]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

PALOMA-2 confirmed that first-line palbociclib + letrozole improved progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.46–0.72) in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC). This analysis evaluated palbociclib-associated hematologic adverse events (AEs) and provides insight on managing these AEs.

Materials and Methods

Postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- ABC were randomly assigned 2:1 to letrozole (2.5 mg daily continuously) plus oral palbociclib (125 mg daily; 3 weeks on/1 week off) or placebo. Safety assessments were performed at baseline, days 1 and 15 (first two cycles) and day 1 of subsequent cycles, and included white blood cell, platelet, and absolute neutrophil count (ANC).

Results

PALOMA-2 randomized 666 women to palbociclib + letrozole (n = 444) or placebo + letrozole (n = 222). Neutropenia was the most common AE (95.3%) with palbociclib (grade 3, 55.6%; grade 4, 11.5%) and was managed by dose modifications; progression-free survival was similar between patients who experienced grade ≥ 3 neutropenia versus those who did not. Median (range) time to onset of neutropenia with palbociclib + letrozole was 15 (12–700) days (grade ≥ 3, 28.0 [12–854] days); median duration of each neutropenia episode grade ≥ 3 was 7.0 days. Asian ethnicity and low baseline ANC were associated with increased risk of grade 3/4 neutropenia with palbociclib (p < .001).

Conclusion

Palbociclib + letrozole was generally well tolerated. Neutropenia, the most frequently reported AE in women with ER+/HER2- ABC, was mostly transient and manageable by dose modifications in patients who experienced grade ≥ 3 neutropenia, without appearing to compromise efficacy. (Pfizer; NCT01740427) IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Palbociclib demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in PALOMA-2 in women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) receiving first-line palbociclib + letrozole. Although hematologic adverse events (AEs) are typically expected with anticancer therapies and are often clinically significant, palbociclib-related hematologic AEs, particularly neutropenia (most frequent AE), were transient/manageable by dose reduction, interruption, or cycle delay, which is in contrast to the more profound neutropenia associated with chemotherapy. Palbociclib dose adjustments decreased hematologic AE severity without appearing to compromise efficacy, supporting palbociclib + letrozole as a first-line treatment for ER+/HER2- ABC.

### Association of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and absolute lymphocyte count with clinical outcomes in advanced breast cancer in the MONARCH 2 trial [^05c83b7f]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Established prognostic factors for treatment response to cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibitors are currently lacking. We aimed to investigate the relationship of pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) to abemaciclib outcomes.

Patients and Methods

This was a post hoc analysis of data from MONARCH 2, a phase III study of abemaciclib or placebo plus fulvestrant in hormone-receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer that progressed on endocrine therapy. Patients were divided into high and low categories based on baseline NLR (cutoff: 2.5) and ALC (cutoff: 1.5 × 10⁹/L). The association of baseline NLR and ALC with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was explored using Cox models and Kaplan-Meier estimates. Tumor response and safety were also examined.

Results

NLR and ALC data were available for 645 patients (abemaciclib: N = 426; placebo: N = 219). Low-baseline NLR or high-baseline ALC was consistently associated with positive PFS and OS trends; low-baseline NLR subgroups also showed trends for better response. The abemaciclib treatment effect against placebo was observed regardless of baseline NLR or ALC. Univariate analyses showed baseline NLR and ALC were prognostic of PFS and OS. Baseline NLR remained significant in the multivariate model (P < .0001). No unexpected differences in safety were observed by baseline NLR or ALC.

Conclusion

Baseline NLR was independently prognostic of PFS and OS. Low-baseline NLR was associated with numerically better efficacy outcomes, but the benefit of adding abemaciclib to fulvestrant was similar irrespective of baseline NLR status.

MONARCH-2 — Abemaciclib plus fulvestrant in hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) versus placebo plus fulvestrant, with median PFS 16.4 months versus 9.3 months (hazard ratio, 0.553; 95% CI, 0.449 to 0.681; P = 0.0001) and ORR 48.1% versus 21.3% (with stated 95% CIs). A prespecified interim analysis showed median overall survival (OS) 46.7 months versus 37.3 months (hazard ratio, 0.757; 95% CI, 0.606 to 0.945; P = 0.01), with subgroup OS effects in visceral disease (hazard ratio, 0.675; 95% CI, 0.511 to 0.891) and in primary endocrine therapy resistance (hazard ratio, 0.686; 95% CI, 0.451 to 1.043). Common all-grade adverse events (AEs) with abemaciclib-fulvestrant versus placebo-fulvestrant were diarrhea (86.4% v 24.7%), neutropenia (46.0% v 4.0%), nausea (45.1% v 22.9%), and fatigue (39.9% v 26.9%); grade 3–4 AEs included neutropenia (26.5% and 1.7%), diarrhea (13.4% and 0.4%), and anemia (7.2% and 0.9%), with serious AEs attributed to study drug in 8.8% versus 1.3%. Patient-reported outcomes showed a 4.9-month delay in pain deterioration and significantly greater time to sustained deterioration (TTSD) in pain and analgesic use (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.98) and on the QLQ-C30 pain item (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.79), while diarrhea TTSD favored placebo (hazard ratio, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.10). The trial randomly assigned 669 women (n = 446 vs n = 223).

Abstract

Background

Established prognostic factors for treatment response to cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibitors are currently lacking. We aimed to investigate the relationship of pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) to abemaciclib outcomes.

Patients and Methods

This was a post hoc analysis of data from MONARCH 2, a phase III study of abemaciclib or placebo plus fulvestrant in hormone-receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2−) advanced breast cancer that progressed on endocrine therapy. Patients were divided into high and low categories based on baseline NLR (cutoff: 2.5) and ALC (cutoff: 1.5 × 10⁹/L). The association of baseline NLR and ALC with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was explored using Cox models and Kaplan-Meier estimates. Tumor response and safety were also examined.

Results

NLR and ALC data were available for 645 patients (abemaciclib: N = 426; placebo: N = 219). Low-baseline NLR or high-baseline ALC was consistently associated with positive PFS and OS trends; low-baseline NLR subgroups also showed trends for better response. The abemaciclib treatment effect against placebo was observed regardless of baseline NLR or ALC. Univariate analyses showed baseline NLR and ALC were prognostic of PFS and OS. Baseline NLR remained significant in the multivariate model (P < .0001). No unexpected differences in safety were observed by baseline NLR or ALC.

Conclusion

Baseline NLR was independently prognostic of PFS and OS. Low-baseline NLR was associated with numerically better efficacy outcomes, but the benefit of adding abemaciclib to fulvestrant was similar irrespective of baseline NLR status.

### Acute myeloid leukemia, version 3.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^05695860]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Acute myeloid leukemia — first-cycle cytopenia management and assessment timing: Venetoclax and hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have been shown to induce prolonged cytopenias, and neutropenia is a dominant treatment-related toxicity. During the first cycle, the Panel recommends continuing treatment regardless of cytopenias until a response assessment is made, with aggressive transfusion support and supportive care as needed. The Panel also recommends withholding growth factors until after the first cycle response assessment; however, G-CSF is encouraged for neutropenic patients who are in morphologic remission but whose counts have not recovered at the end of a treatment cycle. A bone marrow (BM) biopsy is necessary for response assessment on days 21 to 28 of the first cycle.

### The likelihood of being helped or harmed as a patient-centred tool to assess cyclin dependent kinase 4 / 6 inhibitors clinical impact and safety in metastatic breast cancer: a systematic review and sensitivity-analysis [^dbdbf9b0]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In hormone-receptor positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (mBC) no randomized comparisons are available between CDK4/6 inhibitors. We undertook this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the reliability of the likelihood of being helped or harmed (LHH).

Methods

PubMed, CENTRAL, Embase and oncological meetings websites were searched to September 13th, 2022. We included phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib in addition to endocrine therapy (ET) compared to placebo in hormone-receptor positive/HER2-negative advanced or mBC. Outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), adverse events (AEs), dose reductions and discontinuations. Hazard ratios (HRs) and risk differences were computed with a random effect model to estimate the number needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH). LHH was computed as (1/NNT)/(1/NNH). PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022362417.

Findings

2204 records were screened and seven RCTs (4415 patients) were included. A significant PFS benefit was observed in patients treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor compared to placebo (HR 0.549; 0.508–0.594, I² = 0). Palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib had similar NNTs (4.4, 5.0 and 4.4). Palbociclib and ribociclib showed lower LHHs for grade 3–4 neutropenia (0.33 and 0.35) and febrile neutropenia ([FN], 14.27 and 15.52), while abemaciclib the lowest LHH for any grade diarrhea (0.42). Abemaciclib had a lower LHH for grade 3–4 fatigue (9.92) and the highest LHH for all grade 3–4 AEs (0.62), while ribociclib the lowest LHH (1.75) for grade 3–4 hepatotoxicity. Palbociclib had the highest LHH for dose reductions and discontinuations (0.65 and 6.17). Considering OS, an overall benefit was observed (HR 0.788, 0.727–0.856, I² = 0%); ribociclib and abemaciclib had lower NNTs (9.7 and 10.0). Ribociclib showed the highest LHH for diarrhea (1.29), fatigue (7.37), dose reductions (0.28) and discontinuations (2.40), while abemaciclib the highest LHHs for neutropenia (0.40), FN (12.53) and hepatotoxicity (2.23).

Interpretation

Palbociclib and ribociclib showed lower LHHs for haematological toxicities and abemaciclib for diarrhea. Palbociclib confirmed to be a manageable drug. The LHH appears to be a reliable synthesis tool for balancing risks and benefits of experimental drugs when head-to-head comparisons are missing.

Diarrhea Management and Occurrence

The first step in diarrhea management was antidiarrheal medication. At study onset, patients were prescribed and counseled to take antidiarrheal medication at the first sign of loose stools (Fig. 1). If diarrhea did not resolve to grade ≤ 1 within 24 hours of antidiarrheal therapy, dose adjustments were made, per study protocol. Specific recommendations included suspending abemaciclib at the first occurrence of grade ≥ 2 diarrhea. Abemaciclib could be resumed when diarrhea resolved to grade ≤ 1, with a dose reduction for persistent or recurrent grade 2, or grade ≥ 3 diarrhea (Fig. 1A).

The most frequently reported AE was diarrhea, occurring in 85% of patients across MONARCH 2 and 3 (Table 1). Diarrhea was typically low‐grade; 10%–13% of MONARCH 2 and 3 patients taking abemaciclib reported grade 3, and no patients reported grade ≥ 4 diarrhea (Table 2). In MONARCH 2, incidence of any‐grade, grade 2, and grade 3 diarrhea was higher for patients starting at abemaciclib 200 mg b.i.d. than for patients starting at 150 mg b.i.d.

Figure 1 displays the relationship between each patient's nadir ANC in the first two cycles (as a continuous variable) and PFS weeks as a predicted relative hazard based on a univariate Cox regression model. The Spearman's rho of −0.41 (p < 0.001) indicates that decreasing values for nadir ANC were significantly associated with prolonged PFS weeks (hazard ratio (HR) 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13–1.32, p < 0.001). In the breast cancer subgroup, nadir ANC in cycle 1–2 (as a continuous variable) was also associated with PFS (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.02–2.97, p = 0.042). The nadir ANC was also analysed as a categorical variable according to the maximum grade of neutropenia in the first two cycles. For all patients, increasing grade of neutropenia was associated with significantly prolonged median PFS (log-rank p = 0.002), with corresponding HR and median PFS weeks for each grade of neutropenia listed below in Fig. 2a. The relationship between increasing grade of neutropenia and prolonged PFS remained significant after analysing patients with breast (Fig. 2b, log-rank p = 0.028) and non-breast (Fig. 2c, log-rank p = 0.013) tumours separately.

### Abemaciclib in combination with single-agent options in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer: a phase Ib study [^62adec70]. Clinical Cancer Research (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose: Abemaciclib, a dual inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, has demonstrated preclinical activity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label phase Ib study was conducted to test safety, MTD, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of abemaciclib in combination with other therapies for treatment in patients with metastatic NSCLC. Patients and Methods: An initial dose escalation phase was used to determine the MTD of twice-daily oral abemaciclib (150, 200 mg) plus pemetrexed, gemcitabine, or ramucirumab, followed by an expansion phase for each drug combination. Pemetrexed and gemcitabine were administered according to label. The abemaciclib plus ramucirumab study examined two dosing schedules. Results: The three study parts enrolled 86 patients; all received ≥ 1 dose of combination therapy. Across arms, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were fatigue, diarrhea, neutropenia, decreased appetite, and nausea. The trial did not identify an abemaciclib MTD for the combination with pemetrexed or gemcitabine but did so for the combination of abemaciclib with days 1 and 8 ramucirumab (8 mg/kg). Plasma sample analysis showed that abemaciclib did not influence the pharmacokinetics of the combination agents and the combination agents did not affect abemaciclib exposure. The disease control rate was 57% for patients treated with abemaciclib-pemetrexed, 25% for abemaciclib-gemcitabine, and 54% for abemaciclib-ramucirumab. Median progression-free survival was 5.55, 1.58, and 4.83 months, respectively. Conclusions: Abemaciclib demonstrated an acceptable safety profile when dosed on a continuous twice-daily schedule in combination with pemetrexed, gemcitabine, or ramucirumab. Abemaciclib exposures remained consistent with those observed in single-agent studies. Clin Cancer Res; 24(22); 5543–51. ©2018 AACR.

### Acute myeloid leukemia, version 3.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^315d7aab]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 — Cytopenia management and response assessment with venetoclax combinations notes that venetoclax and HMAs have been shown to induce prolonged cytopenias even after achieving remission, and neutropenia is a dominant treatment-related toxicity. During the first cycle, the Panel recommends continuing treatment regardless of cytopenias until a response assessment is made, with aggressive transfusion support and supportive care as needed; the Panel also recommends withholding growth factors until after the first cycle response assessment, although G-CSF should be considered for neutropenic patients in morphologic remission whose counts have not recovered at the end of a treatment cycle. A BM biopsy is necessary for response assessment on days 21 to 28 of the first cycle, perhaps on the earlier end of this range for patients who receive the combination of venetoclax and decitabine.

### Targeting CDK4 and 6 in cancer therapy: emerging preclinical insights related to abemaciclib [^70a77cfd]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Discovery and Clinical Development of CDK4 and 6 Inhibitors, with a Focus on Abemaciclib

Both palbociclib and ribociclib are fashioned on the pyrido [2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one scaffold which confers selective inhibitory activity against CDK4 and 6. In contrast, abemaciclib is based upon a distinct 2-anilino-2,4-pyrimidine-[5-benzimidazole] scaffold. In a pivotal step, Gelbert et alidentified the pyrimidine-benzimidazole molecular structure as a promising scaffold to develop a novel selective CDK4 and 6i. Structure-activity relationship studies evaluated properties such as potency, ligand efficiency, and selectivity to optimize the design of the CDK4 and 6i known as LY2835219 (now known as abemaciclib). During this development phase, several modifications were made which retained potency, while providing enhanced selectivity, specificity, and pharmacokinetic properties compared to the original pyrimidine-benzimidazole scaffold. Preclinical studies using in vitro and in vivo xenograft models demonstrated that abemaciclib inhibited phosphorylation of Rb and induced a G1 cell cycle arrest, resulting in antitumor activity in Rb-proficient malignancies. Abemaciclib was found to be effective at low doses and suitable for prolonged administration.

In the following years, Phase 1 studies investigated the use of palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib in malignancies including BC. Dose-escalation and pharmacokinetic studies determined tolerable dosing and an optimal schedule. Palbociclib and ribociclib require intermittent dosing, primarily related to rates of cytopenia (primarily neutropenia). In contrast, it was established that the safety profile (and in particular lower rates of therapy-induced neutropenia) of abemaciclib permits a continuous dosing schedule. Acceptable toxicity profiles were observed in these early phase trials. Based on findings from the MONARCH 1 (NCT02102490) phase 2 single-arm study of abemaciclib monotherapy, the FDA designated abemaciclib as a breakthrough therapy for patients with refractory HR+ ABC or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Of note, abemaciclib is the only CDK4 and 6i approved for use as a monotherapy, based on the results of this trial.

### MONARCH 3: abemaciclib as initial therapy for advanced breast cancer [^910a2bb9]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Abemaciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor, demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy and in combination with fulvestrant in women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer previously treated with endocrine therapy. Methods MONARCH 3 is a double-blind, randomized phase III study of abemaciclib or placebo plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor in 493 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had no prior systemic therapy in the advanced setting. Patients received abemaciclib or placebo (150 mg twice daily continuous schedule) plus either 1 mg anastrozole or 2.5 mg letrozole, daily. The primary objective was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Secondary objectives included response evaluation and safety. A planned interim analysis occurred after 189 events. Results Median progression-free survival was significantly prolonged in the abemaciclib arm (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.72; P = 0.000021; median: not reached in the abemaciclib arm, 14.7 months in the placebo arm). In patients with measurable disease, the objective response rate was 59% in the abemaciclib arm and 44% in the placebo arm (P = 0.004). In the abemaciclib arm, diarrhea was the most frequent adverse effect (81.3%) but was mainly grade 1 (44.6%). Comparing abemaciclib and placebo, the most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (21.1% v 1.2%), diarrhea (9.5% v 1.2%), and leukopenia (7.6% v 0.6%). Conclusion Abemaciclib plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor was effective as initial therapy, significantly improving progression-free survival and objective response rate and demonstrating a tolerable safety profile in women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.

### Palbociclib with letrozole in postmenopausal women with ER + / HER2-Advanced breast cancer: hematologic safety analysis of the randomized PALOMA-2 trial [^57d3627a]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Safety Assessment

Adverse event assessment included description of the event, duration, severity, timing, and seriousness of the AE and its relatedness to study treatment as reported by the investigator. Hematologic AEs were based on laboratory data and case report forms and summarized by worst grade severity. Neutropenia was determined based on laboratory tests of absolute neutrophil counts. Hematologic laboratory results were further verified for correct grading.

In the event of adverse reactions, dose reductions of palbociclib or placebo were permitted. Protocol‐required dose modifications for treatment‐related toxicities are shown in Figure 1. No dose adjustment for letrozole was permitted, but dosing interruptions were allowed. Discontinuations and dose reduction attributable to neutropenia and other hematologic AEs were based on data reported on case report forms.

### Phase I study of palbociclib with cisplatin or carboplatin in the management of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer [^ee0893ea]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

Winship 3263 is a phase Ib, open-label clinical trial. General eligibility criteria for the study participants for the dose escalation part I included any advanced or metastatic solid tumor after disease progression on at least one prior therapy. Their disease must also be measurable per RECIST version 1.1, and the patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0, 1, or 2. Required laboratory cut-off values were as follows: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 /µL, platelets ≥ 100 × 10⁹/L, hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL, and serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN. The serum creatinine was ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN), or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal. Key exclusion criteria included the use of strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers. We also excluded HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with palbociclib. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of life-threatening infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

Procedures

Dose escalation involved enrolling patients in cohorts of 3 subjects using a Bayesian adaptive design: the Escalation with Overdose Control (EWOC). Eligible patients received escalating doses of palbociclib in combination with different doses of cisplatin (Arm A) and carboplatin (Arm B). The starting doses were palbociclib at 100 mg given orally daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment to comprise a complete cycle of 28 days. This was given in combination with Cisplatin 60 mg/m² or Carboplatin based on Area under the curve dosing (AUC 4), given as intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1. Intrapatient dose escalation was not allowed on study. Patient assignment to Arm A or Arm B was based on slot availability for competitive enrolment, appropriateness of the patient for cisplatin versus carboplatin, and tumor histology as determined by the treating physician in consultation with the sponsor-investigator. A planned expansion phase enrolling PBT cancer was started once the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) had been determined. The aim of the expansion phase was to confirm the safety profile, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the regimen in patients with pancreato-biliary cancers.

### Tibremciclib or placebo plus fulvestrant in hormone receptor-positive and ERBB2-negative advanced breast cancer after endocrine therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^5db549b3]. JAMA Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Tibremciclib plus fulvestrant demonstrated a consistent and manageable safety profile, with lower dose reduction (18.5%) and discontinuation rates (2.2%) than those reported for other CDK4/6 inhibitors (27.9%-39.4% and 2.5%-4%, respectively). Diarrhea was the most common TEAE with tibremciclib (79.3%; grade ≥ 3, 4.9%), comparable with abemaciclib (78.8%; 1.9%) in a similar Chinese population. It typically occurred within the first month and then declined, indicating an early-onset, self-limiting pattern. Despite its effect on some patients, dose reductions were rare (2.7%), and no discontinuations due to diarrhea occurred. Neutropenia was the most common grade 3 or higher TEAE with tibremciclib (15.2%), with no febrile neutropenia and numerically lower than rates reported for palbociclib (65%), abemaciclib (29.8%), and dalpiciclib (84.2%). Grade 3 or higher leukopenia occurred in 9.2% of patients, which was also numerically lower than with palbociclib (28%), abemaciclib (22.1%), and dalpiciclib (62.1%). Another hematologic toxic effect was anemia (grade ≥ 3), which was observed in 12.0% of patients who were receiving tibremciclib plus fulvestrant, comparable with abemaciclib (10.6%) in Chinese patients. Hypokalemia, largely associated with diarrhea, occurred for 38.0% (grade ≥ 3: 12.0%; 19 grade 3 and 3 grade 4) of patients with tibremciclib, which was similar to abemaciclib in MONARCH 2 (33.6% any grade; 7% grade ≥ 3). Most hypokalemia cases were manageable: only 2.2% required dose reduction, and none led to discontinuation. Nevertheless, to effectively manage hypokalemia, early antidiarrheal treatment, routine electrolyte monitoring, and potassium supplementation on detection of hypokalemia are recommended. Additionally, blood creatinine levels were markedly elevated after treatment with tibremciclib plus fulvestrant (59.2%; grade ≥ 3, 1.1%), a rate of grade 3 or higher toxic effects that was similar to the 1.0% reported for abemaciclib plus fulvestrant in the MONARCH plus study. Tibremciclib was associated with hypertriglyceridemia, which occurred for 33.7% of patients (grade ≥ 3, 5.4%), although only 0.5% required dose reduction, and no treatment discontinuations occurred in the tibremciclib arm. In contrast, hypercholesterolemia (28.8%) and hyperlipidemia (8.2%) were less frequent and limited to grade 1 to 2 events. Most cases did not require specific intervention with drug, and only 19.4% of patients received lipid-lowering agents, primarily atorvastatin calcium and rosuvastatin calcium. In general, hypertriglyceridemia was manageable and non–treatment-limiting with appropriate monitoring. The majority of other metabolic and gastrointestinal TEAEs (eg, anorexia, weight loss, hypoalbuminemia, constipation, hyperglycemia) were grade 1 or 2, reversible, and rarely required dose adjustments. Overall, these findings suggest that tibremciclib shares a class-effect toxic effect profile with other CDK4/6 inhibitors, pending validation through direct comparative studies.

### Early treatment-related neutropenia predicts response to palbociclib [^de2081a2]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

It is important to recognise that while patients experiencing neutropenia within the first two cycles had longer PFS, it is possible that patients who did not experience neutropenia might still have received some benefit from the drug. Both studies were single-arm trials, therefore there is no control arm against which the PFS for the grade 0 neutropenia group can be compared. The basis for favourable outcomes in patients with some degree of toxicity is potentially suggested by previous studies of neutropenia in Phase 2 and Phase 2 data sets. Sun et al.used a population pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic model to study the relationship between drug levels and ANC by combining data from three different clinical trials that studied palbociclib either alone or in combination with letrozole. They found that higher levels of palbociclib exposure were associated with lower ANC values and that this neutropenia was rapidly reversible and noncumulative. In addition, there is further preclinical evidence from Hu et al.of a dose–response relationship between increasing palbociclib dose and increasing levels of neutropenia. Furthermore, Im et al. performed an analysis of the PALOMA-2 data in Asian women and found both higher rates of neutropenia as well as higher palbociclib trough concentrations compared to non-Asians. Conversely, Iwata et al.reported safety and efficacy data from PALOMA-3 comparing rates of neutropenia, relative dose intensity, and palbociclib trough concentrations between Asian and non-Asian patients. While patients in the Asian arm had higher rates of neutropenia and required more dose reductions for neutropenia than non-Asian patients, the palbociclib trough concentrations were not significantly different between the two groups.

### Palbociclib with letrozole in postmenopausal women with ER + / HER2-Advanced breast cancer: hematologic safety analysis of the randomized PALOMA-2 trial [^127e94da]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Although the CDK 4/6 inhibitors currently approved for the treatment of HR+/HER2− advanced or metastatic breast cancer share similar overall AE profiles, there are several important differences with respect to hematologic cytopenic effects [6], [7], [27], [28], [29]. For example, whereas both palbociclib (PALOMA‐2) [14] and ribociclib (phase III MONALEESA‐2) [30] had similarly high incidences of any‐grade and grade 3/4 neutropenia (80% and 66%, respectively, for palbociclib vs. 74% and 59% for ribociclib), the phase III MONARCH 3 study showed a relatively lower rate of neutropenia with abemaciclib (41% and 21%), which may potentially be due to the greater potency of abemaciclib against CDK4 versus CDK6 [29]. However, the incidence of diarrhea was much lower for palbociclib [14] and ribociclib [30] compared with abemaciclib [29] (26% and 1% for palbociclib and 35% and 1% for ribociclib vs. 81% and 10% for abemaciclib). Palbociclib also demonstrated a lower incidence of thrombocytopenia compared with abemaciclib (16% and 2% vs. 36% and 2%) [14], [29]. Because all three of these CDK 4/6 inhibitors have shown clinical benefit in the treatment of HR+/HER2− ABC [27], the choice of an appropriate CDK 4/6 agent in clinical practice will likely be driven by the PFS benefit and safety considerations given the clinical characteristics of each individual patient.

Abemaciclib exposure by the number of dose reductions

The median duration of abemaciclib treatment was 23.7 months, regardless of dose reductions. Compared to those with no dose reduction, a greater proportion of patients with one or two reductions completed the first 6 months of treatment (Table 2). At later time points, treatment retention was comparable, or even improved, in patients with dose reductions (Table 2).

Clinical efficacy, as measured by median PFS, favored the abemaciclib arm, regardless of experiencing diarrhea within the first 7 days of abemaciclib initiation (supplemental online Fig. 1). In MONARCH 2, relative to the placebo arm, PFS was improved in abemaciclib‐treated patients who experienced any‐grade diarrhea within the first 7 days (hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39–0.64) and in abemaciclib‐treated patients who did not experience any‐grade diarrhea within the first 7 days (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.48–0.77). For patients who received abemaciclib in combination with fulvestrant, the median PFS was 17.5 months among patients with an early onset of diarrhea (n = 215) and 14.8 months among patients without an early onset of diarrhea (n = 212). Similarly, in MONARCH 3, relative to the placebo arm, PFS was improved in abemaciclib‐treated patients who experienced any‐grade diarrhea within the first 7 days (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35–0.67) and in abemaciclib‐treated patients who did not experience diarrhea within the first 7 days (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43–0.78). For patients who received abemaciclib in combination with an NSAI, the median PFS was 28.2 months among patients with an early onset of diarrhea (n = 134) and 29.1 months among patients without an early onset of diarrhea (n = 183; supplemental online Fig. 1).

### Abemaciclib plus trastuzumab with or without fulvestrant versus trastuzumab plus standard-of-care chemotherapy in women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive advanced breast cancer (monarcHER): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial [^2167dfea]. The Lancet: Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more previous therapies for advanced disease have few effective treatment options. The monarcHER trial aimed to compare the efficacy of abemaciclib plus trastuzumab with or without fulvestrant with standard-of-care chemotherapy of physician's choice plus trastuzumab in women with advanced breast cancer.

Methods

This phase 2, three-group, open-label trial was done across 75 hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in 14 countries. Eligible patients were women aged 18 years or older, who had hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive advanced breast cancer with unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and who had previously received at least two HER2-targeted therapies for advanced disease. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to the abemaciclib, trastuzumab, and fulvestrant (group A), abemaciclib and trastuzumab (group B), or standard-of-care chemotherapy and trastuzumab (group C). Oral abemaciclib 150 mg 12 hourly was administered on days 1–21 of a 21-day cycle, intravenous trastuzumab 8 mg/kg on cycle 1 day 1, followed by 6 mg/kg on day 1 of each subsequent 21-day cycle, and intramuscular fulvestrant 500 mg on days 1, 15, and 29 and once every 4 weeks thereafter. Standard-of-care chemotherapy was administered as specified by the product label. Randomisation was by a computer-generated random sequence by means of an interactive web-response system and stratified by number of previous systemic therapies for advanced breast cancer and measurable versus non-measurable disease. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population, first testing group A versus group C and, if this result was significant, then group B versus group C. Safety was assessed in all patients who had received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02675231) and is ongoing for long-term survival follow-up.

Findings

Between May 31, 2016, and Feb 28, 2018, 325 patients were screened, of whom 237 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to groups A (n = 79), B (n = 79), and C (n = 79). Median follow-up was 19·0 months (IQR 14·7–25·1). The study met its primary endpoint, showing a significant difference at the prespecified two-sided α of 0·2 in median progression-free survival between group A (8·3 months, 95% CI 5·9–12·6) and group C (5·7 months, 5·4–7·0; HR 0·67 [95% CI 0·45–1·00]; p = 0·051). No difference was observed between median progression-free survival in group B (5·7 months, 95% CI 4·2–7·2) and group C (HR 0·94 [0·64–1·38]; p = 0·77). The most common grade 3–4 treatment-emergent adverse event in groups A, B, and C was neutropenia (21 [27%] of 78 patients, 17 [22%] of 77, and 19 [26%] of 72). The most common serious adverse events were: in group A, pyrexia (three [4%]), diarrhoea (two [3%]), urinary tract infection (two [3%]), and acute kidney injury (two [3%]); in group B, diarrhoea (two [3%]) and pneumonitis (two [3%]); and in group C, neutropenia (four [6%]) and pleural effusion (two [3%]). Two deaths were attributed to treatment: one due to pulmonary fibrosis in group B and one due to febrile neutropenia in group C.

Interpretation

The combination of abemaciclib, fulvestrant, and trastuzumab significantly improved progression-free survival versus standard-of-care chemotherapy plus trastuzumab while showing a tolerable safety profile. Our results suggest that a chemotherapy-free regimen might potentially be an alternative treatment option for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.

NCCN Breast Cancer — Fulvestrant with CDK 4/6 inhibitors: In patients previously exposed to prior endocrine therapy, palbociclib plus fulvestrant achieved a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.5 months versus 4.6 months for fulvestrant alone (HR, 0.46; P < .000001), with Grade 3/4 adverse events mainly neutropenia in 65% and pre- or perimenopausal patients also receiving goserelin. In MONARCH 2, abemaciclib plus fulvestrant improved PFS relative to fulvestrant alone (16.4 vs. 9.3 months; HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45–0.68), had a higher objective response rate (48% vs. 21%), and improved overall survival (46.7 vs. 37.3 months; HR, 0.757; 95% CI, 0.606–0.945).

### FDA approves abemaciclib for HR-positive, HER2-negative… [^5ac3da9b]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

On September 28, 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved abemaciclib in combination with fulvestrant for women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following endocrine therapy. In addition, abemaciclib was approved as monotherapy for women and men with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following endocrine therapy and prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. The approval in combination with fulvestrant was based on MONARCH 2, a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in women with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following endocrine therapy who had not received chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.

The trial randomized 669 patients to receive either abemaciclib or placebo orally twice daily plus intramuscular injection of 500 mg fulvestrant on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and then on day 1 of cycle 2 and beyond. Patients remained on continuous treatment with abemaciclib until development of progressive disease or unmanageable toxicity. Median progression-free survival for patients taking abemaciclib with fulvestrant was 16. 4 months compared with
9. 3 months for those taking placebo with fulvestrant with a median response duration of 8. 6 months. The recommended starting doses are 150 mg twice daily in combination with fulvestrant or 200 mg twice daily as monotherapy.

### Management of abemaciclib-associated adverse events in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer: safety analysis of MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 [^9b4d86c9]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In MONARCH 2 and 3, abemaciclib in combination with ET demonstrated a significant and clinically meaningful PFS benefit, OS advantage (MONARCH 2), and a generally tolerable safety profile [5, 6, 7, 8]. This report expands on existing knowledge by providing a more in‐depth investigation of AEs associated with abemaciclib treatment.

The abemaciclib safety profile differs from other CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors and is characterized by an increased rate of diarrhea [5, 6, 12, 13, 14]. Diarrhea, the most commonly occurring AE, typically occurred within the first 7 days of abemaciclib therapy and resolved within 2 weeks with antidiarrheal medication and/or dose‐adjustments. Importantly, no patients experienced grade 4 diarrhea. Decreasing incidence of clinically relevant diarrhea in subsequent cycles indicated low recurrence. In both MONARCH 2 and 3, the PFS benefit achieved with the addition of abemaciclib was observed regardless of early onset of diarrhea. Patients should be counseled regarding the early onset of diarrhea and to begin antidiarrheal medication at the first sign of loose stools. Dose adjustments should be considered after initiation of antidiarrheal medication if symptoms do not resolve within 24 hours of antidiarrheal therapy. It should be noted that patients may vary in the acceptance or tolerance of different grades of diarrhea, and there may be regional or ethnic differences. Although the exact mechanism for the lower rate of diarrhea with abemaciclib compared with other CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors is unknown, these results demonstrate that early and proactive management of diarrhea with antidiarrheal medications, in combination with early dose adjustments, provides an effective strategy to manage this side effect.

### Adjuvant abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy in the treatment of high-risk early breast cancer: ASCO guideline rapid recommendation update Q and a… [^40e460b8]. JCO Oncology Practice (2022). High credibility.

Adjuvant abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy — updated recommendations specify that 2 years of abemaciclib (150 mg twice daily) plus endocrine therapy (ET) may be offered to patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, node-positive early breast cancer with a high risk of recurrence and a Ki-67 score of ≥ 20% as determined by an FDA-approved test; the Panel also recommends that abemaciclib for 2 years plus ET for ≥ 5 years may be offered to the broader intent-to-treat (ITT) population at high risk of recurrence, defined as having ≥ 4 positive axillary lymph nodes, or as having 1–3 positive axillary lymph nodes with histologic grade 3 disease, tumor size ≥ 5 cm, or Ki-67 index ≥ 20%; qualifying statements note that although exploratory analyses suggested similar hazard ratios regardless of Ki-67 status, there were relatively few Ki-67 low tumors in monarchE, and when discussing treatment options, the potential benefits (improved invasive disease-free survival [IDFS]) should be weighed against the potential harms (treatment toxicity and financial cost).

### Early treatment-related neutropenia predicts response to palbociclib [^4ffabe03]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Palbociclib is highly active in oestrogen-receptor positive (ER+) metastatic breast cancer, but neutropenia is dose limiting. The goal of this study was to determine whether early neutropenia is associated with disease response to single-agent palbociclib.

Methods

Blood count and disease-response data were analysed from two Phase 2 clinical trials at different institutions using single-agent palbociclib: advanced solid tumours positive for retinoblastoma protein and advanced liposarcoma. The primary endpoint was PFS. The primary exposure variable was the nadir absolute neutrophil count (ANC) during the first two cycles of treatment.

Results

One hundred and ninety-six patients (61 breast, 135 non-breast) were evaluated between the two trials. Development of any grade neutropenia was significantly associated with longer median PFS in both the breast cancer (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11–0.74, p = 0.010) and non-breast cancer (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38–0.85, p = 0.006) cohorts. Grade 3–4 neutropenia was significantly associated with prolonged PFS in the non-breast cohort (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38–0.85, p = 0.006) but not in the breast cohort (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.51–1.47, p = 0.596). Multivariate analysis yielded similar results.

Conclusions

Treatment-related neutropenia in the first two cycles was significantly and independently associated with prolonged PFS, suggesting that neutropenia may be a useful pharmacodynamic marker to guide individualised palbociclib dosing.

### Adjuvant abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy in the treatment of high-risk early breast cancer: ASCO guideline rapid recommendation update Q and a… [^3665c7d0]. JCO Oncology Practice (2022). High credibility.

Adjuvant abemaciclib with endocrine therapy — selection of endocrine partner and venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk: In monarchE, endocrine therapy (ET) choice was left to the treating clinician, with 68.3% receiving aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy and 31.4% receiving tamoxifen as initial therapy, including 14.2% and 7.6%, respectively, in combination with ovarian suppression. A notably higher risk of VTE was observed when abemaciclib was combined with tamoxifen (any-grade VTE = 4.1%, grade ≥ 3 VTE = 2.2%) compared with AIs (any-grade VTE = 1.7%, grade ≥ 3 VTE = 0.9%). Because of these observed events, clinicians should include VTE risk assessment when deciding on a treatment regimen with patients, perhaps favoring AI use in patients receiving abemaciclib if VTE is of concern.

### Pentostatin (Nipent) [^a213e6ba]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Withholding or discontinuation of individual doses may be needed when severe adverse reactions occur. Drug treatment should be withheld in patients with severe rash, and withheld or discontinued in patients showing evidence of nervous system toxicity.

NIPENT treatment should be withheld in patients with active infection occurring during the treatment but may be resumed when the infection is controlled.

Patients who have elevated serum creatinine should have their dose withheld and a CLcrdetermined. There are insufficient data to recommend a starting or a subsequent dose for patients with impaired renal function (CLcr < 60 mL/min).

Patients with impaired renal function should be treated only when the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. Two patients with impaired renal function (CLcr50 to 60 mL/min) achieved complete response without unusual adverse events when treated with 2 mg/m2.

No dosage reduction is recommended at the start of therapy with NIPENT in patients with anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia. In addition, dosage reductions are not recommended during treatment in patients with anemia and thrombocytopenia if patients can be otherwise supported hematologically. NIPENT should be temporarily withheld if the absolute neutrophil count falls during treatment below 200 cells/mm3in a patient who had an initial neutrophil count greater than 500 cells/mm3and may be resumed when the count returns to predose levels.

### A signal-finding study of abemaciclib in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: results from CYCLONE 1 [^76bf1af5]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors radically changed the treatment paradigm for breast cancer. Similar to estrogen receptor in breast cancer, androgen receptor signaling activates cyclin D-CDK4/6, driving proliferation and resistance to hormonal manipulation in prostate cancer. This study was designed to detect signals of clinical activity for abemaciclib in treatment-refractory metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

Patients and Methods

Eligible patients had progressive mCRPC, measurable disease, and previously received ≥ 1 novel hormonal agent(s) and 2 lines of taxane chemotherapy. Abemaciclib 200 mg twice daily was administered on a continuous dosing schedule. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) without concurrent bone progression. This study was designed to detect a minimum ORR of 12.5%.

Results

At trial entry, 40 (90.9%) of 44 patients had objective radiographic disease progression, 4 (9.1%) had prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-only progression, and 20 (46.5%) had visceral metastases (of these, 60% had liver metastases). Efficacy analyses are as follows: ORR without concurrent bone progression: 6.8%; disease control rate: 45.5%; median time to PSA progression: 6.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.2-NA]; median radiographic PFS; 2.7 months (95% CI, 1.9–3.7); and median OS, 8.4 months (95% CI, 5.6–12.7). Most frequent grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (AE) were neutropenia (25.0%), anemia, and fatigue (11.4% each). No grade 4 or 5 AEs were related to abemaciclib.

Conclusions

Abemaciclib monotherapy was well tolerated and showed clinical activity in this heavily pretreated population, nearly half with visceral metastases. This study is considered preliminary proof-of-concept and designates CDK4/6 as a valid therapeutic target in prostate cancer.
