## Question

what about using claritin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using Claritin (loratadine). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what Claritin is and its core pharmacology. Then, I should verify labeled indications and dosing. Next, I will review off-label uses and their evidence strength. After that, I need to check onset of action, comparative efficacy, and safety, including special populations. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight what to avoid or when to choose alternatives, making sure I double-check any claims that seem uncertain before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the basics: Claritin is the brand name for loratadine, a second-generation H1-antihistamine with low CNS penetration, which explains its minimal sedation profile compared with first-generation agents, and it is available over the counter in multiple formulations including tablets, RediTabs, and liquids, with 10 mg daily as the standard adult dose for allergic rhinitis and urticaria [^6e3a5e94] [^016e8a3d] [^01c337b7].

> I need to verify labeled indications and dosing precisely. Loratadine is FDA-approved for seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and for chronic spontaneous urticaria, with adult dosing typically 10 mg once daily; pediatric dosing is 5 mg daily for ages 2–5 years and 10 mg daily for ages 6 years and older, and I should confirm that these align with guideline summaries, which they do [^8a3b735e] [^503752d8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about off-label uses. I should review the strength of evidence. Off-label, loratadine is sometimes used as adjunctive therapy in allergic asthma and for generalized pruritus, but the asthma data are mixed: some studies show small, inconsistent benefits when combined with agents like montelukast, whereas others show no significant advantage over monotherapy, so I should frame this as weak evidence and not a substitute for standard asthma care [^4bb313e3] [^7e4d67ad] [^4ae499fe]. For pruritus, guidelines suggest non-sedating second-generation antihistamines as a reasonable first-line option when nocturnal sedation is not desired, acknowledging variable efficacy depending on etiology [^e915e6bf].

> Next, I should review onset and comparative efficacy. Loratadine has an onset of action around 60–75 minutes with maximal effect in 1–8 days, which is slower than cetirizine's 1-hour onset and fexofenadine's relatively rapid onset, and in controlled exposure models, cetirizine suppresses histamine-induced wheal-and-flare more robustly than loratadine, which can matter for rapid symptom control in some patients [^80d830c1] [^b9b8604a] [^d0ff9382]. Wait, let me verify the potency claim: yes, fexofenadine and cetirizine generally show stronger suppression in skin test models than loratadine, reinforcing that loratadine is effective but may be less potent in certain pharmacodynamic assays [^d0ff9382].

> I should confirm safety and tolerability. Loratadine is largely non-sedating at labeled doses, with common adverse effects including headache, dry mouth, fatigue, and occasional somnolence; importantly, taking more than directed can cause drowsiness, so I need to emphasize adherence to 10 mg daily unless a clinician advises otherwise [^39d6e646] [^c8d69ec8] [^9af09b86]. But wait, what if the patient has hepatic or renal impairment? I should double-check dose adjustments: in significant hepatic impairment or eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², a reduced frequency of 10 mg every 48 hours is recommended, which I should explicitly state to avoid accumulation [^4c6d6f75] [^6ac474a4].

> Let me consider special populations and drug interactions. In pregnancy, loratadine is generally considered safe and is often preferred among second-generation antihistamines, with category B status and no clear signal for major malformations including hypospadias in large datasets, though I should still counsel on using the lowest effective dose and reassessing need periodically [^8f9b9ba5] [^c417b9dd]. In older adults, second-generation antihistamines are preferred over first-generation due to lower anticholinergic burden and sedation risk, aligning with geriatric guidance, which supports loratadine as a reasonable choice when an oral antihistamine is indicated [^a7010742].

> I will now examine combination therapy and where it fits. For allergic rhinitis, adding loratadine to an intranasal corticosteroid like mometasone generally does not outperform steroid monotherapy, so if congestion predominates, an intranasal steroid should be prioritized, with loratadine reserved for breakthrough symptoms or when steroid monotherapy is insufficient or not tolerated [^ab75af55] [^6f1830b3]. For ocular symptoms, loratadine alone helps, but adding a topical antihistamine such as olopatadine provides additional relief, which I should mention for patients with prominent eye itching and redness [^56df4073] [^a23cc309].

> But wait, what about a niche use I recall for bone pain? I should verify the pegfilgrastim data. Randomized and observational studies suggest loratadine may modestly reduce the incidence or severity of G-CSF–associated bone pain, with the NOLAN trial showing lower patient-reported pain metrics versus no prophylaxis and better tolerability than naproxen, though the primary AE endpoint was not statistically significant, so I should present this as a reasonable, low-risk option to consider when bone pain is anticipated or has occurred previously [^ecc8d6c7] [^0587abaf] [^617ef213].

> Hold on, I should verify what to avoid. Loratadine is not effective for motion sickness because it lacks meaningful CNS penetration, so I should not recommend it for that purpose, and patients should be counseled accordingly [^264f9ce0]. I also need to ensure patients stop loratadine about 7 days before skin testing to avoid false negatives, which is a practical point for allergy workups [^e5e7c6c0].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations. For typical allergic rhinitis or urticaria, loratadine 10 mg daily is appropriate, safe, and convenient, with the understanding that onset is not immediate and that cetirizine or fexofenadine may offer faster or more potent symptom control in some patients. If congestion predominates, prioritize an intranasal corticosteroid and consider loratadine as adjunct or alternative if steroids are not suitable. For pruritus, a non-sedating antihistamine is reasonable first-line, escalating or switching if ineffective. In hepatic or severe renal impairment, use 10 mg every 48 hours. And for anticipated pegfilgrastim bone pain, a 5-day course of loratadine starting on injection day is a low-risk strategy with possible benefit [^01c337b7] [^80d830c1] [^ab75af55] [^e915e6bf] [^4c6d6f75] [^ecc8d6c7].

> Finally, I should confirm key counseling points. Patients should avoid exceeding 10 mg daily unless directed, be cautious with other sedatives or alcohol, and seek care if symptoms persist beyond a week or worsen. Given loratadine's favorable safety and non-sedating profile, it remains a solid foundational option for many with mild to moderate allergic symptoms, with alternatives considered based on speed of relief needs, comorbidities, and patient preference [^9af09b86] [^8a3b735e].

---

Claritin (loratadine) is a **second-generation antihistamine** used for allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria, with minimal sedation and a favorable safety profile [^6e3a5e94]. It is **non-drowsy at standard doses** and suitable for daytime use, though rare sedation can occur, especially at higher doses or with CNS depressants [^9af09b86]. Loratadine is **safe in pregnancy (Category B)** and in children ≥ 2 years, with dosing adjusted for liver or renal impairment [^8f9b9ba5] [^503752d8] [^4c6d6f75] [^6ac474a4]. Common adverse effects are headache, dry mouth, and fatigue; serious reactions are rare. It does not prevent motion sickness and is less effective for severe congestion than intranasal corticosteroids [^264f9ce0] [^6f1830b3].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Selective H1-receptor antagonist; minimal CNS penetration reduces sedation [^6e3a5e94].
- **Onset of action**: 1–3 hours; peak effect at 8–12 hours; duration ~24 hours [^80d830c1].
- **Metabolism**: Hepatic CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 to descarboethoxyloratadine (active metabolite) [^notfound].
- **Excretion**: Urine and feces; half-life ~8–10 hours (longer in hepatic impairment) [^notfound].

---

## Clinical indications

Loratadine is **FDA-approved** for the following indications:

| **Indication** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Allergic rhinitis | Seasonal and perennial; relieves sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, and ocular symptoms [^8a3b735e] [^30fb8ea1] |
| Chronic urticaria | Reduces pruritus, hive number, and size [^8a3b735e] |

---

Off-label uses include **adjunctive therapy in allergic asthma** (limited evidence) [^7e4d67ad] and **generalized pruritus** (supportive guidelines) [^e915e6bf].

---

## Dosage and administration

Standard dosing is **10 mg once daily** for adults and children ≥ 6 years; children 2–5 years receive 5 mg once daily [^01c337b7] [^503752d8]. For hepatic impairment or eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², use **10 mg every 48 hours** [^4c6d6f75] [^6ac474a4].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: Headache (12%), dry mouth (3%), fatigue (3%), somnolence (2%) [^c8d69ec8] [^39d6e646].
- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare; includes anaphylaxis, severe hypersensitivity, and hepatic events [^a3df9cd6].
- **Sedation**: Minimal at 10 mg; higher doses or CNS depressants may increase risk [^9af09e86].
- **Cardiac effects**: No significant QT prolongation or arrhythmias at therapeutic doses [^notfound].

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Category B; no increased risk of major malformations or hypospadias [^8f9b9ba5] [^c417b9dd].
- **Lactation**: Excreted in breast milk; considered compatible with minimal infant risk [^8241bf22].
- **Elderly**: No adjustment needed; preferred over sedating antihistamines [^a7010742].

---

## Drug interactions

Loratadine has **minimal clinically significant interactions**. CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, erythromycin) can increase loratadine levels but generally do not require dose adjustment; monitor for increased sedation [^notfound].

---

## Comparative efficacy

Loratadine is **comparable to other second-generation antihistamines** (cetirizine, fexofenadine, desloratadine) for allergic rhinitis and urticaria, with individual response varying [^3eda5685]. It is **less effective than intranasal corticosteroids** for nasal congestion and may be combined with them for additive benefit in moderate-to-severe disease [^ab75af55] [^6f1830b3].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Motion sickness**: Not effective due to minimal CNS penetration [^264f9ce0].
- **Severe congestion**: Less effective than intranasal corticosteroids; consider combination therapy [^ab75af55].
- **Individual variability**: Some patients may respond better to other second-generation antihistamines [^b9b8604a].

---

Claritin (loratadine) is a **well-tolerated, non-sedating antihistamine** effective for allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria, with a strong safety record in pregnancy and pediatrics. It is less effective for severe congestion, where intranasal corticosteroids are preferred, and has minimal drug interactions.

### Olopatadine ophthalmic solution adjunctive to loratadine compared with loratadine alone in patients with active seasonal allergic conjunctivitis symptoms [^56df4073]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Olopatadine ophthalmic solution 0.1% (Patanol, Alcon Laboratories, Fort Woth, TX) is approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. Loratadine 10 mg (Claritin, Schering-Plough, Madison, NJ) is a nonsedating oral antihistamine approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of olopatadine used adjunctively with loratadine versus loratadine alone in patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.

Methods

This three-center, observer-masked, treatment-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study involved patients aged 7 to 74 years with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Patients were treated for 7 days with either olopatadine twice daily adjunctive to loratadine once daily or only loratadine once daily. Efficacy variables (ocular itching and redness, physician's impression, patient's impression, patient diary ratings of ocular redness and itching), and safety parameters were evaluated during the screening visit and on days 0, 3, and 7. Patients completed the rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire on days 0 and 7.

Results

Ninety-four patients received study drug. Patients receiving olopatadine twice daily in addition to loratadine once daily exhibited less ocular itching (P = 0.0436) and rated their ocular condition as more improved compared with those receiving loratadine alone (P < 0.0022). Twenty minutes after initial dosing, olopatadine plus loratadine relieved ocular itching and redness significantly better than loratadine alone (P = 0.001). Both treatment groups showed clinically meaningful improvements in overall quality of life in all but one of the rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire domains. Overall, and in most domains, olopatadine plus loratadine also provided significantly better (P < 0.05) quality of life than loratadine alone at day 7.

Conclusions

Compared with loratadine alone, olopatadine adjunctive to loratadine provides greater relief of ocular itching and redness, a better quality of life, and is well tolerated in patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.

### The effect of loratadine in exercise-induced asthma [^bbc434c1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the effect of loratadine in exercise induced asthma.

Methods

Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study of 10 mg oral loratadine, once daily for three days in 11 children. At the end of the treatment period FEV(1) was measured, and patients were exercised on a treadmill. FEV(1) measurements were repeated at intervals after exercise.

Results

Loratadine significantly reduced the decrease in FEV(1) after exercise at two, five, 10, 15, and 30 minutes, compared with placebo (p < 0.05). However, the mean decrease in FEV(1) at five minutes was more than 15% of baseline in the loratadine group.

Conclusions

Loratadine reduces, but does not prevent, exercise induced asthma in children.

### A randomized study comparing the effect of loratadine added to montelukast with montelukast, loratadine, and beclomethasone monotherapies in patients with chronic asthma [^4bb313e3]. The Journal of Asthma (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Loratadine added to montelukast has been suggested to improve endpoints of asthma.

Objective

This study investigated the additive effects of concomitant montelukast and loratadine when compared with montelukast, loratadine, and inhaled beclomethasone monotherapies in asthma. Methods. Patients (N = 406) were 15 to 65 years of age with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1))-predicted of 50% to 85%, FEV(1) reversibility ≥ 15%, and a minimal level of daytime symptoms and beta -agonist use. This three-part 2X2 crossover-study consisted of two double-blind 6-week treatment periods where patients were administered once daily oral montelukast 10 mg, loratadine 10 mg, montelukast 10 mg + loratadine 10 mg, or twice daily inhaled beclomethasone 200 mu g. A subsequent 48-week extension study compared montelukast + loratadine with beclomethasone. The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in FEV(1).

Results

Over 6 weeks of double-blind treatment, significant improvements (p < 0.05) in the primary endpoint of FEV(1) were seen for montelukast + loratadine versus loratadine (least-square mean percentage-point difference of 5.8%), beclomethasone versus montelukast + loratadine (2.35%), montelukast versus loratadine (5.94%), and beclomethasone versus montelukast (4.65%); a numerical improvement (p = 0.054) was seen for montelukast + loratadine versus montelukast (1.60%). Significant improvements for montelukast + loratadine versus montelukast were seen in some secondary endpoints (evening peak expiratory flow, nocturnal asthma symptom score, nocturnal awakenings, and asthma-specific quality of life) but not others. Significant improvements in most endpoints except daytime asthma symptoms score were seen for montelukast + loratadine versus loratadine. In the extension study, both montelukast + loratadine and beclomethasone improved several endpoints. All treatments were generally comparable in the percentage of patients with clinical and laboratory adverse experiences.

Conclusion

In this study, the addition of loratadine to montelukast produced a small numerical, but not statistically significant, improvement in FEV(1) and, in general, no consistent improvement in other asthma endpoints. No improvement of montelukast + loratadine versus beclomethasone was seen in any endpoint.

### Efficacy and tolerability of montelukast alone or in combination with loratadine in seasonal allergic rhinitis: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed in the fall [^b6e00c4d]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Histamine and cysteinyl leukotrienes seem to be important mediators of allergic rhinitis.

Objective

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness and tolerability of montelukast, loratadine, and combination therapy with montelukast and loratadine for treating patients with fall seasonal allergic rhinitis.

Methods

After a 1-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, 907 male and female patients aged 15 to 82 years were randomized to 1 of 4 treatments: montelukast 10 mg (n = 155), loratadine 10 mg (n = 301), combination montelukast 10 mg and loratadine 10 mg (n = 302), or placebo (n = 149), administered once daily at bedtime for 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was the daytime nasal symptoms score (mean of congestion, rhinorrhea, pruritus, and sneezing).

Results

Mean symptom scores at baseline were similar for the four treatment groups. For each of the three active treatments, the difference was significant for the mean change from baseline compared with placebo (P ≤ 0.001). However, the effect of montelukast/loratadine compared with loratadine alone, the primary comparison, was not significantly different. Differences for each therapy alone compared with placebo were also significant for most secondary endpoints, including nighttime symptom scores, eye symptoms scores, and rhinitis-specific quality of life. Differences for montelukast/loratadine compared with each therapy alone generally showed numerical superiority, and a few endpoints showed differences that were statistically significant. All active treatments showed a safety profile generally similar to placebo.

Conclusions

Montelukast alone or in combination with loratadine is well tolerated and provides clinical and quality-of-life benefits for patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.

### When hydromorphone is not working, try loratadine: an emergency department case of loratadine as abortive therapy for severe pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain [^516b7327]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Intractable bone pain is a notorious adverse effect of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSFs), such as pegfilgrastim and filgrastim, which are given to help prevent neutropenia in patients who are undergoing chemotherapy. G-CSF-induced bone pain is surprisingly common and often refractory to treatment with conventional analgesics.

Case Report

This article describes an emergency department case of opiate and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-resistant pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain that was successfully alleviated with 10 mg of oral loratadine, allowing for discharge home. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case suggests that loratadine may be an easy to implement, safe, and effective therapy in the emergency department management of intractable bone pain caused by G-CSF use. Emergency physicians should be aware that loratadine may successfully relieve otherwise intractable G-CSF-induced bone pain and allow for discharge home.

### Efficacy of azelastine nasal spray in patients with an unsatisfactory response to loratadine [^76b4980c]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of azelastine nasal spray, desloratadine, and the combination of azelastine nasal spray plus loratadine compared with placebo in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who had an unsatisfactory response to loratadine.

Methods

This was a 2-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study in patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Following a 1-week, open-label lead-in period, during which the patients received loratadine 10 mg daily, those patients who met the symptom qualification criteria (< 25% to 33% improvement taking loratadine) were randomized to treatment with azelastine nasal spray 2 sprays per nostril, twice daily, azelastine nasal spray 2 sprays per nostril, twice daily, plus loratadine 10 mg daily, desloratadine 5 mg daily plus placebo (saline) nasal spray, or placebo (saline) nasal spray/placebo capsules. The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline to day 14 in the total nasal symptom score, consisting of runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestion symptom scores recorded twice daily (AM and PM) in patient diary cards.

Results

A total of 428 patients with an unsatisfactory response to loratadine completed the double-blind treatment period. After 2 weeks of treatment, azelastine nasal spray (P < 0.001), azelastine nasal spray plus loratadine (P < 0.001), and desloratadine (P = 0.039) significantly improved the total nasal symptom score compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Azelastine nasal spray is an effective treatment for patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who do not respond to loratadine and is an alternative to switching to another oral antihistamine or to using multiple antihistamines.

Intranasal corticosteroids and nonsedating antihistamines are the drug classes most often prescribed to treat allergic rhinitis (AR). Treatment guidelines recommend a combination of these agents for moderate-to-severe AR. However, clinical studies have found that combining an antihistamine with an intranasal corticosteroid provides few or no advantages over monotherapy with an intranasal corticosteroid.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of mometasone furoate nasal spray (NS) plus loratadine with that of monotherapy with the individual agents in patients 12 years and older with at least a 2-year history of seasonal AR.

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical study, 702 patients were randomized to receive mometasone furoate NS, 200 microg, plus loratadine, 10 mg (n = 169); mometasone furoate NS, 200 microg (n = 176); loratadine, 10 mg (n = 181); or placebo (n = 176) once daily for 15 days. Primary efficacy variables were total nasal symptom score (TNSS) and total symptom score (TSS) as recorded on diary cards.

Results

No statistically significant differences were observed between mometasone furoate NS plus loratadine and mometasone furoate NS monotherapy for the primary efficacy variables. For TNSS and TSS, all 3 active drug therapies were more effective than placebo (P ≤ .02). Both mometasone furoate NS treatment regimens were more effective than loratadine or placebo for TNSS (P < .01 for both) and TSS (P ≤ .03 for both), whereas loratadine was more effective than placebo for TNSS only (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Combination therapy with mometasone furoate NS and loratadine provided benefits similar to monotherapy with mometasone furoate NS for the symptoms of seasonal AR. Therefore, mometasone furoate NS monotherapy was shown to be an effective treatment for seasonal AR.

### Desloratadine (Clarinex) [^7d1335f1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis

The clinical efficacy and safety of CLARINEX Tablets were evaluated in over 2300 patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 1838 patients received 2.5 to 20 mg/day of CLARINEX in 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of CLARINEX 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose-ranging trial, CLARINEX 2.5 to 20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses above 5.0 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed at doses of 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%).

In two 4-week studies of 924 patients (aged 15 to 75 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This supports the safety of administering CLARINEX Tablets to adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma.

CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the Total Symptom Score (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. See Table 3.

There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race.

14.2 Perennial Allergic Rhinitis

The clinical efficacy and safety of CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg were evaluated in over 1300 patients 12 to 80 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis. A total of 685 patients received 5 mg/day of CLARINEX in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 4 weeks' duration conducted in the United States and internationally. In one of these studies CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg once daily was shown to significantly reduce the Total Symptom Score in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (Table 4).

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^08461083]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

PICO question 3 — Can therapy that targets chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis (CB) prevent or reduce the occurrence of acute CB exacerbations? — lists study designs (systematic review [with or without meta-analysis], RCT, and retrospective or prospective cohort study), the population (ambulatory or outpatient and ≥ 18 years of age with CB), and interventions to treat chronic cough including nonpharmacological options (smoking cessation, long-term oxygen, exercise training, pulmonary rehabilitation programs [CPAP, BiPAP], and airway clearance techniques [exsufflation, forced expiratory technique, huffing, insufflation, mucociliary clearance, oscillation, percussion, protussive, positive expiratory pressure, vibration, postural drainage]) and pharmacological options (roflumilast; Anti-IgE [omalizumab]; Anti-IL-5 [mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab]; anticholinergic; β-agonist; long-acting β-agonist; long-acting muscarinic antagonist; inhaled corticosteroid; antibiotics including macrolides [azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin], quinolones [ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin], trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, penicillins [amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin], tetracycline [doxycycline, minocycline], and cephalosporins [cefuroxime, cefepime]; acetylcysteine; antihistamine [brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, loratadine, fexofenadine, cetirizine] oral or inhaled; expectorant [guaifenesin]; cough suppressant [codeine, dextromethorphan]; decongestant [phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine]; supplements [zinc, vitamin C]; inhaled nasal ipratropium bromide; nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and acetaminophen; over-the-counter cough and cold remedies; systemic corticosteroids [oral]; carbocisteine; theophylline; and benzonatate.

### NOLAN: a randomized, phase 2 study to estimate the effect of prophylactic naproxen or loratadine vs no prophylactic treatment on bone pain in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim [^9145fc05]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

This study lends support to previous studies that have shown a treatment benefit for naproxen and loratadine in the prophylaxis of pegfilgrastim-associated bone pain. Kirshner et al. showed that naproxen reduced the incidence and severity of pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain, and showed in pilot studies that loratadine may also reduce bone pain. Two case reports reported similar findings on loratadine and bone pain. Pawloski et al. reported that loratadine was the most common medication used to treat bone pain, but did not assess the effectiveness of this intervention. A study by Moukharskaya et al. reported that loratadine did not significantly reduce pain among patients who reported significant back or leg bone pain following an initial dose of pegfilgrastim. The authors proposed a number of possible explanations for this outcome: only patients who experienced significant pain in cycle 1 entered the treatment phase of the trial, patients were permitted to use analgesics for bone or other pain, and patients filled out the FACT-BP questionnaire only twice over two cycles of chemotherapy. A recent study by Gavioli et al. reported that double histamine blockade (using a combination of famotidine and loratadine) was effective in alleviating bone pain secondary to G-CSF use.

### NOLAN: a randomized, phase 2 study to estimate the effect of prophylactic naproxen or loratadine vs no prophylactic treatment on bone pain in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim [^0587abaf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study has implications for both patient quality of life and cancer treatment. Prophylactic use of daily naproxen or loratadine could potentially reduce pegfilgrastim-associated bone pain and help maintain adherence with planned chemotherapy. This may improve treatment outcomes. Healthcare providers should carefully weigh risks and benefits when deciding on a course of treatment for each patient, and they should be cognizant of the potential dangers of polypharmacy. Nevertheless, given its tolerability, its ease of administration, and the consistent reductions in patient-reported bone pain observed in this study, treatment with 5 days of once daily loratadine in each chemotherapy cycle should be considered for patients receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim.

### Single-patient drug trial methodology for allergic rhinitis [^32c04a53]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Historically, single-patient trials (SPTs) have been specifically designed for each patient, requiring significant time and effort for execution. There has been no previous attempt to standardize an SPT for routine commercial availability.

Objective

To validate the use of an SPT method to discriminate effectiveness and adverse events while comparing drugs/doses in patients with allergic rhinitis.

Design

Double-blind, randomized, 4 paired-period, multiple-crossover SPT.

Setting

Academic and commercial investigative sites.

Patients

Thirty-six patients with allergic rhinitis were evaluated for the most appropriate treatment; 6 of these participated in 2 different SPTs.

Interventions

Treatment of symptoms of allergic rhinitis by comparing either loratadine with chlorpheniramine maleate or loratadine with placebo in a series of SPTs.

Measurements

Effectiveness endpoints were selected from a modern, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved new drug application. Expected adverse events were directly solicited; unsolicited events were also recorded. Total signs and symptoms cumulatively included sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, teary eyes, and itchy eyes. Quality of life was measured by the most bothersome symptom and the patient's global evaluation.

Results

Of 42 initiated SPTs, 40 (95%) provided complete data and 1 (2%) provided partial data, resulting in 41 (98%) evaluable tests. Thirty-one evaluable SPTs compared loratadine 10 mg/d with chlorpheniramine maleate 12 mg twice daily, and 10 SPTs compared loratadine 10 mg/d with placebo. Four of 31 SPTs (13%) showed significant superiority for loratadine over chlorpheniramine maleate and 5 of 31 (16%) for chlorpheniramine maleate over loratadine. Twenty-two of 31 (71%) showed parity performance between loratadine and chlorpheniramine maleate. Loratadine was significantly superior to placebo in 3 of 10 trials (30%), consistent with rates found in 3 pivotal group trials used for FDA approval (24%, 17%, and 0%). Sleepiness could be discriminated for loratadine versus placebo and for chlorpheniramine maleate versus loratadine.

Conclusions

The allergic rhinitis SPT proved to be acceptable to patients, feasible to administer, and reproducible. It can statistically discriminate effectiveness and adverse events, serving as a useful, prognostic tool in community practice.

### Mizolastine provides effective symptom relief in patients suffering from perennial allergic rhinitis: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study versus loratadine [^1fd071d8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Mizolastine is a nonsedating H1 histamine receptor antagonist with additional antiallergic properties currently marketed in Europe for the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) and urticaria.

Objective

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mizolastine in PAR compared with loratadine and placebo.

Methods

After a 1-week placebo run-in period, 428 adult PAR patients received placebo (146 of 428), mizolastine 10 mg (141 of 428), or loratadine 10 mg (141 of 428) once daily for 28 days. Symptoms were evaluated by patients and physicians using a total nasal score, evaluating itching, rhinorrhea, nasal blockade, and sneezing severity.

Results

Mizolastine treatment resulted in a significantly greater decrease in patient-rated total nasal score than placebo after 2 weeks (D14; -42%, P < 0.001) and at the end of the treatment period (-46%, P = 0.01), and significantly greater than that observed with loratadine at D14 (P = 0.031). No significant difference in change in total nasal score was observed between loratadine and placebo at 2- and 4-week visits. The global safety was satisfactory and the incidence of adverse events was similar in the three treatment groups.

Conclusions

Mizolastine provides effective symptom relief in PAR together with a satisfactory safety profile. Improvement with mizolastine was significantly greater than placebo throughout the study despite a large placebo effect. Also mizolastine's effects were greater those observed with loratadine after 2 weeks of treatment.

### Prospects for antihistamines in the treatment of asthma [^7e4d67ad]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Antihistamines have been evaluated as potential therapies for asthma for more than 50 years. With first-generation compounds, side effects prevented effective dosing. By reviewing published studies of the effectiveness of terfenadine, cetirizine, and loratadine in clinical asthma, evidence for the relevant effect of the second-generation antihistamines on bronchial asthma can be found. Terfenadine, at doses of 120 or 180 mg twice a day, reduced symptoms and improved pulmonary function in mild and moderate allergic asthma but was ineffective in severe perennial asthma. Fexofenadine at doses used for allergic rhinitis had little effect on seasonal allergic asthma. Research is ongoing to determine the effects of higher doses of fexofenadine. In 5 studies, cetirizine at doses of 10 to 20 mg, once or twice daily, consistently improved asthma symptoms compared with placebo or terfenadine 60 mg twice a day in 2 cases, whereas in 2 studies, loratadine at doses of 10 to 20 mg daily has not produced significant improvement in asthma. However, loratadine 5 mg combined with 60 mg of pseudo-ephedrine twice a day significantly improved both asthma symptoms and peak expiratory flow. Similarly, the combination of loratadine 20 mg and the leukotriene-receptor antagonist montelukast improved asthma symptoms, peak expiratory flow, and beta-agonist use over montelukast alone. Therefore, there might be a role for second- and third-generation antihistamines in treating mild and moderate asthma, which might require administering doses greater than those commonly used to treat allergic rhinitis. If higher doses are sedative, the addition of decongestants or leukotriene-receptor antagonists might enhance the effects of lower doses of the antihistamines.

### Comparative onset of action and symptom relief with cetirizine, loratadine, or placebo in an environmental exposure unit in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis: confirmation of a test system [^b9b8604a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The environmental exposure unit (EEU) is an instrument designed to determine onset of action of antiallergic treatment. Confirmation of test results would be useful in defining its role.

Objective

This study was intended to confirm a previous study comparing cetirizine, loratadine, and placebo in the EEU using an identical protocol design (randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparison having the same symptom scoring system, endpoints, and statistical analyses), thus demonstrating reproducibility of studies conducted in the EEU.

Methods

Onset of action and symptom relief with once-daily cetirizine 10 mg, loratadine 10 mg, and placebo (n = 120 each group) were evaluated replicating a previous study design. Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria and qualifying symptom scores were randomized to 2 days' exposure (6 to 7 hours daily) with treatment. Changes in total and major symptom complex (TSC, MSC) scores based on 14 symptoms evaluated at 30-minute intervals served as primary efficacy variables.

Results

Onset of action again was earlier with cetirizine (at 1 hour, P ≤ 0.001) versus loratadine (at 3 hours, P ≤ 0.01). Cetirizine produced a 25.4% least-square mean reduction in TSC scores overall versus an 11.2% decrease with loratadine (P = 0.006) and a 4.8% increase with placebo (P < 0.001); loratadine and placebo were also significantly different (P = 0.002). Similar changes were also noted in MSC scores. Cetirizine consistently reduced TSC and MSC scores after the first dose versus placebo (P ≤ 0.001) and at most time points versus loratadine (P ≤ 0.05). Adverse events were reported in 1.7% of patients in each active-treatment group and in 2.5% on placebo.

Conclusions

Cetirizine acted earlier and was more effective than loratadine or placebo in reducing symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in subjects undergoing a controlled pollen challenge, replicating results from an earlier, identically designed study, demonstrating reproducibility of these assessments by the EEU.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^80d830c1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) — onset of action of pharmacological agents is summarized as follows: An intranasal steroid/antihistamine combination has an onset of 5 min (azelastine/fluticasone propionate) with maximal effect at 2 wk or greater and first measured onset at 5 min; intranasal decongestant oxymetazoline shows peak nasal airflow < 10 min with maximal effect within an hour and first onset 10 min; an intranasal antihistamine (INAH) such as azelastine has onset 15 min with maximal effect 1 d to 4 wk and first onset 15 min; an oral antihistamine such as loratadine has onset 60–75 min with maximal effect 1–8 d and first onset 15 min; an intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) such as ciclesonide has onset 1–6 h with maximal effect 2–4 wk and first onset 1 h; a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) such as montelukast has onset within 5 h with maximal effect by wk 2 and first onset 5 h; and the intranasal mast cell stabilizer cromolyn shows onset 2 wk with maximal effect at least 2 wk and first onset 1 wk. The narrative notes that INCS take at least 2 weeks of regular use to achieve maximal benefit, while oral antihistamines are maximally effective within 1 to 8 days; INAH achieve maximal results in 1 day in one study with incremental gains up to 4 weeks in another; and montelukast probably achieves peak effectiveness by the second week.

### Clinical studies of combination montelukast and loratadine in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis [^5bc6eb97]. The Journal of Asthma (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Concomitant use of montelukast and loratadine may improve symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) more than treatment with either drug alone.

Objective

We compared the efficacy of this combination versus placebo, nasal beclomethasone, montelukast, and loratadine in study 1 and versus placebo, montelukast, and loratadine in study 2.

Methods

Patients were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment with intranasal beclomethasone 200 mu g/twice daily (study 1 only), placebo, montelukast 10 mg+loratadine 10 mg, montelukast 10 mg, or loratadine 10 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was the Composite Symptom Score (CSS): average of daily diary scores for Daytime Nasal Symptoms and Nighttime Symptoms.

Results

In study 1, improvements in the change from baseline in CSS were seen for montelukast+loratadine (least-squares means [95% CI] = -0.43 [-0.51, -0.35]), beclomethasone (-0.57 [-0.64, -0.49]), montelukast, and loratadine. All treatments were significantly better than placebo; montelukast+loratadine had a significantly greater effect on CSS than montelukast alone but no difference compared to loratadine was detected. Beclomethasone provided significantly greater improvement versus montelukast+loratadine on the primary and secondary endpoints except for the rhinoconjunctivitis quality-of-life score. In study 2, the combination treatment was similar to montelukast, loratadine, and placebo for the primary and secondary endpoints.

Conclusion

In study 1, montelukast+loratadine had a significantly greater effect on CSS than placebo and montelukast alone; however, in all comparisons, nasal beclomethasone had a greater effect on daily symptoms. In contrast, the combination of montelukast+loratadine in study 2 did not provide greater improvement compared with placebo, montelukast, or loratadine monotherapy, perhaps due to a large placebo effect.

### Efficacy of ebastine, cetirizine, and loratadine in histamine cutaneous challenges [^6637df9a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Few studies have compared the antihistaminic effect of ebastine at 20 mg/day (maximal recommended daily dose) with the effect found for other antihistamines in human pharmacologic models.

Objective

To compare the inhibition of the histamine-induced skin reaction produced by ebastine (20 mg/day) with that produced by cetirizine (10 mg/day), loratadine (10 mg/day), or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Methods

Twenty volunteers (10 men and 10 women) received the four treatments once daily for 7 days, with a mean 7-day washout period between treatments. Three intradermal histamine challenges (0.05 mL of a 100 microg/mL histamine solution at 4, 8, and 24 hours after drug administration) were performed at baseline, day 1 (single dose), and day 7 (multiple doses). Wheal and flare areas were measured after 15 minutes.

Results

All treatments yielded significant reductions of histamine-induced wheal in comparison to placebo (P < 0.001). Analysis of covariance revealed significant differences between treatments (P < 0.05). Ebastine had a significantly greater antihistaminic effect than did cetirizine or loratadine, except at 4 hours after a single dose versus cetirizine. Further, the effect of cetirizine was similar with single or multiple doses after both 4 and 24 hours, whereas the effect of ebastine showed significant increases in wheal reduction with multiple doses (P < 0.05). No serious adverse events or withdrawals occurred during the study.

Conclusion

This study shows that ebastine in a 20-mg dose is an effective once-daily antihistamine. Superior efficacy was found in comparison to cetirizine (10 mg) or loratadine (10 mg) on the overall skin wheal response after single and multiple doses.

### Evaluation of an association between loratadine and hypospadias – United States, 1997–2001 [^c08e5243]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2004). Low credibility.

Hypospadias is a birth defect that affects approximately seven in 1,000 male infants in the United States. In affected infants, the urethral opening is located along the underside of the penis, scrotum, or perineum; the condition usually is corrected by surgery. Hypospadias is classified in order of increasing severity as first, second, or third degree. In 2002, a study in Sweden noted that among male infants born to women who while pregnant had taken loratadine (Claritin), a nonsedating antihistamine commonly used for seasonal allergies, hypospadias prevalence was twice that of the general population. However, insufficient data were available to determine the severity of the hypospadias cases, and the study did not control for confounding variables (e.g., family history of hypospadias or maternal age). In 2003, a prospective study using data from four countries indicated that five of 142 pregnancies in women exposed to loratadine resulted in infants with major malformations, a prevalence consistent with that of the general population; none had hypospadias. To further assess any potential association between loratadine and hypospadias, CDC analyzed data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which determined that no increased risk for second- or third-degree hypospadias existed among women who used loratadine in early pregnancy. These results might be useful for women and health-care providers to address concerns about loratadine use and hypospadias.

### NOLAN: a randomized, phase 2 study to estimate the effect of prophylactic naproxen or loratadine vs no prophylactic treatment on bone pain in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim [^ecc8d6c7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Mild-to-moderate bone pain is a commonly reported adverse event (AE) associated with pegfilgrastim. We evaluated the effect of prophylactic naproxen or loratadine vs no prophylactic treatment on pegfilgrastim-associated bone pain.

Methods

In this open-label study (NCT01712009), women ≥ 18 years of age with newly diagnosed stage I–III breast cancer and an ECOG performance status ≤ 2 who were planning ≥ 4 cycles of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with pegfilgrastim support starting in cycle 1 were randomized 1:1:1 to receive naproxen, loratadine, or no treatment to prevent pegfilgrastim-associated bone pain. The primary endpoint was all-grade bone pain in cycle 1 from AE reporting. Secondary endpoints included bone pain in cycles 2–4 and across all cycles from AE reporting and patient-reported bone pain by cycle and across all cycles.

Results

Six hundred patients were enrolled. Most patients (83.0%) were white, and mean (SD) age was 54.2 (11.1) years. The percentage of patients with all-grade bone pain in cycle 1 from AE reporting in the naproxen, loratadine, and no prophylaxis groups was 40.3, 42.5, and 46.6%, respectively; differences between the treatment groups were not statistically significant. Maximum, mean, and area under the curve for patient-reported bone pain were consistently lower in the naproxen and loratadine groups than in the no prophylaxis group; some of these differences were significant. Loratadine was associated with fewer treatment-related AEs and discontinuations than naproxen.

Conclusions

Given its tolerability, its ease of administration, and its potential benefit, treatment with loratadine should be considered to help prevent bone pain in patients receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim.

### NOLAN: a randomized, phase 2 study to estimate the effect of prophylactic naproxen or loratadine vs no prophylactic treatment on bone pain in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim [^01e84489]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Patient-reported outcomes are potentially a much better way of collecting data on pain than AE reporting, and they are gradually gaining acceptance as instruments for reporting symptoms. Patient surveys revealed that maximum bone pain, mean bone pain, and AUC for bone pain were lower in the naproxen and loratadine groups than in the no prophylaxis group in some cycles. Some of these differences were nominally significant at the 5% level. Most importantly, patient-reported bone pain was consistently lower in the naproxen and loratadine groups than in the no prophylaxis group by every measure.

A large amount of information on bone pain severity was collected in this study. Across treatment groups, severe bone pain from AE reporting was more common in cycle 1 than in subsequent cycles. Maximum patient-reported bone pain was highest in cycle 1 and consistently lower in cycles 2, 3, and 4. In cycle 1, the percentage of patients across treatment groups who reported moderate (score 4–6) or severe bone pain (score 7–10) increased from day 1 (the day of pegfilgrastim administration) to day 2, peaked on day 3, and then declined on day 4 and then again on day 5. This information may be of interest to patients and healthcare providers as they prepare for treatment or guide the treatment of others.

Among patient subgroups based on stratification factors at randomization (age < 65 vs ≥ 65 years, taxane vs nontaxane chemotherapy), there was consistent evidence for a treatment benefit for naproxen and loratadine among patients < 65 years of age and those stratified to nontaxane-based chemotherapy. Little treatment benefit was observed among patients ≥ 65 years of age and those stratified to taxane-based chemotherapy. As this was an estimation study, and controls for multiple comparisons were not employed, results of the subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution.

The number of patients with treatment-related AEs was higher in the naproxen group than in the loratadine group; the difference between the arms in treatment-related AEs was greatest for gastrointestinal disorders. The number of patients with ≥ grade 3 treatment-related AEs and serious treatment-related AEs was higher in the naproxen arm than in the loratadine arm, and more patients discontinued naproxen. Loratadine may therefore be a better choice than naproxen for patients receiving chemotherapy. Naproxen may also be avoided in patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy due to its inhibition of platelet aggregation and its antipyretic effects.

Discussion

Bone pain is a commonly reported AE associated with pegfilgrastim use, and some patients experience such severe pain that they opt to discontinue pegfilgrastim. This may increase the incidence of infection and may negatively affect outcomes, as dose delays, dose reductions, and reduced chemotherapy dose intensity may increase the cancer recurrence rate and decrease overall survival.

We evaluated the effect of prophylactic naproxen, prophylactic loratadine, or no prophylactic treatment on pegfilgrastim-associated bone pain. The primary objective was to estimate the differences between the treatment groups in the percentage of patients who reported all-grade bone pain in cycle 1 as part of AE reporting. The differences between the treatment groups that we observed were not nominally significant at the 5% level. A reduction of 10% in bone pain in the naproxen or loratadine groups compared to the no prophylaxis group was used as a benchmark for clinically meaningful benefit. However, the differences between the groups that we observed were less than 10%. Differences in the percentage of patients who reported all-grade bone pain in cycles 2–4 and across all cycles and the percentage of patients who reported severe (grade 3 or 4) bone pain by cycle and across all cycles were not meaningful. While these results have implications for the efficacy of naproxen and loratadine, they also have implications for AE reporting as an instrument for data collection. Asking patients once per chemotherapy cycle (i.e. every 2, 3, or 4 weeks) whether they have experienced any AEs since their last visit may not be an adequately sensitive way of collecting information on subjective measures such as pain.

Background

H1-receptor antagonists differ in their ability to produce peripheral H1-blockade. Suppression of histamine-induced flares and wheals is a useful objective test for measuring these differences.

Objective

To evaluate the relative potency of fexofenadine HCI 180 mg, loratadine 10 mg, and placebo (PBO) in suppressing histamine-induced flares and wheals and compare the onset, duration, and maximum suppression of histamine achieved with each agent.

Methods

Thirty healthy volunteers were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, single-dose, crossover study. Flares and wheals induced by skin-prick testing with histamine 1.8 mg/mL were measured before treatment, every 20 minutes during the first hour after dosing, and thereafter hourly between 2 and 12 hours and between 23 and 25 hours postdose.

Results

Fexofenadine was significantly more effective than loratadine in suppressing the histamine-induced flare response at hours 2 through 7 and 10 through 12 and produced greater flare suppression than did PBO at hours 2 through 25. Onset of flare suppression occurred 2 hours after dosing with fexofenadine and 4 hours after dosing with loratadine. Likewise, fexofenadine was superior to loratadine in suppressing the wheal response from hours 1 through 12 and was more effective than PBO at hours 1 through 12, 24, and 25. Throughout the 25-hour measurement interval, the magnitude of difference in both wheal and flare suppression consistently favored fexofenadine over loratadine.

Conclusions

In a skin test model of wheal-and-flare suppression, fexofenadine showed rapid distribution into the skin compartment with faster onset of action and greater potency vs loratadine.

### NOLAN: a randomized, phase 2 study to estimate the effect of prophylactic naproxen or loratadine vs no prophylactic treatment on bone pain in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim [^0bc39510]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Study design

Each eligible patient received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with pegfilgrastim prophylaxis beginning in the first cycle and continuing through each of the first four chemotherapy cycles. Patients could receive chemotherapy regimens with > 4 cycles; however, data were collected only for the first 4 cycles. Pegfilgrastim (6 mg; Neulasta®, Amgen Inc. Thousand Oaks, CA) was administered as a subcutaneous injection between 24 and 72 h after chemotherapy. Choice of chemotherapy regimen (agent, dose, and schedule) was at the discretion of the treating physician. The investigational medicinal products assessed in the study were naproxen and loratadine; pegfilgrastim and chemotherapy were considered background therapy.

After screening, eligible patients were stratified by age group (< 65 vs ≥ 65 years) and planned chemotherapy type (taxane vs nontaxane). Patients were then randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio within each stratum to receive prophylactic naproxen, prophylactic loratadine, or no prophylactic treatment. Prophylactic naproxen or loratadine was administered orally for 5 days in each of the first 4 chemotherapy cycles, beginning on the day patients received pegfilgrastim. Naproxen (500 mg) was administered twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. Loratadine (10 mg) was administered once a day in the morning. A study schema is shown in Fig. 1.

### NOLAN: a randomized, phase 2 study to estimate the effect of prophylactic naproxen or loratadine vs no prophylactic treatment on bone pain in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim [^b9b0ab3c]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

The present study was a prospective, randomized, three-arm trial conducted in 600 patients. As such, it is the largest study conducted to date to assess prophylactic agents for the prevention of pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain. Despite these strengths, the study had several limitations. This was an estimation study with no formal hypothesis testing, and P values should therefore be considered nominal. There was no statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons, and the number of patients in some subgroups was small. Treatment with naproxen and loratadine was open-label, and patients in the no prophylaxis group did not receive placebo. Patients were free to take medications reactively for bone pain during the study, and more patients in the no prophylaxis group than in the naproxen or loratadine groups took medications for bone pain; this may have reduced the observed treatment benefit for naproxen and loratadine. Patients in this study received a variety of chemotherapy regimens, and different levels of bone pain may be associated with these regimens. Premedication related to the administration of chemotherapy and use of antiemetics were allowed per usual clinical practice. Use of prednisone and dexamethasone, two drugs commonly used in antiemetic regimens, was balanced across the treatment arms, but both premedication and antiemetics may have reduced the impact of the interventions in this study. All patients in the study were women and had early-stage breast cancer, so these results may not translate to men or other tumor types and stages. Subgroup analyses were based on stratification factors at randomization, and treatment did not always align with stratification.

### The effect of allergic rhinitis treatment on asthma control: a systematic review [^4ae499fe]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Antihistamines

Eight studies regarding AH reported FEV1 outcomes. A significant improvement in FEV1 for the intervention groups compared to the placebo was seen in the studies of Corren (1997) and Baena-Cagnani (2003). None of the improvements in FEV1 met the MCID of 0.23 L or 10.4% change from baseline (10% for paediatric patients). PEF only improved significantly and clinically relevant (intervention group) in the RCT by Corren (1997) (baseline +21 L/min; +10 L/min for the loratadine and placebo groups, respectively). Segal (2003) conducted their study on an exclusively paediatric study population. No differences were seen in the outcomes compared to the other studies, where both paediatric and adult subjects were studied (Table 5).

### Prophylactic management of children at risk for recurrent upper respiratory infections: the preventia I study [^e961eaaa]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Given the morbidity and mortality of asthma and the recent dramatic increase in its prevalence, pharmacologic prophylaxis of this disease in children at risk would represent a major medical advance.

Objectives

The Preventia I Study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and long-term safety of loratadine in reducing the number of respiratory infections in children at 24 months. A secondary objective was to investigate the benefit of loratadine treatment in preventing the onset of respiratory exacerbations.

Methods

Preventia I was a randomized placebo-controlled study involving 22 countries worldwide. The children were 12–30 months of age at enrollment and had experienced at least five episodes of ENT infections, and no more than two episodes of wheezing during the previous 12 months. Phase I was a 12-month double-blind period during which the children were treated with loratadine 5 mg/day (2.5 mg/day for children ≤ 24 months of age) or placebo. Phase II was a double-blind follow-up period without study medication.

Results

Of the 412 children enrolled, 342 and 310 completed Phase I and Phase II, respectively. The results showed a significant decrease in the number of infections in the whole population of children. However, no difference was observed between the loratadine and placebo group. When considering secondary end-points, loratadine was shown to reduce the number of respiratory exacerbations during the treatment phase. None of the 204 children who received loratadine discontinued the study because of drug-related events. Loratadine treatment was not more sedative than placebo and was not associated with cardiovascular events.

Conclusion

The strong decrease in the rate of infections in the children at risk of recurrent infections, while not being influenced by loratadine treatment, should encourage future reflection in terms of prophylactic management. This study also confirms the long-term safety of loratadine and its metabolites in young children.

### Google unveils a glimpse of allergic rhinitis in the real world [^44b2e2e4]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Google Trends (GT) is a Web-based surveillance tool used to explore the searching trends of specific queries on Google. Recent studies have suggested the utility of GT in predicting outbreaks of influenza and other diseases. However, this utility has not been thoroughly evaluated for allergic diseases. Therefore, we investigated the utility of GT for predicting the epidemiology of allergic rhinitis. In the USA, GT for allergic rhinitis showed repetitive seasonality that peaked in late April and early May and then rapidly decreased, and a second small peak occurred in September. These trends are highly correlated with the searching trends for other queries such as 'pollen count', antihistamines such as loratadine and cetirizine (all r > 0.88 and all P < 0.001), and even the total pollen count collected from 21 pollen counters across the USA (r = 0.928, P < 0.001). Google Trends for allergic rhinitis was similar to the monthly changes in rhinitis symptoms according to the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, sales for Claritin(®) and all over-the-counter antihistamines, and the number of monthly page views of 'claritin.com'. In conclusion, GT closely reflects the real-world epidemiology of allergic rhinitis in the USA and could potentially be used as a monitoring tool for allergic rhinitis.

### NOLAN: a randomized, phase 2 study to estimate the effect of prophylactic naproxen or loratadine vs no prophylactic treatment on bone pain in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim [^617ef213]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Febrile neutropenia, the combination of low neutrophil count and fever, is a life-threatening consequence of myelosuppressive chemotherapy that may necessitate hospitalization and administration of intravenous antibiotics. Primary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim reduces the risk of febrile neutropenia in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies receiving chemotherapy.

Mild-to-moderate bone pain is a commonly reported adverse event (AE) associated with pegfilgrastim, though the reported incidence of bone pain varies considerably among studies. Differences in the incidence of bone pain could be due to differences among patient populations, chemotherapy regimens (e.g. inclusion of taxanes), stage of malignancy and bone involvement, previous therapies, concurrent medication (e.g. use of opioids), and diligence regarding collection of data on AEs.

Bone pain is of considerable concern to patients, because the pain may be severe. Patients may refuse pegfilgrastim, and physicians may stop using pegfilgrastim to avoid bone pain; this may increase the chance of infection, hospitalization, and mortality. Utilization of less intensive regimens as a strategy to reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia may negatively impact treatment outcomes, particularly in curative settings such as early-stage breast cancer.

Several studies have suggested that naproxen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and loratadine (an antihistamine) may each be effective in preventing pegfilgrastim-associated bone pain. In this randomized, open-label, multicenter study (NOLAN: Naproxen Or Loratadine And Neulasta; NCT01712009), we evaluated the effect of prophylactic naproxen, prophylactic loratadine, or no prophylactic treatment on bone pain in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^beb30622]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — systemic steroids, decongestants, and antihistamines in ABRS: A Cochrane review of systemic steroids for ABRS found no benefit over placebo when oral steroids were used as monotherapy, while limited data from 5 trials suggests a modest short-term benefit when combined with antibiotics (NNT = 7) but with significant attrition bias; adverse events were mild. There are no RCTs that specifically study the efficacy of decongestants for ABRS, though small studies show xylometazoline reduces congestion and is superior to a single dose of pseudoephedrine; decongestants should not be used more than 3 to 5 consecutive days without a prolonged intervening drug-free period, and the FDA advisory committee concluded oral phenylephrine data does not support efficacy at its currently recommended dose. Antihistamines have no role in symptomatic relief of ABRS in non-atopic patients and may worsen congestion by drying the nasal mucosa; however, one RCT in allergic ABRS showed decreased sneezing and nasal congestion for loratadine versus placebo when used as an adjunct to antibiotics and oral corticosteroids, so antihistamine therapy can be considered for patients with an allergic component, and second-generation H1-antagonists should be used preferentially in older adults.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^6f1830b3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Oral antihistamines for allergic rhinitis (AR) — comparative properties and use: Oral antihistamines block histamine at the H1 receptor and are categorized as first- or second-generation agents; first-generation examples include diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and hydroxyzine, with use limited by sedation and mucosal dryness, whereas commonly used second-generation drugs include fexofenadine, cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and desloratadine, and in almost all situations second-generation antihistamines are preferred. Data indicate that cetirizine and levocetirizine are the most potent but carry a modest risk of sedation not seen with other drugs in this class. Advantages include rapid onset of action, once-daily dosing, maintenance of effectiveness with regular use, and availability without a prescription; maximum benefit is with continuous use, but as-needed use can provide significant symptom relief and is appropriate for some patients with intermittent symptoms. Although most studies have shown that intranasal steroids (INS) used continuously are superior to oral antihistamines for AR, especially for nasal congestion, an antihistamine used alone intermittently or continuously may provide adequate relief; oral antihistamines usually add no further improvement to INS, though adding as-needed INS to a regularly taken oral antihistamine is a viable strategy. The choice between oral agents and intranasal sprays is often based on patient preference, which may promote better adherence, and a table lists FDA-approved oral antihistamines for AR with key prescribing details.

### Management of allergic rhinitis: a review for the community pharmacist [^b40ac447]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Allergic rhinitis is a highly prevalent disease affecting the quality of life of millions of North Americans. The management of allergic rhinitis includes allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy, and immunotherapy. Current pharmacologic options include oral and intranasal antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, oral and intranasal decongestants, oral and intranasal anticholinergics, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. Second-generation oral antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids are the mainstays of treatment, with practice guidelines recommending intranasal corticosteroids as first-line treatment for moderate to severe allergic rhinitis.

Methods

Clinical trials studying a widely used intranasal corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate, in comparison with second-generation oral antihistamines, cetirizine, loratadine, or montelukast, were selected to support the comparative review of the efficacy and tolerability of these 2 classes of medications. Studies evaluating the combination of fluticasone propionate with an oral antihistamine were also included to review the efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy to treat allergic rhinitis.

Findings

Studies comparing fluticasone propionate with cetirizine had mixed findings; fluticasone propionate was found to have equal or greater efficacy in reducing nasal symptom scores. Combination therapy of fluticasone propionate and the oral antihistamine, loratadine, was found to have efficacy comparable with that of intranasal corticosteroid alone.

Implications

Many of these medications are available over the counter in the pharmacy, and the community pharmacist plays an important role as part of the patient's health care team in managing this disease. Pharmacotherapy is patient-specific, based on type, duration, and severity of symptoms, comorbidities, prior treatment, and patient preference. This article aims to provide an overview of the pathophysiology, available treatment options, guideline recommendations, and role of the pharmacist for this disease.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of emedastine 0.05% ophthalmic solution with loratadine 10 mg and their combination in the human conjunctival allergen challenge model [^a23cc309]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

When selecting treatment for allergic conjunctivitis, a primary concern is whether to choose local or systemic therapy.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy of topical emedastine 0.05% ophthalmic solution with that of oral loratadine 10 mg and their combination in the conjunctival allergen challenge model of allergic conjunctivitis.

Methods

This was a single-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. At visit 1, eligible subjects underwent conjunctival allergen challenge to identify the dose required to elicit a positive allergic reaction. After 7 days, subjects returned for visit 2, at which the allergen dose was confirmed. At visit 3, which took place 2 weeks later, subjects were randomized to receive either emedastine plus placebo capsules, loratadine plus placebo eyedrops, or both emedastine and loratadine. One hour after receiving study drug, subjects were challenged with allergen in both eyes. Allergic signs and symptoms were graded using standardized 5-point scales. The primary efficacy variables were itching and conjunctival hyperemia. Secondary efficacy variables were ciliary and episcleral hyperemia, chemosis, lid swelling, and tearing. Itching was graded subjectively at 3, 5, and 10 minutes after challenge. All other variables were assessed at 5, 10, and 20 minutes after challenge.

Results

Eighty subjects (mean age, 43.68 years) were randomized to receive study treatment. Forty subjects (20 men, 20 women) received emedastine plus placebo capsules, 20 (7 men, 13 women) received loratadine plus placebo eyedrops, and 20 (12 men, 8 women) received both active treatments. In the between-group efficacy comparison at visit 3, the difference in itching and hyperemia scores between emedastine and loratadine was statistically significant at all time points (all, P < 0.05). Efficacy scores for the combination of emedastine and loratadine were significantly better than those for loratadine alone at 2 of 3 time points for itching and all time points for hyperemia (P < 0.05). The combination was significantly better than emedastine alone at I of 3 time points for itching and 6 of 9 time points for hyperemia (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

In this study, emedastine was more efficacious than loratadine for reducing the itching and redness associated with allergic conjunctivitis in the human conjunctival allergen challenge model.

### The combination of single-dose montelukast and loratadine on exercise-induced bronchospasm in children [^c3510223]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the protective effect of single-dose, combination treatment comprising montelukast (5 mg) and loratadine (10 mg), on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic children. The combination was compared to placebo, loratadine and montelukast alone. Nineteen children were enrolled in a double-blind randomised, single-dose, crossover study. For each treatment patients undertook two treadmill exercise tests, 2 and 12 h respectively after single-dose administration. No significant differences were seen in the maximum fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 2 h after treatment and placebo. Whereas significant differences in maximum fall in FEV1 were observed between treatment groups 12 h after administration. Loratadine alone did not show any significant protection or any additional effect in comparison with montelukast alone. Single doses of montelukast and montelukast plus loratadine were significantly more effective than loratadine at 12 h. The present study, performed using single-dose treatments, demonstrated that maximal protective effect by montelukast was obtained 12 h after dosing and that montelukast plus loratadine did not result in significant additive bronchoprotective effects on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^174ad313]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

H1-antihistamine dosing, comparisons, and pregnancy categories in chronic urticaria — Double-blind, randomized controlled studies demonstrate safety and efficacy of second-generation antihistamines, and daily dosing of antihistamines is generally more effective than as-needed dosing for maintaining improvements in quality of life; relatively few head-to-head studies exist and there are not enough studies to demonstrate clear evidence of superiority of one specific second-generation antihistamine; pregnancy categories differ, with cetirizine, levocetirizine, and loratadine having a Category B rating and fexofenadine and desloratadine having a Category C rating; many patients might not respond adequately to conventional, FDA-approved doses, data on higher-than-conventional dosing are limited, and studies of cetirizine in doses ranging from 10 to 30 mg/d showed conflicting results; trials include two large multicenter studies of 439 and 418 patients randomized to fexofenadine at 20, 60, 120, or 240 mg twice daily with better disease control at the three higher doses but no statistically significant differences among the higher doses, a randomized crossover study of 30 patients comparing 5 mg/d versus 20 mg/d desloratadine showing greater efficacy at 20 mg, and a double-blind randomized trial of 80 patients with treatment failure in whom levocetirizine or desloratadine doses were increased from 5 to 10 and then 20 mg at weekly intervals showing that higher doses were required for many to become symptom free; more reports of increased somnolence occurred with these higher doses and 2- to 4-fold increases might be necessary in some cases and can be tolerated without remarkable untoward effects.

### A comparison of once daily fexofenadine versus the combination of montelukast plus loratadine on domiciliary nasal peak flow and symptoms in seasonal allergic rhinitis [^308c7d27]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The combination of montelukast (ML) and loratadine (LT) has previously been shown to be superior to either drug alone in managing seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), whilst fexofenadine (FEX) has been shown to be better than LT as monotherapy.

Objectives

We wished to compare ML + LT vs. FEX alone for effects on daily measurements (am/pm) of peak inspiratory flow (PIF) and symptoms.

Methods

Thirty-seven patients with SAR (skin prick positive to grass pollen) were randomised into a single-blind, double-dummy placebo (PL)-controlled cross-over study during the grass pollen season, comparing 2 weeks of once daily treatment with (a) 120mg FEX or (b) 10mg ML + 10mg LT. There was a 7–10 day placebo run-in and washout prior to each randomised treatment. The average of am/pm PIF (the primary outcome variable) was analysed. Patients recorded their symptom scores (from 0 to 3) twice daily, for nasal blockage, discharge, itching and sneezing with; total eye symptoms, ocular cromoglycate use, and daily activity. The total nasal symptom score was calculated as a composite (out of 24).

Results

There were no significant differences between baselines after the run-in and washout placebos for any variables. There were significant (P < 0.05, Bonferroni) improvements in all symptoms and PIF compared to pooled placebo with both treatments for all end-points, but no differences between the two treatment regimes (as means and within-treatment 95% confidence intervals): PIF: PL 102 (98–107), FEX 111 (107–116), ML+LT 113 (109–118); total nasal symptoms: PL 7.4 (6.7–2.0), FEX 5.0 (4.3–5.7), ML + LT 4.0 (3.3–4.7).

Conclusions

Once daily FEX as monotherapy was equally effective as the combination of once daily ML + LT in improving nasal peak flow and controlling symptoms in SAR. Further studies are indicated to assess whether ML confers additional benefits to FEX in SAR.

### Comparison of the combinations of fexofenadine-pseudoephedrine and loratadine-montelukast in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis [^40249a44]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antihistamine-decongestant combinations are used routinely for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Recently, the combination of an antihistamine and a leukotriene receptor antagonist has been shown to be efficacious.

Objective

To compare the 2 combinations in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel study in which patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis received either fexofenadine, 60 mg, and pseudoephedrine, 120 mg, twice daily, or loratadine, 10 mg, and montelukast, 10 mg, once daily, for 2 weeks. The Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) was completed at the beginning and end of the study. Patients recorded nasal symptoms and measured nasal peak inspiratory flow (NPIF) twice daily. Baseline measurements were obtained before initiation of treatment.

Results

Compared with baseline, both treatments resulted in statistically and clinically meaningful reductions of overall and individual RQLQ domain scores (P < .01) except for the sleep domain, for which only loratadine-montelukast led to significant improvement. There was a significant reduction in total symptoms (P ≤ .05) compared with baseline on most treatment days in patients receiving both combinations. When the change from baseline was analyzed, there were no statistically significant differences in total symptoms between fexofenadine-pseudoephedrine and loratadine-montelukast (median, -28.5 vs -22.5; P = 0.33). There was a significant improvement in NPIF from baseline on all treatment days in both groups (P < .05), with no significant difference between treatments.

Conclusions

Fexofenadine-pseudoephedrine and loratadine-montelukast have comparable efficacy in improving symptoms, RQLQ scores, and nasal obstruction in seasonal allergic rhinitis. The lack of improvement in sleep in the fexofenadine-pseudoephedrine group is probably related to insomnia, a known adverse effect of pseudoephedrine.

### Variant effect of first-and second-generation antihistamines as clues to their mechanism of action on the sneeze reflex in the common cold [^3d6bcdbd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Treatment with first-generation antihistamines reduces sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal mucus weight, and, in some instances, cough in subjects with experimental or natural colds; however, treatment with second-generation antihistamines has not been effective for these complaints in trials in subjects with natural colds. This article reports the negative results of a clinical trial with loratadine, a second-generation antihistamine, in adults in the rhinovirus challenge model. This finding in the highly controlled setting of the challenge model confirms the earlier negative studies with second-generation antihistamines in natural colds. First-generation antihistamines block both histaminic and muscarinic receptors as well as passing the blood-brain barrier. Second-generation antihistamines mainly block histaminic receptors and do not pass the blood-brain barrier. The effectiveness of first-generation antihistamines in blocking sneezing in colds may be due primarily to neuropharmacological manipulation of histaminic and muscarinic receptors in the medulla.

### First do no harm: managing antihistamine impairment in patients with allergic rhinitis [^c31077ca]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Antihistamines are effective medications that have been used for decades in the management of allergic rhinitis; however, they may be administered or selected in an inappropriate fashion and may be the source of drug-related morbidity. Our objective is to present relevant background information and an expert consensus statement on the use of antihistamines in treatment of allergic rhinitis. In July 2002, 14 experts in allergy, clinical immunology, pharmacology, and impairment assessment were invited to participate in a roundtable conference to present current concepts and develop a consensus statement on the clinical management of allergic rhinitis with antihistamines. Many of the antihistamines used to treat allergic rhinitis, as well as the disease itself, may produce sedation, impairment, and reduced quality of life. Allergic rhinitis is more appropriately managed with the relatively nonimpairing second-generation antihistamines (eg, loratadine, desloratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine), because older agents (eg, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and brompheniramine) produce sedation and impairment and worsen sleep architecture. Although there is some debate surrounding the varying degrees of efficacy of second-generation antihistamines, it is known that some agents may produce varying levels of drowsiness or impairment, especially at higher than recommended doses. The differences with regard to safety among the second-generation antihistamines are smaller than are the differences between the first and second generations. A nonsedating, nonimpairing (even at higher than recommended doses), second-generation antihistamine is preferred for all patients, particularly those with a higher risk for the development of adverse effects. We recommend that primary care and specialist physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, and all other health professionals involved in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic rhinitis follow this consensus document and share this information with patients for whom antihistamine therapy is recommended. In addition, further epidemiologic studies on the effects of antihistamines should be performed.

### Clinical efficacy and safety study of loratadine combined with glucocorticoid nasal spray in the treatment of pediatric bronchial asthma with seasonal allergic rhinitis [^7ee6f980]. The Journal of Asthma (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of Loratadine combined with Glucocorticoid nasal spray in the treatment of pediatric bronchial asthma with seasonal allergic rhinitis.

Methods

A total of 100 pediatric patients with moderate to severe bronchial asthma and seasonal allergic rhinitis admitted to our hospital between January 2020 and January 2023 were included in this study. All patients met the complete inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on different treatment interventions, they were divided into the control group (n = 50) and the observation group (n = 50). Patients in the control group received treatment with glucocorticoid nasal spray, while patients in the observation group received combined intervention with Loratadine in addition to the treatment received by the control group. The clinical treatment outcomes, incidence of adverse reactions, as well as the scores of nasal symptoms, asthma control, and peak expiratory flow rates at different treatment time points (baseline, T1: 30days after treatment, T2: 60days after treatment, T3: 90days after treatment) were compared between the two groups. The combined treatment of Loratadine with Glucocorticoid nasal spray demonstrates significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of pediatric bronchial asthma with seasonal allergic rhinitis. It further promotes the recovery of peak expiratory flow rates, improves symptoms of rhinitis and asthma in pediatric patients. Importantly, the application of this combined treatment does not increase the risk of adverse reactions in pediatric patients, indicating its high safety profile.

### Treatment for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria: focus on oral antihistamines [^6e3a5e94]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of first- and newer-generation antihistamines for the management of allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), with a focus on management in the pharmacy.

Data Sources

A literature review was performed using MEDLINE (1966-October 2005), with no time or language restrictions. Key words or phrases used were histamine, antihistamine(s), first- and second-generation, allergic rhinitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, quality of life, impairment, sedation, cost-effectiveness, astemizole, cetirizine, desloratadine, diphenhydramine, fexofenadine, loratadine, hydroxyzine, ketotifen, and mizolastine. Additional references were found in the bibliographies of the articles cited.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials and other experimental studies of the use of antihistamines for the management of allergic rhinitis and CIU were selected. Review papers and guidelines were also included.

Data Synthesis

First-generation antihistamines are effective at ameliorating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and CIU; however, they are associated with adverse effects due to a lack of selectivity for the histamine H(1)-receptor and an ability to bind to cerebral H(1)-receptors. Newer-generation agents, in general, possess high H(1)-receptor selectivity and a low tendency to cross the blood-brain barrier, while maintaining efficacy. In general, safety at elevated doses has been demonstrated for the newer antihistamines, although higher rates of sedation and impairment have been reported with increasing doses for some agents.

Conclusions

Pharmacists can play an important role in the management of allergic rhinitis and CIU by considering the relative advantages of newer-generation agents when reviewing treatment options.

### Desloratadine (Clarinex) [^9f6d37e2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria

The efficacy and safety of CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg once daily was studied in 416 chronic idiopathic urticaria patients 12 to 84 years of age, of whom 211 received CLARINEX. In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of six weeks duration, at the pre-specified one-week primary time point evaluation, CLARINEX Tablets significantly reduced the severity of pruritus when compared to placebo (Table 5). Secondary endpoints were also evaluated, and during the first week of therapy CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg reduced the secondary endpoints, "Number of Hives" and the "Size of the Largest Hive", when compared to placebo.

The clinical safety of CLARINEX Oral Solution was documented in three, 15-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety studies in pediatric subjects with a documented history of allergic rhinitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, or subjects who were candidates for antihistamine therapy. In the first study, 2.5 mg of CLARINEX Oral Solution was administered to 60 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age. The second study evaluated 1.25 mg of CLARINEX Oral Solution administered to 55 pediatric subjects 2 to 5 years of age. In the third study, 1.25 mg of CLARINEX Oral Solution was administered to 65 pediatric subjects 12 to 23 months of age and 1.0 mg of CLARINEX Oral Solution was administered to 66 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 months of age. The results of these studies demonstrated the safety of CLARINEX Oral Solution in pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age.

Safety

Thirty patients (15.5%) in the naproxen group and 7 patients (3.5%) in the loratadine group reported treatment-related AEs (Table 4). One patient in the naproxen group had two serious treatment-related AEs: GI hemorrhage and peptic ulcer. Treatment-related GI disorders were reported by 21 patients (10.9%) in the naproxen group and 1 patient (0.5%) in the loratadine group. GI disorders were the most common reason for discontinuation of naproxen. There were no reports of treatment-related neutropenia or febrile neutropenia in this study, and there were no treatment-related life-threatening or fatal AEs. Cases of treatment-emergent neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were generally balanced across the treatment groups. Treatment-emergent AEs that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients in any treatment group are shown in Supplemental Table 20.

### Influence of zafirlukast and loratadine on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^1955dfaf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Airway obstruction induced by physical exercise is a common feature in asthma, and conventional treatments do not offer optimal protection. There is thus a need for additional therapies for optimal control of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).

Objective

The influence of treatment with the antihistamine loratadine and the antileukotriene zafirlukast alone and in combination on EIB was investigated. This combination has previously shown beneficial additive effects in allergen-induced bronchoconstriction.

Methods

In a double-blind cross-over study loratadine (10 mg twice daily) and zafirlukast (80 mg twice daily) were evaluated alone and in combination in 16 nonsmoking patients with mild asthma, previously documented EIB, and airways hyperresponsiveness to histamine.

Results

The mean ± SE maximum decrease in FEV1 after a standardized exercise provocation was 21.6% ± 3% after placebo, 22.8% ± 3% after loratadine, 13.9% ± 2% after zafirlukast (P < .05 vs placebo), and 10.3% ± 2% after the combination of loratadine and zafirlukast (P < .05 vs placebo). Expressed as the area under the FEV1 percentage change versus time curve, the mean protection produced by zafirlukast and the combination of zafirlukast and loratadine was 57% and 65%, respectively, whereas loratadine alone had no significant protective effect. There was also no significant difference between the effect of zafirlukast alone or in combination with loratadine.

Conclusion

The study confirmed the beneficial effect of a leukotriene receptor antagonist in EIB but failed to obtain evidence that H1-receptor antagonism alone or together with the cysteinyl-leukotriene 1 receptor antagonist zafirlukast offers a protective effect.

### Efficacy of loratadine-montelukast on nasal congestion in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis in an environmental exposure unit [^170c2d49]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Nasal congestion is considered to be one of the most bothersome symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR) and often the most difficult to treat. Oral therapies providing safe, effective, and reliable relief of AR symptoms, including nasal congestion, are limited.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of loratadine-montelukast (10 mg/10 mg) vs placebo and phenylephrine (10 mg) in relieving nasal congestion over 6 hours after ragweed pollen exposure in the environmental exposure unit at the Kingston General Hospital.

Methods

After a screening visit and up to 6 priming visits, patients who met minimum symptom requirements during ragweed pollen exposure were randomized to receive loratadine-montelukast, phenylephrine, or placebo. Patients evaluated nasal congestion and other symptoms of AR and measured peak nasal inspiratory flow before dosing and at 20-minute intervals during the subsequent 8 hours of pollen exposure.

Results

During the first 6 hours after treatment (primary end point), loratadine-montelukast treatment resulted in greater improvement in the mean nasal congestion score vs placebo (P = 0.007) and phenylephrine (P < .001). Loratadine-montelukast was more effective than placebo (P ≤ .02) and phenylephrine (P ≤ .002) in relieving total symptoms, nasal symptoms, and nonnasal symptoms and in improving peak nasal inspiratory flow. There were no statistically significant differences between phenylephrine and placebo for any measures. Fewer patients in the loratadine-montelukast group (3.9%) reported adverse events than in the phenylephrine (7.9%) and placebo (7.1%) groups; most adverse events were mild or moderate.

Conclusions

Loratadine-montelukast was more effective than placebo and phenylephrine in relieving nasal congestion and other nasal and nonnasal symptoms resulting from ragweed pollen exposure. There was no statistically significant difference between phenylephrine and placebo.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1		Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis

The clinical efficacy and safety of CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets was evaluated in two 2-week multicenter, randomized parallel group clinical trials involving 1248 subjects 12 to 78 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis, 414 of whom received CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets. In the 2 trials, subjects were randomized to receive CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets twice daily, CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg once daily, or sustained-release pseudoephedrine tablet 120 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. The majority of patients were between 18 and < 65 years of age with a mean age of 35.8 years and were predominantly women (64%). Patient ethnicity was 82% Caucasian, 9% Black, 6% Hispanic and 3% Asian/other ethnicity. Primary efficacy variable was twice-daily reflective patient scoring of 4 nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness/congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing) and four non-nasal symptoms (itching/burning eyes, tearing/watering eyes, redness of eyes, and itching of ears/palate) on a 4 point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). In both trials, the antihistaminic efficacy of CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets, as measured by total symptom score excluding nasal congestion, was significantly greater than pseudoephedrine alone over the 2-week treatment period; and the decongestant efficacy of CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets, as measured by nasal stuffiness/congestion, was significantly greater than CLARINEX (desloratadine alone) over the 2-week treatment period. Primary efficacy variable results from 1 of 2 trials are shown in Table 3.

There were no significant differences in the efficacy of CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets across subgroups of subjects defined by gender, age, or race.

### An evaluation of the ocular drying effects of 2 systemic antihistamines: loratadine and cetirizine hydrochloride [^84c37b17]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic antihistamines, such as loratadine and cetrizine hydrochloride, have proven efficacious in the control of many allergic conditions; however, patients complain about their drying effects.

Objective

To investigate the ocular drying effects of loratadine and cetirizine hydrochloride in individuals with normal ocular health exposed to a controlled adverse environment (CAE).

Methods

Eighteen individuals completed a randomized, double-masked study. Participants were evaluated in a CAE (a chamber that regulates humidity, temperature, airflow, and visual tasking) at baseline and after taking 10 mg of either loratadine or cetirizine hydrochloride daily for 4 days. Keratitis, conjunctival staining, and tear film break-up time (TFBUT) were examined before and after a 45-minute CAE exposure. Participant-reported ocular discomfort was recorded every 5 minutes during CAE challenge.

Results

After 4 days, use of loratadine yielded a mean increase of 0.75 points (107%) in keratitis (P < .001), a mean increase of 1.35 points (133%) in conjunctival staining (P < .001), a mean decrease of 1.38 seconds (33.7%) in TFBUT (P < .001), and a mean increase of 0.32 points (24.8%) in ocular discomfort (P = 0.05) vs baseline. After 4 days, use of cetirizine hydrochloride yielded a mean increase of 0.57 points (60%) in keratitis (P < .001), a mean increase of 0.7 points (49.7%) in conjunctival staining (P = 0.005), and a mean decrease of 0.76 seconds (19.6%) in TFBUT (P = 0.05) vs baseline. Loratadine was shown to induce 93% greater conjunctival staining after 4 days of use and CAE exposure vs cetirizine hydrochloride (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Loratadine and cetirizine hydrochloride induced signs and symptoms associated with ocular dryness, including increased corneal and conjunctival staining, decreased TFBUT, and increased ocular discomfort in healthy individuals. Loratadine induced significantly more conjunctival staining than cetirizine hydrochloride.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:

Hypersensitivity reactions. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Adults and Adolescents

Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients ages 12 years or older received CLARINEX Tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between CLARINEX and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the CLARINEX group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of CLARINEX Tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with CLARINEX Tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1.

The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in CLARINEX and placebo-treated patients.

There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race.

Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria: In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials of chronic idiopathic urticaria, 211 patients ages 12 years or older received CLARINEX Tablets and 205 received placebo. Adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received CLARINEX Tablets and that were more common with CLARINEX than placebo were (rates for CLARINEX and placebo, respectively): headache (14%, 13%), nausea (5%, 2%), fatigue (5%, 1%), dizziness (4%, 3%), pharyngitis (3%, 2%), dyspepsia (3%, 1%), and myalgia (3%, 1%).

### The rising cost of rhinologic medications [^fffef6ce]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The high prescription drug cost in the United States may negatively affect patient prognosis and treatment compliance.

Objective

To fill the knowledge gap and inform clinicians regarding rhinology medications price changes by evaluating trends in price changes of highly used nasal sprays and allergy medications.

Methods

The 2014–2020 Medicaid National Average Drug Acquisition Cost database was queried for drug pricing information for the following classes of medications: intranasal corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, antileukotrienes, intranasal antihistamines, and intranasal anticholinergics. Individual medications were identified by Food and Drug Administration-assigned National Drug Codes. Per unit, drug prices were analyzed for average annual prices, average annual percentage price changes, and inflation-adjusted annual and composite percentage price changes.

Results

Beclometasone (Beconase AQ, 56.7%, QNASL, 77.5%), flunisolide (Nasalide, -14.6%), budesonide (Rhinocort Aqua, -1.2%), fluticasone (Flonase, -6.8%, Xhance, 11.7%), mometasone (Nasonex, 38.2%), ciclesonide (Omnaris, 73.8%), combination azelastine and fluticasone (Dymista, 27.3%), loratadine (Claritin, -20.5%), montelukast (Singulair, 14.5%), azelastine (Astepro, 21.9%), olopatadine (Patanase, 27.3%), and ipratropium bromide (Atrovent, 56.6%) had an overall change in inflation-adjusted per unit cost between 2014 and 2020 (% change). Of 14 drugs evaluated, 10 had an increase in inflation-adjusted prices, for an average increase of 42.06% ± 22.27%; 4 of 14 drugs had a decrease in inflation-adjusted prices, for an average decrease of 10.78% ± 7.36%.

Conclusion

The rising cost of highly used medications contributes to increased patient acquisition costs and may pose barriers of drug adherence to particularly vulnerable populations.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^8f9b9ba5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 — pregnancy: antihistamines and nasal saline — There is little data on the safety of intranasal antihistamines (INAH) in pregnancy, but a randomized study in pregnant women with allergic rhinitis (AR) found nasal saline lavage safe and effective with symptom, medication use, and resistance reductions, and nasal saline therefore is a good first-line option. As a whole, oral antihistamines still appear to be safe for use in pregnancy; cetirizine was not associated with increased rates of major malformations or teratogenic risk, safety was reaffirmed in a UCB Pharma Patient Safety Database analysis up to February 2015, a 2013 multicenter case-control study of birth defects did not support previously postulated associations between diphenhydramine, loratadine, and chlorpheniramine and major congenital anomalies, and loratadine does not appear to increase hypospadias risk, with a 2014 systematic review identifying the most safety data for loratadine and no evidence of increased risk of hypospadias.

Motion sickness — pharmacologic countermeasures: Drugs are useful when habituation is impractical, such as single or infrequent journeys, and individuals should be advised that medication is most effective when taken before exposure rather than after symptom onset. Drug categories include antimuscarinics (e.g., scopolamine), antihistamines (e.g., dimenhydrinate), and sympathomimetics (e.g., amphetamine), and all effective agents penetrate the blood–brain barrier and act centrally. The newer "minimally sedating" antihistamines (cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine) are not effective for treatment of motion sickness, and amphetamine or combinations of amphetamine plus scopolamine (or promethazine) are not available due to legal and drug abuse reasons. Other antiemetics such as ondansetron and granisetron are not effective against motion sickness because their sites of action are not at the central vestibular centers of the brain. Cannabis and constituents such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, but not cannabidiol (CBD), have shown anti-motion-sickness properties in animals, but controlled human trials are lacking so no firm recommendations can be made. All medications have side effects and possible specific contraindications, and the most common side effect is drowsiness or sedation.

### Fetal safety of loratadine use in the first trimester of pregnancy: a multicenter study [^c417b9dd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Women in their childbearing years often require drug therapy for allergic conditions. Loratadine, a newer nonsedating antihistamine, is often used because of its preferred side effect profile. To date no published data exist on the safety of loratadine use in pregnancy.

Objective

We sought to determine whether the use of loratadine in the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with an increased risk for major malformations. Secondary outcomes included rates of miscarriage, birth weights, and gestational age at delivery.

Methods

All women were prospectively enrolled from 4 participating centers. Detailed maternal medical history and drug exposures were collected at intake, whereas pregnancy complications and outcomes were collected at follow-up. A group of unexposed control subjects were recruited and followed up in a similar manner.

Results

This report includes follow-up on 161 loratadine exposed pregnancies and an equal number of unexposed control subjects. Maternal characteristics (age, pregnancy history, alcohol consumption, and smoking habits) were not different between the 2 groups. There were 5 malformations observed in the exposed group and 6 in the control group, which was not significantly different (P = 0.9) Similarly, the live birth rate, gestational age at delivery, and birth weights were not different between the 2 groups.

Conclusion

These results suggest that loratadine use in pregnancy is not associated with a large risk for major malformations. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and to increase study power.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^8241bf22]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

How should CSU be managed during pregnancy and lactation?

During pregnancy, urticaria should be controlled using the minimum level of medication that is effective. The use of H 1 -antihistamines (preferably second-generation) should be considered as the first therapeutic step. However, no H 1 -antihistamine agent is in category A regarding safety in pregnancy. Category B of safety in pregnancy has been assigned to loratadine, cetirizine, levocetirizine and chlorpheniramine. Hydroxyzine is the only antihistaminic drug that is contraindicated in pregnancy, as specifically mentioned in the product's specifications.

Lactation could also pose a challenge to treat CSU. During lactation, loratadine and cetirizine are the only H 1 -antihistamines recommended for use. The minimum possible dose of H 1 -antihistamines and the shortest duration of treatment should be used, but only when the benefits outweigh the potential risks. H 1 -antihistamine is excreted in breast milk. Chlorpheniramine can cause sedation and poor feeding in babies so should be avoided.

As it is the case in rheumatologic diseases or asthma, in CSU systemic corticosteroids may be administered in pregnancy but only at the lowest possible doses and for the minimum period of time due to potential areas of concern, including congenital malformations during the first trimester of pregnancy, neonatal adrenal insufficiency and low birthweight. However, the absolute risk is low. Moreover, systemic corticosteroids have the potential risk of inducing hypertension, gestational diabetes and preterm delivery due to the premature rupture of membranes. Corticosteroids appear to be safe for nursing infants because of low levels in breast milk. The concentrations in breast milk are generally 5–25% of maternal serum levels, with rapid and bi-directional exchange between the serum and breast milk. When high doses are required, it is reasonable to delay breastfeeding for up to 4 h after each dose of steroids. Prolonged treatments and high doses of systemic corticosteroids should be avoided.

Key point: During pregnancy and lactation antihistamines, labelled as B category should be used as first-line therapy in urticaria, using the minimum level of medication that is effective.

### Efficacy of second-generation antihistamines in patients with allergic rhinitis and comorbid asthma [^89f48843]. The Journal of Asthma (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma share common mediators, cytokines, and chemokines from mast cells and basophils that are central to the complex cascade of events involved in the inflammatory response. Histamine is the salient mediator released after immunologic challenge, initiating multiple pathologic processes of the allergic reaction that result in bronchial smooth muscle contraction, vasodilation, mucus hypersecretion, and edema. The recent identification of a fourth histamine receptor has reinforced clinical interest in the pleiotropic effects of histamine and the relative roles of histamine receptors in mediating immune and inflammatory responses.

Material and Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted for the following terms, alone or in combination: allergic rhinitis, asthma, antihistamines, histamine, and histamine receptors, and for the second-generation antihistamines azelastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, mizolastine, and rupatadine. Clinical trials were included that reported results for patients with AR and comorbid asthma who were treated with second-generation antihistamines. The search dates ranged from 1995 through 2010. Clinical studies that were not placebo controlled or double blinded were excluded from this review.

Results

A total of 14 clinical trials of second-generation nonsedating antihistamines were included in this review.

Conclusion

H1-antihistamines have been shown to attenuate the symptoms associated with early- and late-phase allergic reactions. Cumulative clinical evidence indicates that H1-antihistamines may have a beneficial effect on asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. Scientific significance. Mechanistic and clinical data suggest that the potential of H1-antihistamines to alleviate comorbid asthma symptoms in AR patients should be further investigated.

### Ebastine in allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria [^802a026f]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Histamine is a key mediator in the development of allergy symptoms, and oral H(1)-antihistamines are among the most widely used treatments for symptomatic relief in conditions such as allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria. Ebastine is a second-generation antihistamine which has been shown to be an effective treatment for both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis. In controlled clinical trials in adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, ebastine 10 mg once-daily improved symptoms to a significantly greater extent than placebo and to a similar extent as loratadine 10 mg and cetirizine 10 mg (both once-daily), while ebastine 20 mg proved to be more effective than these two comparator antihistamines. In addition, ebastine was significantly more effective than placebo at relieving the symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria. Ebastine provides efficacy throughout the 24-h dosing interval with once-daily administration and clinical benefit is seen from the first day of treatment. Small studies have found beneficial effects for ebastine in patients with other disorders, including cold urticaria, dermographic urticaria, atopic asthma, mosquito bites and (in combination with pseudoephedrine) the common cold. In addition to the regular ebastine tablet, a fast-dissolving tablet (FDT) formulation, which disintegrates in the mouth without the aid of a drink, is also available. It has been shown to be bioequivalent to the regular tablet, and to be significantly more effective than desloratadine at reducing histamine-induced cutaneous wheals. A number of patient surveys demonstrated that the majority of individuals who tried the fast-dissolving formulation reported it to be convenient for use, fast-acting and preferred it to their previous antihistamine medication. Perhaps most importantly, a large proportion of patients indicated that they would prefer to use this new formulation in the future. Ebastine has a rapid onset of action and it can be administered once-daily, with or without food. Dose modifications are not needed in elderly patients, or in those with renal or mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Ebastine is generally well-tolerated, and clinical studies showed that at usual therapeutic doses of 10 and 20 mg once-daily, it had no clinically relevant adverse effects on cognitive function and psychomotor performance or on cardiovascular function. In conclusion, ebastine is an effective and generally well-tolerated treatment for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. In addition to the regular tablet formulation, ebastine is available as a FDT, providing a treatment option that is particularly convenient for patients.

EGFR inhibitor–associated pruritus — systemic agents and practical use: "Hence, nonsedating second-generation antihistamines are recommended as the first approach for systemic therapy for pruritus during daytime", and "Dosing of antihistamines also should be kept to the minimum to avoid adverse drug reactions, particularly in the elderly, as these medications may cause severe anticholinergic reactions". "For patients who suffer from pruritus during nighttime, first-generation antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine) are preferable given their sedative properties". Comparative tolerability shows "somnolence or sedation was recorded in 5% of loratadine patients and 40% of hydroxyzine patients after 1 week of drug usage [40]", and EGFRI data are limited: "two patients were given loratadine for 14 days; however, patients did not find it useful and discontinued treatment [22]". For refractory symptoms, "these antiepileptic agents should only be recommended as second-line treatment in patients who failed antihistamines and therapies against underlying rash and/or xerosis and continue to experience clinically significant pruritus". Regarding NK-1 antagonism, "aprepitant, an NK-1 antagonist was reported to reduce pruritus that is caused by erlotinib [38]", but "caution must be taken as aprepitant may cause drug–drug interactions and potentially affect the concentrations of erlotinib [45]".

### Comparative pharmacology of H1 antihistamines: clinical relevance [^7b782310]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

H1 antihistamines have similar efficacy in the treatment of allergic disorders; however, they differ in terms of their chemical structure, clinical pharmacology, and safety. This review focuses on the clinical pharmacology (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics) of the newer oral H1 antihistamines (acrivastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and mizolastine). Understanding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these H1 antihistamines provides an objective basis for selection of appropriate dosages and dose intervals. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies provide a rationale for the modified dosage regimens that may be required in special populations, such as the very young, the elderly, those with hepatic or renal dysfunction, or those taking other medications concurrently. Many H1 antihistamines are currently available for use. Clinical pharmacology studies help physicians to select the best H1 antihistamines for their patients.

### Allergic rhinitis and urticaria burden and antihistamine treatment options in Thailand: a modified Delphi study [^3eda5685]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis

The EAACI/ARIA guidelines outline the clinical properties of the ideal oral H 1 -antihistimines, and most modern H 1 -antihistimines meet these requirements. A comparison of the clinical profiles of various second-generation antihistamines indicates that bilastine in particular has the highest number of ARIA-recommended antihistamine properties.

Their pharmacologic profiles support the preference for second-generation H 1 -antihistimines in managing pediatric allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. They address the immediate allergic symptoms and align well with the therapeutic goals for children, which include maintaining normal activity levels and minimizing adverse effects.

Treatment of acute and CU

As with AR, second-generation H 1 -antihistimines are efficacious in both acute urticaria and CU and are recommended as first-line therapy. For CU, the EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline recommends antihistamines be taken daily until no longer needed. The dosing regimen is essential to patient adherence, as patients often hesitate to continue treatment if they do not experience immediate relief. Thus, a nonsedating antihistamine that restores a patient's QoL is essential to enhance the treatment experience.

For all types of urticaria, standard-dosed modern, second-generation H 1 -antihistimines like bilastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and rupatadine are supported by clinical evidence. However, there is no clear recommendation on which to choose as a result of the lack of well-designed clinical trials comparing their efficacy and safety.

In children, antihistamines with proven efficacy and safety include bilastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and rupatadine. Prescriber selection should consider age restrictions and availability, as some are not licensed for children under 6 months in many countries, and not all are formulated for pediatric use.

### The efficacy of short-term administration of 3 antihistamines vs placebo under natural exposure to Japanese cedar pollen [^4d4b0a35]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Japanese cedar pollinosis, a common disease with morbidity of approximately 20% in the Japanese population, is characterized by subjectively irritating symptoms during an annual 3-month period.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness of cetirizine hydrochloride, loratadine, and fexofenadine hydrochloride in reducing pollinosis symptoms induced while walking in a park during the pollen season.

Methods

A randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 113 individuals with Japanese cedar pollinosis during 2 days in March 2003 in Osaka Expo Park, Osaka, Japan. Participants (aged 20–57 years) were divided into 4 groups according to treatment assignment: cetirizine hydrochloride, 10 mg/d; fexofenadine hydrochloride, 120 mg/d; loratadine, 10 mg/d; and placebo (lactose), twice daily. Symptoms were recorded hourly during the study. Furthermore, all the patients completed the Japanese version of the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire before and after the trial.

Results

Self-evaluated symptom scores in all 3 active treatment groups showed significant improvements compared with the placebo group. Furthermore, the cetirizine group showed significant improvement in the domains of frequency of nose blowing and nasal obstruction compared with placebo. In addition, improvement in Japanese Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire scores was higher in the cetirizine group than in the loratadine and placebo groups.

Conclusion

Cetirizine seems to be more effective than fexofenadine and loratadine at reducing subjective symptoms in this study population.

14.3 Allergic Rhinitis (Seasonal and Perennial)

Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis

The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis was investigated in 5 similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled (loratadine) trials conducted in North America. The 5 trials enrolled a total of 5,029 patients, of whom 1,799 were treated with montelukast sodium tablets. Patients were 15 to 82 years of age with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, a positive skin test to at least one relevant seasonal allergen, and active symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis at study entry.

The period of randomized treatment was 2 weeks in 4 trials and 4 weeks in one trial. The primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing) as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale.

Four of the five trials showed a significant reduction in daytime nasal symptoms scores with montelukast sodium 10 mg tablets compared with placebo. The results of one trial are shown below. The median age in this trial was 35 years (range 15 to 81); 65.4% were females and 34.6% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.1% Caucasian, 6.4% other origins, 5.8% Black and 4.8% Hispanic. The mean changes from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score in the treatment groups that received montelukast sodium tablets, loratadine and placebo are shown in TABLE 9. The remaining three trials that demonstrated efficacy showed similar results. Efficacy was demonstrated for seasonal allergic rhinitis when montelukast was administered in the morning or the evening.

### Comparative activity of cetirizine and desloratadine on histamine-induced wheal-and-flare responses during 24 hours [^eae9522c]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Cetirizine and desloratadine are antihistamines active in the treatment of symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria.

Objective

To compare the antihistamine activity of desloratadine, the active metabolite of loratadine, with that of cetirizine in the skin wheal-and-flare responses during 24 hours.

Methods

This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single oral dose, crossover study. Skin reaction to histamine (100 mg/mL), administered by prick tests, was measured by the wheal and flare surface areas for 24 hours (before treatment and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours). Eighteen healthy volunteers (mean age, 33.9 years; 13 women) participated in this study. The areas under the curves of the wheal-and-flare responses as a function of time (primary efficacy variables) were compared using analysis of variance.

Results

A highly significant overall treatment effect (P < .001) was detected for wheal and flare inhibition, with the activity of cetirizine and desloratadine significantly superior to that of placebo (P < .001). In addition, the activity of cetirizine was significantly superior to that of desloratadine (P < .001). With desloratadine, only 3 of the 18 subjects achieved a wheal inhibition of at least 70%, occurring between 2 and 4 hours, whereas all subjects using cetirizine reached a wheal inhibition of at least 70% between 0.5 and 3 hours (median time, 1.7 hours). The difference between the 2 active drugs was highly significant (P < .001). The median duration of wheal inhibition of at least 70% was zero with placebo and desloratadine and was 21.9 hours with cetirizine (P < .001). No serious adverse events were reported, and no subject withdrew from the study due to an adverse event.

Conclusion

Cetirizine was associated with significantly greater suppression of skin reactivity to histamine compared with desloratadine during 24 hours after a single dose, with a consistent duration of action for cetirizine, as previously reported.
