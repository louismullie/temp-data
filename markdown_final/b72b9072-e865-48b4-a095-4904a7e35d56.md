## Question

Zileuton and increased liver enzymes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about zileuton and increased liver enzymes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and mechanism of zileuton and how that relates to hepatotoxic risk. Then, I should verify the clinical incidence and severity of ALT/AST elevations from pivotal trials and labeling. Next, I will examine timing, latency, and recovery patterns. After that, I need to assess risk factors and special populations. Then, I should review monitoring requirements and management thresholds, including when to stop therapy. Finally, I will synthesize patient counseling points, mechanistic insights, and compare with other leukotriene modifiers to frame overall risk–benefit decisions.

> Let me first confirm the drug and its mechanism, because if I misstate this, downstream conclusions about hepatotoxicity risk could be off. Zileuton is a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor that reduces leukotriene synthesis and is approved for chronic asthma management; its hepatic metabolism via CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 can produce reactive intermediates, which plausibly contributes to idiosyncratic DILI risk, and in vitro systems suggest subtler transcriptomic signatures of liver stress rather than overt cytotoxicity, aligning with the clinical pattern of mostly reversible transaminase elevations rather than fulminant injury in trials [^112eDowG] [^114stYow] [^1163HGQc] [^114TYgcm].

> I need to check the trial data on incidence carefully, and I should double-check the immediate-release versus extended-release numbers. In a 12-week placebo-controlled study of extended-release zileuton, ALT elevations ≥ 3×ULN occurred in 2.5% of treated versus 0.5% on placebo, and in a 6-month study, the rate was 1.8% with zileuton versus 0.7% with placebo; for immediate-release formulations, pooled trials show an overall ALT ≥ 3×ULN rate of 3.2%, which fits with the mechanistic expectation of dose-dependent hepatocellular signals even though these elevations are usually asymptomatic and reversible on withdrawal [^111q6793] [^1114Tir5] [^112eDowG] [^114Me1ck].

> Wait, let me verify timing and latency because that drives monitoring cadence. Most ALT elevations occur within the first 1–3 months, with the majority in the first month, and in a 6‑month study, 82% occurred within the first 3 months; recovery after discontinuation is generally rapid, with most resolving to < 2×ULN within about 2–3 weeks, though isolated cases have normalized up to about a month after stopping therapy, which reinforces the value of early surveillance during initiation [^1114Tir5] [^111q6793].

> Hold on, I should verify the severity spectrum and clinical consequences, and I must be careful not to overstate risk. In controlled trials, zileuton-associated elevations were typically mild to moderate, without jaundice, chronic liver disease, or deaths, and most normalized after drug cessation; however, postmarketing reports for immediate-release zileuton include severe hepatic injury, jaundice, and ALT elevations greater than 8×ULN, so while trial signals are reassuring, real-world hepatotoxicity can be clinically significant and mandates vigilance and structured monitoring [^111q6793] [^1114Tir5] [^114dKDMD].

> Next, I should review risk factors and special populations, and I need to ensure I align with contraindications and labeling cautions. Active liver disease or persistent ALT ≥ 3×ULN is a contraindication; older adults may have higher risk, with subgroup analyses suggesting increased ALT elevations in females ≥ 65 years on immediate-release, though this was not clearly replicated in ER trials; use in patients with substantial alcohol intake or prior liver disease warrants caution; and pediatric use under 12 years is not established due to hepatotoxicity risk, with zileuton not indicated for children < 12 years in current guidance [^116Mo9eA] [^1167Tgr2] [^112eDowG] [^1151kzRD].

> I should confirm the FDA-recommended monitoring schedule and whether it varies by formulation or risk, because this dictates practice. Baseline hepatic function tests are required prior to initiation, then ALT should be checked monthly for the first 3 months, every 2–3 months through the remainder of the first year, and periodically thereafter for long-term therapy; if symptoms of liver dysfunction occur or transaminases reach ≥ 5×ULN, the drug should be discontinued and liver tests followed until normalization, which operationalizes early detection of clinically meaningful injury [^112eDowG].

> Now, I will examine management thresholds and dechallenge, and I need to ensure I do not conflate different drugs' cutoffs. Discontinue zileuton if AST/ALT ≥ 5×ULN regardless of symptoms, or if symptoms/signs of liver dysfunction are present; for persistent but modest elevations below these thresholds, some clinicians continue with closer monitoring, recognizing that many elevations are transient and reversible, but any symptomatic patient or rapidly rising enzymes should prompt cessation and evaluation for alternative causes of liver injury per DILI principles [^112eDowG] [^114zraiE] [^11154Hag].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology again, but I should double-check whether any mechanistic data conflict with the clinical phenotype. In vitro liver-chip models did not detect overt zileuton cytotoxicity, whereas transcriptomic models flag immune activation and metabolic stress signatures, consistent with idiosyncratic DILI rather than intrinsic, dose-dependent necrosis; clinically, the pattern is hepatocellular with ALT predominance and relatively early onset during therapy, supporting a combination of bioactivation and host susceptibility rather than direct cytotoxicity at therapeutic exposures [^1163HGQc] [^114TYgcm] [^111q6793].

> I need to ensure patient counseling is concrete and actionable, and I should verify that the language matches labeling. Patients should be told zileuton is not a rescue medication, to take doses consistently after morning and evening meals, and to report immediately any right upper quadrant pain, nausea, fatigue, pruritus, jaundice, dark urine, or flu-like symptoms; they must attend scheduled liver enzyme tests and understand that the most serious potential side effect is liver enzyme elevation, which is why routine monitoring is mandatory [^112LoJRu] [^1111Mv6V].

> But wait, what about comparative context with other leukotriene modifiers; I should confirm whether this changes the risk–benefit discussion. GINA notes elevated liver function tests with zileuton and zafirlukast, and VA/DoD guidance highlights hepatic risk and pediatric limitations for zileuton, while also reminding clinicians of neuropsychiatric concerns across the class; zafirlukast has postmarketing reports of life-threatening hepatic failure, which underscores that while zileuton's trial signal is modest, the class carries real hepatotoxic potential and warrants individualized selection and monitoring [^111ogogi] [^1151kzRD] [^115LUo1V] [^111Tj3fp].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications and make sure I am not overstating or understating risk. Zileuton confers a small but real risk of asymptomatic ALT elevations around 2–3% in trials, with most occurring early and resolving after discontinuation; severe outcomes are rare in trials but documented postmarketing, so structured baseline and on‑treatment ALT monitoring, avoidance in active liver disease or persistent ALT ≥ 3×ULN, and prompt cessation with significant elevations or symptoms are essential to mitigate DILI risk while preserving asthma control benefits in appropriately selected patients [^111q6793] [^1114Tir5] [^112eDowG] [^114dKDMD].

---

Zileuton causes **dose-related ALT/AST elevations** in 2–3% of patients, typically within the first 3 months and resolving after discontinuation [^111q6793] [^1114Tir5]. Severe hepatotoxicity (ALT ≥ 5× ULN or jaundice) is rare but possible; therefore, **baseline and periodic LFTs are required** [^112eDowG]. Zileuton is contraindicated in active liver disease or persistent ALT ≥ 3× ULN [^116Mo9eA], and should be stopped if ALT ≥ 5× ULN or symptoms of liver injury occur [^112eDowG]. Risk is higher with alcohol use, concomitant hepatotoxins, or baseline liver disease; monitor closely in these settings [^112eDowG].

---

## Incidence and severity of liver enzyme elevations

- **Incidence**: ALT elevations ≥ 3× ULN occur in ~2–3% of patients on zileuton, higher than placebo (~0.5–0.7%) [^111q6793] [^1114Tir5].

- **Timing**: Most elevations occur within the first 3 months, often in the first month [^111q6793] [^1114Tir5].

- **Severity**: Severe hepatotoxicity (ALT ≥ 5× ULN or jaundice) is rare but reported; most elevations resolve after stopping the drug [^112eDowG] [^114dKDMD].

---

## Clinical significance and risk factors

- **Clinical significance**: Elevations are usually asymptomatic and reversible, but severe injury (including jaundice and liver failure) has been reported postmarketing [^112eDowG] [^114dKDMD].

- **Risk factors**: Alcohol use, concomitant hepatotoxic drugs, and baseline liver disease increase risk; use caution in these patients [^112eDowG].

---

## Monitoring recommendations

- **Baseline LFTs**: Required before starting zileuton [^112eDowG].

- **Early monitoring**: Monthly LFTs for the first 3 months [^112eDowG].

- **Later monitoring**: Every 2–3 months for the remainder of the first year, then periodically thereafter [^112eDowG].

- **Action thresholds**: Discontinue if ALT ≥ 5× ULN or if symptoms of liver injury occur (e.g. jaundice, fatigue, RUQ pain) [^112eDowG].

---

## Management of elevated liver enzymes

- **Mild elevations (< 3× ULN)**: Continue with close monitoring; most resolve spontaneously [^1111WH2K].

- **Moderate elevations (3–5× ULN)**: Consider discontinuation or closer monitoring; assess for other causes [^113A8bkw].

- **Severe elevations (≥ 5× ULN)**: Discontinue immediately and monitor until normalization [^112eDowG].

---

## Comparison with other leukotriene modifiers

| **Medication** | **Incidence of ALT elevation ≥ 3× ULN** | **Severity and clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Zileuton | 2–3% | - Moderate <br/> - Usually reversible <br/> - Rare severe injury |
| Montelukast | Rare (< 1%) | - Mild <br/> - Usually reversible |
| Zafirlukast | Rare (< 1%) | - Severe hepatotoxicity reported <br/> - Including liver failure |

---

Zileuton has a **higher incidence of ALT elevations** than other leukotriene modifiers, warranting more intensive monitoring [^112eDowG].

---

## Clinical outcomes and long-term consequences

Most elevations resolve without long-term sequelae, but **rare severe injury** — including jaundice and liver failure — has been reported [^112eDowG] [^114dKDMD].

---

## Regulatory and guideline recommendations

Regulatory stance: Zileuton is **contraindicated in active liver disease or persistent ALT ≥ 3× ULN** [^116Mo9eA]. Guideline stance: GINA notes elevated liver enzymes with zileuton and emphasizes monitoring and caution in patients with liver disease [^111ogogi].

---

Zileuton causes **dose-related ALT/AST elevations** in 2–3% of patients, typically within the first 3 months and resolving after discontinuation [^111q6793] [^1114Tir5]. Severe hepatotoxicity is rare but possible; therefore, **baseline and periodic LFTs are required** [^112eDowG]. Zileuton is contraindicated in active liver disease or persistent ALT ≥ 3× ULN, and should be stopped if ALT ≥ 5× ULN or symptoms of liver injury occur [^116Mo9eA] [^112eDowG]. Risk is higher with alcohol use, concomitant hepatotoxins, or baseline liver disease; monitor closely in these settings [^112eDowG].

### Zileuton [^111q6793]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based upon gender. The clinical trials did not include sufficient numbers of patients < 18 years of age or non-Caucasians to determine whether there is any difference in adverse reactions based upon age or race.

Hepatotoxicity

In the 12-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of ALT elevations (≥ 3×ULN) was 2.5% (5 of 199) in the Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets group, compared to 0.5% (1 of 198) in the placebo group. In the Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets group, the majority of ALT elevations (60%) occurred in the first month of treatment, and in 2 of the 5 patients in the Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets group, ALT elevations were detected 14 days after completion of the 3-month study treatment. The levels returned to < 2×ULN or normal within 9 and 12 days, respectively. The ALT elevations in the other 3 patients were observed to return to < 2×ULN or normal within 15, 19, and 31 days after Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets discontinuation. There appeared to be no clinically relevant relationship between the time of onset and the magnitude of the first elevation or the magnitude of first elevation and time to resolution. The hepatic function enzyme elevations attributed to Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets did not result in any cases of jaundice, development of chronic liver disease, or death in this clinical trial.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

Elevations of one or more hepatic function enzymes and bilirubin may occur during Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets therapy. These laboratory abnormalities may progress to clinically significant liver injury, remain unchanged, or resolve with continued treatment, usually within three weeks. The ALT (SGPT) test is considered the most sensitive indicator of liver injury for Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets.

Assess hepatic function enzymes prior to initiation of, and during therapy with, Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets. Assess serum ALT before treatment begins, once a month for the first 3 months, every 2–3 months for the remainder of the first year, and periodically thereafter for patients receiving long-term Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets therapy. If clinical signs and/or symptoms of liver dysfunction develop (e.g., right upper quadrant pain, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, or "flu-like" symptoms) or transaminase elevations ≥ 5×ULN occur, discontinue Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets and follow hepatic function enzymes until normal.

In controlled and open-label clinical studies involving more than 5000 patients treated with zileuton immediate-release tablets, the overall rate of ALT elevation ≥ 3×ULN was 3.2%. In these trials, one patient developed symptomatic hepatitis with jaundice, which resolved upon discontinuation of therapy. An additional 3 patients with transaminase elevations developed mild hyperbilirubinemia that was less than 3×ULN. There was no evidence of hypersensitivity or other alternative etiologies for these findings.

Since treatment with Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets may result in increased hepatic function enzymes and liver injury, Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets in pediatric patients under 12 years of age have not been established. FDA has not required pediatric studies in patients under the age of 12 years due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets is not appropriate for children less than 12 years of age.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Subgroup analysis of controlled and open-label clinical studies with zileuton immediate-release tablets suggests that females ≥ 65 years of age appear to be at increased risk of ALT elevations. In Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets placebo-controlled studies there were no discernable trends in ALT elevations noted in subset analyses for patients ≥ 65 years of age, although the database may not have been sufficiently large to detect a trend [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Dosing adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction or patients undergoing hemodialysis is not necessary [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or persistent ALT elevations ≥ 3×ULN [see Warnings and Precautions (5) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].

6.3 Post marketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of zileuton immediate-release tablets and may be applicable to Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship.

Cases of severe hepatic injury have been reported in patients taking zileuton immediate-release tablets. These cases included death, life-threatening liver injury with recovery, symptomatic jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevations of ALT > 8×ULN.

Cases of sleep disorders and behavior changes have also been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

6.2 Long-Term Clinical Studies Experience

The safety of Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets was evaluated in one 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with asthma. Patients received two 600 mg Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets (n = 619) or placebo (n = 307) twice daily by mouth along with usual asthma care. Eighty-six percent of patients were white, 40% were male, and the overall mean age was 36.

The rate and type of adverse reactions observed in this study were comparable to the adverse reactions observed in the 12-week study. Other commonly reported adverse reactions (occurring at a frequency of ≥ 5%) in Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets-treated patients and at a frequency greater than placebo-treated patients included the following: headache (23%), upper respiratory tract infection (9%), myalgia (7%), and diarrhea (5%) compared to 21%, 7%, 5% and 2%, respectively, in the placebo-treated group.

ALT elevations (≥ 3×ULN) were observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets compared to 0.7% in patients treated with placebo. The majority of elevations (82%) were reported within the first 3 months of treatment and resolved within 21 days for most of these patients after discontinuation of the drug. The hepatic function enzyme elevations attributed to Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets did not result in any cases of jaundice, development of chronic liver disease, or death in this clinical trial.

Occurrences of low white blood cell (WBC) count (< 3.0 × 109/L) were observed in 2.6% (15 of 619) of the Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets-treated patients and in 1.7% (5 of 307) of the placebo-treated patients. The WBC counts returned to normal or baseline following discontinuation of Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets. The clinical significance of these findings is not known.

### Cannabidiol-associated hepatotoxicity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117EHkrE]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Findings of liver enzyme elevations in recent cannabidiol studies have raised concerns over liver safety. This study aimed to determine the association between cannabidiol use, liver enzyme elevation, and drug-induced liver injury (DILI).

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a search of EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Clinicaltrials.gov, Medline, medRxiv, and Web of Science of records up to February 2022 was conducted. Clinical trials initiating daily cannabidiol treatment with serial liver enzyme measures were included. The proportion of liver enzyme elevations and DILI were independently extracted from published reports. Pooled proportions and probability meta-analyses were conducted.

Results

Cannabidiol use was associated with an increased probability of liver enzyme elevation (N = 12 trials, n = 1229; OR = 5.85 95% CI = 3.84–8.92, p < 0.001) and DILI (N = 12 trials, n = 1229; OR = 4.82 95% CI = 2.46–9.45, p < 0.001) compared to placebo controls. In participants taking cannabidiol (N = 28 trials, n = 1533), the pooled proportion of liver enzyme elevations was 0.074 (95% CI 0.0448–0.1212), and DILI was 0.0296 (95% CI 0.0136–0.0631). High-dose CBD (≥ 1000 mg/day or ≥ 20 mg/kg/day) and concomitant antiepileptic drug use were identified as risk factors. No cases were reported in adults using cannabidiol doses < 300 mg/day. No cases of severe DILI were reported.

Conclusions

Cannabidiol-associated liver enzyme elevations and DILI meet the criteria of common adverse drug events. Clinicians are encouraged to screen for cannabidiol use and monitor liver function in patients at increased risk.

### The safety and efficacy of zileuton controlled-release tablets as adjunctive therapy to usual care in the treatment of moderate persistent asthma: a 6-month randomized controlled study [^114Me1ck]. The Journal of Asthma (2007). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of zileuton controlled release [CR] 1,200 mg BID added to usual care (UC) in 926 patients with moderate asthma (619 patients randomized to zileuton CR and 307 to placebo). Sustained improvements in AM and PM peak expiratory flow (PEF) were observed in the zileuton CR group compared to placebo. The adverse event profile was similar in the two treatment groups. Eleven patients (1.8%) receiving zileuton CR and 2 (0.7%) receiving placebo experienced elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3X the upper limit of normal (ULN). These elevations typically occurred (81.8%) during the first 3 months of exposure and most resolved within 21 days after discontinuation.

Association of liver enzyme results with patient characteristics

Table 2 shows the prevalence of patients in each treatment arm who experienced a peak ALT or AST (hereafter ALT/AST) ≥ 3 × ULN while taking their allocated treatment, by subgroups defined by baseline characteristics. In the standard arm, the highest proportion of patients with a peak ALT/AST ≥ 3 × ULN was found in those aged > 55 years with 8 of 38 patients (21.1%, p = 0.01).

Seven of 46 (15.2%) HIV-positive patients taking standard therapy had elevated ALT/AST ≥ 3 × ULN compared to 53 of 593 HIV-negative patients (8.9%) but this difference was not significant (p = 0.160).

Significantly more Asian patients experienced ALT/AST ≥ 3 × ULN compared to other ethnic groups [11.4% (Asian) vs 6.7% (black) vs 5.5% (mixed race), p < 0.001]. Also, a significantly higher proportion of Asian patients experienced DILI (28 of 560, 4.8%) compared to the other ethnic groups (2.0% black, 0% Caucasian, and 2.7% mixed race and other; p = 0.02). Of the 67 Asian patients with a peak ALT/AST ≥ 3 × ULN, 57 (85.1%) were taking isoniazid-containing regimens and 10 (14.9%) were allocated to the ethambutol arm (p = 0.008).

### Liver toxicity associated with tuberculosis chemotherapy in the REMoxTB study [^116F2cjR]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The combination of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol taken over at least 6 months has been standard therapy for drug-sensitive tuberculosis (TB) for over 30 years. Liver enzyme elevations and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) are recognised complications for this regimen. They cause patient morbidity, treatment interruption and poor treatment outcomes. The reported rates of significant liver enzyme elevation on standard therapy vary between 5% and 30%. An increased risk is associated with pre-existing liver disease, HIV infection, alcohol use, being female and increasing age.

Management guidelines for TB DILI are largely based on expert opinion. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines recommend treatment interruption when alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are elevated to 5 times the upper limit of normal (5 × ULN) or when bilirubin rises above the ULN. The American Thoracic Society (ATS), in contrast, recommends interruption when hepatic enzyme levels are greater than 3 × ULN with symptoms or jaundice, or more than 5 × ULN in asymptomatic patients.

The timing and magnitude of elevations in the serum transaminases over the course of treatment in all patients, with and without symptoms, remain unclear, making appropriate management of liver toxicity, including timing of treatment interruption and re-introduction uncertain.

To address this evidence gap, we extracted data from a large number of well-characterised patients with the aim of describing the pattern of liver enzyme elevation in standard TB therapy and identifying predisposing factors. We also identified the timing and severity of liver enzyme elevation in two experimental regimens. To our knowledge, this is the largest and most comprehensive available analysis of liver biochemical data for patients taking TB treatment.

### Liver toxicity associated with tuberculosis chemotherapy in the REMoxTB study [^115kqGXG]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A prospective series of 1223 patients with drug-induced liver failure demonstrated that TB therapy-induced liver failure can often have a subacute presentation and was associated with 67% mortality. The fatality seen on the ethambutol arm involving an ALT rise of 38 × ULN highlights the risk of mortality for patients presenting with hyperbilirubinaemia and elevated levels of liver enzymes. While the local physician evaluated this as 'hepatitis of unknown cause', it would seem reasonable to consider this as DILI. By comparison, the mortality associated with acute viral hepatitis is low and the majority of deaths are accounted for by the chronic sequelae of the disease.

Despite most patients being clinically unaffected by ALT elevations on treatment, we still demonstrated an overall risk of 3.4% for DILI on standard TB therapy and higher rates of DILI among those patients with enzyme elevations at randomisation compared with the overall trial population. Given the challenging circumstances surrounding TB treatment (with much higher levels of HIV co-infection than seen in REMoxTB), we would still recommend the conservative monitoring schedule laid out above to allow for the early detection of at-risk patients. Given that the majority of patients with liver enzyme elevations were not withdrawn, there is some evidence in favour of attempting to re-introduce the same regimen following a treatment interruption, as opposed to immediately changing to a more liver-sparing regimen.

### Efficacy of zileuton controlled-release tablets administered twice daily in the treatment of moderate persistent asthma: a 3-month randomized controlled study [^112zJaF1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A controlled-release (CR) formulation of zileuton was developed to simplify administration from 600 mg 4 times daily (Zyflo) to 1,200 mg twice daily.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of zileuton CR, two 600-mg tablets twice daily, compared with placebo.

Methods

Patients with moderate asthma treated with short-acting beta-agonists only were randomized to receive zileuton CR, 1,200 mg twice daily (n = 206); placebo CR, twice daily (n = 203); zileuton immediate-release (IR), 600 mg 4 times daily (n = 101); or placebo IR, 4 times daily (n = 103), for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in morning trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1).

Results

Improvement in trough FEV1 was observed after 2 weeks of treatment (P = 0.001) and was maintained throughout the study. After 12 weeks of dosing, FEV1 improved by a mean of 0.39 L (20.8%) in the zileuton CR group vs 0.27 L (12.7%) in the placebo CR group (P = 0.02). A significant decline in beta-agonist use and a smaller proportion of patients reporting asthma exacerbations were observed in the zileuton CR group vs the placebo CR group. Adverse event profiles were similar across treatment groups. Elevations in alanine aminotransferase levels at least 3 times the upper limit of normal that reversed after drug withdrawal were seen in 5 zileuton CR-treated patients (2.5%) vs 1 placebo CR-treated patient (0.5%).

Conclusions

Treatment with zileuton CR, 1,200 mg twice daily, resulted in a significant improvement in asthma control, and the safety and efficacy profile was similar to that observed with zileuton IR, 600 mg 4 times daily (Zyflo).

### Liver toxicity associated with tuberculosis chemotherapy in the REMoxTB study [^113teFSZ]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a common complication of tuberculosis treatment. We utilised data from the REMoxTB clinical trial to describe the incidence of predisposing factors and the natural history in patients with liver enzyme levels elevated in response to tuberculosis treatment.

Methods

Patients received either standard tuberculosis treatment (2EHRZ/4HR), or a 4-month regimen in which moxifloxacin replaced either ethambutol (isoniazid arm, 2MHRZ/2MHR) or isoniazid (ethambutol arm, 2EMRZ/2MR). Hepatic enzymes were measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 17 weeks and as clinically indicated during reported adverse events. Patients included were those receiving at least one dose of drug and with two or more hepatic enzyme measurements.

Results

A total of 1928 patients were included (639 2EHRZ/4HR, 654 2MHRZ/2MHR and 635 2EMRZ/2MR). DILI was defined as peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 5 times the upper limit of normal (5 × ULN) or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN with total bilirubin > 2 × ULN. DILI was identified in 58 of the 1928 (3.0%) patients at a median time of 28 days (interquartile range IQR 14–56). Of 639 (6.4%) patients taking standard tuberculosis therapy, 41 experienced clinically significant enzyme elevations (peak ALT ≥ 3 × ULN). On standard therapy, 21.1% of patients aged > 55 years developed a peak ALT/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 3 × ULN (p = 0.01) and 15% of HIV-positive patients experienced a peak ALT/AST ≥ 3 × ULN compared to 9% of HIV-negative patients (p = 0.160). The median peak ALT/AST was higher in isoniazid-containing regimens vs no-isoniazid regimens (p < 0.05), and lower in moxifloxacin-containing arms vs no-moxifloxacin arms (p < 0.05). Patients receiving isoniazid reached a peak ALT ≥ 3 × ULN 9.5 days earlier than those on the ethambutol arm (median time of 28 days vs 18.5 days). Of the 67 Asian patients with a peak ALT/AST ≥ 3 × ULN, 57 (85.1%) were on an isoniazid-containing regimen (p = 0.008).

Conclusions

Our results provide evidence of the risk of DILI in tuberculosis patients on standard treatment. Older patients on standard therapy, HIV-positive patients, Asian patients and those receiving isoniazid were at higher risk of elevated enzyme levels. Monitoring hepatic enzymes during the first 2 months of standard therapy detected approximately 75% of patients with a peak enzyme elevation ≥ 3 × ULN, suggesting this should be a standard of care. These results provide evidence for the potential of moxifloxacin in hepatic sparing.

### Incidence and risk factors for chronic elevation of alanine aminotransferase levels in HIV-infected persons without hepatitis B or C virus co-infection [^114c1iT8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic liver disease in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients is mostly caused by hepatitis virus co-infection. Other reasons for chronic alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation are more difficult to diagnose.

Methods

We studied the incidence of and risk factors for chronic elevation of ALT levels (greater than the upper limit of normal at 2 consecutive semi-annual visits) in participants of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study without hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who were seen during the period 2002–2008. Poisson regression analysis was used.

Results

A total of 2365 participants were followed up for 9972 person-years (median age, 38 years; male sex, 66%; median CD4+ cell count, 426/microL; receipt of antiretroviral therapy [ART], 56%). A total of 385 participants (16%) developed chronic elevated ALT levels, with an incidence of 3.9 cases per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 3.5–4.3 cases per 100 person-years). In multivariable analysis, chronic elevated ALT levels were associated with HIV RNA level > 100,000 copies/mL (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.23; 95% CI, 1.45–3.43), increased body mass index (BMI, defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) (BMI of 25–29.9 was associated with an IRR of 1.56 [95% CI, 1.24–1.96]; a BMI 30 was associated with an IRR of 1.70 [95% CI, 1.16–2.51]), severe alcohol use (1.83 [1.19–2.80]), exposure to stavudine (IRR per year exposure, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.07–1.17]) and zidovudine (IRR per years of exposure, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.00–1.08]). Associations with cumulative exposure to combination ART, nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and unboosted protease inhibitors did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for exposure to stavudine. Black ethnicity was inversely correlated (IRR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.33–0.82]). Treatment outcome and mortality did not differ between groups with and groups without elevated ALT levels.

Conclusions

Among patients without hepatitis virus co-infection, the incidence of chronic elevated ALT levels was 3.9 cases per 100 person-years, which was associated with high HIV RNA levels, increased BMI, severe alcohol use, and prolonged stavudine and zidovudine exposure. Long-term follow-up is needed to assess whether chronic elevation of ALT levels will result in increased morbidity or mortality.

### An official ATS statement: hepatotoxicity of antituberculosis therapy [^113nMbut]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a problem of increasing significance, but has been a long-standing concern in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) infection. The liver has a central role in drug metabolism and detoxification, and is consequently vulnerable to injury. The pathogenesis and types of DILI are presented, ranging from hepatic adaptation to hepatocellular injury. Knowledge of the metabolism of anti-TB medications and of the mechanisms of TB DILI is incomplete. Understanding of TB DILI has been hampered by differences in study populations, definitions of hepatotoxicity, and monitoring and reporting practices. Available data regarding the incidence and severity of TB DILI overall, in selected demographic groups, and in those coinfected with HIV or hepatitis B or C virus are presented. Systematic steps for prevention and management of TB DILI are recommended. These include patient and regimen selection to optimize benefits over risks, effective staff and patient education, ready access to care for patients, good communication among providers, and judicious use of clinical and biochemical monitoring. During treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) monitoring is recommended for those who chronically consume alcohol, take concomitant hepatotoxic drugs, have viral hepatitis or other preexisting liver disease or abnormal baseline ALT, have experienced prior isoniazid hepatitis, are pregnant or are within 3 months postpartum. During treatment of TB disease, in addition to these individuals, patients with HIV infection should have ALT monitoring. Some experts recommend biochemical monitoring for those older than 35 years. Treatment should be interrupted and, generally, a modified or alternative regimen used for those with ALT elevation more than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in the presence of hepatitis symptoms and/or jaundice, or five times the ULN in the absence of symptoms. Priorities for future studies to develop safer treatments for LTBI and for TB disease are presented.

### What is the incidence of methotrexate or leflunomide discontinuation related to cytopenia, liver enzyme elevation or kidney function decline? [^117AyV81]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

MTX and LEF are uncommonly discontinued for blood-test abnormalities after the first year of shared-care prescription and discontinuations for severely abnormal blood-test results are even less frequent. These data will be useful when counselling patients in routine clinical practice. Elevated liver enzymes were the commonest blood-test abnormality to cause treatment discontinuations. This underlines the need to advise patients treated with DMARDs to minimize other risk-factors for hepatotoxicity. Further research is required to identify risk-factors of target-organ damage, and, to develop a prognostic model for risk-stratified blood-test monitoring. This is being evaluated by our team in another ongoing study that will also assess the acceptability and cost-effectiveness of risk-based monitoring.

### Tocilizumab (Tofidence) [^114HkZXD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated Liver Enzymes

Liver enzyme abnormalities are summarized in Table 1. In patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation, modification of treatment regimen, such as reduction in the dose of concomitant DMARD, interruption of tocilizumab-IV, or reduction in tocilizumab-IV dose, resulted in decrease or normalization of liver enzymes [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)]. These elevations were not associated with clinically relevant increases in direct bilirubin, nor were they associated with clinical evidence of hepatitis or hepatic insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].

In the all-exposure population, the elevations in ALT and AST remained consistent with what was seen in the 24 week, controlled clinical trials.

In Study WA25204, of the 1538 patients with moderate to severe RA [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] and treated with tocilizumab, elevations in ALT or AST > 3 x ULN occurred in 5.3% and 2.2% patients, respectively. One serious event of drug induced hepatitis with hyperbilirubinemia was reported in association with tocilizumab.

Leukotriene modifiers (leukotriene receptor antagonists, LTRA) target one part of the inflammatory pathway in asthma and are sometimes used as an option for maintenance therapy, mainly only in children. When used alone they are less effective than low-dose ICS, and when added to ICS they are less effective than ICS-LABA; medications include montelukast, pranlukast, zafirlukast, and zileuton. Adverse effects include elevated liver function tests with zileuton and zafirlukast, and there are concerns in adults and children about risk of serious behavioral and mood changes, including suicidal ideation, associated with montelukast that should be discussed with patients/parents/caregivers.

### Zidovudine (Retrovir) [^111qCtFV]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of zidovudine PO (also known as Retrovir, Retrovir):

- **Hematologic disorder**: use extreme caution with poor bone marrow reserve with advanced HIV disease, or a history of cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy. A CBC and differential should be performed prior to administration of zidovudine. Severe anemia and/or granulocytopenia may necessitate interruption of therapy, dosage adjustment, discontinuation of zidovudine, and/or blood transfusions until bone marrow recovery.
- **Lactic acidosis**: use extreme caution in patients with hepatic disease or in those with known risk factors for liver disease (e.g., alcohol use disorder). LFTs and serum electrolytes should be assessed more frequently. Treatment should be discontinued in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity.
- **Myopathy, myositis**: use extreme caution in patients with a history of muscle weakness or movement disorders. Regular monitoring of CK levels and clinical symptoms of muscle weakness or pain can help identify early signs of myopathy or myositis. If myopathy or myositis occurs, discontinuation of Zidovudine should be considered, and appropriate medical management, including supportive measures and treatment of any underlying cause, should be initiated.

### Liver enzyme elevations inVolunteer infection studies: findings and recommendations [^113r81Xs]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

This investigation was prompted by observations of elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in IBSM studies conducted using several structurally diverse NCEs. Elevated ALT/AST was also observed with piperaquine, a component of the licensed antimalarial dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, which has no clinical hepatotoxicity. Similar findings across these studies suggested there might be common factors in the IBSM model increasing the risk of transaminase elevation.

Hepatotoxicity is a major reason for drugs to fail clinical development. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) provokes liver test abnormalities or liver dysfunction, although diagnosis requires reasonable exclusion of other causes. Intrinsic DILI is caused when drugs affect hepatocytes, by a variety of dose-dependent mechanisms, and can be predicted in human and animal models. By contrast, idiosyncratic DILI is rare, unpredictable, and dependent on factors inherent to the individual. Severe DILI is a leading cause of acute liver failure. To date, no genetic, metabolic, or other characteristic reliably predicts severe DILI in an individual. Increases in ALT/AST indicate hepatocellular injury but do not predict progression to severe DILI. Only when liver damage evolves to impair hepatocellular bilirubin excretion and serum bilirubin increases does functional impairment manifest clinically.

The potential for a drug to cause severe DILI is described by Hy's law, that is, ALT elevation in a participant, usually substantial (≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal [×ULN]), seen concurrently with bilirubin > 2 × ULN. Hy's law identifies a drug likely to cause severe DILI (fatal or requiring liver transplant) at a rate roughly 1/10 the rate of Hy's law cases. Hy's law is confirmed if the drug caused the liver injury (excluding other causes), if hepatocytes are injured (not biliary obstruction, i.e. alkaline phosphatase [ALP] not substantially elevated), and if the injury was sufficient to impair liver function (hyperbilirubinemia). Finding two Hy's law cases causally related to drug administration in a clinical program indicates a high potential for severe DILI. Finding one case requires greater monitoring and investigation.

### Liver toxicity associated with tuberculosis chemotherapy in the REMoxTB study [^113E6HYL]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this paper, we have shown that 94% of patients completed their course of standard TB therapy without clinically significant ALT elevations detected. There were similar proportions of 95% in the isoniazid arm and 96% in the ethambutol arm.

There has been an assumption that the majority of elevations during TB treatment will occur within the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy. One recent paper reported that over half of the patients who developed elevated liver enzymes within 2 weeks of starting treatment had good specificity for predicting hepatotoxicity later during treatment using a monitoring schedule of regular testing for the first 2 weeks of treatment. The BTS and ATS both recommend pre-treatment baseline blood tests followed by clinical assessment in all patients. In patients deemed by the physician to be at higher risk of DILI or with existing liver disease or age > 35 years old, the ATS recommends a further blood test between 2 and 4 weeks after initiating therapy. The BTS advises a policy of further weekly blood tests for 2 weeks and 2-weekly blood tests for the first 2 months for patients with known liver dysfunction. Current guidance from the World Health Organization does not include regular monitoring for hepatotoxicity, and instead symptoms are used to detect liver dysfunction.

General drug-induced liver injury (DILI) guidance highlights reporting, education, and nuanced monitoring. "All practitioners are encouraged to voluntarily report instances of suspected DILI to the FDA via the MedWatch system". Transient enzyme elevations "can be seen with drugs such as isoniazid that are self-limited despite continued dosing". The "FDA and LiverTox websites are a rich resource for information about drug hepatotoxicity". Monitoring recommendations "vary in detail", and for isoniazid, patient education is emphasized while "Monthly laboratory monitoring has not been shown to reduce the incidence of clinically significant liver injury", though "many specialty societies advise baseline and on-treatment laboratory monitoring in high-risk individuals".

### Drug-induced liver injury associated with the use of nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors [^113MSo6a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients frequently present with elevated levels of serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]). This has often been attributed to the hepatic effects of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, including nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). A review of cohort studies investigating the incidence of hepatotoxicity among patients receiving ARV therapy suggests that the overall rate of ALT and/or AST elevations is similar among all ARVs. The rate of severe hepatotoxicity, ALT and/or ASTlevels > 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), during therapy with NNRTIs is relatively low but may be significantly higher in patients with concurrent chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis B or C). A comprehensive analysis of 17 randomized clinical trials of nevirapine demonstrated that 10% of all nevirapine-treated patients developed elevated levels of ALT and/or AST > 5 times the ULN; however, almost two-thirds (6.3% of nevirapine-treated patients) of these elevations were asymptomatic. Symptomatic hepatic events were seen in 4.9% (3.2%-8.9%) of nevirapine-treated patients.

### Abiraterone acetate (Zytiga) [^115TGHKN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

In postmarketing experience, there have been ZYTIGA-associated severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and deaths [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

In the combined data of 5 randomized clinical trials, grade 3–4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5 × ULN) were reported in 6% of 2230 patients who received ZYTIGA, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1.1% of 2230 patients taking ZYTIGA. In these clinical trials, no deaths clearly related to ZYTIGA were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.

Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with ZYTIGA, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced ZYTIGA dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt ZYTIGA treatment and closely monitor liver function.

Re-treatment with ZYTIGA at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 × ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 × ULN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Permanently discontinue ZYTIGA for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 × ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 × ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

The safety of ZYTIGA re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20 × ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10 × ULN is unknown.

### Hepatotoxicity in an African antiretroviral therapy cohort: the effect of tuberculosis and hepatitis B [^114GNhZY]. AIDS (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Hepatotoxicity is a significant complication of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We assessed the incidence of and risk factors for hepatotoxicity among HIV-infected individuals on ART in South Africa.

Design

We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a workplace HIV care program in South Africa which uses a first-line regimen of efavirenz, zidovudine, and lamivudine and provides routine clinical and laboratory monitoring.

Methods

We included subjects with baseline and follow-up alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase tests. Severe hepatotoxicity cases were identified during the first 12 months of ART. Potential risk factors, including concomitant medication use, tuberculosis, and hepatitis B and C, were determined from clinical records, database queries, and serological testing. Associations with hepatotoxicity were investigated using Cox proportional hazards modeling.

Results

Of the 868 subjects (94% male, median age 41 years), the median nadir CD4 cell count was 136/microl, 25% received concomitant tuberculosis treatment during ART, and 17% of a randomly selected subset were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). We identified 7.7 episodes of severe hepatotoxicity per 100 person-years. Tuberculosis treatment increased risk 8.5 fold, positive HBsAg 3.0 fold, and nadir CD4 cells count < 100/microl 1.9 fold. Importantly, the fraction of patients with severe hepatotoxicity on ART (4.6%) was similar to the fraction with liver enzyme elevations > 5 times the upper limit of normal before starting ART (4%).

Conclusions

In this African ART cohort, we found a low incidence of and minimal morbidity due to hepatotoxicity. HBsAg and concomitant tuberculosis therapy significantly increased the risk of hepatotoxicity.

### Liver toxicity associated with tuberculosis chemotherapy in the REMoxTB study [^115a97B3]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In REMoxTB, the IQR for the time to reach peak ALT ≥ 3 × ULN was 14–56 days for patients taking standard TB therapy, suggesting that 75% of these patients would have been detected by a regular LBT during the first 60 days of treatment. Based on the pattern of elevations observed, we would recommend a monitoring schedule consisting of LBTs at baseline, 1 week (to identify early elevators), 2 weeks (lower end of the IQR), 4 weeks (median timing for elevations) and 8 weeks (upper end of the IQR). We suggest that this schedule is achievable even in resource-poor settings and that our findings suggest diminishing return for LBTs after 8 weeks of therapy in the absence of symptoms.

There are unanswered questions surrounding the significance of isolated ALT elevations regarding how best to evaluate these patients, and which are the most appropriate biochemical markers to be included in the evaluation of ALT elevations. Isolated liver enzyme levels on treatment could reflect hepatic adaptation to the medication, wherein transient LBT abnormalities resolve even with continued exposure to the drug and the patient remains clinically well throughout. One large cohort study of over 11,000 patients receiving isoniazid preventive therapy observed symptoms and signs of hepatotoxicity in only 0.15% of patients completing therapy, suggesting that the rates of DILI/enzyme elevations requiring intervention are actually very low with monotherapy and, by extension, with standard TB therapy as well. Certainly, in our study a minority of patients with DILI or clinically significant elevations had recorded symptoms or bilirubin elevations and in the trial, the majority of patients who experienced liver enzyme elevations went on to be cured of their disease.

### A large-scale human toxicogenomics resource for drug-induced liver injury prediction [^114TYgcm]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

3D liver systems offer important physiological context. High-content imaging in 3D models, such as those by Walker et al.and Ewart et al. achieves similar performance on small, curated panels (Walker: 23/27 vs. 23/27; Ewart: 11/14 vs. 13/14). However, their limited scalability constrains their utility to a broader range of DILI mechanisms. They may perform well on narrow, curated panels, but struggle with unknown mechanisms or mechanisms not captured by the low-dimensional endpoint, as shown in the following comparison. To explore the unique capabilities of 2D transcriptomics vs 3D cytotoxicity assays, we conducted direct compound-level comparisons with larger 3D screening studies: Vorrink et al.and Fäs et al. In Vorrink et al. 3D cytotoxicity uniquely detected 3 compounds (Fialuridine, Methotrexate, Trazodone), all linked to cytotoxic effects that result in acute cell death. Conversely, our model uniquely flagged 10 compounds — including fluconazole, phenytoin, and zileuton — associated with immune activation, metabolic stress, or enzyme modulation, which are not readily captured by viability endpoints. A similar pattern emerged in the Fäs et al. study: 3D cytotoxicity exclusively identified 4 compounds (e.g. Haloperidol, Fialuridine) whose toxicities depend on structural or metabolic context. Our model uniquely identified 5 compounds (e.g. Cimetidine, Fluconazole, Ximelagatran) marked by subtle transcriptional responses rather than overt cell death. These comparisons highlight a key limitation of fixed single-endpoint models: while effective in narrow contexts, they struggle with broader chemical and mechanistic diversity. Our transcriptomic approach, by contrast, offers systems-level resolution that generalizes across DILI pathways — not only detecting known cytotoxic responses but also uncovering less immediate, non-lethal mechanisms often missed by traditional assays (Supplementary Data S4).

### Prevalence of elevated liver enzymes and its association with type 2 diabetes: a cross-sectional study in Bangladeshi adults [^113QGojf]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Previously, some studies have been conducted to assess the relationship between liver enzymes and T2D in Asian, 5, 7, 11, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 European 4, 24, 25, 26 and American populations. 12, 27, 28, 29 Most of the previous study examined the associations that included only two or three liver enzymes, and there are a limited number of studies that examined maximum number (four) of liver enzymes to evaluate the relationship with T2D. Moreover, their findings were inconsistent. The epidemiological data concerning the association between elevated liver enzymes and T2D in Bangladeshi adults are not available so far. To address these issues, we conducted a cross‐sectional study to measure the prevalence of elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP and GGT) in nondiabetic and diabetic subjects in Bangladesh and evaluate the association of increased liver enzymes with T2D.

Rechallenge after suspected hepatotoxicity — In general, readministration of a suspected hepatotoxic drug in a patient with ongoing or previous DILI is best avoided, and we strongly recommend against re-exposure to a drug thought likely to have caused hepatotoxicity, especially if the initial liver injury was associated with significant aminotransferase elevation (e.g., > 5xULN, Hy's law, or jaundice); an exception to this recommendation is in cases of life-threatening situations, where there is no suitable alternative (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Performance assessment and economic analysis of a human liver-chip for predictive toxicology [^1163HGQc]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Results obtained with these drugs are presented in Table 3, with toxicity values indicating the lowest concentration at which toxicity was detected. Lomitapide was highly toxic when tested over all included concentrations down to 0.1× human plasma C max, with all Liver-Chips showing signs of toxicity following five days of dosing. While telithromycin displayed a decrease in albumin along with a concomitant increase in ALT and morphological injury score, diclofenac and asunaprevir induced concentration and time-dependent changes in albumin and injury scores, but no elevation of ALT was seen with these drugs. Hepatotoxicity was also confirmed with immunofluorescence microscopy, which revealed apoptosis-mediated cell death following exposure to diclofenac, asunaprevir, or telithromycin. However, the Liver-Chip was unable to detect hepatotoxicity caused by zileuton, a treatment intended for asthma. The exact mechanism of toxicity of zileuton is unknown, but it likely involves production of intermediate reactive metabolites due to oxidative metabolism by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2C9, and 3A4. Although zileuton is > 93% plasma protein bound, we do not believe this was responsible for the lack of toxicological effect, as we were able to detect toxicities induced by other highly protein-bound drugs in the test set.

### Prevalence of elevated liver enzymes and its association with type 2 diabetes: a cross-sectional study in Bangladeshi adults [^115bbnjU]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The association between serum liver enzymes and T2D has not been evaluated previously for the Bangladeshi population. In this case, this is the first report, which adds to the information regarding the relationship of hepatic enzymes with T2D in a Bangladeshi adult cohort. In the present study, serum activity of GGT showed an independent association with T2D.

In this study, 61.2% of participants in T2D and 37.1% of participants in the nondiabetes group had at least one or more elevated liver enzymes. The prevalence of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP and GGT) above upper normal upper limit was significantly higher in subjects having diabetes. The prevalence of elevated liver enzymes in the present study (ALT 19%, AST 34.1%, ALP 36.8% and GGT 27.2%) is higher than that previously measured in a small diabetic cohort (ALT 18%, AST 3% and ALP 3%, GGT was not analysed) in Bangladesh. 38 Moreover, the association between liver enzymes and T2D was not evaluated in that previous study. In the present investigation, the prevalence of increased liver enzymes in the T2D group was higher in female than in the male participants, which are in line with a previous study. 7 The gender difference in elevated liver enzymes may be a reason for the individual's differences in body fat distribution and metabolism. The elevated levels of liver enzymes have been reported in Indian, 5, 39 Thai, 40 Algerian 7 and Chinese 11, 19 population. A wide variation has been observed on the prevalence of increased hepatic enzymes in these studies. Different reference values, ethnicity, age groups and demography might be considerable factors for the observed variations of these studies.

### Liver toxicity caused by nevirapine [^111zBuT2]. AIDS (2002). Low credibility.

Nevirapine plasma levels were measured in 70 HIV-infected patients, 33 of whom developed transaminase elevations. Higher nevirapine levels and hepatitis C virus infection were found to be independent predictors of liver toxicity. Moreover, in individuals with chronic hepatitis C, nevirapine concentrations greater than 6 microg/ml were associated with a 92% risk of liver toxicity. Therefore, monitoring nevirapine levels, especially in individuals with chronic hepatitis C, may be warranted.

### Incidence of hepatotoxicity due to antitubercular medicines and assessment of risk factors [^113bh5UH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antitubercular drugs cause derangement of hepatic function revealed by clinical examination and abnormal liver function test results. Potential hepatotoxicity of some of the first-line antitubercular agents remains a problem, especially during the initial period of treatment.

Objective

To determine the incidence of antitubercular drug-induced hepatotoxicity in a Nepalese urban population and assess the risk factors.

Method

Fifty patients diagnosed with active tuberculosis infection with normal pretreatment liver function were monitored clinically as well as biochemically in a prospective cohort analysis.

Results

Antitubercular drugs were found to be associated with derangement of hepatic function, resulting in elevation of liver enzymes to a variable extent (t = -4.550, p < 0.01 for aspartate aminotransferase [AST]; t = -5.467, p < 0.01 for alanine aminotransferase [ALT] at 95% CI). Thirty-eight percent of patients had 2 times and 30% had > 3 times elevation of ALT. Similarly, 40% and 29% of patients showed 2 and > 3 times elevation of the AST level, respectively. Four patients (8%) developed drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Jaundice was the presenting symptom in all patients. The time interval for onset of hepatotoxicity after initiation of therapy was 12–60 days (median 28). Antitubercular drug-induced hepatotoxicity was found more often in younger patients (6% vs 2%; p = 0.368, OR 2.75). Female gender was also a higher risk (p = 0.219, OR 4.2). Most patients who had developed hepatitis were diagnosed per sputum-smear positive reactions. Nutritional status, assessed by body mass index and serum albumin level, was the next predisposing factor.

Conclusions

A finding of an 8% incidence of hepatotoxicity is considerably high. Risk factors of hepatotoxicity included female gender, disease extent, and poor nutritional status. Timely detection and temporary withdrawal of the offending agent can completely cure antitubercular drug-induced hepatotoxicity.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^114zraiE]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Guidance statements — clinically significant drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is defined as any of: serum AST or ALT > 5x ULN or ALP > 2x ULN on two separate occasions, total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP, or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; most hepatotoxic drugs cause injury within the first 6 months, so evaluation should include a detailed medication and HDS history within the 180 days before presentation; classify injury using the ratio (ALT/ULN)/(ALP/ULN) into hepatocellular (R ≥ 5), mixed (2 < R < 5), and cholestatic (R ≤ 2) profiles; excluding alternative causes is required, and certain drugs have phenotype "signatures" useful for causality; We recommend accessing the LiverTox website for literature covering over 1000 prescription drugs.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^113s1NHW]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic approach to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and initial laboratory testing includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin, with serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) as severity markers. Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^115US4Me]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Isoniazid — monitoring strategies and risk — notes U.S. burden and evolving regimens, targeted monitoring, and rechallenge limits. In the United States, an estimated 13 million have latent tuberculosis and > 10,000 are treated for active disease each year; isoniazid remains a leading cause of DILI-related acute liver failure. Latent tuberculosis therapy has changed from 6 to 9 months of isoniazid monotherapy to 3–4-month regimens with other agents. Monthly liver test monitoring is generally reserved for patients with specified risk factors, with periodic tests also considered in those older than 35 years; educating patients to self-monitor and stop when symptoms occur can avert ALF and death. Reintroduction after a DILI episode leads to recurrent liver injury in only 10% of patients but should only be done for active, drug-resistant tuberculosis.

### Severe hepatotoxicity associated with rifampin-pyrazinamide preventative therapy requiring transplantation in an individual at low risk for hepatotoxicity [^112qcMNP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

We report a case of severe hepatotoxicity associated with rifampin-pyrazinamide preventative therapy that required liver transplantation in a closely monitored, human immunodeficiency virus-uninfected individual who had no risk for hepatotoxicity. Because hepatotoxicity associated with this treatment appears to be idiosyncratic, we recommend closer monitoring of liver enzyme levels than do the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, as well as at least temporary interruption of treatment during any elevation of liver enzyme levels greater than the normal value.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^111eYebY]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Isoniazid

In the United States, an estimated 13 million individuals have latent TB, but > 10,000 individuals are treated for active TB each year. Although the incidence of severe DILI appears to be lower than previously appreciated, isoniazid continues to be a leading cause of DILI‐related ALF in the United States and worldwide (Table 2).–The recommended treatment for latent TB has recently changed from 6 to 9 months of isoniazid monotherapy to regimens with a lower risk of hepatoxicity, including 3–4‐month regimens of isoniazid with other agents. Whereas the treatment for active TB still consists of isoniazid, rifamycin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, alternative strategies are now available that depend on various individual patient characteristics.

Over the past 40 years, various recommendations for laboratory monitoring while receiving isoniazid have been proposed that begin with baseline liver assessments for all patients. However, this approach has not been shown to be better than assessing for clinical symptoms of hepatitis at detecting toxicity.–Although the specific details are left to individual local and state programs to adopt, monthly liver test monitoring is generally reserved for those with baseline liver test abnormalities, viral hepatitis, heavy alcohol use, use of other hepatotoxic medications, underlying liver disease or HIV infection, and current or recently pregnant women. Periodic liver tests can also be performed in those older than 35 years of age. Underreporting and poor adherence to American Thoracic Society guidelines are common in cases of isoniazid hepatotoxicity and are associated with hospitalization, death, and liver transplantation. However, when patients are educated to self‐monitor and stop drugs when symptoms occur, ALF and death can be averted. Finally, reintroduction of isoniazid after a DILI episode leads to recurrent liver injury in only 10% of patients but should only be done for patients with active, drug‐resistant TB.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1111WH2K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Ketoconazole — hepatic safety and monitoring: The side-effect profile is relatively benign except for idiosyncratic severe hepatic dyscrasia, estimated to occur in one in 15 000 exposed individuals, for which the FDA issued a black box warning in 2013. Among 33 cases submitted to the FDA from initial marketing in 1980, 18 patients had an 8-fold elevation in transaminases, five had cholestatic injury, and nine had a mixture. Thus, monitoring liver function is necessary; mild asymptomatic elevation in serum transaminases occurs in approximately 10–15% of cases, usually when therapy starts or when doses increase, so close monitoring is needed at these times. Values typically return to normal within 2–4 weeks after stopping therapy or reducing doses, and if liver enzyme elevations remain less than three times the upper limit of normal, most clinicians will continue therapy; when enzyme levels are higher, discontinuation or dose reduction is advised.

Guidance statements

51 Early detection of DILI is best achieved by educating patients to report untoward symptoms to their providers along with prospective clinical and laboratory monitoring with certain high-risk drugs like the ICIs, isoniazid, and methotrexate.
52 All practitioners are encouraged to voluntarily report instances of suspected DILI to the FDA via the MedWatch system at https://www.fda. gov/safet y/medwatch.
53 Transient elevations of serum liver enzymes can be seen with drugs such as isoniazid that are self-limited despite continued dosing, presumably because of metabolic and immunological adaptation.
54 The FDA and LiverTox websites are a rich resource for information about drug hepatotoxicity and provide informative relevant documents and recommendations for surveillance that may be accessed online, including drug labeling and package inserts.
55 Recommendations for hepatotoxicity monitoring vary in detail, according to the background information available. Often, common sense must be applied and/or experts consulted.
56 Recommended monitoring for isoniazid hepatotoxicity includes patient education to report new symptoms suggestive of hepatitis. Monthly laboratory monitoring has not been shown to reduce the incidence of clinically significant liver injury and can lead to premature discontinuation of therapy in many patients. However, many specialty societies advise baseline and on-treatment laboratory monitoring in high-risk individuals.
57 Annual measurement of liver elastography is recommended as a noninvasive means to monitor the hepatotoxicity of drugs like methotrexate that tend to cause silent fibrosis but is not likely applicable to most other drugs that cause DILI.
58 Predosing liver biochemistries are recommended for all patients initiating statin therapy. However, routine on-treatment monitoring of liver biochemistries is not recommended because of the low risk of hepatotoxicity, including patients with liver disease.
59 Patients with known compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis can and should receive statins as clinically indicated. However, use of statins in people with decompensated cirrhosis should be individualized based on assessment of risk versus benefit.
60 Predosing and on-treatment laboratory monitoring is the standard of care for oncology patients receiving ICIs with a series of steps to withhold the drug, increase laboratory monitoring, and use corticosteroids based on the severity of liver injury.

### Drug-induced liver disease [^117ByF2G]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

The year 2002 saw a warning from the US Food and Drug Administration not to use the diet agent, Lipokinetix, and brought to light a few new agents as potential hepatotoxins. Numerous other reports confirmed the hepatotoxicity of several previously described agents. Refinements in causality assessment remain an important aspect in defining drug-induced liver disease and proposed new upper limits of normal for alanine aminotransferase that are lower than most laboratories currently report may require rethinking our definition of "normal liver function tests". Chronic viral hepatitis B and C remain important risk factors for antiretroviral-induced liver injury in patients co-infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and in patients receiving antituberculosis therapy. Acetaminophen retains its status as the most common cause of acute drug-induced liver failure in the United States and in many other countries. Several papers addressed the issue of accidental versus intentional overdoses, the role of alcohol consumption as a risk factor, and newer aspects of treating and preventing acetaminophen injury to the liver. Finally, the use of potentially hepatotoxic medications in patients with underlying liver disease continues to be a controversial topic and a rational approach to the use of such drugs in this setting is provided.

### Zafirlukast [^111Tj3fp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Hepatotoxicity:

Cases of life-threatening hepatic failure have been reported in patients treated with zafirlukast. Cases of liver injury without other attributable cause have been reported from post-marketing adverse event surveillance of patients who have received the recommended dose of zafirlukast (40 mg/day). In most, but not all post-marketing reports, the patient's symptoms abated and the liver enzymes returned to normal or near normal after stopping zafirlukast. In rare cases, patients have either presented with fulminant hepatitis or progressed to hepatic failure, liver transplantation and death. In extremely rare post-marketing cases, no clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of liver dysfunction were reported to precede the latter observations.

Physicians may consider the value of liver function testing. Periodic serum transaminase testing has not proven to prevent serious injury but it is generally believed that early detection of drug-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug enhances the likelihood for recovery.

Patients should be advised to be alert for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction (e.g., right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, flu-like symptoms, and anorexia) and to contact their physician immediately if they occur. Ongoing clinical assessment of patients should govern physician interventions, including diagnostic evaluations and treatment.

### Efficacy, safety and tolerability of GSK2190915, a 5-lipoxygenase activating protein inhibitor, in adults and adolescents with persistent asthma: a randomised dose-ranging study [^114HiUxY]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

GSK2190915 was well-tolerated and there were no differences between treatment groups in the frequency of adverse events. Previous studies of zileuton and MK-0633 suggest that these molecules may have less than optimal safety and tolerability profiles as liver abnormalities were identified. In one study with MK-0633, a planned extension to the study was terminated prematurely and the patients discontinued because of apparent dose-related increases in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels. No such abnormalities were observed in the current study.

As the original protocol allowed recruitment of both male and female subjects, 56 males received at least one dose of study medication. However, interim histopathological assessments of the male reproductive tract from toxicology studies in rats, which were reported during the conduct of the study, revealed testicular toxicity at high exposure levels of GSK2190915. In a proportion of the rats receiving the maximum feasible dose of GSK2190915 (1000 mg/kg/day), testicular atrophy and hypospermia in the epididymides were observed. The reasons behind this finding were unclear at the time and, therefore, it was decided to withdraw all males and only recruit female subjects for the remainder of the study. Although the study population was predominantly female (92%), the results obtained in the study appear applicable to both genders as, generally, no gender-specific results have been described in asthma treatment.

### Efficacy, safety and tolerability of GSK2190915, a 5-lipoxygenase activating protein inhibitor, in adults and adolescents with persistent asthma: a randomised dose-ranging study [^115xhLYu]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

The results reported in this study population suggest that inhibition of FLAP may not provide further improvement on efficacy endpoints beyond those achieved with cysLT receptor antagonism. However, this requires further evaluation in specifically designed clinical trials. In patients with severe asthma, where neutrophil inflammation plays a significant role in disease pathology, zileuton has demonstrated improvements in lung function. Although zileuton is the only LT synthesis inhibitor currently available, its use has been limited by the need to monitor hepatic enzyme levels and the high frequency of dosing. The findings from the current study indicate that GSK2190915 could play a similar role to zileuton in terms of its anti-LT production activity.

Urinary LTE 4 levels decreased in a manner dependent on GSK2190915 dose/GSK2190915 plasma concentration, confirming that GSK2190915 is capable of inhibiting the 5-LO pathway in subjects with persistent asthma. GSK2190915 achieved 50% of maximum estimated inhibition of urinary LTE 4 at a plasma concentration of 33 ng/mL, which is comparable to the value estimated from earlier studies in healthy subjects (unpublished observations). However, reduced LTE 4 was only associated with small and non-statistically significant changes in FEV 1 from baseline. Thus, the measures of efficacy of the present study failed to demonstrate a dose–response for GSK2190915 on FEV 1 even though the pharmacokinetic data confirmed that an increase in drug exposure was associated with a dose-dependent decrease in the levels of urinary LTE 4.

### Deucravacitinib (Sotyktu) [^114fByF6]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.6 Laboratory Abnormalities

Triglyceride Elevations - Treatment with SOTYKTU was associated with increases in triglyceride levels. The effect of this elevated parameter on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. Periodically evaluate serum triglycerides according to the clinical guidelines for hyperlipidemia while patients are receiving treatment with SOTYKTU. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Liver Enzyme Elevations - Treatment with SOTYKTU was associated with an increase in the incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to treatment with placebo. Liver serum transaminase elevations ≥ 3 times the ULN were reported in subjects treated with SOTYKTU. Evaluate liver enzymes at baseline and thereafter in patients with known or suspected liver disease according to routine patient management. If treatment-related increases in liver enzymes occur and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt SOTYKTU until a diagnosis of liver injury is excluded [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.7 Immunizations

Prior to initiating therapy with SOTYKTU, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines including prophylactic herpes zoster vaccination. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with SOTYKTU. The response to live or non-live vaccines has not been evaluated.

5.8 Potential Risks Related to JAK Inhibition

It is not known whether TYK2 inhibition may be associated with the observed or potential adverse reactions of Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibition. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety trial of a JAK inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, higher rates of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, major adverse cardiovascular events, overall thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) were observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. SOTYKTU is not approved for use in RA.

### Elevation of liver enzyme levels during psychopharmacological treatment is associated with weight gain [^112iE18X]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2005). Low credibility.

Increased circulating levels of liver enzymes emerging during treatment with psychotropic drugs are frequently encountered and, in general, attributed to drug metabolism or toxic effects. Because obesity was shown to be associated with elevated liver enzyme levels in different non-psychiatric study samples, we hypothesized that drug-induced weight gain might be an additional causative factor. We tested this hypothesis in 67 inpatients who received psychopharmacological treatment across five weeks. Stepwise linear regression was used to predict changes in the serum levels of aspartate-amino transferase (ASAT) and alanine-amino transferase (ALAT) by changes in the body mass index (BMI), by changes in other biological parameters related to body weight (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha], soluble TNF receptors [sTNF-R], interleukin-6 [IL-6], leptin plasma levels) and by the respective liver enzyme baseline level. BMI changes from baseline to endpoint were significantly associated with the changes in ALAT and ASAT levels across five weeks of treatment and with ALAT and ASAT levels at the end point of the study. The baseline levels of ALAT and ASAT also had a significant impact on these liver enzyme level changes, whereas all other variables had not. These results suggest that weight gain-associated metabolic changes occurring during treatment with psychotropic drugs have consistent and clinically relevant effects on the liver.

### What is the incidence of methotrexate or leflunomide discontinuation related to cytopenia, liver enzyme elevation or kidney function decline? [^117H4URc]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRDs) affect > 1% adults and are treated with DMARDs. These drugs can cause cytopenia, raised liver enzymes and AKI and, fortnightly to monthly monitoring blood-tests are recommended when initiating treatment with less frequent testing thereafter. In the UK, DMARDs are initiated in a rheumatology clinic with prescriptions dispensed from the hospital and fortnightly blood monitoring overseen by the rheumatology team. Once an effective, tolerated and stable dose is reached, the responsibility for prescribing and arranging 2–3 monthly blood-tests is handed to the GP under shared-care policy supported by the British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and Royal College of General Practitioners. The Rheumatology team is contacted if there are side-effects, including blood-test abnormalities and oversee treatment changes. Monitoring blood-tests are discontinued after 2 years for SSZ while long-term testing is continued for low-dose MTX and LEF. Whether such long-term testing influences the decision to discontinue treatment is not known because most clinical trials are shorter than 1 year, and many observational studies report cumulative toxicity including outcomes from the treatment initiation phase during which reversible drug-induced target organ injury is common. However, evidence from a large 2-year clinical trial suggests that DMARD discontinuation due to target organ damage becomes less common with increasing duration of treatment. With growing use of DMARDs and the corresponding increased burden and cost of testing, it is important to evaluate the benefit from regular monitoring blood-tests for long-term low-dose MTX or LEF treatment. Thus, the objectives of this study were to examine the incidence of drug discontinuation and dose reduction with abnormal blood-test results in AIRDs treated with long-term low-dose MTX or LEF. We also explored the data to examine whether the incidence of MTX discontinuation due to any abnormal blood-test result, elevated liver enzymes, AKI or cytopenia differed in RA and PsA as there is evidence that psoriasis increases the risk of hepatotoxicity from MTX.

### Hepatic histopathology and clinical characteristics associated with antiretroviral therapy in HIV patients without viral hepatitis [^1151shSf]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

All available ARV (antiretroviral) agents can cause hepatotoxicity. Many case reports of ARV-induced hepatotoxicity have been described in patients with confounding viral hepatitis. This case series is comprised 23 HIV-positive patients with hepatic enzyme abnormalities but without the evidence of viral hepatitis. The data available for these 23 patients were assessed with an effort to establish any correlation between ARV therapy and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) as well as the histologic findings on liver biopsies.

Methods

The 23 participants included in this study were referred to a hepatology/gastrointestinal clinic that catered specifically to HIV patients. The patients were referred by their HIV providers for evaluation of elevated LFTs, gastrointestinal symptoms or cirrhosis. The data surveyed included variables associated with hepatotoxicity and HIV infection.

Results

Liver biopsies were obtained in 21 out of 23 participants. The remaining two participants had evidence of cirrhosis based on imaging studies. The LFT elevations were definitely or possibly attributed to ARV therapy in 17 out of 23 participants. Specifically, the biochemical hepatotoxicity was definitely related to ARV therapy in six and possibly related to ARV medications in 11 participants. Nine out of 17 participants had evidence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, whereas four out of 17 had clinical features of lipodystrophy. Six participants had elevated LFTs before starting ARV therapy. The participants with nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases had normal LFTs for many years after which a steep rise was noted. All participants with nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases were exposed to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

Conclusion

ARV medications, particularly the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, can cause a dose-dependent hepatotoxicity that occurs after several months of exposure and possibly result in increasing the adverse effects of alcohol and obesity. Owing to the overlap of ARV medications, the contribution of each class of drugs toward the observed hepatotoxicity is not entirely clear. Liver biopsies should be considered in patients receiving ARV therapy with elevated LFTs and/or evidence of fatty liver.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^112eit57]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Drug and supplement-induced liver injury — medications and supplements are emphasized as common sources: "Prescribed and over-the-counter medications, as well as non-prescribed complementary alternative medicines or dietary supplements, represent a common source for acute and chronic liver injury". Workup demands thorough review, since "Identification of an offending agent is challenging and requires a comprehensive query of the patient, his or her family, and careful review of available medical and pharmacy records and laboratory data (22)". Many drugs can raise enzymes: "Many medications are associated with at least a small risk of elevation of ALT/AST/alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin with or without hepatotoxicity", and for statins "there is an extensive literature on the safety in those with chronic liver disease with only rare cases of hepatotoxicity reported (60,61)". In suspected acetaminophen exposure, clarify use when enzymes are markedly elevated: "In those with high ALT levels (> 1,000IU/l) an accurate history of acetaminophen use either as a single medicine or in combination with analgesic-narcotic combinations is essential". Management often involves withdrawal and monitoring: "Attributing liver injury to a specific agent frequently requires empiric trials of drug discontinuation to observe full recovery of liver chemistries", with substitution or surveillance as needed. Clinicians should ask about supplements — "Specific query for non-prescribed supplements is essential to discovery of associated liver injury" — and be aware that "Common herbal supplements associated with hepatotoxicity include chaparral, ephedra, ji bu huan, germander, green tea extract, and shark cartilage (8,62)".

### Alterations in immune function are associated with liver enzyme elevation in HIV and HCV co-infection after commencement of combination antiretroviral therapy [^111XNGWC]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

The cause of liver enzyme elevation during combination antiretroviral therapy in people with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus co-infection is unclear. We followed 12 subjects (five with alanine transaminase elevation) for 24 weeks after combination antiretroviral therapy commencement. Immune responses against hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus and other viruses were assessed by interferon-γ ELISpot. Plasma cytokines, chemokines and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody levels were measured. Those with liver enzyme elevation had higher ELISpot responses both against hepatitis C virus non-structural regions and other viral antigens, and their anti-hepatitis C virus antibody levels were consistently higher, suggesting that reconstitution of both hepatitis C virus-specific and non-hepatitis C virus-specific immune responses may be associated with liver transaminase elevation during combination antiretroviral therapy.

### Pregnancy is associated with elevation of liver enzymes in HIV-positive women on antiretroviral therapy [^114Zd2cp]. AIDS (2015). Low credibility.

To minimize hepatotoxicity risk, NVP-containing regimens are not recommended for individuals starting ART with CD4 + cell count more than 250 cells/μl. In our study, wherein one-fifth of women were receiving a NVP-containing regimen, higher CD4 + cell count category, as a time-dependent variable, was associated with a lower risk of LEE and severe LEE, which counters the evidence that starting ART with CD4 + cell count more than 250 cells/μl increases the risk of NVP-induced hepatotoxicity, although other studies have not found such an association.

As anticipated, the proportion of women who altered their ART was higher when LEE was more severe. It is not surprising that women who experienced LEE in pregnancy were more likely to stop/interrupt treatment than women who experienced LEE outside pregnancy, as many of the pregnant women would have planned to stop ART at delivery irrespective of LEE. The woman who interrupted ART during pregnancy probably did so to avoid using efavirenz. It is of concern that pregnant women who experienced LEE had two times the odds of switching regimen than women who experienced it outside pregnancy.

There was a small but statistically significant increase in risk of LEE and severe LEE with increasing calendar year. This is unlikely to be due to changes in ALT monitoring, as monitoring did not increase overall or in women starting treatment. It could be due to changes in variables not measured by the UK CHIC Study but known to affect ALT such as BMI, alcohol consumption, co-medication or use of illicit drugs.

There were a number of other limitations to the analysis. Data were obtained from an observational study and LFTs were not performed according to a schedule but as a part of routine monitoring and where clinically indicated. This means that women with a high risk of, or with clinical indication for, hepatopathy will have had more ALT measurements. This could increase the detection rate of LEE in those with hepatopathy and therefore lead to an overestimation of the LEE incidence. In addition, HIV-positive women are more regularly monitored in pregnancy than at other times, typically having a minimum of three LFTs (at first antenatal visit, 20 weeks and 36 weeks gestation) than once every 6 months among women stable on treatment. This could introduce bias, increasing the detection rate of LEE in pregnancy. However, among women starting treatment, the average number of ALT measurements was the same in and outside pregnancy.

### Isoniazid [^113A8bkw]. FDA. Low credibility.

Boxed warning regarding the use of isoniazid PO and hepatitis: use extreme caution in all patients, especially those with an increased risk of hepatitis, such as individuals with daily alcohol use, chronic liver disease, or those who use injection drugs. Regularly monitor liver function and conduct clinical evaluations at monthly intervals. For patients aged 35 and older, measure liver enzymes at baseline and periodically throughout treatment. Instruct patients to immediately report any signs or symptoms indicative of liver damage or adverse effects, such as unexplained anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, jaundice, rash, persistent paresthesias of the hands and feet, persistent fatigue, weakness, fever lasting more than 3 days, or RUQ abdominal tenderness. If liver function abnormalities exceed three to five times the ULN, consider discontinuing isoniazid. Promptly discontinue the drug if symptoms of hepatic damage or adverse reactions are observed, as continued use may lead to more severe liver damage. Patients with tuberculosis who experience isoniazid-induced hepatitis should receive alternative treatments, and if isoniazid is reintroduced after recovery, it should be done in gradually increasing doses, with prompt discontinuation if liver issues recur.

### Kinetic patterns of liver enzyme elevation with COVID-19 in the United States [^112Bgcua]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 is a global pandemic that started in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 related liver enzyme elevations have been described however the clinical presentation, enzyme kinetics, and associated laboratory abnormalities of these patients have not been well described. Five cases of COVID-19 associated liver enzyme elevations are reported here. We found that COVID-19 related liver enzyme elevations occurred in a hepatocellular pattern and persisted throughout the initial hospitalization in all patients. Abnormalities in lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels were seen in all five cases. In conclusion, abnormalities in aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin levels are commonly seen in COVID-19 related liver injury. Elevated aminotransferase levels often persist throughout the entire hospitalization. However, the clinical course of COVID-19 related liver injury appears benign.

### Prevailing patterns of liver enzymes in patients with COVID-19 infection and association with clinical outcomes [^112NepRM]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Serum aminotransferase levels are 2 of the most useful markers of hepatic cellular injury. AST is also found in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney and brain tissue, in addition to the liver. Serum ALT and the serum AST/ALT ratio are often measured clinically as biomarkers of liver health. Elevation in the AST/ALT ratio can be seen in patients with alcoholic liver disease. In addition, patients with Wilson's disease or cirrhosis due to viral hepatitis may have AST greater than ALT, though the ratio may not be greater than 2. In our study, we noticed that AST elevation prevailed overall on admission compared to ALT, so we attempted to establish the utility of the AST/ALT ratio in COVID-19 patients. Among our patients, 34% had an AST/ALT ratio ≥ 2. An AST/ALT ratio of 2 or more was associated with the need for intubation (OR 2.678, 95%CI 1.202–5.963; P = 0.016) and need for vasopressors (OR 3.352, 95%CI 1.495–7.514; P = 0.003). In fact, in our study an AST/ALT ratio ≥ 2 was more strongly associated with disease severity compared to AST or ALT alone. Given that the source of AST is not limited to the liver alone, elevation of AST out of proportion to ALT may suggest multiorgan involvement in COVID-19 patients. This could explain the association between an AST/ALT ratio ≥ 2 and poor outcomes, as mentioned above. This needs further validation, as it has not been studied previously, but this was a notable finding in our study. The impact of COVID-19 in those with preexisting chronic liver diseases, such as viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and alcohol related liver disease, is yet to be evaluated further. One study from China reported that patients with underlying chronic hepatitis B infection did not have any higher risk of liver injury or severe disease compared to the overall population, whereas other studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 may aggravate liver injury in patients with viral hepatitis. Similarly, Moon et al also reported a higher case fatality rate among non-cirrhotic chronic liver disease patients compared to the general population. These data need to be validated further. Mean ALP level largely remained normal and there was mild to moderate bilirubin elevation, with a predominance of direct bilirubinemia. However, a statistically significant association could not be established with severe outcomes, such as ICU admission, vasopressor use or death.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115eJLE3]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Use of hepatotoxic drugs

A wide variety of drugs are associated with liver disease, and a requirement for the monitoring of liver functions may be documented. In this systematic review the drugs most commonly implicated included: carbamazepine, methyldopa, minocycline, macrolide antibiotics, nitrofurantoin, statins, sulfonamides, terbinafine, chlorpromazine and methotrexate. In addition, drugs can cause fatty liver and steatohepatitis and vascular injury. Methotrexate treatment requires special care, to prevent dose-dependent liver fibrosis, and non-invasive markers of fibrosis should be monitored. Although statins can lead to drug-induced liver injury, this is very rare, with studies demonstrating they are safe in patients with pre-existing abnormal liver enzymes.

On occasions it can be difficult to establish the relative contribution of a drug or drugs alongside possible concomitant liver disease. In this situation clinical judgement needs to be exercised to determine what is the major contributor and the need to discontinue medication. This will be influenced by the pattern of liver blood tests, the timing of medication use with respect to the liver blood abnormality developing and the clinical setting.

Family history of liver diseases

Investigating the relatives of patients with familial diseases, including haemochromatosis or Wilson's disease, would be an indication for the specific relevant tests: ferritin and transferrin saturation, haemochromatosis genotype, caeruloplasmin and urinary copper.

Liver enzymes are a poor guide to the development of progressive liver fibrosis in alcohol-related liver disease, but elevated enzymes, of which GGT is the best predictor of mortality, can be useful aids to behaviour change. The current NICE recommendation is to screen for advanced liver disease using Fibroscan in patients drinking at harmful levels (50 units/week in men and 35 units/week in women), and there is emerging evidence that a diagnosis of liver fibrosis can be an effective stimulus for behaviour change.

Viral hepatitis

Viral hepatitis may be associated with non-specific symptoms, including fatigue, which may be severe, but the majority of patients are symptom free and identified as a result of risk factors, including country of origin or parental exposure. While liver blood tests can give an indication of necro-inflammation or of advanced fibrosis, a key early test is serology for viral hepatitis in high-risk groups, such as people who inject drugs, migrants from high-prevalence areas, prisoners, as liver blood tests can be normal in this setting (Table 2).

### Prevalence of elevated liver enzymes and its association with type 2 diabetes: a cross-sectional study in Bangladeshi adults [^115AfHen]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health concern affecting millions of people worldwide. The relationship between liver enzymes and T2D has been reported in limited studies; however, there is still a lack of evidence for the Bangladeshi population. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of elevated liver enzymes and examine its association with the prevalence of T2D in Bangladeshi adults.

Methods

A total of 270 individuals (110 diabetic and 160 nondiabetic) were enrolled in the study. Alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT, AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activities were measured in blood serum collected from them. T2D was defined as fasting blood glucose (FBG) ≥ 126 mg/dL or self-reported recent use of insulin or antidiabetic medications. Association between liver enzymes and T2D was evaluated by multinomial logistic regression analysis.

Results

Overall, 61.2% of participants in T2D and 37.1% of participants in the nondiabetes group had at least one or more elevated liver enzymes. The mean concentrations of serum ALT, AST, ALP and GGT were significantly higher in the T2D group compared to the nondiabetes group. The prevalence of elevated liver enzymes was significantly higher in the diabetes group compared to the nondiabetes group (P < .01). In regression analysis, serum GGT activity showed an independent association with the prevalence of T2D.

Conclusions

A high prevalence of elevated liver enzymes was observed in subjects having diabetes. Increased serum GGT activity was independently associated with the prevalence of T2D among Bangladeshi adults. More studies of this nature should be carried out in developing countries to get proper insights into the involvement of liver enzymes in T2D.

5 CONCLUSION

Our results indicated a significant increase in liver enzymes except AST, lipid profile except HDL‐C, and MetS status in both prediabetic and T2MD subjects, with the differences being more pronounced in diabetic individuals. On the one hand, these variables or their ratio may be considered predictive risk factors for diabetes, and on the other hand, they may be utilized as diagnostic factors. However, it is unknown whether T2DM increases liver enzyme levels or whether elevated liver enzyme levels increase the incidence of T2DM, and the pathophysiologic pathways underlying this association are unclear. Therefore, additional research is required to clarify these theories and validate their clinical applications.

### Monitoring for hepatotoxicity: what is the predictive value of liver "function" tests? [^113EvKTy]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major reason drugs fail during development or are withdrawn from the market. The ability to predict, detect, and avoid DILI through appropriate patient selection and effective monitoring has proved to be an elusive goal. Many approved drugs have labeling recommendations for serum enzyme monitoring intended to detect and prevent hepatotoxicity, but such monitoring is often seen as inconvenient, uncomfortable, costly, and inefficient by both patients and doctors, and thus monitoring recommendations are poorly followed, if at all. This review considers whether monitoring works to prevent DILI, whether monitoring recommendations are derived from data or opinions, and whether any better alternatives exist.

Assess LFTs at baseline and every month during the first 6 months of treatment, every 3 months for the next 12 months, and at least annually thereafter. Consider obtaining more frequent monitoring in patients with a history of liver disease, elevated LFTs at baseline, or a history of elevated LFTs with drugs containing elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and/or ivacaftor. Interrupt vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor for significant elevations in LFTs or when signs or symptoms of liver injury develop. Do not use vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) and should only be used when there is a clear medical need, and the benefit outweighs the risk.

### Assessment of the relationship between liver enzymes and cardiovascular disease: a study in Bangladeshi adults [^116D4gT2]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This study explored the relationship between serum liver enzymes and CVD in a population group in Bangladesh. It is worth noting that this is the first study to investigate the association between elevated liver enzymes and CVD in Bangladeshi adults.

In the present study, the prevalence of elevated liver enzymes was significantly higher among subjects with CVD than in subjects without CVD. In regression models, all three liver enzymes showed a positive and independent association with the risk of CVD. Our findings on the association between liver enzymes and CVD are supported by some previous studies. A recent large‐scale population‐based study in Korea indicated that high variability in AST, ALT and GGT was associated with an increased risk for all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular events, and the degree of association was most significant for GGT variability. Another large‐scale study showed a significant relationship between liver enzymes (ALT, AST and GGT) and CVD development and all‐cause mortality in the population of Korea, where GGT showed the strongest association among the three liver enzymes. Further observational studies in the same country showed that individuals with elevated AST or ALT levels had increased risks of CVD‐related mortality and all‐cause mortality than those with normal levels of AST or ALT, after adjusting for several confounding variables.

Another recent study found significant linear relationships between blood pressure and CVD risk factors across the ALT and GGT quartiles. The study indicated GGT as a better marker for predicting the risks of CVD than other liver enzymes. In our study, serum GGT also showed the strongest association with CVD in both genders, which aligns with other studies. In a survey of British men, GGT showed a positive association among all‐cause mortality, ischemic heart disease‐related mortality and CVD risk factors. In another longitudinal study, GGT was independently associated with mortality from CVD in Austrian adults. A meta‐analysis of prospective studies showed that an increased 1 IU/L of GGT was associated with HR = 1.20 for chronic heart disease and HR = 1.54 for stroke. Although previous studies demonstrated an independent association between liver enzymes and CVD risks, considerable heterogeneity was observed among the study's findings. Altogether, apart from hepatic diseases, growing evidence suggests that GGT is an effective marker for obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes and hypertension.

### Prevalence of elevated liver enzymes and its association with type 2 diabetes: a cross-sectional study in Bangladeshi adults [^1139u9J3]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health concern affecting millions of people worldwide. The relationship between liver enzymes and T2D has been reported in limited studies; however, there is still a lack of evidence for the Bangladeshi population. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of elevated liver enzymes and examine its association with the prevalence of T2D in Bangladeshi adults.

Methods

A total of 270 individuals (110 diabetic and 160 nondiabetic) were enrolled in the study. Alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT, AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ‐glutamyltransferase (GGT) activities were measured in blood serum collected from them. T2D was defined as fasting blood glucose (FBG) ≥ 126 mg/dL or self‐reported recent use of insulin or antidiabetic medications. Association between liver enzymes and T2D was evaluated by multinomial logistic regression analysis.

Results

Overall, 61.2% of participants in T2D and 37.1% of participants in the nondiabetes group had at least one or more elevated liver enzymes. The mean concentrations of serum ALT, AST, ALP and GGT were significantly higher in the T2D group compared to the nondiabetes group. The prevalence of elevated liver enzymes was significantly higher in the diabetes group compared to the nondiabetes group (P < .01). In regression analysis, serum GGT activity showed an independent association with the prevalence of T2D.

Conclusions

A high prevalence of elevated liver enzymes was observed in subjects having diabetes. Increased serum GGT activity was independently associated with the prevalence of T2D among Bangladeshi adults. More studies of this nature should be carried out in developing countries to get proper insights into the involvement of liver enzymes in T2D.

### The relationship between hepatic enzymes, prediabetes, and diabetes in the azar cohort population [^117HW7Rp]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

The significant association of ALT and GGT with diabetes odds found in the present study aligns with the role of liver diseases and liver injury in the development of diabetes. As a site of glycogen synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and insulin degradation, the liver plays an essential role in plasma glucose homeostasis. On the other hand, changes in hepatic enzymes have been reported in diabetic patients, with diabetes being associated with liver diseases like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Patients with NAFLD have elevated serum ALT, AST, and GGT levels. Therefore, these hepatic enzymes were used as markers of liver fat accumulation to predict incident diabetes before direct measurements of liver fat became readily available. Moreover, changes in hepatic enzymes can be considered an indicator of liver dysfunction in prediabetic and diabetic patients.

The results also indicated that the increased odds of diabetes with elevated levels of hepatic enzymes were similar in both genders. Moreover, in the association with prediabetes, a similar pattern was observed among men and women, except for AST levels, which were associated with high odds of prediabetes in the fourth quartile in males. Previous studies also reported similar findings in men and women. The study by Doi et al. reported that after adjustment for some confounders, the significant association of serum GGT and ALT with ORs of future diabetes was similar in both genders, but not for AST levels. Diabetes risk increased significantly with elevating quartiles of AST levels for men but not for women. However, André et al. demonstrated a significant association between ALT levels and future diabetes risk in men only.

Hepatotoxicity monitoring in routine clinical practice

A commonsense approach to monitoring is to target individuals who are taking medications that have a high likelihood of causing hepatotoxicity. Important considerations for liver biochemistry monitoring include (i) reference ranges for serum aminotransferase levels that may vary among laboratories, (ii) the presence of baseline elevations in patients with underlying liver disease, (iii) latency of enzyme elevations that may vary from days to months and, rarely, even years (e.g. with nitrofurantoin and minocycline), and (iv) transient and self‐limited aminotransferase elevations encountered with drugs like isoniazid and statins (Figure 2) that can resolve with continued dosing, presumably because of metabolic and or immunological adaptation.

### Hepatitis in children with tuberculosis: a case report and review of the literature [^116mCT2x]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Studies suggest that there are five clinical-histologic forms of liver involvement in patients with TB disease: miliary, granulomatous, nodular, ductal and nodal TB. Of all those, the form associated with miliary TB represents the most common in adults and entails widespread liver dissemination and injury. The frequency of liver involvement in children due to primary TB is unknown, and although clinical experience suggest that clinically apparent hepatic disease in is rare in pediatric patients, elevated LFTs and ALP before initiating anti-TB treatment may suggest diffuse hepatic disease, which is likely what occurred in our case.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical guidelines recommend to screen for LFTs before initiating TB treatment in adults. LFTs then require frequent monitoring only in patients with underlying liver or biliary tract disease, receiving treatment with other hepatotoxic drugs, concomitant HIV infection or previous drug-induced liver injury history, due to the hepatotoxicity associated with first-line agents. In children, small studies have reported rates of hepatotoxicity associated with TB treatment that varied from 8 to 40%, although overall, the occurrence of drug-induced liver toxicity in children is considerably lower than in adults. Nevertheless, baseline LFTs could serve to monitor its potential development and help to identify hepatic TB, for which early identification and management has been associated with better outcomes.

### Hepatotoxic effects of therapies for tuberculosis [^116NZq26]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Hepatotoxic effects attributable to antituberculosis therapy are considered unique among drug-related liver problems because almost all first-line antituberculosis medications have such adverse effects, which vary in severity according to the drug and the regimen. In addition, all regimens for the treatment of active tuberculosis include a combination of medications that must typically be administered for at least 6 months to ensure complete cure of the disease and to minimize the development of drug-resistant bacterial strains. Hepatotoxic effects are a serious problem in patients who are undergoing treatment for tuberculosis, not only because of the morbidity and mortality they directly cause, but also because the liver symptoms can necessitate interruption of therapy or affect a patient's adherence to it, which can limit the efficacy of the antitubercular regimen.

Laboratory methods and data management

LBTs were performed in local laboratories and the normal ranges for each laboratory were used in this analysis. LBT results from between 14 days before the first dose of medication and 7 days after the last dose of trial medication were included. Results for ALT, AST and total bilirubin were expressed as multiples of the upper limit of the local normal range (ULN).

In this study, DILI was defined as either ALT ≥ 5 × ULN or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN with total bilirubin > 2 × ULN, based on the 2011 international DILI Expert Working Group consensus statement. We considered all ALT elevations ≥ 3 × ULN [with or without bilirubin elevations or increased international normalised ratio (INR)] as clinically significant based on thresholds used by both the ATS and BTS guidance. The trial adverse event reporting system was used to obtain details of symptoms at the time of DILI episodes and clinically significant elevations by collecting all events within a time window of 5 days before through to 5 days after the peak ALT elevation. For patients with a peak ALT ≥ 3 × ULN, serious adverse event narratives for the REMoxTB trial were reviewed for information regarding treatment interruptions, herbal medications, alcohol use and additional tests carried out. Additionally, where sufficient information was available, we applied the Roussel–Uclaf causality assessment method (RUCAM) to identify a causal relationship between the TB medication and peak ALT ≥ 3 × ULN. The criteria for the RUCAM score can be found in Additional file 1: Table S2.

We searched the recorded adverse events for the terms 'ascites', 'cirrhosis', 'child', 'hepatic', and 'liver' and applied the Child–Pugh scoring criteria (Additional file 1: Table S3) to those patients with evidence of chronic liver disease within 1 month of their first dose of trial medication, to categorise those with stage A or B liver disease.

We identified all patients with ALT > 1 × ULN at baseline and further ALT elevations on treatment. LBTs in the database were labelled as having been taken either at a protocol-scheduled visit or at an unscheduled visit that was clinically indicated. For each treatment arm, we calculated the proportion of LBTs that were taken at scheduled visits compared to unscheduled tests for both DILI cases and clinically significant elevations.

Methotrexate safety monitoring — liver and hepatotoxicity: Liver function test monitoring is recommended every 3 to 6 months when results are normal, and abnormal elevations should prompt a repeat laboratory check in 2 to 4 weeks. For persistent elevations, a gastrointestinal (GI) referral is recommended. For patients with risk factors for hepatotoxicity, it may be reasonable to consider an alternative therapy to methotrexate; if methotrexate is chosen, recommended hepatotoxicity monitoring is similar to that in low-risk individuals, except noninvasive hepatic specific serology should be performed at baseline and annually thereafter, irrespective of total cumulative dose.

### The phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is a determinant of zileuton response in adults with asthma [^1138u4LZ]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2018). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that genetic variation at the level of unique biological pathways is associated with variability in lung function in response to zileuton. In order to identify sets of genes and pathways that were associated with zileuton response, we first performed a pathway-based analysis using GWAS data obtained from a recent genome-wide investigation of zileuton response. The advantage of using data identified through GWAS to interrogate biological pathways is that this method enriches for potentially functionally important candidate genes and SNPs that may not have been individually strongly associated with clinical response phenotypes. Having identified a set of candidate genes and pathways related to clinical response to zileuton, we then sought to identify specific QTLs associated with changes in LTB 4 concentrations post-treatment, as well as changes in global mRNA expression. We next integrated pathway enrichment and QTL information to identify potentially causal candidate genes. Finally, we experimentally validated the expression of selected candidate pathway genes, and determined the activation status of a key pathway of interest.

### Liver enzymes elevation after HAART in HIV-HCV co-infection [^113oNv5T]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection is common among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. The incidence and risk factors associated with hepatotoxicity in this population after high active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is initiated are still not well-understood. We argued to evaluate the incidence and risk factors associated with liver enzyme elevation (LEE) and their clinical significance. A retrospective chart review of patients who started HAART and had follow up at our centre for at least 1 year was undertaken. The frequency and severity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation after treatment initiation were investigated and searched for clinical manifestations. Between January 1996 and March 2002, 85 HIV-HCV co-infected patients began HAART and continued follow up for at least 1 year. The incidence of severe toxicity [grades 3 + 4 LEE: > 5 and > 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) of ALT or AST] was calculated at 4% per person-years. There were no clinical manifestations of liver toxicity, and patients continued their treatment with a trend towards a decrease of their enzymes. No statistical differences in opportunistic infections or mortality were evident. The variables associated with severe hepatotoxicity were a higher baseline AST, higher international normalized ratio (INR) and lower albumin. A baseline AST < 2.1 ULN had a negative predictive value of 92% of leading to severe hepatotoxicity. In HIV-HCV co-infected patients therefore, the group at a higher risk of developing higher transaminase elevations is the one with a higher baseline AST, higher INR and lower albumin.

### Liver injury in children: signal analysis of suspected drugs based on the food and drug administration adverse event reporting system [^114DwQs3]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

In this study, six signals were found to be disproportionally associated with pediatric liver injury for the first time, namely acetylcysteine, thiopental, temazepam, nefopam, primaquine, and pyrimethamine. Acetylcysteine (also known as N-acetylcysteine, NAC) was detected as a disproportional signal associated with pediatric hepatic injury (ROR, 3.0; 95% CI 1.9–4.8). None of these HAEs had been reported in either package inserts or the published literature since NAC was marketed. NAC is the only drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of DILI caused by acetaminophen (APAP) overdose and might prevent hepatic injury by restoring glutathione levels. A dosage of NAC for children greater than 5 kg is set based on clinical practice; however, the safety and effectiveness of NAC have not been verified in adequate and well-controlled studies. The ACG Clinical Guideline: Diagnosis and Management of Idiosyncratic Drug-Induced Liver Injury suggests the use of NAC for children with ALF caused by severe DILI, as a significantly lower 1-year spontaneous survival rate was associated with the intravenous infusion of NAC in children with non-APAP ALF in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. In our study, we found that NAC was a secondary suspected or concomitant drug in most reports and a primary suspicious drug in one report where APAP was secondary. Therefore, as a disproportional signal, NAC is used to treat or prevent HAEs, especially APAP-induced HAEs. However, whether NAC has a negative effect on children with non-APAP ALF is unclear.

We also found an association between temazepam use and pediatric liver injury (ROR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2–4.7). No hepatotoxic risk is indicated in the prescribing information, and there is a lack of evidence to ensure the effectiveness and safety of temazepam among children. Temazepam is a benzodiazepine, and it is uncommon to observe elevated hepatic enzymes with benzodiazepine used and to report hepatoxic cases in practice. However, it has been reported that benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam, flurazepam, and triazolam) are associated with rare cholestatic liver injuries. We have not retrieved any literature directly reporting temazepam-induced liver injury and postulated that this is due to its lower frequency of medication and shorter duration. In addition, there is a possibility that cross-sensitivity to temazepam might occur with other benzodiazepines.

### Association between the cumulative dose of cyclosporine and liver enzyme abnormalities in dermatology patients managed with a low-dose regimen [^116Xw4F5]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Cyclosporine (CsA) is an immunosuppressive agent that specifically inhibits T cell-related immune responses. There is little evidence regarding the association between low-dose CsA administration and abnormal hepatic function in dermatology patients. This study aimed to examine the association between the cumulative dose of CsA and liver enzyme abnormalities obtained from peripheral blood tests in patients with skin diseases. A retrospective single-center study of 697 patients who were prescribed CsA for skin disease in the outpatient dermatology clinic between 2015 and 2019 were performed. Multiple logistic regression with confounder adjustment was performed to assess the association between the cumulative dose of CsA and liver enzyme abnormalities. Compared to patients with the lowest cumulative dose of CsA (˂7.0g), patients with the highest cumulative dose of CsA (≥ 30.6g) were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of developing liver enzyme abnormalities (odds ratio [OR] = 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02–3.79). In the stratified analysis, patients with the highest cumulative dose of CsA (≥ 30.6g) were significantly associated with a 1.5-or higher alanine aminotransferase elevation from baseline (OR = 2.26, CI = 1.08–4.73). Patients prescribed long-term, low-dose CsA up to a high cumulative dose (≥ 30.6g) may be associated with an increased risk of developing liver enzyme abnormalities. However, these liver enzyme elevations were not severe in magnitude and were reversible.

### Drug-induced aminotransferase alterations during antiretroviral HIV post-exposure prophylaxis [^117226xT]. AIDS (2003). Low credibility.

In 655 individuals receiving HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), drug-induced aminotransferase alterations were frequent and severe in the nevirapine-including regimen, rare and mild-to-moderate in other combinations, and always reversible. Grade 3–4 incidence in protease inhibitor or nevirapine PEP was 0.5 and 25.0 per 100 person-months, respectively. Apart from nevirapine, continuing PEP appears to be safe even in the case of aminotransferase alterations. The usefulness of routine monitoring of liver function during PEP could be re-considered.

### Highlights of prescribing information… [^114stYow]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

The levels returned to < 2×ULN or normal within 9 and 12 days, respectively. The ALT elevations in the other 3 patients were observed to return to < 2×ULN or normal within 15, 19, and 31 days after zileuton extended-release tablets discontinuation. There appeared to be no clinically relevant relationship between the time of onset and the magnitude of the first elevation or the magnitude of first elevation and time to resolution. The hepatic function enzyme elevations attributed to zileuton extended-release tablets did not result in any cases of jaundice, development of chronic liver disease, or death in this clinical trial. ALT elevations were observed in 1. 8% of patients treated with zileuton extended-release tablets compared to
0. 7% in patients treated with placebo. The majority of elevations were reported within the first 3 months of treatment and resolved within 21 days for most of these patients after discontinuation of the drug.

The hepatic function enzyme elevations attributed to zileuton extended-release tablets did not result in any cases of jaundice, development of chronic liver disease, or death in this clinical trial. Zileuton is an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase and thus inhibits leukotriene formation. Both the R and S enantiomers are pharmacologically active as 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors in in vitro and in vivo systems. Zileuton is an orally active inhibitor of ex vivo LTB4 formation in several species, including mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, sheep, and monkeys. Zileuton inhibits arachidonic acid-induced ear edema in mice, neutrophil migration in mice in response to polyacrylamide gel, and eosinophil migration into the lungs of antigen-challenged sheep. In patients with asthma receiving zileuton immediate-release tablets 600 mg four times daily, peak plasma levels averaging 5. 9 µg/mL were associated with a mean LTB4 inhibition of 98%.

Zileuton inhibits the synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes as demonstrated by reduced urinary LTE4 levels. Metabolism In vitro studies utilizing human liver microsomes have shown that zileuton and its N-dehydroxylated metabolite can be oxidatively metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.
