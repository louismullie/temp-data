## Question

Give me multiple differentials for a lump in the anal fissure around 1 inch from the anal sphincter

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for multiple differentials for a "lump in the anal fissure around 1 inch from the anal sphincter". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomic location and whether "1 inch from the anal sphincter" implies perianal skin versus anal canal. Then, I should verify the most likely diagnosis given the context of a fissure and a "lump". Next, I will consider key differentials that can mimic or coexist with a fissure, including sentinel tag, thrombosed external hemorrhoid, perianal abscess/fistula, condyloma, and malignancy. After that, I need to check for atypical fissure features that would broaden the differential to inflammatory or infectious etiologies. Finally, I will outline a practical diagnostic approach and when to escalate to imaging or biopsy, anchoring to guidelines and evidence quality as I go.

> Let me first confirm the anatomic frame. "1 inch from the anal sphincter" most plausibly corresponds to the perianal skin at the anal verge, where chronic anal fissures classically develop a distal sentinel skin tag and a proximal hypertrophied anal papilla, both of which can be felt as small "lumps" associated with the fissure itself [^0ca53bac] [^59496897]. Wait, let me verify the typical fissure landmarks: posterior midline is most common, anterior midline is more frequent in women, and lateral or multiple fissures are atypical and should prompt evaluation for secondary causes, which matters if the "lump" is not in the expected midline location [^0ca53bac] [^6a5fd1fc].

> I will now examine the most likely diagnosis. In the context of a chronic anal fissure, a sentinel skin tag at the distal extent of the fissure is the leading explanation for a small, firm, tender perianal "lump" near the anal verge; this is a hallmark chronic feature alongside a hypertrophied papilla and exposed internal sphincter fibers at the fissure base, and it aligns with the 1-inch distance from the sphincter complex [^0ca53bac] [^59496897]. Hold on, I should confirm that this is consistent with guideline descriptions of chronic fissure morphology, which it is [^0ca53bac].

> Next, I should review key mimics and coexisting conditions. A thrombosed external hemorrhoid presents as a painful, tender, bluish perianal lump at the anal verge and can be confused with a sentinel tag; careful inspection and palpation usually distinguish the thrombus from a fibrotic tag, and thrombosed externals are common causes of acute anal pain with a mass [^aff0a67c] [^5baa4e00]. But wait, what if the "lump" is fluctuant and warm? That would steer me toward a perianal abscess, which can coexist with or be mistaken for a fissure; abscesses require prompt drainage and are linked to fistula formation in a substantial fraction of cases, so I need to check for induration, fluctuance, and systemic signs before concluding it's just a tag [^162e593c] [^e8013954].

> I need to ensure I consider infectious and neoplastic differentials that can masquerade as a fissure with a mass. Condyloma acuminata can produce verrucous, cauliflower-like perianal growths and may be mistaken for a tag or even coexist with fissures; sexual history and inspection for multifocal warts guide suspicion, and HPV-related disease is more prevalent in immunocompromised hosts or men who have sex with men, warranting a lower threshold for biopsy and HPV testing when morphology is atypical [^a31b5cf5] [^48f1da28]. Anal squamous cell carcinoma can present as a firm, indurated mass with pain or bleeding and may be misattributed to a chronic fissure; risk factors include HPV, HIV, and immunosuppression, so any nonhealing, firm, or fixed lesion deserves biopsy and staging workup rather than empiric fissure treatment [^acc1e169] [^59b048cf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a "simple" fissure. I should double-check for atypical fissure features that broaden the differential. Lateral location, multiple fissures, or fissures in the setting of Crohn's disease, HIV, syphilis, or tuberculosis should prompt evaluation for secondary causes; in these contexts, fissures may be painless, indolent, or associated with other perianal disease such as fistulas or tags, and guidelines recommend targeted history, exam, and selective labs or imaging to exclude these entities [^0ca53bac] [^8235835b]. Let me reconsider: if the patient has diarrhea, weight loss, perianal fistulas, or is immunocompromised, I should escalate to endoscopy, MRI, or CT based on suspected disease rather than assume a primary fissure [^e27e8ec2].

> I will now outline a practical diagnostic approach. First, focused history on bowel habits, pain character, bleeding, sexual exposures, immunosuppression, and IBD symptoms; then, gentle external inspection and digital rectal exam, ideally with anoscopy to visualize the fissure, sentinel tag, and papilla, while assessing for thrombosed hemorrhoid, abscess, condyloma, or mass; reserve exam under anesthesia if pain precludes adequate evaluation [^0ca53bac] [^3cbf13e2]. Wait, I should verify when imaging is indicated: in atypical fissures or when malignancy, IBD, or occult sepsis are suspected, endoscopy, MRI, CT, or endoanal ultrasound can be used selectively based on the suspected pathology, whereas typical acute fissures do not require imaging [^e27e8ec2] [^129d2c53].

> Let me think about management implications briefly, because they reinforce the diagnosis. For a chronic fissure with sentinel tag, first-line therapy is topical calcium channel blocker or nitrate with fiber and fluids; if medical therapy fails, lateral internal sphincterotomy is the surgical treatment of choice in appropriately selected patients without baseline incontinence, with high healing rates and acceptable continence outcomes in trials and guidelines [^fc31b3cf] [^069df6ac]. Hold on, I should verify exceptions: patients with IBD, prior sphincter injury, or high risk of incontinence may be better served by botulinum toxin or anocutaneous flap rather than sphincterotomy, underscoring why confirming the diagnosis and patient selection matter before committing to surgery [^bfdf29cb] [^41be0707].

> In summary, I should confirm the leading diagnosis as a sentinel skin tag associated with a chronic anal fissure at the anal verge, while actively excluding thrombosed external hemorrhoid, perianal abscess or fistula, condyloma, and anal carcinoma based on morphology, location, and risk factors. Atypical fissure features mandate evaluation for secondary causes such as Crohn's disease, HIV, syphilis, or tuberculosis, and selective imaging or biopsy should be pursued when red flags are present rather than assuming a benign fissure alone [^0ca53bac] [^8235835b] [^acc1e169].

The most likely cause of a 1-inch perianal lump near an anal fissure is a **sentinel tag** (hypertrophied skin tag) from a chronic fissure [^0ca53bac] [^59496897]. Other common causes include a **thrombosed external hemorrhoid** (painful, bluish lump) [^aff0a67c], a **perianal abscess** (fluctuant, erythematous, tender) [^162e593c], and a **condyloma** (warty, HPV-related growth) [^a31b5cf5]. Less common but serious causes include **anal squamous cell carcinoma** (firm, indurated, nonhealing) [^acc1e169] and **Crohn's disease** (multiple, atypical, or lateral fissures with tags) [^0ca53bac] [^fcc83899]. Evaluation is clinical, with anoscopy or exam under anesthesia if needed; atypical features or nonhealing lesions warrant biopsy and imaging (MRI/endoscopic ultrasound) to exclude malignancy or inflammatory disease [^e27e8ec2] [^3cbf13e2].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Differentiating characteristics** |
|-|-|-|
| Sentinel tag (chronic anal fissure) | - Small, firm, skin-colored tag at the fissure base <br/> - Often painless unless inflamed <br/> - Associated with chronic fissure | - History of chronic anal pain/bleeding <br/> - Visible fissure <br/> - Hypertrophied papilla proximally [^0ca53bac] [^59496897] |
| Thrombosed external hemorrhoid | - Sudden painful, bluish, firm lump at anal verge <br/> - May bleed if ruptures | - Acute onset <br/> - No fissure <br/> - Blue discoloration <br/> - Tense, tender [^aff0a67c] [^5baa4e00] |
| Perianal abscess | - Fluctuant, erythematous, tender mass <br/> - Fever, malaise <br/> - May drain pus | - Warmth <br/> - Fluctuance <br/> - Systemic signs <br/> - No chronic fissure history [^162e593c] [^73fb6948] |
| Condyloma acuminatum (HPV warts) | - Warty, cauliflower-like growths <br/> - Multiple <br/> - May be asymptomatic or pruritic | - Warty appearance <br/> - No fissure <br/> - STI risk factors [^a31b5cf5] [^48f1da28] |
| Anal squamous cell carcinoma | - Firm, indurated, nonhealing mass <br/> - Bleeding <br/> - Pain <br/> - Weight loss | - Firmness <br/> - Fixation <br/> - Nonhealing <br/> - Risk factors (HPV, HIV, smoking) [^acc1e169] [^59b048cf] |
| Crohn's disease-associated perianal disease | - Multiple, atypical, or lateral fissures <br/> - Skin tags <br/> - Fistulas <br/> - Abscesses | - Multiple/lateral fissures <br/> - Fistulas <br/> - Systemic symptoms <br/> - IBD history [^0ca53bac] [^fcc83899] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **History and physical examination**: Assess pain, bleeding, duration, STI risk, IBD symptoms, and bowel habits; inspect for fissure, tag, hemorrhoid, abscess, or warts [^0ca53bac] [^a31b5cf5].
- **Anoscopy**: Visualize the fissure, tag, and anal canal; consider exam under anesthesia if pain limits evaluation [^3cbf13e2] [^46349a52].
- **Imaging**: MRI or endoanal ultrasound if atypical fissures, suspected abscess/fistula, or malignancy; endoscopy if IBD or malignancy suspected [^e27e8ec2] [^3cbf13e2].
- **Biopsy**: For nonhealing, indurated, or warty lesions to exclude malignancy or HPV-related disease [^acc1e169] [^11e39eff].

---

## Conclusion

A 1-inch perianal lump near an anal fissure is most often a **sentinel tag** from a chronic fissure, but thrombosed hemorrhoid, abscess, condyloma, and carcinoma must be considered. Atypical features or nonhealing lesions require **biopsy and imaging** to exclude serious disease [^0ca53bac] [^e27e8ec2].

Anal fissures are a common anorectal condition typically occurring in the midline. They often present with pain and bleeding though presentation can be variable. Most fissures are associated with hypertonic anal sphincter, though other etiologies include infection, inflammatory bowel disease, and malignancy. Diagnosis is primarily clinical. Initial management involves increased fiber and fluid intake, and symptom management. Chronic fissures may require topical nitrates, calcium channel blockers, botulinum toxin, or surgery. Lateral internal sphincterotomy is the gold standard surgical management. Special considerations exist for certain patient populations.

7) Acute anal fissure 7. A - in patients with suspected acute anal fissure, what is the role of clinical examination and biochemical investigations?

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of biochemical investigations in patients with typical acute anal fissure, based on the available literature.

In patients with atypical acute anal fissure, we suggest to collect a focused medical history and perform a complete physical examination and laboratory tests based on the suspected associated illness, to rule out other causes (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Anal fissure (AF) is a longitudinal tear within the anal canal that can extend from the dentate line to the anal verge. The diagnosis of AF commonly occurs in the third decade of life without any difference among sex. Approximately 90% of anal fissures are located posteriorly in the midline, while anterior fissures occur in 10% of women versus 1% of men. AF are rarely located laterally in the anal canal or multiple in number. In these atypical cases, associated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), sexually transmitted diseases (HIV, syphilis, or herpes), anorectal cancer, or tuberculosis should be ruled out. The exact etiology of AF is still unknown. Mechanical rauma caused by the passage of hard stools is not enough to explain their onset and less than 25% of patients with AF complains of constipation. Moreover, manometric studies have supported the ischemic ulcer theory, with a strong correlation between internal anal sphincter (IAS) hypertonia and decreased anodermal vascular blood flow.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of anal fissures [^0ca53bac]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). High credibility.

Anal fissure — definition, symptoms, and typical locations are outlined as follows: The term anal fissure refers to a linear tear within the anal canal that usually extends from the dentate line toward the anal verge. Trauma and irritation to the anal canal, often precipitated by either constipation or diarrhea, can lead to development of an anal fissure. The primary symptom associated with anal fissures is anal pain, provoked by defecation, and may last for several hours after defecation; the pain is usually sharp, feels like a tearing sensation or "passing glass", and can be debilitating because of the intensity. Anorectal bleeding may also be present, typically bright red when wiping. Anal fissures are most commonly located in the posterior midline (73%) but can be found in the anterior midline in 13% of women and 8% of men, with 2.6% occurring both anteriorly and posteriorly simultaneously. Lateral fissures or multiple fissures are considered to be an atypical presentation and require a more comprehensive evaluation. Although this benign anorectal condition is commonly encountered in practice, there is a paucity of population-level data describing its incidence.

Benign anorectal conditions produce anal pain, rectal bleeding, or discharge from the perianal region, which are highly prevalent symptoms in the general population. Hemorrhoidal disease, anal fissure, perianal abscess, proctalgia syndromes, and pruritus anii are the most common clinical disorders. Well-trained physicians, irrespective of their specialty, can treat most of these disorders and refer them to a specialist in proctology only when necessary. The aim of this review is to provide a practical guide to the management of benign anorectal disorders in terms of their initial management and the criteria for specialist referral.

The following constitutes key background information on anal fissure:

- **Definition**: AFs refer to an anorectal disorder characterized by a tear in the squamous epithelium of the anus, distal to the dentate line. Fissures are defined as acute if present for < 6 weeks, and they are defined as chronic if present for > 6 weeks.
- **Pathophysiology**: Various risk factors increase the risk of AFs, mediating their effects via mechanical tissue trauma, ischemia of the anal canal, impaired sphincter structure or function, or anal hypertonicity.
- **Epidemiology**: The annual incidence of AFs in the US is estimated at 110 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: AFs may cause clinical manifestations of anal pain, spasm, and/or bleeding with defecation.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Medical treatment is associated with over 70% success rates. Surgical treatment, which is typically reserved for patients in whom medical therapy fails, yields excellent outcomes.

### Current concepts in anal fissures [^9000702e]. World Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Anal fissure is a common and distressing problem the true incidence of which is probably higher than recorded. There is a progressive understanding of the etiopathogenesis of this entity and the changing trend in its management approach. This is a systematic review of available published literature looking at current management options in anal fissures.

Methods

A MEDLINE-based search of the relevant literature from 1970 to 2004 was performed on the current concepts in etiopathogenesis and management of anal fissure.

Results

The current opinion is a drift toward conservative measures as the first- and second-line approaches rather than surgery for treatment of anal fissure. Simple and readily available measures with less complication, good patient compliance, and satisfaction requiring no hospitalization should first be considered.

Conclusions

Most anal fissures heal with medical therapy, but their limitations include side effects, poor compliance, and recurrence of the fissure. A cautious surgical approach is required to treat those who do not respond to medical therapy.

### ACG clinical guidelines: management of benign anorectal disorders [^5baa4e00]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Hemorrhoids — diagnostic assessment and grading — gastroenterologists and other providers should diagnose hemorrhoids by history and physical examination, and if there is bleeding, the source often requires confirmation by endoscopic studies (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Physical examination should include visual inspection of the anus, both at rest and while straining, and digital examination for other anal pathology, and internal hemorrhoids can be assigned a functional grade based on their history: first-degree hemorrhoids do not prolapse, second-degree hemorrhoids prolapse but self-reduce, third-degree hemorrhoids protrude and require manual reduction, and fourth-degree hemorrhoids protrude and cannot be reduced. Laboratory testing is almost never helpful, and the clinical diagnosis of hemorrhoids usually includes hemorrhoid-pattern bleeding that mandates at least sigmoidoscopy to rule out other sources of bleeding; in patients over the age of 50 years or with a suggestive family history, this may be the occasion for evaluation of the entire colon, usually by colonoscopy. Hemorrhoids without symptoms are not diagnosed by flexible endoscopy, and a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is easily recognized on physical examination as a usually tender blue lump at the anal verge, and no other workup or classification is needed.

Painful and bothersome anorectal syndromes can be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for clinicians because structural and functional abnormalities may often coexist and require a multidisciplinary approach to management. Although it is often difficult to attribute all of a patient's anorectal symptoms to a singular disorder with definitive intervention and cure, improving quality of life, treating coexistent conditions such as functional constipation and/or defecation disorders, addressing psychological comorbidities if present, and confirming there is no evidence of inflammatory or malignant conditions are top priorities.

### Non-surgical treatments for anal fissure in adults [^72b5a3f7]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

An anal fissure is defined as a linear tear or ulcer of the anal mucosa. Patients typically describe a sharp pain 'like passing broken glass' on defaecation, followed by a burning pain in the anus lasting a few hours. Pain and bleeding during and after the passage of stool are the usual presenting features. Fissures are most common in young to middle-aged adults and are also commonly seen in pregnant and postpartum women. The lifetime incidence of anal fissure is around 11%. Here, we review the evidence on the efficacy and safety of non-surgical treatments for anal fissure.

### Anorectal disorders: an update [^71bfe61b]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Anorectal disorders encompass structural, neuromuscular, and functional disorders. They are common, often distressing, and in some cases debilitating, and significantly add to the health care burden. They present with multiple, overlapping symptoms that can often obscure the underlying pathology and can pose significant diagnostic and management dilemmas. A meticulous history and comprehensive digital rectal examination can provide clarity on the diagnosis, appropriate testing, and management of these conditions. Today, with the development of sophisticated diagnostic tools such as high-resolution and high-definition (3-D) anorectal manometry, 3-D anal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance defecography and imaging, and neurophysiological tests such as translumbosacral anorectal magnetic stimulation, it is possible to more accurately define and characterize the underlying structural and functional abnormalities. In this review, we present a succinct update on the latest knowledge with regards to the pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of anal fissure, hemorrhoids, rectal prolapse, intussusception, rectocele, solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, levator ani syndrome, dyssynergic defecation and fecal incontinence.

Despite the knowledge of etiological association with high-risk human papilloma viruses and high-risk patient cohorts, the incidence of anal squamous cell carcinoma has continued to rise. The known precursor lesion (in particular, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) makes it amenable to screening and surveillance strategies. However, the diagnosis of anal intraepithelial neoplasia suffers from interpretation challenges leading to high interobserver variability, along with numerous differential diagnoses and lingering terminology issues. Proper treatment of anal lesions requires accurate diagnosis, and while a variety of modalities are available for treatment, the rate of recurrence remains high and each modality has its own set of side effects and complications. The aim of this review article is to outline the diagnostic considerations and provide practical tips for diagnosing anal squamous intraepithelial lesions.

AF can be divided, temporally and morphologically, into acute and chronic: acute fissures are superficial, with well-demarcated edges and last less than 6 weeks; chronic fissures are characterized by a distal sentinel tag and a proximal hypertrophied anal papilla with the exposure of the IAS fibers at the base of the AF and symptoms for over 6 weeks.

The diagnosis of AF is mainly clinical and is based on recent and past medical history, including family history and complete physical examination. Patients with AF often complain of severe and prolonged anal pain, referred as passing a "broken glass", during and after defecation. Other associated symptoms include spasm and/or intermittent bleeding with defecation. When the tone of the IAS is too high, digital rectal examination can be painful and an examination under anesthesia is indispensable to rule out other concomitant diseases such as anal abscess or fistula. No recommendation can be made regarding the role of biochemical investigations among patients presenting typical acute anal fissure or referring similar symptomatology, based on the available literature. In case of a suspicion but non-conclusive physical examination, when concomitant diseases are suspected, laboratory tests should be based on the supposed associated diseases to rule out other causes.

7.B - in patients with suspected acute anal fissure, which are the appropriate imaging investigations?

No recommendation can be made regarding the use of imaging investigations in patients with typical acute anal fissure, based on the available literature.

In patients with atypical acute anal fissure, we suggest to perform investigations (endoscopy, CT scan, MRI, or endoanal ultrasound) only in case of suspected concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, anal or colorectal cancer or occult perianal sepsis (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Usually, no imaging investigations are necessary at initial presentation of acute AF. In case of a suspicion but non-conclusive physical examination, if the fissure cannot be seen, the diagnosis is unclear, or if there is significant bright red bleeding in a patient with an increased risk for colorectal cancer or in patients above 50 years of age or if there are features suggesting a secondary anal fissure, imaging such as endo-anal ultrasound, endoscopy, CT scan, or MRI, may be required. The choice of the appropriate imaging technique should be driven by the suspected underling disease. Anorectal manometry could be indicated in patients who have undergone previous surgery, but it is frequently too painful to be performed with in the emergency setting.

### Benign anorectal disease: hemorrhoids, fissures, and fistulas [^91c10a2a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

There is a separate entity of fissures associated with childbirth that appear to be due to shear forces from the baby's head during birth, causing tethering of the mucosa to muscle and local trauma. About 11% of chronic fissures, associated with difficult or instrumented deliveries, occur after childbirth, and are most common in the anterior midline. These fissures are not associated with increased sphincter tone, but have normal or even low tone, so sphincterotomy is not indicated for treatment.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of anal fissure is a clinical one. Patients usually present with anal pain, most commonly for several hours after bowel movements, and may have painful bleeding with bowel movements. A fissure may be found upon examination, although this may be difficult because of pain and internal sphincter spasm. Chronic fissures develop indurated edges and may have visible sphincter muscle at the base with associated hypertrophic papilla proximally and sentinel tags distally (Fig. 2).

Discussion

Although PV is known to involve the anal area, the frequency at which it occurs varies widely among studies, ranging from 2–27.9%. Chams-Davatchi et al observed anal lesions in 2% of 1209 patients with PV, while Malik et al reported an incidence of 10% in their retrospective cohort of 160 PV patients. Kherzi et al, in a prospective study of 168 newly diagnosed cases of PV, found a 27.9% rate of anal involvement and suggested that anal PV seems underreported. Anal involvement was significantly associated with PV in other mucosal sites (ophthalmic, nasal, genital). It was also significantly correlated with the severity of concomitant oral PV, but not with the severity of cutaneous lesions. Hemorrhoids were observed in 17 (10%) patients; interestingly, 16 of the 17 patients with hemorrhoids also had anal PV, suggesting that repeated trauma during defecation might be a triggering factor. Our case illustrates that anal mucosa is a site of PV recurrence, even when other sites are in remission.

PV treatment challenges include shorter treatment periods and better quality of life for the patients. Since early initiation of treatment, before PV becomes too severe or widespread, has been associated with improved prognosis in general, early recognition of anal involvement may be important in the management of PV patients. Regarding therapy, our patient responded favorably to treatment with rituximab, in concordance with the results of a previous study with this drug in PV patients of the same genetic heritage.

Routine anal clinical examination is recommended even in asymptomatic patients with PV, while anoscopy performed by a colorectal specialist is indicated in patients with local discomfort and/or unexplained anal pain, particularly in the presence of hemorrhoids. Confirmatory skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence testing are essential in order to achieve prompt diagnosis and appropriate management of PV. Gastroenterologists should be aware of this manifestation and have a high index of suspicion for PV alongside more common differential diagnoses, such as anal fissures, hemorrhoids or cancer, especially in patients with either a history of pemphigus or a not yet diagnosed oral erosive disease.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^f6a8b53c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with suspected complicated hemorrhoids, we suggest to perform imaging investigation (CT scan, MRI, or endoanal ultrasound) only if there is suspicion of concomitant anorectal diseases (sepsis/abscess, inflammatory bowel disease, neoplasm) (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

The literature regarding complicated hemorrhoids is extremely scarce, and none of the studies investigate the role of imaging techniques in this specific subset of patients. Acute anal pain is the typical manifestation of multiple anal diseases, including hemorrhoidal crisis, anorectal abscesses, and anal fissures. The presence of an associated anorectal mass may further complicate the scenario, considering that not only thrombosed and prolapsed hemorrhoids could present as an anorectal mass, but also condylomas, abscesses, polyps, anorectal prolapse, or anorectal cancer can present in the same way. Lastly, it is important to remember that acute complicated hemorrhoids could be the clinical manifestation of a concomitant inflammatory anal and perianal condition, as demonstrated by the reported incidence of symptomatic hemorrhoids in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ranging from 3.3 to 20.7%. Therefore, a thorough medical history and a complete physical examination are key factors to drive the diagnostic workup of acute anal pain. Imaging studies should be considered when there is suspicion of an underlying diseases. The only study investigating the role of EUS in hemorrhoidal disease is from Poen et al. and concluded that hemorrhoids are associated with endosonographic thickening of submucosal tissue, internal and external anal sphincter, but EUS changes cannot predict treatment outcome or symptom recurrence. The conclusions of the abovementioned studies regarding imaging techniques in anorectal abscesses can be extended to complicated hemorrhoids workup, even if they were not aimed to analyze specifically the role of imaging in hemorrhoidal disease; however, the recommendations are weak.

### Common anorectal conditions: part I. symptoms and complaints [^f1cacf85]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Anorectal symptoms and complaints are common and may be caused by a wide spectrum of conditions. Although most conditions are benign and may be successfully treated by primary care practitioners, a high index of suspicion for colorectal cancer should be maintained, and all patients should be appropriately investigated. Inspection, palpation and anoscopic examination using an Ive's slotted anoscope provide adequate initial assessment. Pruritus ani usually represents a self-perpetuating itch-scratch cycle and is uncommonly due to infection. The history, as well as the physical examination, can distinguish anal pain due to hemorrhoids, fissure, abscess, cancer or proctalgia fugax. The most frequent causes of rectal bleeding are hemorrhoids, fissures and polyps. Diagnoses associated with difficulty in passing stool can range from constipation to fecal incontinence.

ANORECTAL PROBLEMS

Introduction

Anorectal abscesses are common, with 18 000 patients affected annually in England. English HES data show that a primary abscess has an incidence of 20/100 000 and are more common in men than women. The location of the anorectal abscess may indicate a likely pathogenesis, with superficial 'perianal' abscesses arising from a superficial source and ischio‐anal fossa and intersphincteric abscesses more commonly leading to fistula formation and probably arising according to the cryptoglandular hypothesis. In patients presenting with an anorectal abscess, 2.8% will ultimately be diagnosed with Crohn's disease.

An anal fistula occurs, following primary anorectal abscess, in 17% of patients, usually within the first year (67%), and is more likely in patients with underlying IBD.

An anorectal abscess is a painful condition but the abscess is not always apparent to the patient or initial treating clinicians, and some patients are treated empirically with antibiotics or for other anorectal conditions (such as fissure or haemorrhoids) before the abscess is diagnosed. Intersphincteric abscesses seem to present earlier, with pain as the predominant symptom, whereas abscesses in the ischio‐anal fossa may present later and with inflammatory or septic features as well as pain, perhaps due to the larger space within which the abscess may expand without meeting restrictive structures.

Acute anal fissures are longitudinal tears in the anal mucosa and present with symptoms of duration less than 6 weeks and without features of chronicity (visible internal sphincter fibres in the base of the wound, a hypertrophied anal papilla at the apex of the fissure (cephalad) and a sentinel tag at the caudad extent of the fissure). They cause pain, particularly during and after defaecation, and may also present with bright red rectal bleeding. The majority of anal fissures occur in the posterior midline with the anterior midline the second most common location, particularly in women. Multiple or lateral fissures should prompt a search for an underlying condition such as IBD or infective causes. Such atypical features will usually present in the chronic setting.

Malignant neoplasms of the anal canal and perianal region — pretreatment evaluation should include the following: A disease-specific history and physical examination should be performed, emphasizing symptoms, risk factors, and signs of advanced disease. Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Most patients present with a slow-growing mass involving either the anal canal or the perianal skin, and pain and bleeding are common, occurring in approximately half of patients, although < 20% of patients may be asymptomatic. Because the incidence of anal cancer is higher among men practicing anoreceptive intercourse, as well as among patients positive for HIV, a high index of suspicion should be maintained in these patients who present with anorectal complaints. Physical examination should focus primarily on an anorectal examination and evaluation of the inguinofemoral nodes, with digital anorectal examination performed to identify the lesion location and to evaluate for fixation and/or the presence of invasion of local structures, such as the vagina or the anal sphincter mechanism; anoscopy or proctoscopy with biopsy is essential to establish the size of the lesion, to determine its location within the anal canal, and to confirm diagnosis.

Patients with a wide variety of anorectal lesions present to family physicians. Most can be successfully managed in the office setting. A high index of suspicion for cancer should be maintained and all patients should be questioned about relevant family history or other indications for cancer screening. Patients with condylomata acuminata must be examined for human papillomavirus infection elsewhere after treatment of the presenting lesions. Their sexual partners should also be counseled and screened. Both surgical and nonsurgical treatments are available for the pain of anal fissure. Infection in the anorectal area may present as different types of abscesses, cryptitis, fistulae or perineal sepsis. Fistulae may result from localized infection or indicate inflammatory bowel disease. Protrusion of tissue through the anus may be due to hemorrhoids, mucosal prolapse, polyps or other lesions.

### Benign anorectal conditions: evaluation and management [^a31b5cf5]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Common anorectal conditions include hemorrhoids, perianal pruritus, anal fissures, functional rectal pain, perianal abscess, condyloma, rectal prolapse, and fecal incontinence. Although these are benign conditions, symptoms can be similar to those of cancer, so malignancy should be considered in the differential diagnosis. History and examination, including anoscopy, are usually sufficient for diagnosing these conditions, although additional testing is needed in some situations. The primary treatment for hemorrhoids is fiber supplementation. Patients who do not improve and those with large high-grade hemorrhoids should be referred for surgery. Acutely thrombosed external hemorrhoids should be excised. Perianal pruritus should be treated with hygienic measures, barrier emollients, and low-dose topical corticosteroids. Capsaicin cream and tacrolimus ointment are effective for recalcitrant cases. Treatment of acute anal fissures with pain and bleeding involves adequate fluid and fiber intake. Chronic anal fissures should be treated with topical nitrates or calcium channel blockers, with surgery for patients who do not respond to medical management. Patients with functional rectal pain should be treated with warm baths, fiber supplementation, and biofeedback. Patients with superficial perianal abscesses not involving the sphincter should undergo office-based drainage; patients with more extensive abscesses or possible fistulas should be referred for surgery. Condylomata can be managed with topical medicines, excision, or destruction. Patients with rectal prolapse should be referred for surgical evaluation. Biofeedback is a first-line treatment for fecal incontinence, but antidiarrheal agents are useful if diarrhea is involved, and fiber and laxatives may be used if impaction is present. Colostomy can help improve quality of life for patients with severe fecal incontinence.

Hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and fistulas are common benign anorectal diseases that have a significant impact on patients' lives. They are primarily encountered by primary care providers, including internists, gastroenterologists, pediatricians, gynecologists, and emergency care providers. Most complex anorectal disease cases are referred to colorectal surgeons. Knowledge of these disease processes is essential for proper treatment and follow up. Hemorrhoids and fissures frequently benefit from non-operative treatment; they may, however, require surgical procedures. The treatment of anorectal abscess and fistulas is mainly surgical. The aim of this review is to examine the etiology, diagnosis, medical, and surgical treatment for these benign anorectal diseases.

Fissures

An anal fissure is a linear tear in the anal mucosa, usually extending from the dentate line to the anal verge. Anal fissures are common, but no population studies have elucidated their exact incidence. Fissures occur in all age groups, but appear to be more common in young and otherwise healthy people. If one persists for more than 4–8 weeks, it is considered chronic. Most fissures occur at the posterior midline (90%). Anterior midline fissures occur in 10–25% of female fissures and 1–8% of male fissures. Anterior and posterior midline fissures can occur concomitantly in about 3% of cases. A lateral fissure should raise concern for inflammatory bowel disease, tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, or syphilis. Anal fissures cause significant pain and negatively impact quality of life.

Anal fissures were initially thought to be due to anal canal trauma from hard stools or diarrhea, but this explains only acute fissures. Additionally, constipation and hard bowel movements are only reported in 13% of patients with fissures. It appears that persistently high internal sphincter tone leads to chronicity of fissures. Pain from the fissure itself contributes to the increased sphincter tone, but persists even after local anesthetic is applied. These changes in tone appear to be pathological, and can persist for long periods of time. One study showed that internal sphincter biopsies taken at the time of internal sphincterotomy for chronic anal fissure have less nitric oxide present compared to internal sphincters from abdominoperineal resection specimens. The increased internal sphincter tone causes local ischemia that prevents the fissure from healing, creating a chronic wound. The anoderm is supplied by the inferior rectal arteries after it traverses the internal sphincter. Studies illustrate that the perfusion of the anoderm is inversely related to the pressure of the internal sphincter. Angiography and cadaver studies show that there is a paucity of arterioles in the posterior midline anal canal that explains the propensity for fissures to occur at this location.

7.C - in patients with an acute anal fissure, what is the role of non-operative management?

In patients with acute anal fissure, we recommend non-operative management as the first-line treatment (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B).

In patients with acute anal fissure, we recommend dietary and lifestyle changes, with increased fiber and water intake (strong recommendation based on moderate quality evidences, 1B).

In patients with acute anal fissure, we recommend against the use of manual dilatation (strong recommendation based on moderate quality evidences, 1B).

No recommendation can be made regarding the use of controlled anal dilatation in patients with acute anal fissure, based on the available literature.

Initial treatment of anal fissures is medical or non-operative. There are only few studies concerning non-operative management in the treatment of acute AF: 50% of patients will not require further therapy solving the problem, in 10–14 days, with non-operative measures such as sitz baths, fiber, and topical agents. However, to prevent a recurrence of AF, the combined use of dietary and lifestyle changes and medical therapy are recommended.

Anal fissures in perianal Crohn disease (PCD) — prevalence and treatment approach: Fissures make up approximately 20% to 30% of anal lesions in PCD. Fissures suggest active CD and are therefore treated medically, and in the presence of acute inflammation it is futile and potentially dangerous to attempt to excise a fissure or close it with suture. Symptoms typically respond to effective medical therapy using nitrate-based ointments and sitz baths, and no controlled trials show any efficacy of oral antibiotics in the treatment of perianal fissures.

### Anal self-massage in the treatment of acute anal fissure: a randomized prospective study [^aab66274]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The anal fissure is a longitudinal lesion of the skin of the anal canal, located at the back of the anal sphincter in 90% of cases. The cause of this disease still remains unclear, although it is considered that an increase in the internal anal sphincter tone may lead to a local reduction in the blood flow, causing damage especially posteriorly, where the perfusion is physiologically lower than in the other areas of the anal canal. From this perspective, the anal fissure can be regarded as an ischemic disease. Hard stools can be the primary cause of this complex background. Therefore, a first therapeutic approach is habit regularization, especially as a preventive maneuver. Once, however, the anal fissure has presented, the choice of therapy to be implemented cannot be simple: noninvasive treatment, represented by the use of nitroglycerin-based creams or calcium channel antagonists, is often burdened with side-effects such as headache. Moreover, the long-term efficacy of these medical treatment has not been proven.

### Transperineal sonographic anal sphincter complex evaluation in chronic anal fissures [^70d54d07]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess the role of transperineal sonography in assessment of pathologic changes to the anal sphincter complex in patients with chronic anal fissures.

Methods

We conducted a prospective case-control study of 100 consecutive patients of any age and both sexes with chronic anal fissures who presented to a colorectal clinic between January 2012 and August 2013 (group A) and 50 healthy volunteers (group B).

Results

The most common patterns of radiologic changes to anal sphincters associated with chronic anal fissures were circumferential thickening of the anal sphincter complex in 5 patients (5%), circumferential thickening of the internal anal sphincter in 3 patients (3%), preferential thickening of the internal anal sphincter at the 6-o'clock position in 80 patients (80%) and the 12-o'clock position in 7 patients (7%), preferential thickening of the internal and external anal sphincters in 3 patients (3%), and thinning of the internal anal sphincter in 2 patients (2%).

Conclusions

Chronic anal fissures cause differential thickening of both internal and external anal sphincters, with a trend toward increased thickness in relation to the site of the fissure. Routine preoperative transperineal sonography for patients with chronic anal fissures is recommended, and it is mandatory in high-risk patients.

Perianal abscess and fistulas

Anorectal abscesses represent a very common disease process that typically results from a cryptoglandular infection in the anal canal and can occur in the ischiorectal, intersphincteric, supralevator, perianal or submucosal spaces. They are more common in men and their incidence peaks around age 20–40 years. Abscesses and fistula often occur concomitantly, with 30–70% of those with active abscesses having a current fistula. Of people with anorectal abscesses who do not currently have a fistula, 30–50% will develop one in the future.

An anal fistula is a persistent epithelialized tract from the anal canal to the perianal skin, and can be intersphincteric, transsphincteric, suprasphincteric, or extrasphincteric. Fistulas are considered simple if they are low transsphincteric or intersphincteric and cross less than 30% of the external sphincter. Complex fistulas include those that are high transsphincteric (involving more than 30% of the external sphincter), extrasphincteric or suprasphincteric, and cryptoglandular in origin, in addition to fistulas associated with inflammatory bowel disease, radiation, malignancy, chronic diarrhea or preexisting incontinence. Eighty percent of fistulas are secondary to cryptoglandular infection, with the remainder due to Crohn's disease, trauma, radiation, malignancy or various infectious diseases.

Anal cancer is a rare cancer, comprising less than 5% of gastrointestinal tract malignancies. Diagnosis of anal canal cancer can be difficult given that presenting symptoms are similar to those of benign anorectal diseases. General surgeons who encounter suspected anal canal cancer need to have a good understanding of the anatomy of the anal canal, high index of suspicion for malignancy, and low threshold to biopsy lesions when indicated. This article discusses the most commonly encountered anal canal tumors, the evaluation of these tumors, and their management. The foundation for successful therapy includes timely diagnosis, accurate staging, and routine surveillance.

HIV-associated anal carcinoma

After the introduction of highly active anti-retroviral treatment (HAART), people with HIV infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) gained a greatly improved life expectancy with better immune conditions, at the price of an increased tendency to develop tumours. Although it is considered a non-AIDS-defining malignancy, currently SCAC ranks third (8.2%) among neoplasms observed in HIV/AIDS populations, with a substantially higher incidence in MSMs and in long-standing infected people.

Dysplastic intraepithelial lesions are highly prevalent in HIV-infected people, and HIV represents a marker for coinfection with other sexually transmitted diseases such as HPV. Since the risk of developing SCAC increases with the total time elapsed with CD4+ count below 200 cells/μl, it has been hypothesised that HIV-related immune suppression acts as a cofactor to HPV in the development of anal dysplasia and progression to overt carcinoma.

Screening procedures including high-resolution anoscopy and cytology smears are increasingly adopted at HIV care centres, to allow detection of SCAC precursors and early-stage tumours amenable to limited excision and topical therapies. Prevention should limit the occurrence of advanced stages at diagnosis in the future.

A high prevalence (at least 30%) of anorectal complaints is characteristic of HIV-positive patients, particularly those practicing anoreceptive intercourse. Differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of abnormalities, including non-specific anal diseases such as haemorrhoids, fissures, fistulas and abscesses, along with venereal infections, viral ulcers, and a non-negligible (7%) rate of neoplasms such as SCAC, lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. Therefore, when performing cross-sectional imaging procedures on HIV-infected patients, even for unrelated complaints, special attention should be paid to the anal region, with a focus on the possible identification of solid, enhancing tissue consistent with tumour that indicates need for biopsy (Figs. 5, 8, 10, 13).

Despite initial discouraging reports, in the HAART era HIV-positive patients are likewise treated with standard chemo-radiation regimens, reaching satisfactory results in terms of local control and survival rates, although with increased toxicity and frequent local recurrences.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^73fb6948]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of complex abscesses (perianal and perirectal, and abscesses in intravenous drug injection sites)?

Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. We recommend antibiotic therapy if systemic signs of infection are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or in cases of abscess with significant cellulitis (recommendation 1C).

We recommend empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with coverage of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Common sites of origin of complex abscesses may be perineal or perianal, perirectal, and abscesses at intravenous drug injection sites. Complicated skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage with adjuvant antibiotic therapy.

Perianal and perirectal abscesses originate most often from an obstructed anal crypt gland, with the resultant pus collecting in the subcutaneous tissue, intersphincteric plane, or beyond (ischiorectal space or supralevator space) where various types of anorectal abscesses form. Once diagnosed, anorectal abscesses should be promptly drained surgically. An undrained anorectal abscess can continue to expand into adjacent spaces as well as progress to generalized systemic infection. Anorectal abscess occurs more often in males than females. Most patients present between the ages of 20 to 60 with the mean age of 40 in both sexes.

The diagnosis of anorectal abscess is usually based on the patient's history and physical examination. The most common symptom of anorectal abscess is pain. As such, it has to be differentiated from other causes of anal pain including anal fissure, thrombosed hemorrhoids, levator spasm, sexually transmitted diseases, proctitis, and cancer. Low (intersphincteric, perianal, and ischiorectal) abscesses are usually associated with swelling, cellulites, and exquisite tenderness, but few systemic symptoms. High (submucosal, supralevator) abscesses may have few local symptoms, but significant systemic symptoms. Deeper abscesses, such as those that form in the supralevator or high ischiorectal space, may also present with pain referred to the perineum, low back, or buttocks.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^162e593c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

An anorectal abscess is characterized by an infection in the soft tissue around the anus. However, depending on the different anatomical locations of the infectious process, the manifestations, and the treatment of anorectal abscesses vary widely. It is important to remember the anatomical classification of intersphincteric, perianal, ischiorectal, or supralevator abscesses. Anorectal abscesses are associated with anal fistulas in approximately a third of patients, and the classification of fistulae depends on their anatomical location as well. The clinical presentation is typically characterized by perianal pain, swelling, and fever, but deeper abscesses may also present with pain referred to the perineum, low back, and buttocks or with symptoms that mimic an intra-abdominal condition; discharge of pus could also be present and occasionally patients with anorectal abscesses will present with urinary retention. It is a common disease and constitutes a common presentation to emergency general surgeons; the most common age for presentation is 20–40 years, with men more commonly affected than women. The majority are idiopathic in nature, with the cryptoglandular hypothesis being most commonly accepted, but a proportion may present as part of another disease process, most commonly Crohn's disease. The differential diagnosis of anorectal abscesses is wide and comprises other significant diseases such as anal cancer and precancerous conditions, Crohn's disease, and tuberculosis. In fact, an anorectal abscess will develop in approximately one third of patients with Crohn's disease. Furthermore, it is important to make an early distinction from Fournier's gangrene/necrotizing fasciitis. The most common anatomical locations are perianal and ischio-rectal, with intersphincteric and supralevator being less common. The management of patients with known Crohn's disease goes beyond the aims of these guidelines, but it is mandatory to exclude the presence of undiagnosed underlying Crohn's disease in every patient presenting with an anorectal abscess, especially if recurrent. For this reason, a focused and detailed medical history is of utmost importance and complete physical examination should include a careful inspection of the perineum checking for surgical scars, anorectal deformities, other signs of perianal Crohn's disease, the presence of secondary cellulitis, or the presence of external opening of an anal fistula. A complete anorectal examination, including digital rectal examination, is usually feasible, but in some cases, sedation or anesthesia may be needed due to the intense pain. The patient's history and physical examination are usually enough to diagnose small and superficial abscesses, while deeper abscesses can be challenging to diagnose; in these cases, rectal examination usually reveals a tender, indurated area above the anorectal ring.

Methods

To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the boards of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST), to develop questions on seven main topics that thoroughly cover the field of this pathology (retained anorectal bodies, perineal necrotizing fasciitis, complicated hemorrhoids, acute anal fissure, anorectal abscess, bleeding anorectal varices, complicated anorectal prolapse). Leading specialists in the field then were asked to perform a thorough search on each of these topics in different databanks (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE) for relevant papers between 1985 and November 2019 and a systematic review of the available literature. They were asked to focus their search to provide evidence-based answers to every question with immediate practical application and to summarize them in statements. Furthermore, the references were kept up to date and the last literature search was performed in January 2021. All the statements were presented and discussed during the WSES - AAST - WJES Consensus Conference on Anorectal Emergencies held in Parma, Italy, on December 12, 2019, and for each statement, a consensus among the WSES - AAST panelists was reached. An international expert panel discussed the different issues in subsequent rounds. At each round, the manuscript was revised and improved. The final version about which agreement was reached resulted in the present manuscript. All the members contributed to the development of the manuscript.

The questions were created according to the PICO criteria, and the following guidelines adopt the GRADE methodology.

Topics and questions

For clarity, we report the seven topics together with the relative questions. The statements are summarized in Table 1.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of anal fissures [^bfdf29cb]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). High credibility.

Lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) for pharmacologically naive patients — LIS may be offered in selected pharmacologically naive patients with chronic anal fissure; Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A. Multiple randomized trials show LIS superiority over topical nitrates, calcium channel blockers, or botulinum toxin, with healing rates of 88% to 100% and FI rates of 8% to 30% with follow-up up to 6 years. Patients with duration of symptoms exceeding 1 year are less likely to respond to medical therapy. Given poor compliance and persistent fissures with nonoperative management and that long-term fecal continence and quality of life are preserved in the vast majority after LIS, LIS can safely be offered as first-line therapy for chronic anal fissures in patients with no underlying FI; those in whom LIS may be excluded as first-line therapy include women with prior obstetrical injury, patients with IBD, those with previous anorectal operations, and patients with a documented anal sphincter injury.

Perianal symptoms are common, and benign anorectal conditions have clinical features not too dissimilar to those associated with anal canal carcinoma. To avoid delayed diagnosis, physicians need to be cognizant of the possibility of anal canal carcinoma, which can be effectively treated with chemoradiation therapy without the need for mutilating surgery. Appropriate imaging studies should be obtained for accurate staging of the disease and for follow-up examinations after definitive treatment.

### Fistula-in-ano: an uncommon cause of chronic vulvar symptoms [^563d38aa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Rectal and anal fistulae are frequently missed diagnoses. Symptoms of fistula-in-ano may mimic other chronic vulvar conditions.

Cases

Three patients presented with chronic symptoms including nonhealing ulcer, pruritus, dyspareunia, and discharge for 6–18 months. High clinical suspicion and rectal examination with concomitant perineal probing was useful in making a diagnosis. Once the diagnosis of fistula-in-ano was made, surgical correction was successful.

Conclusion

When evaluating persistent vulvar problems, the clinician's differential diagnoses should include less common causes. The goals of treatment for fistula-in-ano should be to eliminate the nidus of infection and to preserve the anal sphincter during the repair.

Fissure

Question 9.10

How should acute fissures be managed in the emergency setting?

Recommendation: Acute anal fissure should be managed using dietary modification and analgesia in the first instance, with a topical calcium channel blocker or nitric oxide donor added if symptoms do not settle.

Level of evidence II

Grade of recommendation B

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)

An anal fissure is a linear ulcer in the anoderm, most commonly found in the posterior or anterior midline. Acute fissures have an onset within 6 weeks of presentation and will not display features of chronicity such as sentinel tags or hypertrophied papillae. Most occur following mechanical trauma associated with constipation and straining at stool with sphincter spasm and relative ischaemia thought to contribute to persistence. Fissures in the presence of Crohn's disease are addressed in IBD guidelines.

A Cochrane review updated in 2012 considered non‐surgical approaches to the management of acute (and chronic) anal fissures, based mostly on older studies examining high fibre diets and analgesia, or topical agents such as glyceryl trinitrate and calcium channel blockers. US and previous UK guidelines have commented on the deficiency in evidence to support any specific management of acute anal fissures.

Some authors advocate early surgery (Botox or even sphincterotomy) in cases of severe pain, but the known risk of minor continence disturbance (up to 30%) and the recognized healing rate of acute fissures (around 50%) from simple measures do not support this approach.

In the 1980s, a high fibre diet was shown to induce healing in the majority of acute fissures and reduce the recurrence if used as a maintenance therapy. Dilators and more recently 'anal self‐massage' (10 min of intra‐anal digitation twice a day) are reported to reduce the pain of acute fissures and encourage healing but are not in regular use in the UK.

It is important to note that a patient presenting with anal pain without any obvious cause should undergo an EUA by an experienced surgeon.

### Histologic diagnosis of a case of anal duct carcinoma with cytological correlation and differential diagnoses [^56fdd9bb]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Anal duct carcinoma is an uncommon malignancy of the glands of the anal duct. This entity poses a diagnostic challenge, both clinically and histologically. This article describes histopathologic findings in a case of anal duct carcinoma, including the initial diagnosis on biopsy and subsequent cytology specimens. Additionally, differential diagnoses of this neoplasm are discussed. With a high index of suspicion, and attention to histological and immunohistochemical features, anal duct carcinoma can be accurately diagnosed both on biopsy and on cytology.

### Anterior anal fissures are associated with occult sphincter injury and abnormal sphincter function [^659e2a27]. Colorectal Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The pathogenesis of chronic anal fissure (CAF) remains incompletely understood but most are associated with a high resting anal pressure and reduced perfusion at the fissure site. To date, no major distinction has been made between anterior and posterior anal fissures and their aetiology and treatment. We compared anterior and posterior fissures in patients who have failed to respond to medical treatment with respect to their underlying aetiology, anal canal pressures and sphincter muscle integrity.

Method

Seventy consecutive patients (54 female:16 male) with a symptomatic CAF and 39 normal controls (19 female:20 male) without evidence of significant ano-rectal pathology were prospectively assessed by manometry and anal endosonography.

Results

Anterior anal fissures were identified in a younger age group [33 years (IQR 26–37) vs 41 years (IQR 36–52)] and predominantly in women. Anterior fissure patients were significantly more likely to have underlying external anal sphincter defects compared with posterior fissures [OR 10.9 (95% CI 3.4–35.4)]. Maximum resting pressure was not significantly elevated for anterior fissures compared with controls (P = 0.316) but was significantly elevated in posterior fissures (P = 0.005). The maximum squeeze pressure was significantly lower in the anterior fissure group [167 cmH2O (IQR 126–196) vs 205 cmH2O (IQR 174–262), P = 0.004]. A history of obstetric trauma was significantly associated with anterior fissure location [OR 13.9 (95% CI 3.4–55.7)].

Conclusions

Anterior anal fissures are associated with occult external anal sphincter injury and impaired external anal sphincter function compared with posterior fissures. These findings have implications for treatment, especially if a definitive procedure, such as lateral internal sphincterotomy, is considered.

### Poorly differentiated tumours of the anal canal: a diagnostic strategy for the surgical pathologist [^421dc45f]. Histopathology (2007). Low credibility.

Poorly differentiated malignancies affecting the anal canal are uncommon but pose diagnostic difficulties because of the wide range of normal cell types that may occur within a limited anatomical region. The range of lesions that may present as poorly differentiated tumours includes squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, small and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma expressing epithelial cytokeratins and other patterns of mixed differentiation, undifferentiated carcinoma, malignant melanoma, lymphoma and secondary tumours. This review discusses the differential diagnosis of these neoplasms with the aid of short illustrative case studies.

### Uncommon anal cancers [^3a48257f]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Anal cancer is by itself a rare entity. Even rarer are the uncommon anal tumors described in this article. Diagnosis of these lesions can be challenging as some of these have no symptoms in their initial stages and only cause symptoms once they have progressed to advanced stages. Further, it can be difficult for even the trained eye to make a diagnosis as some of these pathologies mimic benign disease or the more common anal malignancy, squamous cell carcinoma. More data are needed to establish consensus for the management of these unusual pathologies.

### Evaluating the accuracy of hemorrhoids: comparison among specialties and symptoms [^cbddb91f]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A large proportion of patients with anorectal complaints are referred to colorectal surgeons with the label of hemorrhoids.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to review presenting symptoms and frequency of accurate diagnosis, as well as to analyze determinants of misdiagnosis to guide educational endeavors.

Design

This was a retrospective study.

Settings

The study was conducted at a tertiary care academic center.

Patients

The charts of patients referred to a colorectal clinic with the diagnosis of hemorrhoids from January 1, 2012, to January 1, 2017, were reviewed.

Main Outcome Measures

The accuracy of the referring provider's diagnosis of hemorrhoids was measured.

Results

Review of charts identified 476 patients with the referral diagnosis of hemorrhoids. The most common presenting symptoms were bleeding (63%; n = 302), pain (48%; n = 228), and protrusion (39%; n = 185). Anal examination (ie, external inspection and/or digital internal examination) was documented in only 48%. The hemorrhoid diagnostic accuracy was 65% (n = 311). Among patients with incorrect hemorrhoid diagnoses (35%; n = 169), actual diagnosis was anal fissure (34%), skin tag (27%), and hypertrophied papilla (6%). One rectal and 2 anal carcinomas were found (0.63%). Compared with general practitioners, gastroenterologists had 86% higher odds of correct diagnosis (OR = 1.86 (95% CI, 1.10–3.10); p = 0.02), whereas the gynecologists had 68% lower odds of correct diagnosis at the time of referral (OR = 0.32 (95% CI, 0.10–0.80); p = 0.02). On multivariable analysis, referring specialty was not predictive of accurate diagnosis. Patients presenting with protrusion had 73% higher odds of accurate diagnosis (OR = 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1–2.7); p = 0.02), whereas patients presenting with pain (OR = 1.6 (95% CI, 1.1–2.5); p = 0.03) or pruritus (OR = 2.5 (95% CI, 1.2–5.0); p = 0.008) were more likely to be misdiagnosed.

Limitations

This is a retrospective study. Not all of the charts contained all data points. The number of patients may limit the power of the study to detect some differences.

Conclusions

A variety of anorectal complaints are diagnosed as hemorrhoids by providers who have initial contact with the patients. Educational programs directed toward improving physician knowledge can potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and earlier initiation of appropriate care. Presenting symptoms other than protrusion lead to higher rate of misdiagnosis by a referring physician. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A847.

### Diagnosis and treatment of perianal Crohn disease: NASPGHAN clinical report and consensus statement [^a6f8b3c9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Medium credibility.

Perianal Crohn disease — clinical presentation in children — Manifestations of PCD fall into 3 distinct categories: tissue destruction (anal fissures, tags, deep ulcers), fistulae and abscesses (often multiple and complex), and rectal stricture. The spectrum is variable, with some having relatively mild disease and others experiencing a severe, destructive, debilitating course leading to constipation, fecal incontinence, recurrent infections and sepsis, compromise of sexual function, significantly diminished quality of life, and, in some cases, a diverting colostomy or ileostomy. Even in its most severe form, PCD can be surprisingly painless, and children and adolescents are often reticent to volunteer information about bowel habits, drainage, or anal pruritus; it is therefore extremely important to ask direct questions. Skin tags may cause cosmetic concerns but are not frequently associated with pain unless inflamed. Despite the absence of pain in some children, functional impairments and social implications are often significant.

### Sonography of benign conditions of the anal canal: an update [^6cb1ea21]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this article is to describe our experience with sonography for the study of benign conditions of the anal canal and perianal soft tissues.

Conclusion

Assessment of the anal sphincters in patients with fecal incontinence and documentation of perianal inflammatory masses and tracts in those with perianal inflammatory disease are the major indications for imaging the anal canal. We augment traditional transanal sonography with transperineal scanning in both sexes and transvaginal scanning in women to better show the anal canal in its quiet state to allow an accurate assessment of the integrity of the anal sphincters and of evidence of acute or chronic inflammatory involvement.

### Medical and surgical treatment of haemorrhoids and anal fissure in Crohn's disease: a critical appraisal [^fcc83899]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Differently from the general population, aberrant positions are common; multiple and lateral fissures were reported in 32–33% and 9–20% of patients respectively. This is confirmed in our data in which, although more than half of the patients had a posterior fissure, 43.9% of them presented with unusual location.

Whereas in non-IBD subjects anal fissures are usually symptomatic, in CD patients pain, bleeding and anal discomfort have been reported in only 44–70% of cases, and they may be hence completely quiescent. In our series the majority of subjects reported one of the typical symptoms, but asymptomatic patients with diagnosis of anal fissure were encountered.

Although conservative medical therapy or simple observation is also indicated for the management of anal fissures, it should be considered that unhealed fissure may progress to fistula or abscess in up to 20% of the cases.

Common local anorectal procedures such as sphincterotomy or anal dilation are infrequently performed in CD patients, due to the perception of putting the patients at risk of incontinence, as they frequently have an underlying diarrhea state and are at significant risk of requiring additional anal surgery in the future. Despite good results after anal dilation and stretch have been reported in erratic series, we agree with Fleshner et al. that dilation of the sphincter should be avoided in CD, not only because of suboptimal healing of the fissure but also to avoid uncontrolled trauma to diseased anal mucosa with potential development of secondary infection or fistula.

Regarding the use of lateral internal sphincterotomy, it has been advocated to treat selected CD patients, but literature data is limited and based on small series. Wolff et al. suggested that painful fissures should be converted to a painless state by sphincterotomy. Accordingly, Cohen et al. stated that a limited sphincterotomy may be performed after failure of all medical approaches.

### Anal abscess and fistula [^e8013954]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2026). Medium credibility.

Anorectal abscesses and fistulas are common surgical conditions. Most often these are idiopathic and caused by cryptoglandular infections. Diagnosis relies on focused history and physical examination findings as well as imaging studies to determine the extent of sphincter involvement and exact location. Treatment of an abscess is prompt surgical drainage. Surgical management of a fistula is focused on preservation of continence while achieving healing. Optimal surgical treatment is based on anatomy of the fistula tract. Surgical options include fistulotomy, seton placement, advancement flap, LIFT, and VAAFT. Emerging therapies, such as mesenchymal stem cell injections, show promise but require further study.

### Attitudes to the treatment of chronic anal fissure in ano after failed medical treatment [^ebfdca4f]. Colorectal Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The treatment of chronic fissure may be medical or surgical. Indications for assessment, which is the better treatment and under what circumstances, are vital for the appropriate management. The aim of the study was to assess the management of this condition by an expert group of surgeons.

Methods

Consultant members of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (n = 452) were approached and requested to answer a preset multiple-choice questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed to assess their management strategy and their approach to investigation and treatment under different clinical situations.

Results

The overall response was 78% (n = 356). Medical treatment was the first line treatment in 95% of the responders. Lateral anal sphincterotomy without pre-operative endoanal ultrasound and/or anorectal physiology was performed by 57%. Anal dilatation was performed selectively by 36% but only 35% of these would perform a pre-operative endoanal ultrasound or anorectal physiology.

Conclusion

In the selected group of clinicians lateral anal sphincterotomy remains the procedure of choice in both sexes. Pre-operative assessment using endoanal ultrasound and anorectal physiology is used selectively especially in postpartum women. Anal dilatation remains a subjective procedure and though used selectively, is performed without pre-operative endoanal ultrasound and/or anorectal physiology in majority of cases.
