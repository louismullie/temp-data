## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to calculate the change in chemical potential of a perfect gas when its pressure is increased isothermally from 1.8 atm to 29.5 atm at 40°C, and to select the correct answer from the provided options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the thermodynamic formula for the pressure dependence of chemical potential in an ideal gas. Then, I should verify the temperature conversion and confirm the gas constant. Next, I will compute the pressure ratio and take its natural logarithm. After that, I will multiply by RT and convert to kJ/mol. Finally, I will compare the result to the answer choices and double-check for any unit or calculation errors before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the governing equation. For a perfect gas, the chemical potential at pressure P relative to a reference pressure P° is given by μ = μ° + RT ln(P/P°), so the isothermal change in chemical potential is Δμ = RT ln(P₂/P₁), where P2 is the final pressure and P1 is the initial pressure. I should confirm that this expression is valid for isothermal processes and that it assumes ideal gas behavior, which it does [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the temperature and units. The stated temperature is 40°C, which is 313.15 K, not 298.15 K. I initially thought to use 298.15 K because the prompt says "data refer to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated", but hold on, the problem explicitly gives 40°C, so I should use 313.15 K for this calculation. The gas constant R is 8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹, which I will keep in SI units for now and convert to kJ at the end [^notfound].

> I will now examine the pressure ratio. P2 is 29.5 atm and P1 is 1.8 atm, so P2/P1 = 29.5/1.8 ≈ 16.3889. Let me double-check that division: 29.5 ÷ 1.8 is indeed about 16.3889, so ln(16.3889) ≈ 2.796. I should confirm that I'm using the natural logarithm, not base 10, which I am [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the multiplication by RT. RT at 313.15 K is 8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹ × 313.15 K ≈ 2603.5 J mol⁻¹. Multiplying by ln(16.3889) gives Δμ ≈ 2603.5 × 2.796 ≈ 7279 J mol⁻¹, which is about 7.28 kJ mol⁻¹. Converting to kJ and rounding to one decimal place, I get approximately +7.3 kJ mol⁻¹ [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the answer choices. The closest option to +7.3 kJ mol⁻¹ is B, which is listed as +7.3 kJ mol⁻¹. Let me reconsider whether any rounding or unit missteps could shift this into another option; given the magnitude and the choices, B remains the best match, and the calculation is internally consistent with the ideal gas chemical potential formula and the specified temperature [^notfound].

> Final answer: B. +7.3 kJ mol⁻¹.

The change in chemical potential for a perfect gas during isothermal compression is given by **Δμ = RT ln(P₂/P₁)**. At 40°C (313.15 K), with R = 8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹, and pressures from 1.8 atm to 29.5 atm, the calculation is:

Δμ = 8.314 × 313.15 × ln(29.5/1.8) ≈ 7.3 kJ mol⁻¹.

Thus, the correct answer is **B. +7.3 kJ mol⁻¹**.

---

## Thermodynamic derivation

The chemical potential of a perfect gas is given by:

μ = μ° + RT ln(P/P°)

where μ° is the standard chemical potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, P is the pressure, and P° is the reference pressure (usually 1 atm).

For an isothermal process, the change in chemical potential is:

Δμ = μ₂ − μ₁ = RT ln(P₂/P₁)

---

## Calculation

Given:

- Initial pressure, P1 = 1.8 atm
- Final pressure, P2 = 29.5 atm
- Temperature, T = 40°C = 313.15 K
- Gas constant, R = 8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹

Substitute the values into the equation:

Δμ = 8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹ × 313.15 K × ln(29.5/1.8)

First, calculate the pressure ratio:

29.5/1.8 ≈ 16.39

Then, calculate the natural logarithm:

ln(16.39) ≈ 2.796

Now, multiply by RT:

Δμ ≈ 8.314 × 313.15 × 2.796 ≈ 7279 J mol⁻¹ ≈ 7.28 kJ mol⁻¹

Rounding to one decimal place, **Δμ ≈ 7.3 kJ mol⁻¹**.

## Conclusion

The change in chemical potential is **+7.3 kJ mol⁻¹**, corresponding to option B.

### Unexpectedly high pressure for molecular dissociation in liquid hydrogen by electronic simulation [^31077771]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The study of the high pressure phase diagram of hydrogen has continued with renewed effort for about one century as it remains a fundamental challenge for experimental and theoretical techniques. Here we employ an efficient molecular dynamics based on the quantum Monte Carlo method, which can describe accurately the electronic correlation and treat a large number of hydrogen atoms, allowing a realistic and reliable prediction of thermodynamic properties. We find that the molecular liquid phase is unexpectedly stable, and the transition towards a fully atomic liquid phase occurs at much higher pressure than previously believed. The old standing problem of low-temperature atomization is, therefore, still far from experimental reach.

### Thermodynamic insight into stimuli-responsive behaviour of soft porous crystals [^be2d43d8]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Knowledge of the thermodynamic potential in terms of the independent variables allows to characterize the macroscopic state of the system. However, in practice, it is difficult to access this potential experimentally due to irreversible transitions that occur between equilibrium states. A showcase example of sudden transitions between (meta)stable equilibrium states is observed for soft porous crystals possessing a network with long-range structural order, which can transform between various states upon external stimuli such as pressure, temperature and guest adsorption. Such phase transformations are typically characterized by large volume changes and may be followed experimentally by monitoring the volume change in terms of certain external triggers. Herein, we present a generalized thermodynamic approach to construct the underlying Helmholtz free energy as a function of the state variables that governs the observed behaviour based on microscopic simulations. This concept allows a unique identification of the conditions under which a material becomes flexible.

### A pressure-amplifying framework material with negative gas adsorption transitions [^1cb8e0ee]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Adsorption-based phenomena are important in gas separations, such as the treatment of greenhouse-gas and toxic-gas pollutants, and in water-adsorption-based heat pumps for solar cooling systems. The ability to tune the pore size, shape and functionality of crystalline porous coordination polymers — or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) — has made them attractive materials for such adsorption-based applications. The flexibility and guest-molecule-dependent response of MOFs give rise to unexpected and often desirable adsorption phenomena. Common to all isothermal gas adsorption phenomena, however, is increased gas uptake with increased pressure. Here we report adsorption transitions in the isotherms of a MOF (DUT-49) that exhibits a negative gas adsorption; that is, spontaneous desorption of gas (methane and n-butane) occurs during pressure increase in a defined temperature and pressure range. A combination of in situ powder X-ray diffraction, gas adsorption experiments and simulations shows that this adsorption behaviour is controlled by a sudden hysteretic structural deformation and pore contraction of the MOF, which releases guest molecules. These findings may enable technologies using frameworks capable of negative gas adsorption for pressure amplification in micro- and macroscopic system engineering. Negative gas adsorption extends the series of counterintuitive phenomena such as negative thermal expansion and negative refractive indices and may be interpreted as an adsorptive analogue of force-amplifying negative compressibility transitions proposed for metamaterials.

### Quasi-equilibrium phase coexistence in single component supercritical fluids [^63cf0649]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In their supercritical state simple fluids are generally thought to assume a homogeneous phase throughout all combinations of pressures and temperatures, although various response functions or transport properties may exhibit anomalous behavior, characterizing a state point as either more gas-like or liquid-like, respectively. While a large body of results has been compiled in the last two decades regarding the details of the supercritical phase in thermodynamic equilibrium, far less studies have been dedicated to out-of-equilibrium situations that nevertheless occur along with the handling of substances such as carbon dioxide or Argon. Here we consider successive compression-expansion cycles of equal amounts of Argon injected into a high-pressure chamber, traversing the critical pressure at two times the critical temperature. Due to expansion cooling, the fluid temporarily becomes sub-critical, and light scattering experiments show the formation of sub-micron-sized droplets and nanometer-scale clusters, both of which are distinct from spontaneous density fluctuations of the supercritical background and persist for a surprisingly long time. A kinetic rate model of the exchange of liquid droplets with the smaller clusters can explain this behavior. Our results indicate non-equilibrium aspects of supercritical fluids that may prove important for their processing in industrial applications.

### Fundamental principles and applications of natural gas hydrates [^a8ed7ddf]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

Natural gas hydrates are solid, non-stoichiometric compounds of small gas molecules and water. They form when the constituents come into contact at low temperature and high pressure. The physical properties of these compounds, most notably that they are non-flowing crystalline solids that are denser than typical fluid hydrocarbons and that the gas molecules they contain are effectively compressed, give rise to numerous applications in the broad areas of energy and climate effects. In particular, they have an important bearing on flow assurance and safety issues in oil and gas pipelines, they offer a largely unexploited means of energy recovery and transportation, and they could play a significant role in past and future climate change.

### Molecular determinant of the effects of hydrostatic pressure on protein folding stability [^9d54ab19]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

where Δ H = H U − H N is the enthalpy change upon unfolding, K is the equilibrium constant and R is the universal gas constant. For a two-state equilibrium between N and U states, the pressure response is defined by a sign of the volume change upon unfolding, Δ V Tot,

Combining equations (2) and (3) allows deriving the pressure–temperature phase diagram for protein stability:

where Δ H, Δ S and Δ V Tot are the unfolding enthalpy, entropy and volume changes at a reference temperature, T o, and reference pressure, P o, Δ C p is the heat capacity change of unfolding. The reference temperature, T o, and pressure, P o, according to the biochemical convention are usually chosen to be 300 K and 0.1 MPa (= 1 atm). The change in compressibility upon unfolding, Δ β, defined as Δ β = (γΔ V /γ P) T is very small and often ignored. The change in thermal expansivity upon unfolding, Δ α, defined as Δ α = (γΔ V /γ T) P is known to be positive. Therefore, Δ V Tot is the key parameter in defining the effect of hydrostatic pressure on protein stability. According to Le Chatelier's principle, if Δ V Tot = V Tot, U − V Tot, N < 0, the increase in pressure will shift the equilibrium from N to U, that is, will lead to a decrease in stability. Similarly, if Δ V Tot = V Tot, U − V Tot, N > 0, the increase in pressure will shift the equilibrium from U to N, that is, will lead to an increase in stability.

Thermodynamics calculations

Gibbs free energy calculations were made according to the study by Dolfing et al. Temperature corrections were made with the Gibbs–Helmholz equation according to ΔG o Tact = ΔG o Tref.(T act / T ref)+ΔH o Tref ·(T ref − T act)/ T ref with T in K; T act = 328.15 K, T ref = 298.15 K. The effect of pressure on ΔG (in kJ per reaction) was approximated as ΔG o Tref, Pact = ΔG o Tref, Pref +ΔV o ·(P act −P ref)/10000 where ΔG o Tref, Pact is the Gibbs free energy of reaction at the reference temperature (298.15 K) and in situ pressure (5 MPa; 50 atm), ΔG o Tref, Pref is the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction at the reference temperature and pressure (0.1 MPa; 1 atm), P act is the in situ pressure in atm, P ref is the reference pressure in atm and ΔV o is the partial molar volume change of the reaction at the reference temperature and pressure in cm 3 mol −1, as outlined in the study by Wang et al. The calculations were made for acetate (p K a = 4.75) at the appropriate pH values. For the reaction CO 2 +4H 2 →CH 4 +2H 2 O, ΔV o = −62.3; for CH 3 COO − +H + +2H 2 O→4H 2 +2CO 2, ΔV o = 92.25; for CH 3 COO − +H + →CH 4 +CO 2, ΔV o = 29.95. Neglecting activity coefficients yields an error in calculated Gibbs free energy values of at most 2 kJ mol −1 for all reported values at an ionic strength of 0.1 M (Debye–Huckel calculations).

Estimation of the mass transfer coefficient for CO 2

From the changing absorption, we can estimate the mass transfer coefficient K of CO 2. The mass transfer coefficient is defined as the amount of gas transferred per timeand per unit area A divided by the driving concentration difference. The driving concentration difference is Δ c = P/k H − c l. Here k H = 29.4 atm M −1 is Henry's constant for CO 2 and water at 25 °C, and c l is the mean concentration of CO 2 in water. P/k H is the concentration of CO 2 in water equilibrated with CO 2 gas at pressure P. We further assume that the concentration of CO 2 in the liquid is negligible (c l = 0), as it will be consumed by the neutralization reaction. This is a rough assumption because the conversion rate of CO 2 to H 2 CO 3 in water is known to be slow (0.039 s −1). Therefore, we calculate a lower limit for the mass transfer coefficient.

We take the increase in absorption to estimate the transfer coefficient (minimum 35–42 in Fig. 2b). In this range from pH 13 to 11.5 most of the NaOH is neutralized. The total amount of NaOH neutralized in 7 min is 3.8 × 10 −3 mol (0.22 M times the total liquid volume of 17.5 ml). As the reaction is carried out above the second pK of carbonic acid of 10.3, every carbon dioxide neutralizes two NaOH molecules (H 2 CO 3 +2 NaOH→Na 2 CO 3 +2H 2 O). This leads to a transfer rate = 4.5 × 10 −6 mol s −1. With an apparent membrane area of 2.5 × 10 −4 m 2 and P = 1 atm we obtain a mass transfer coefficient K = 5.3 × 10 −4 m s −1. This value is a lower limit because we assumed that CO 2 is immediately converted to carbonic acid and because we used the mean decreases in hydroxyl concentration in the 7 min considered rather than the maximal decreases. This is already of the same order of magnitude as highly efficient conventional gas contactor membranes.

### Molecular determinant of the effects of hydrostatic pressure on protein folding stability [^75bc5327]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Here we will limit our discussion to only one type of biopolymers — proteins — but some of the issues can be pertinent to nucleic acids and to a lesser degree biological membranes. Experimental studies of the effects of hydrostatic pressure on protein stability have shown that most proteins unfold with an increase in pressure (negative Δ V Tot), although some are actually stabilized (positive Δ V Tot). The volume changes estimated from these experiments and also from direct measurements using pressure perturbation calorimetry are very small and range from −4% to +0.5%, relative to the total volume of the protein, that is, Δ V Tot /V Tot, N. Such small in amplitude and variable in sign changes in Δ V Tot have been puzzling the field for the past 50 years. Since the first high-resolution structures of proteins have been solved, it has become evident that the native state of proteins contains a large number of voids (space inside protein that is not occupied by protein atoms) and cavities (voids large enough to accommodate a water molecule but may or may not be occupied by water). It has been shown that the volume fraction of the native protein that is occupied by voids ranges between 20 and 30%. The presence of voids in the native state qualitatively explains the higher volume of the native state relative to the unfolded state. However, the magnitude of the negative volume changes due to the voids is much larger than the total negative volume changes observed experimentally and, moreover, cannot explain the experimentally observed positive volume changes. This led to a suggestion that possibly the volume changes due to the hydration of atoms inaccessible to the solvent in the native state and becoming exposed upon unfolding might lead to the positive contribution that offsets the negative void volume changes. However, the transfer of model compounds from non-polar solvent into aqueous solution was also shown to be accompanied by negative volume changes. This discrepancy between experimental volume changes and volume changes expected from protein structure and transfer studies has been termed the 'Protein Volume Paradox'. We performed detailed analysis of the two major assumptions ((1) all voids in the native state contribute to the total volume change upon unfolding and (2) hydration leads to a decrease in volume) that led to the formulation of this apparent paradox and showed that they are both oversimplified. We show that the volume changes upon protein unfolding can be calculated by explicitly modelling the volumes of the unfolded state ensemble and using a proper thermodynamic transfer model to account for the volume changes upon hydration.

Calculating volume of hydration Δ V Hyd

When a protein unfolds, groups buried in the native state become exposed and will interact with water. These interactions can possibly lead to volume changes and thus must be accounted for when considering volume changes upon protein unfolding. Historically, this unfolding reaction was modelled as a transfer from non-polar solvent to water. It has been shown that volume change upon such transfer, usually attributed to the volume changes upon hydration, is always negative, that is, volume of a solute in aqueous solution is always smaller than that in non-polar solvent. However, transfer from non-polar solvent to aqueous solution has been proven to be inadequate to model thermodynamics of hydration (see for example, refs). In the case of volume changes, the larger size of non-polar solvent than that of water leads to an overestimation of the volume that a solute occupies in the non-polar phase(see Fig. 5). It has been well established that transfer from gas phase into aqueous solution is a more appropriate way to model thermodynamics of hydration. This is also the case for modelling the volume changes upon hydration (Fig. 5). To understand the volume changes upon hydration in more detail, we analysed the experimentally measured volume change upon transfer of over 150 different model solutes (aromatic and non-aromatic compounds, oligopeptides and N -acetyl amides of amino acids) from gas phase into aqueous solution at 25 °C. The hydration volume upon transfer from gas phase into water, V Hyd, is equal to the experimentally measured partial volume of a solute in water minus the geometric volume of this solute (that is, V SE) (Fig. 5). This volume will, in a first approximation, depend on the number of water molecules that can directly interact with the solute and thus is proportional to the molecular surface area of the solute molecule. Figure 6a shows the dependence of the hydration volume, V Hyd, on the total molecular surface area (MSA) of various solutes, MSA Tot. Two major observations can be made from the plot shown in Fig. 6a. First, the hydration volume is always positive, that is, transfer of any (polar or non-polar) solute into aqueous solution leads to an increase in volume. Second, the increase in the molecular surface area leads to an increase in the corresponding hydration volume. However, there is a large spread in this trend (Fig. 6a). Interestingly, the correlation becomes much more pronounced (R 2 = 0.94) if we plot only non-polar MSA (MSA NP) as a function of V Hyd (see Fig. 6b). This suggests that the solvent interactions with non-polar surfaces make up a major contribution to the volume changes upon hydration. This observation is in line with some previous reports; however, present analysis has been done on a much larger and more diverse data set. Importantly, not all variance in V Hyd can be explained by MSA NP. Therefore, we performed a fit to both non-polar, MSA NP, and polar, MSA Pol, surface areas

### The structural origin of anomalous properties of liquid water [^074a6f46]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Water is the most important liquid for our existence and plays an essential role in physics, chemistry, biology and geoscience. What makes water unique is not only its importance but also the anomalous behaviour of many of its macroscopic properties. The ability to form up to four hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), in addition to the non-directional interactions seen in simple liquids, leads to many unusual properties such as increased density on melting, decreased viscosity under pressure, density maximum at 4 °C, high surface tension and many more (see, for example). If water would not behave in this unusual way it is most questionable if life could have developed on planet Earth.

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the isobaric heat capacity (C P) and the isothermal compressibility (κ T) that initially decrease with decreasing temperature but, just above the ambient temperature regime, there is a deviation and both the heat capacity and compressibility begin to increase on further cooling, resulting in a minimum at 308 K (35 °C) and 319 K (46 °C), respectively. These properties are related to fluctuations in the liquid where κ T derives from volume, or equivalently density, fluctuations, whereas C P is related to entropy fluctuations. Similarly, the density (ρ) of a simple liquid increases with decreasing temperature and this is true also for water when it is hot. However, as it enters the ambient regime, the rate of increase decreases and a maximum in the density is seen at 277 K (4 °C) after which the density instead decreases on further cooling. The density variation can be derived from the thermal expansion coefficient (α P), dependent on the cross-correlation between fluctuations in density and entropy, which thus becomes negative for water below the density maximum. As these thermodynamic properties measure the response to external perturbations, such as temperature or pressure, they are referred to as thermodynamic response functions. Their unusual behaviour for water is denoted anomalous where the anomaly becomes much stronger on cooling. Indeed, when fitted to a power law each of these properties seems to diverge towards a temperature of 228 K.

### Force-driven reversible liquid-gas phase transition mediated by elastic nanosponges [^cdcf0ce5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Conventional cooling systems rely mostly on the bulk phase transition (BPT) of halocarbon-based refrigerants, which cause ozone depletion and global warming. Recently, alternative systems have been extensively investigated by adopting the magnetocaloric effect –, electrocaloric effect – and elastocaloric effect (eCE) –. eCE is especially promising because of its relatively large available latent heat (ca. 5–13 kJ kg –1), affording a coefficient of performance (COP) that is comparable (5–7), to those of conventional BPT systems. However, the limitation of the latent heat based on the solid–solid phase transition hampers further improvement of COP. To develop more efficient cooling systems, it is important to explore alternative pathways for generating large latent heat with smaller external work. A probable method is to utilise physical adsorption or physisorption, the principle of which is shown in Fig. 1a. The van der Waals interactions between a solid surface and gas molecules (adsorbates) form a potential curve, and adsorbates are condensed on the solid surface usually through a multilayer adsorption mechanism. Inside the nanopores, two potential curves overlap to form a deeper potential (Fig. 1b), and adsorption occurs based on the mechanisms of micropore filling of pores < 2 nm in size and capillary condensation in pores > 2 nm at pressures much lower than the bulk equilibrium pressure. The density of the adsorbed refrigerant is close to the liquid density; therefore, adsorption corresponds to a phase transition. Indeed, the heats of adsorption/desorption are comparable to the heats of condensation/evaporation of the bulk refrigerant. Thus, the adsorbed refrigerant is in different equilibrium conditions from that of the bulk. Figure 1c illustrates the two different equilibrium conditions of bulk and adsorbed refrigerant. The quasi-liquid adsorbed inside nanopores is in equilibrium with the gas phase, whose pressure is much lower than the bulk saturation pressure, and therefore, its gas–liquid equilibrium line can be considered as shifting downwards. For example, at point A in Fig. 1c, the bulk refrigerant is gaseous, whereas it is condensed as quasi-liquid in nanopores. If the adsorbed refrigerant at point A is forcibly squeezed out of a nanopore by mechanical deformation of the nanoporous material, the expelled refrigerant must obey the gas–liquid equilibrium of the bulk refrigerant (solid line in Fig. 1c), suggesting that the refrigerant at point A may evaporate immediately. Additionally, for nanoporous materials with sufficient softness and elasticity, the desorbed gas can be re-adsorbed upon shape recovery of the nanoporous materials. Thus, reversible phase transition can be expected on the mechanically flexible nanoporous materials by the combination of the existing physicochemical phenomena, adsorption and bulk phase transition. However, most conventional nanoporous materials like zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are too hard to be deformed significantly enough for squeezing the adsorbed refrigerants. Certain MOFs are considered soft or flexible, because they show reversible structure change –, whereas their deformations are a kind of phase transition induced by the accommodation of guest molecules, or the irradiation of light, and their deformation by mechanical force is quite small. Additionally, elastic porous materials with large pore sizes (> 100 nm) like graphene aerogels – cannot be used because they lack the ability to adsorb gases. To realise the force-induced phase transition of refrigerants, nanoporous materials with sufficient elasticity and small nanopores (< 10 nm), denoted as nanosponges, are necessary.

### Bistable and photoswitchable States of matter [^7a0efff7]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Classical materials readily switch phases (solid to fluid or fluid to gas) upon changes in pressure or heat; however, subsequent reversion of the stimulus returns the material to their original phase. Covalently cross-linked polymer networks, which are solids that do not flow when strained, do not change phase even upon changes in temperature and pressure. However, upon the addition of dynamic cross-links, they become stimuli responsive, capable of switching phase from solid to fluid, but quickly returning to the solid state once the stimulus is removed. Reported here is the first material capable of a bistable switching of phase. A permanent solid to fluid transition or vice versa is demonstrated at room temperature, with inherent, spatiotemporal control over this switch in either direction triggered by exposure to light.

### Future increased risk from extratropical windstorms in Northern Europe [^61325c1e]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The future projections of the population have been used to estimate the impact of population change on the projected losses. Despite decreases in the projected meteorological intensity of windstorms in the future with risk adaptation, increases in population by the end of the century lead to larger risk potential through an increase in socio-economic exposure. This is a feature that is robust across all of the models examined. Many of the local increases in SOCSSI concentrated across North Western Europe can be offset somewhat by adapting to increases in the extreme wind speed climatology. For the SSP5-8.5 scenario, the increase in SOCSSI is reduced by 19% (averaged over all of Europe) by including adaptation to the increased extreme windspeeds (compared increase of 74.1% with no adaptation and an increase of 40.5% with adaptation). The increased risk over Northwestern Europe in the SSP5-8.5 scenario, even when including adaptation, is more than double the historical value, indicating the adaptation is useful, but not sufficient, at reducing the future storm risk. Even if the population does not grow, adaptation to the future wind speed climatology would be necessary to avoid an increase in storm losses (i.e. the METSSI). For the more moderate climate change scenario, almost all of the population- and wind-driven increases in the impacts are mitigated by adapting to the higher wind speeds (34.1% increase with no adaptation and 7.6% increase with adaptation). So mitigating the greenhouse gas emissions, or following lower emissions scenarios, would be another way to limit the future increases in storm loss and would require less adaptation. Our approach to losses and adaptation in this study is an idealised approach and does not account for added complexities in land use changeand differing vulnerabilities on a national and regional level. Policy decisions regarding adaptation are also made more complex by the uncertainties in the METSSI projections with different models. We consider adaptation in the perfect sense, and therefore our two loss estimates provide an upper and lower bound for future windstorm impacts. Despite this, our results provide a clear benefit indicating where impacts are likely to change through the 21st century, with results acting as a baseline for further investigation by loss modellers and future high-resolution studies.

### Measuring gas discharge in contact electrification [^c904b737]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Test strategies of measuring gas breakdown voltage in contact electrification.

a Pseudo-constant-pressure and b Pseudo-constant-distance. In (a) the gap between charged surfaces is increased at different target gas pressures (low in path 1, high in path 2) to trigger gas breakdown. In (b) gas pressure is varied (increasing in path 1, decreasing in path 2) at fixed gap distances to trigger gas breakdown. Schematics are provided for representative numbered states, where black spheres represent negative surface charge or electrons in gas molecules, and red spheres are positive surface charge or gas cations. Transitions between states include change in gas pressure at fixed distance (zero slope), change in gap distance at constant pressure (non-zero finite slope) and gas breakdown events (vertical drops) indicating intersections with hypothetical Paschen curves (dashed, neutral gray) to be obtained. The contact electrification (state 1) practically involves multiple contact cycles to deposit an adequate amount of surface charge, and state 1 represents the contact phase in the final cycle. In both strategies, path 1 starts with contact electrification under low gas pressure, while path 2 starts with contact cycles under high gas pressure where partial breakdown discharge is inevitably present. In (a) from state 1 to 2 the gap is first raised to overcome van der Waals adhesion and then reduced, which may also apply to (b) depending on the target gap length at state 2.

A pseudo-constant-distance test instead fixes the gap length and records the breakdown events as the gas pressure varies (Fig. 2b). Similarly, contact electrification cycles are first performed at a low pressure around 10 Pa. At the end of the final contact cycle, the surfaces are moved to the target gap distance and the operating gas is slowly released into the chamber while the Coulomb force is monitored so that breakdown events are indicated by discontinuities in the measurement. However, discharge detection by increasing the gas pressure may only reveal the first half (left to the minimum voltage point) of the Paschen curve since intersections with the second half is not feasible once the gap voltage falls below the minimum breakdown threshold. An alternative strategy (path 2, Fig. 2b) starts with contact electrification cycles at a high gas pressure (e.g. atmospheric, around 100 kPa) and then slowly pumps gas out of the chamber while the surfaces are kept at the target gap distance. Breakdown events represented by intersections with the second half of the Paschen curve can hence be obtained.

### Physiological basis for atmospheric methane oxidation and methanotrophic growth on air [^953b01df]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Next, we asked whether atmMOB can obtain enough energy from growth on air to meet the basic maintenance energy of 2.8 kJ C-mol −1 h −1 at 20 °C postulated previously. To calculate the strain-specific energy yields in C-mol, we first estimated the cellular energy yields based on the measured CH 4, H 2, and CO oxidation rates. M. aurea KYG yielded 6.89 x 10 −12 J cell −1 h −1 (n = 5, SD = 3.22 x 10 −12), M. gorgona MG08 2.21 x 10 −12 J cell −1 h −1 (n = 5, SD = 4.36 x 10 −13), M. palsarum NE2 3.09 x 10 −12 J cell −1 h −1 (n = 5, SD = 2.90 x 10 −13), and M. rosea SV97 3.879 x 10 −12 J cell −1 h −1 (n = 5, SD = 1.57 x 10 −12) by the oxidation of either two or three trace gases in air (Fig. 1B). Due to the higher free energy potential and atmospheric concentration of CH 4 compared to atmospheric H 2 and CO, the energy estimates predict CH 4 as the major energy source for all four strains. Our estimates derive from the Gibbs free energy change of the following reactions at atmospheric conditions: andthat amount to −797.4 kJ mol −1, −236.8 kJ mol −1, and −199.9 kJ mol −1, respectively. However, these numbers do not account for the energy required for activation of CH 4 by the pMMO or production cost of the enzymes involved in energy conservation from the gases. While the oxidation of H 2 and CO is catalyzed by one enzyme, the oxidation of CH 4 to CO 2 by atmMOB involves at least seven enzymes (see section: Comparative proteomics: Trace gas oxidation). Thus, due to the larger investments required for energy conservation from CH 4, the gases CO and H 2 might play more important roles as energy sources for growth on trace gases in air than indicated by the energy calculations alone. Considering the cellular dry masses and carbon content (Supplementary data file, Dataset 3) of M. gorgona MG08, M. aurea KYG, M. palsarum NE2, and M. rosea SV97, the energy yields per cell and hour translates to 0.40 kJ C-mol −1 h −1 (SD = 0.08 kJ C-mol −1 h −1), 0.71 kJ C-mol −1 h −1 (SD = 0.33 kJ C-mol −1 h −1), 0.38 kJ C-mol −1 h −1 (SD = 0.04 kJ C-mol −1 h −1), and 0.65 kJ C-mol −1 h −1 (SD = 0.26 kJ C-mol −1 h −1), at 20 °C, respectively (Fig. 3). These estimated energy yields for M. gorgona MG08, M. aurea KYG, M. palsarum NE2, and M. rosea SV97 are 3.9–7.4 times lower than the reported average energy requirements for cellular maintenance in aerobic bacteria (2.8 kJ C-mol −1 h −1 at 20 °C correspond to 4.5 kJ C-mol −1 h −1 at 25 °C).

### Tailoring the separation properties of flexible metal-organic frameworks using mechanical pressure [^272ee4ec]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Results

Experimental approach

The porous MOF MIL-53has been selected as a model candidate to propose a proof-of-concept of this line of thought. This channel-like framework made of chains of metal octahedra sharing μ 2 -OH vertices linked through terephthalate ligands, has been demonstrated to exhibit in its aluminum and chromium forms a guest-assisted reversible phase transition between a large pore (LP) and a narrow pore (NP) phase, accompanied with a remarkable change of the unit cell volume of about 40%. As illustrated in Fig. 1b for CO 2 adsorption, this leads to a two-step isotherm. At room temperature and in the absence of guest molecules, the LP phase is the most stable form. A slight increase in pressure induces a narrowing of the pores leading to the NP phase while increasing the CO 2 pressure reopens the structure in its LP phase. On desorption, as the CO 2 is evacuated from the pores, the reversible structural transition is observed (i.e. LP to NP phase) with hysteresis in the transition pressure.

As a consequence of this phase transition, the pore size aperture varies from 8 Å in the LP phase down to 3.5 Å in the NP phase (Fig. 1c), making this material potentially of interest to molecular sieve CO 2 over N 2 and CH 4 due to the difference in their kinetic diameters (3.3, 3.7, and 3.8 Å, respectively). Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that a similar contraction of the structure can be induced by the application of hydrostatic mechanical pressure in the range of 20–100 MPa. These structural features, together with the excellent mechanical stability of MIL-53(Al, Cr) up to 500 MPa, make this MOF ideal for the present study. To exploit this concept, we have developed a unique experimental setup allowing the measurement of high-pressure gas adsorption isotherms under external, uniaxial mechanical constraint (Supplementary Fig. 1). The use of a hydraulic mechanical press allows for the control of the mechanical pressure, which is maintained constant and continuously applied on the powder bed throughout the adsorption experiment.

Decompression sickness ("the bends") — mechanism and gas kinetics are described: Breathing air under pressure causes excess inert gas (usually nitrogen) to dissolve in and saturate body tissues; the amount of gas dissolved is proportional to and increases with total depth and time below the surface; if ascent allows supersaturation, bubbles form that interfere with blood flow and tissue oxygenation, and the excess dissolved gas must be cleared through respiration.

### Accurate determination of solvation free energies of neutral organic compounds from first principles [^5212bab3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The main goal of molecular simulation is to accurately predict experimental observables of molecular systems. Another long-standing goal is to devise models for arbitrary neutral organic molecules with little or no reliance on experimental data. While separately these goals have been met to various degrees, for an arbitrary system of molecules they have not been achieved simultaneously. For biophysical ensembles that exist at room temperature and pressure, and where the entropic contributions are on par with interaction strengths, it is the free energies that are both most important and most difficult to predict. We compute the free energies of solvation for a diverse set of neutral organic compounds using a polarizable force field fitted entirely to ab initio calculations. The mean absolute errors (MAE) of hydration, cyclohexane solvation, and corresponding partition coefficients are 0.2 kcal/mol, 0.3 kcal/mol and 0.22 log units, i.e. within chemical accuracy. The model (ARROW FF) is multipolar, polarizable, and its accompanying simulation stack includes nuclear quantum effects (NQE). The simulation tools' computational efficiency is on a par with current state-of-the-art packages. The construction of a wide-coverage molecular modelling toolset from first principles, together with its excellent predictive ability in the liquid phase is a major advance in biomolecular simulation.

### Water as the often neglected medium at the interface between materials and biology [^89d17e1f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Central to the chemical and physical behavior of water is its nature as a polar molecule. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms have vastly different electronegativities. Thus, the oxygen atom carries a partial negative charge due to its greater attraction for the shared electrons of the H-O covalent bond. Consequently, the two hydrogen atoms carry a partial positive charge. The formation of this dipole results in electrostatic attraction between H and O atoms of adjacent water molecules, generating a type of secondary bonding called hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonds are weaker than covalent bonds. The hydrogen-oxygen bond dissociation energies are 21 and 464 kJmol −1 for hydrogen bonds and covalent bonds, respectively. Therefore, within the temperature range for which water is a liquid, hydrogen bonds are able to break and re-form in a continuous dynamic fashion. The lifespan of a hydrogen bond in liquid water is in the range of tens of femtoseconds to picoseconds. Although individual hydrogen bonds are weak, collectively they result in the high cohesive forces of water as a substance.

The polar nature of water enables crucial cellular functions such as cell membrane formation, support of the three-dimensional shape of the DNA double helix, and it has an important role in the tertiary structure of proteins — specifically, water enables hydrophobic interactions, which are crucial to protein folding and aggregation. Water is a polar, protic solvent and amphoteric reagent, and has the ability to ionize both itself and other molecules. Due to its high heat capacity, water protects against the effects of temperature fluctuation.

There is a vast amount of literature on the behavior of water. The picture is, as yet, far from complete and research in this area is highly active. Entire journal issues have been devoted to the topic of water and its properties. Water is unique among all chemical substances in that it displays many anomalous and unexpected behavior parameters. For example, water has an unusually high boiling point for a substance composed of such small molecules; water displays a decreased viscosity when under pressure; it shows a maximum density at 4 °C and ice has a lower density than liquid water. Other thermodynamic parameters, such as specific heat (C P), thermal expansion coefficient (α P), and compressibility (k T), all show anomalous behavior. Much of the unusual behavior of water is linked to hydrogen bonding. For example, the high heat capacity and heat of vaporization are due to the large energy input required to break up the hydrogen-bonded network to allow greater molecular movement.

### Copper adparticle enabled selective electrosynthesis of n-propanol [^03d512fb]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

To assess the n-propanol generation process, we tested the Cu AD catalysts at reduced CO partial pressures (Fig. 5). Note that the decrease of CO partial pressure in gas feedstock would directly reduce the local CO concentration at the Cu catalysts surface (Fig. 5a). Gas mixtures of CO and N 2 with a composition of 15%, 35%, and 65% CO, respectively, at 1 atm were introduced at a constant potential of −0.44 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH. As CO partial pressure is increased, we observe an increase of FE n-propanol from 11% to 23% commensurate with a decrease of FE ethylene from ~42% to ~30% (Fig. 5b). The FE changes of ethanol and acetate are relatively small at all CO partial pressures. The ratio of FE n-propanol to FEC 2 (Fig. 5c) shows the increase of n-propanol production at the expense of C 2 (mainly ethylene). The shift from ethylene to n-propanol is consistent with *C 2 intermediates that contribute to ethylene formation (such as *OCCOH and *CCH 2; Fig. 1) being major intermediates for n-propanol as well. The similar ~11% FE n-propanol obtained on both Cu NP catalysts under 100% CO and Cu AD catalysts under 15% CO highlights the role of adparticles in concentrating CO and stabilizing *C 2 intermediates for n-propanol generation.

### Dissolving salt is not equivalent to applying a pressure on water [^50f1ee74]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Salt water is ubiquitous, playing crucial roles in geological and physiological processes. Despite centuries of investigations, whether or not water's structure is drastically changed by dissolved ions is still debated. Based on density functional theory, we employ machine learning based molecular dynamics to model sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and sodium bromide solutions at different concentrations. The resulting reciprocal-space structure factors agree quantitatively with neutron diffraction data. Here we provide clear evidence that the ions in salt water do not distort the structure of water in the same way as neat water responds to elevated pressure. Rather, the computed structural changes are restricted to the ionic first solvation shells intruding into the hydrogen bond network, beyond which the oxygen radial-distribution function does not undergo major change relative to neat water. Our findings suggest that the widely cited pressure-like effect on the solvent in Hofmeister series ionic solutions should be carefully revisited.

### Transition to a moist greenhouse with CO ₂ and solar forcing [^0fb0849d]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Water-rich planets such as Earth are expected to become eventually uninhabitable, because liquid water turns unstable at the surface as temperatures increase with solar luminosity. Whether a large increase of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO 2 could also destroy the habitability of water-rich planets has remained unclear. Here we show with three-dimensional aqua-planet simulations that CO 2 -induced forcing as readily destabilizes the climate as does solar forcing. The climate instability is caused by a positive cloud feedback and leads to a new steady state with global-mean sea-surface temperatures above 330 K. The upper atmosphere is considerably moister in this warm state than in the reference climate, implying that the planet would be subject to substantial loss of water to space. For some elevated CO 2 or solar forcings, we find both cold and warm equilibrium states, implying that the climate transition cannot be reversed by removing the additional forcing.

### Metamaterials with negative compressibility highlight evolving interpretations and opportunities [^87323b30]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

While (static) negative compressibility cannot occur continuously under the standard assumptions above, metamaterials can be designed to undergo a negative compressibility transition in which they change discontinuously from a low- to a high-volume phase in response to increased pressure(Fig. 1a). The effect is enabled by the stress-induced decay of metastable states, involves a finite increase in volume in response to a differential increase in applied pressure (also characterized in terms of finite-difference compressibility), and can be cycled through a hysteresis loop. Negative compressibility transitions were proposed over a decade ago, but they have only recently been experimentally achieved with buckling designs constructed using additive manufacturing.

A different mechanism has been examined in open poroelastic materials, where pressure is applied via a fluid medium that penetrates the material(Fig. 1b). When the material is fully penetrated, the medium pressure pushes out from within the material as much as it acts to compress it. However, the differing responses of subcomponents can still lead to negative effective compressibility (the "effective" volume here includes that occupied by the penetrating medium). Naturally, the compressibility of the combined (closed) system consisting of the penetrated material and the surrounding fluid medium remains positive (as does the compressibility of the bulk poroelastic material itself). This form of negative compressibility is especially relevant in small-scale stochastic systems, such as in the negative response exhibited by some proteins as they denature under increasing pressure.

A third possible mechanism involves sources of energy other than the mechanical work done by the applied pressure (Fig. 1c). Although this mechanism remains largely unexplored as a source of negative compressibility, we suggest that it has potential for future metamaterial design.

### Energy-efficient COconversion to multicarbon products at high rates on CuGa bimetallic catalyst [^11fac61c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To further assess the performance of Cu 5 Ga 1 under practical relevant conditions, we conducted CO 2 R in a flow cell configuration (Supplementary Fig. 12) and employed diluted CO 2 streams. As shown in Fig. 3e, f, we present the product distributions of Cu 5 Ga 1 and Cu at the same current density of 0.5 A cm −2, under different CO 2 partial pressure using N 2 as the inert balance gas. At 100% CO 2 partial pressure, Cu 5 Ga 1 (FE = ~68%) exhibits slightly lower C 2+ selectivity compared to Cu (FE = ~80%), which can be attribute the smaller overpotential applied. However, upon reducing the CO 2 partial pressure from 100% to 75%, the FE C2+ of Cu decreased rapidly (to ~40%), coupled with a significant increase in FE CH4 (from ~5% to ~30%). This result indicates that flooding likely occurred at the GDE surface. Notably, the applied potential was recorded to be approximately −0.87 V RHE (Fig. 3g left) for Cu at 75% CO 2 partial pressure, aligning with the mass transport region we proposed earlier (Fig. 1b). When we further reduce the CO 2 partial pressure to 50% and 25%, H 2 became the predominate product for Cu, as anticipated (Fig. 3g right). In contrast, Cu 5 Ga 1 catalyst exhibits a distinct behavior. Specifically, as the CO 2 partial pressure decreases, the FE C2+ increases instead of decreasing, reaching the highest FE C2+ (~83%) and FE C2H4 (~53%) at 50% CO 2, while the FE H2 only increases modestly from 4% to 8%. This intriguing trend further supports our hypothesis on the potential-dependent regions for electrode flooding, as the applied potential for Cu 5 Ga 1 is only −0.7 V RHE at 50% CO 2. When we further reduce the CO 2 partial pressure to 25%, the applied potential increased significantly to compensate for the CO 2 concentration overpotential. Consequently, we observed a significant decrease in FE C2+ (~60%), and increase in selectivity towards to CH 4 and H 2, indicative of flooding at the GDE reaction layer.

### Insights from a dynamical system approach into the history of atmospheric oxygenation [^ecada1e8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Atmospheric oxygen levels are traditionally viewed to have been relatively stable throughout Earth's history with several-step increases. Emerging evidence, however, suggests extremely dynamic atmospheric oxygen levels through large swaths of Earth's history. Here, we provide a new perspective on atmospheric oxygen evolution using a dynamical analysis to explore the relative importance of previously proposed feedbacks on the global oxygen and carbon cycles. Our results from a stochastic analysis of oxygen mass balance in this framework suggest there are multiple steady states for atmospheric oxygen, but only three stable states. One stable state under anoxic conditions (< 10–5 present atmospheric level (PAL)), one at low (~10–3 to 10–2 PAL), and one near modern value atmospheric oxygen levels. Our findings also suggest two unstable states (tipping points) for atmospheric oxygen: one around 10–5 and another one around 10–1 PAL.

### Redox-triggered switching in three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks [^676dceb7]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Tunable gas absorption and separation

Considering the redox-switchable process in 3D-TPB-COF-HQ will form different functional groups on the pore surface and also change the shape of the pore channel, we speculate the redox-triggered modification of pore environment may influence their gas separation property. For a proof-of-concept experiment, we studied the selective sorption of CO 2 over N 2 to demonstrate the redox-responsive effect. As shown in Fig. 5a, 3D-TPB-COF-HQ exhibited a CO 2 capacity of 93.4 cm 3 g −1 at 273 K and 1 bar, and after oxidation to 3D-TPB-COF-Q, the capacity will increase a little bit to 105 cm 3 g −1. We then calculated the isosteric heats of adsorption (Q st) from the CO 2 adsorption isotherms at two different temperatures by fitting the data to the virial equation (Supplementary Table S5 and Supplementary Fig. 23–25). Obviously, the Q st values of 3D-TPB-COF-HQ (23.5 kJ mol −1) is lower than that of 3D-TPB-COF-Q (29.0 kJ mol −1). Based on the CO 2 and N 2 isotherms measured at 273 K and by using the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), the adsorption selectivity for CO 2 /N 2 mixtures (15:85) of these COFs as a function of pressure is also calculated (Fig. 5b). 3D-TPB-COF-HQ showed a selectivity of 40 at 1 bar, but after oxidation to 3D-TPB-COF-Q, the selectivity will increase to a much higher value of 93. From these results, we believe that the shape change of the pore channel and the modification of pore surface from hydroquinone to quinone groups will significantly enhance the gas separation selectivity. Moreover, after the reduction of 3D-TPB-COF-Q, 3D-TPB-COF-HQ(R) exhibited almost the same performance as that of TPB-COF-HQ, confirming again the reversibility of this process. Therefore, the redox-triggered switching process in 3D-TPB-COF-HQ can reversibly change the pore environment and result in different gas separation property.

### Interpolating numerically exact many-body wave functions for accelerated molecular dynamics [^7dff026b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

While there have been many developments in computational probes of both strongly-correlated molecular systems and machine-learning accelerated molecular dynamics, there remains a significant gap in capabilities in simulating accurate non-local electronic structure over timescales on which atoms move. We develop an approach to bridge these fields with a practical interpolation scheme for the correlated many-electron state through the space of atomic configurations, whilst avoiding the exponential complexity of these underlying electronic states. With a small number of accurate correlated wave functions as a training set, we demonstrate provable convergence to near-exact potential energy surfaces for subsequent dynamics with propagation of a valid many-body wave function and inference of its variational energy whilst retaining a mean-field computational scaling. This represents a profoundly different paradigm to the direct interpolation of potential energy surfaces in established machine-learning approaches. We combine this with modern electronic structure approaches to systematically resolve molecular dynamics trajectories and converge thermodynamic quantities with a high-throughput of several million interpolated wave functions with explicit validation of their accuracy from only a few numerically exact quantum chemical calculations. We also highlight the comparison to traditional machine-learned potentials or dynamics on mean-field surfaces.

### Dynamic air / liquid pockets for guiding microscale flow [^77fd48d8]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Microscale flows of fluids are mainly guided either by solid matrices or by liquid-liquid interfaces. However, the solid matrices are plagued with persistent fouling problems, while liquid-liquid interfaces are limited to low-pressure applications. Here we report a dynamic liquid/solid/gas material containing both air and liquid pockets, which are formed by partially infiltrating a porous matrix with a functional liquid. Using detailed theoretical and experimental data, we show that the distribution of the air- and liquid-filled pores is responsive to pressure and enables the formation and instantaneous recovery of stable liquid-liquid interfaces that sustain a wide range of pressures and prevent channel contamination. This adaptive design is demonstrated for polymeric materials and extended to metal-based systems that can achieve unmatched mechanical and thermal stability. Our platform with its unique adaptive pressure and antifouling capabilities may offer potential solutions to flow control in microfluidics, medical devices, microscale synthesis, and biological assays.

### Benchmark single-step ethylene purification from ternary mixtures by a customized fluorinated anion-embedded MOF [^5b677c24]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In this work, we reported a GeF 6 2− anion embedded MOF ZNU-6 (ZNU = Zhejiang Normal University) with large cages (~8.5 Å diameter) connected by narrow interlaced channels (~4 Å diameter) for benchmark one-step C 2 H 4 recovery from C 2 H 2 and CO 2. ZNU-6 is constructed by CuGeF 6 and tri(pyridin-4-yl)amine (TPA) and exhibits excellent chemical stability. Static gas adsorption isotherms showed that ZNU-6 takes up 1.53/8.06 mmol/g of C 2 H 2 and 1.46/4.76 mmol/g of CO 2 at 0.01 and 1.0 bar (298 K), respectively. The calculated IAST selectivities for C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 (1/99) and CO 2 /C 2 H 4 (1/99) are 43.8–14.3 and 52.6–7.8 (0.0001–1.0 bar), respectively. The calculated Q st values at near-zero loading for C 2 H 2 and CO 2 are 37.2 and 37.1 kJ/mol, indicative of its facility for material regeneration but much higher than that of C 2 H 4 (29.0 kJ/mol). Modeling study indicates that there are two potential binding sites for C 2 H 2, C 2 H 4, and CO 2. One is in the interlaced channel and the other locates in the large cage. Moreover, all gas molecules prefer to be adsorbed in the interlaced channel with higher affinity. The realistic binding sites and host–guest interactions under normal conditions (298 K and 1.0 bar) were further demonstrated by in-situ single crystal structures with the saturated dose of gases. Notably, rare C 2 H 2 clusters formed by π···π packing and C-H···C≡C interactions are observed in the interlaced channel with a small proportion of C 2 H 2 molecules adsorbed in the large cage additionally. In sharp contrast, only 1/3 of CO 2 molecules are located in the narrow channel while 2/3 of CO 2 molecules are accommodated in the large cavity. This distinct gas distribution is highly consistent with the difference of adsorption heat curves. The practical C 2 H 4 purification performance is further demonstrated by dynamic breakthroughs and record high C 2 H 4 productivity is achieved from ternary C 2 H 2 /CO 2 /C 2 H 4 mixtures in a single adsorption process under various conditions. The separation performance is retained over multiple cycles and under humid conditions.

### Structure and chemistry of graphene oxide in liquid water from first principles [^a91d383c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Construction of graphene oxide models

In detail, we first built each empty semiordered or random GO replica by adding chemical functions according to the constraints detailed in the first part of the paper. Then, these structures have been placed into a 15 × 13 × 16 Å 3 orthorhombic cell, corresponding to a 6 × 6 graphene-like lattice with an interlayer spacing of 16 Å. Then, we performed a preliminary geometry optimization and a cell relaxation using VASP. Indeed, adding chemical functions on the GO surface induces a mechanical strain and the lattice parameters a and b need to be adjusted. This procedure is then repeated with the C2PK code to ensure that the minimum energy configuration has been reach and to check the consistency of the results with two different codes. Once the empty surface is fully relaxed (i.e. the pressure of the system is about 10–100 MPa, a standard value for such materials), we generated a single 30 ps AIMD trajectory for each replica at T = 300 K, using periodic boundary conditions. The deuterium mass is substituted for all protons to reduce the timestep size needed for energy conservation in our Born Oppenheimer dynamics AIMD and to limit nuclear quantum effects of the proton. All the AIMD simulations were carried out with a 0.5 fs timestep in the N V T ensemble, using a stochastic velocity rescaling (SVR) thermostatwith a time constant of 1 ps.

### Measuring gas discharge in contact electrification [^515b9961]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Experimental approach

The test apparatus (Fig. 1b) performs contact electrification in a vacuum chamber and thereafter measures the attractive Coulomb force between the charged surfaces when they are separated. A load cell with high capacity (25 N) is mounted above the top sample surface to monitor the contact force as well as any strong adhesion when the surfaces disengage, the majority of which is attributed to van der Waals interactions. A second load cell with low capacity (1.2 N) is placed beneath the bottom sample surface to measure the Coulomb force, which is overloaded during the contacts as a compromise. The top and bottom sample surfaces are planar with a circular effective contact area (45.6 cm 2, 76.2 mm diameter) which is relatively large to ensure sufficient load cell resolution for capturing low-voltage gas breakdown. Two test strategies, namely pseudo-constant-pressure and pseudo-constant-distance tests, are implemented to reconstruct the presumed Paschen curve by detecting gas breakdown events when gap distance and gas pressure are varied, respectively. A pseudo-constant-pressure test simulates the general contact electrification process by separating charged surfaces at different controlled gas pressures (Fig. 2a). The vacuum chamber is first flushed with the operating gas, where the surfaces are brought to a significant gap distance around 30 mm while the gas pressure is swept between 10 Pa and 100 kPa 3 times. It is assumed that the majority of any residual surface charge is dissipated during this stage, at which point the load cells are zeroed. The gap is then slowly closed until a contact force is detected and the corresponding displacement is recorded as the nominal zero point for measuring gap distance. The gas pressure in the chamber is then lowered and kept around 10 Pa, where the surfaces are pressed into several quasi-static contact cycles with a controlled peak contact force until a certain amount of surface charge is deposited. The surface charge density is in general not saturated but assumed uniform, while the maximum gap distance in the separation stage of each contact cycle is kept small (less than 2 mm) to avoid triggering gas breakdown, albeit ideal disengaging at exactly zero gap distance is usually not feasible since extra tension is required to overcome any van der Waals adhesion. After the surfaces fully disengage at the end of the final contact cycle, they are brought back to a near-zero gap (around 0.02 mm) and the gas pressure is raised and kept closely around a target value. The gap is then increased quasi-statically, during which the Coulomb attraction is monitored and post-processed to calculate the surface charge density and gap voltage. Each discontinuity (drop) in the measured voltage represents a breakdown event and is recorded as an intersection with the hypothetical Paschen curve. The first breakdown event in tests with comparatively high initial raw charge density reveals earlier sections (at smaller gaps) of the Paschen curve, and ideally the further parts (at larger gaps) can later be covered by breakdown events that follow. In practice, the lowest measurable voltage is limited by the resolution of the load cell so that tests at various target gas pressures are performed to obtain different sections of the Paschen curve. When the target gas pressure is high, massive discharge may already happen while the pressure is being raised to the target value, in which case an alternative strategy (path 2, Fig. 2a) is employed where the contact cycles are performed at a higher gas pressure (e.g. atmospheric, around 100 kPa) instead. The separation stage in the contact cycles is no longer free of discharge but an adequate amount of residual surface charge can still be deposited. Similarly, the surfaces are brought to a near-zero gap after the final contact cycle and gas pressure is then lowered to the target value, followed by the same separation and Coulomb force measurement procedure.

### Stabilization of a linear nanomechanical oscillator to its thermodynamic limit [^39fee782]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

The rapid development of micro- and nanomechanical oscillators in the past decade has led to the emergence of novel devices and sensors that are opening new frontiers in both applied and fundamental science. The potential of these devices is however affected by their increased sensitivity to external perturbations. Here we report a non-perturbative optomechanical stabilization technique and apply the method to stabilize a linear nanomechanical beam at its thermodynamic limit at room temperature. The reported ability to stabilize a nanomechanical oscillator to the thermodynamic limit can be extended to a variety of systems and increases the sensitivity range of nanomechanical sensors in both fundamental and applied studies.

### Controlled release of HS and NO gases through CO-stimulated anion exchange [^4ea6ae48]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Difficulties related to handling gases are a common bottleneck for applications. Although solid materials that release gas molecules under external stimuli exist, they require an external energy or a device for reliable operation. Herein, we report a CO 2 stimulus for controlled release of p.p.m.-level functional gases from solid materials. A CO 2 -preferential anion-exchange property of layered double hydroxides and redox reactions in gas molecules are combined to release various gases (including H 2 S and NO) under ambient air from HS - and NO 2 - -incorporated layered double hydroxides, respectively. The profiles of gas release are mainly governed by the difference of pK a between H 2 CO 3 and resulting acids (formed through protonation of interlayer anions), and are not so susceptible to the variation of relative humidity in air. Moreover, structural modulation of solid materials enables fine control of the gas release profiles. The use of safe, ubiquitous, and nearly constant (~400p.p.m. in atmosphere) CO 2 stimulus offers broad applications for functional gases.

### Molecular sieving of iso-butene from colefins with simultaneous high 1, 3-butadiene and n-butene uptakes [^01f1c0c5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Isosteric heat of adsorption

The experiment isosteric heat of adsorption for C 4 H 6 and n-C 4 H 8 were calculated using the data at 283 K and 298 K, which was calculated by the Clausius–Clapeyron equation and was defined as:where Q st (kJ mol −1) represents the adsorption heat of gas molecular, P (mmHg) and T (K) represent the pressure and temperature, respectively, and R is the universal gas constant. Here, the adsorption heat of each component was determined precisely according to the virial fitting parameters of single-component adsorption isotherms measured at 283 and 298 K, which was calculated as follows:where the N (mg g −1) is the adsorption amount, and m and n determine the number of items required to precisely fit the adsorption isotherms.

Calculation of kinetic adsorption

The diffusional time constants (D', D/r 2) were calculated by the short-time solution of the diffusion equation assuming a step change in the gas-phase concentration, clean beds initially and micropore diffusion control:where t (s) is the time, M t (mmol g −1) is gas uptake at time t, M e (mmol g −1) is the gas uptake at equilibrium, D (m 2 s −1) is the diffusivity and r (m) is the radius of the equivalent spherical particle. The slopes of M t /M e versus t 1/2 are derived from the fitting of the plots at 0.5 bar and 298 K, and the pressure rise rate is 200 mbar min −1.

### Boosting photocatalytic hydrogen production from water by photothermally induced biphase systems [^ca89f562]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In addition to kinetically promote the transport of water molecules, high temperatures will reduce hydrogen transport resistance as well so that the photocatalytic reaction rate can be accelerated. This can be evidenced by the hydrogen gas diffusion coefficient D L in a liquid-phase environment, calculated by the Stokes–Einstein equation:where T is the temperature,(= 2.26) is the "association" parameter of the solvent water, and μ denote the molecular weight and viscosity of water, respectively, andis the molar volume of hydrogen. When the temperature is increased from 298 to 373 K, the hydrogen gas diffusion coefficient D L is increased. Thus, hydrogen transport resistance is slightly decreased.

A more significant effect on promoting the photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution reaction comes from the state change of the water phase. When the water phase changes from liquid to steam at the same temperature (373 K), interestingly, the first and second step of the photocatalytic reaction (i.e. the water molecule adsorption process and the hydrogen adsorption process) has been significantly influenced. The Gibbs energy of the water molecule adsorption process substantially decreases from 0.331 eV in the triphase system to −0.212 eV in the biphase system, and it also reduces (−0.054 vs. −0.007 eV) for the hydrogen adsorption process (Fig. 4c), indicating that the water molecule adsorption process and hydrogen adsorption process in the biphase system become much more comfortable than that in the triphase system. Kinetically, the hydrogen gas diffusion coefficient D G in the gaseous environment can be calculated by the Chapman–Enskog theory:where A (= 1.858 × 10 −3) is an empirical coefficient, M is the molar mass, P is the pressure in the system, σ is the average collision diameter, and Ω is a temperature-dependent collision integral. The produced hydrogen bubbles experience frictional resistance in adjacent interlayers from relative motion with the environmental particles. Owing to the interfacial frictional resistance, the hydrogen-gas diffusion coefficients differ significantly in the liquid and steam water phases. In the liquid water phase, D L is (4.99–5.06) × 10 −5 at reaction temperatures near 373 K (i.e. 368–373 K), based on the Stokes–Einstein equation (Eq. (2)), whereas, in the steam phase, D G is 2.65 × 10 −3 at 373 K, two orders of magnitude higher than that in the liquid water. Therefore, when the produced hydrogen gas passes through the liquid water before being liberated, it is greatly resisted by the environmental liquid water molecules. By contrast, the hydrogen bubbles in the biphase system pass through the gas water molecules with much less resistance. Figure 4d schematizes the hydrogen transport resistances in the liquid- and gas-phase environments.

### Controlled release of HS and NO gases through CO-stimulated anion exchange [^0bddbd77]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Gas molecules play key roles in many research fields and their practical utility depends on the safety and cost-effectivity of the gas delivery system (particularly when gases are toxic, labile, or flammable) –. The use of high-pressure gas cylinders is often the source of safety concerns; therefore, solid materials that release gas molecules under external stimuli (e.g. heat, light, and vacuum) have attracted particular interest –. However, such conventional stimuli require external energy (e.g. electricity) and controlling device for reliable operation. By contrast, the use of aerial components as stimuli for gas release is attractive in that air is safe, charge-free, and available anytime anywhere. Some zeolites and metal organic frameworks that capture and release gases have been reported –. In particular, controlled release of H 2 S and NO is valuable for medical application, because these gases are physiologically active (i.e. they exhibit effects such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, cytoprotective, and vasodilatory effects) at p.p.m.-level concentrations but are toxic at higher concentrations and labile under air –. These solids bind gases at coordinatively unsaturated transition metal cation sites and release them under moist air through the replacement of gas molecules with water. However, the water-triggered gas-release system could be susceptible to the variation of relative humidity (RH) and long-term release of gases were, in most cases, demonstrated under fixed and low RH condition (10~20%RH). In addition, initial burst release of highly concentrated gases tends to be observed.

### Isoflurane [^b727d934]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DESCRIPTION

Some physical constants are:

Equation for vapor pressure calculation:

log10 P vap = A+ B where: A = 8.056

T B = -1664.58

T = °C + 273.16 (Kelvin)

Isoflurane is a clear, colorless, stable liquid containing no additives or chemical stabilizers. Isoflurane has a mildly pungent, musty, ethereal odor. Samples stored in indirect sunlight in clear, colorless glass for five years, as well as samples directly exposed for 30 hours to a 2 amp, 115 volt, 60 cycle long wave U.V. light were unchanged in composition as determined by gas chromatography. Isoflurane in one normal sodium methoxide-methanol solution, a strong base, for over six months consumed essentially no alkali, indicative of strong base stability. Isoflurane does not decompose in the presence of soda lime (at normal operating temperatures), and does not attack aluminum, tin, brass, iron or copper.

### Adsorbed oxygen dynamics at forced convection interface in the oxygen evolution reaction [^f90b5081]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Finite element simulations

The fluid motions inside the cell were all simulated in Fluent software using the Mixture multi-phase flow model. The fluxes of different phases entering the grid per unit time were weighted and averaged to obtain the macroscopic fluid motion trend in that grid for transfer, realizing the velocity, density, pressure, and other physical quantities of different fluid phases for solving the calculations. Considering the very low Reynolds number of the flow, Laminar flow model was used for the calculation. A transient pressure-based solver was used to perform the calculations with second-order wind-type accuracy by means of a transient coupled-type algorithm. For the simulation of the fluid replacement process within the cell, due to the similarity of density, viscosity between the two liquids, no surface tension between the phases, and no clear cross-interface after mixing, the surface tension coefficient was 0 nm −1 with the volumetric force format.

### Quantifying surface tension of metastable aerosols via electrodeformation [^1369d042]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Accurate surface tension measurements are key to understanding and predicting the behavior of atmospheric aerosols, particularly their formation, growth, and phase transitions. In Earth's atmosphere, aerosols often exist in metastable states, such as being supercooled or supersaturated. Standard tensiometry instruments face challenges in accessing these states due to the large sample volumes they require and rapid phase changes near surfaces. We present an instrument that uses a strong electric field, nearing the dielectric strength of air, to deform aerosol microdroplets and measure surface tension in a contact-free, humidity-controlled environment. A dual-beam optical trap holds single microdroplets between two electrodes and excites Raman scattering. When a high voltage is applied, droplet deformations reach tens of nanometers. These small shape changes are precisely measured through the splitting of morphology-dependent resonances, seen as sharp peaks in Raman spectra. Our measurements cover water activities where droplets are supersaturated, a region with limited previous data, and show good agreement with existing data where comparisons are possible. Unlike prior levitation-based methods, this approach measures surface tension in systems with viscosities over 10 2 Pas without relying on dynamic processes.

As for reaction conditions, the thermodynamic equilibrium potential was determined according to the Nernst equation, assuming 1 atm of N 2 in the electrolyte.where F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C mol −1), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298.15 K), c (OH −) is the hydroxide concentration (0.1 M), R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol −1 K −1), and pH is 13. Assuming a NH 4 OH concentration of 10 −6 M in the electrolyte, the corresponding thermodynamic equilibrium potential is calculated to be 0.207 V vs. RHE.

### Understanding the adsorption process in ZIF-8 using high pressure crystallography and computational modelling [^b203cfbf]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Effect of pressure on compressibility, geometry and loading

The crystallographic data allowed changes in the framework compressibility, geometry and pore content to be monitored over the pressure range studied. As already highlighted in earlier reports, the orientation of the mIm linker [defined by the angle θ between the planes of the mIm atoms and the (100) crystallographic plane, see Fig. 1c, d] is particularly sensitive to pressure. Under ambient pressure and temperature conditions, θ is 65.1° and consequently the 4MR and 6MR window diameters measured 0.8 Å and 3.0 Å respectively. Upon sealing the DAC at the lowest possible pressures using CH 4 as a PTM (0.30 GPa), the unit cell volume of ZIF-8 increased by 1.39% (Fig. 2). This is indicative of the PTM penetrating into the pores of the framework (Table 1). The increase in electron density was accompanied by a decrease in θ to 58.7°, causing the diameter of the 4MR to decrease from 0.8 to 0.7 Å and the 6MR windows to increase from 3.0 to 3.1 Å. The calculated energy barrier to this small rotation was relatively modest, with an energy penalty of just 0.5 kJ mol -1 per mIm linker (for more information on DFT calculations see Supplementary Fig. 3). On increasing pressure to 0.50 GPa, the unit cell of ZIF-8-AP compressed (by 0.36%) while θ remained essentially unchanged (measuring 58.9°). Such a small change in rotation did not change the 4MR and 6MR window diameters, however the electron density within the pores steadily increased, equating to ca. 33 CH 4 molecules/uc (molecules per unit cell). At 0.70 GPa, the unit cell expanded further (by 2.83%), which was accompanied by a displacive phase transition to the ZIF-8-HP phase (Fig. 2), characterised by θ increasing to 86.6°, which caused the diameters of 4MR and 6MR to increase to 2.5 Å and 3.3 Å, respectively. This was accompanied by a large change in solvent uptake into the pore (equating to ca. 89 CH 4 molecules/uc). The energy penalty for the framework to undergo such a large rotation was calculated to be 5.8 kJ mol −1 per mIm linker. The energy of adsorption must, therefore, be greater to overcome this barrier. Increasing the pressure from 0.70 to 1.40 GPa led to compression of the HP phase, decreasing the unit cell volume by 1.40%, while θ continued to increase modestly, measuring 87.8° at 1.40 GPa (which corresponds to a 6.2 kJ mol −1 penalty for rotation per linker). Conversely the 6MR diameter actually decreased in size between 0.70 and 1.40 GPa (by 2.40%) owing to the framework compression. Above 1.40 GPa, crystallinity deteriorated, and no structural data could be extracted.

### One-step ethylene production from a four-component gas mixture by a single physisorbent [^e06fc0e2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The pore volume, Langmuir and Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) specific surface area for Zn-atz-oba are 0.287 cm 3 g −1, 783.1 m 2 g −1, and 710.7 m 2 g −1, respectively, as calculated from its cryogenic (77 K) N 2 adsorption isotherm (Supplementary Figs. 2–4). Both parameters are in agreement with the crystal structure derived pore volume (0.283 cm 3 g −1) and the Langmuir surface area calculated therefrom (755 m 2 g −1), respectively. Horvath-Kawazoe model (pore geometry: slit) based pore size distribution analysis revealed the aperture distribution to be ultramicroporous between 0.32 and 0.44 nm (Supplementary Fig. 5).

Adsorption isotherm, selectivity, and enthalpy

The C 2 H 2, C 2 H 4, C 2 H 6, and CO 2 adsorption isotherms of activated Zn-atz-oba were recorded at 298 and 273 K (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 6). Interestingly, C 2 H 2, C 2 H 6, and CO 2 exhibited higher adsorption uptakes at 298 K across the entire pressure range tested, 0–100 kPa, especially in the low-pressure region, 0–20 kPa. These uptakes suggest selective adsorption of C 2 H 2, CO 2, and C 2 H 6 over C 2 H 4 by Zn-atz-oba. Low-coverage isosteric adsorption enthalpies were determined by virial fit of the isotherm data (see Methods section, Supplementary Note 2: Adsorption enthalpy calculation, and Supplementary Figs. 7–10) and the trends (Fig. 2d) correlate well with their low-pressure (until 20 kPa) saturation uptake capacities as follows: Q st (C 2 H 6) (30.0 kJ mol −1) > Q st (CO 2) (29.0 kJ mol −1) > Q st (C 2 H 2) (27.5 kJ mol −1) > Q st (C 2 H 4) (27.0 kJ mol −1). We also note that the adsorption enthalpies of all four gases are below 35 kJ mol −1, an indication that Zn-atz-oba should exhibit a relatively low energy footprint for regeneration.

### Intra-crystalline mesoporous zeolite encapsulation-derived thermally robust metal nanocatalyst in deep oxidation of light alkanes [^4ecb177e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In order to further clearly study the changes of chemical valence of Pd species during the oxidation process. The in situ near ambient pressure XPS (in situ NAP-XPS) was performed as shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that Pd species have two states (Pd 0 and Pd 2+) under vacuum condition indicating some PdO species are still unreduced. The valence of Pd species remains unchanged at room temperature when the C 3 H 8 and O 2 mixed gas (C 3 H 8 :O 2 = 1:5) was introduced. As the reaction temperature increasing to 225 °C, a new peak was detected around 346.7 eV in the Pd3d 3/2 spectra could be attributed to Pd 4+ species. The peak intensity of Pd 2+ and Pd 4+ species are gradually increased and the peak intensity of Pd 0 species are gradually decreased as the reaction temperature continues to increase. It was proved that some of the reduced metallic Pd species are oxidized to PdO x species. The above ex situ XRD, Raman, XPS, and in situ NAP-XPS results indicate that the changes of chemical valence of Pd species are from low-valence Pd 0 to high-valence Pd 2+ and Pd 4+ during the oxidation process of propane. The formation and the co-existing of the Pd−PdO interfaces can efficiently provide the active oxygen species.

### Acute blood pressure-lowering effects of nitrogen dioxide exposure from domestic gas cooking via elevation of plasma nitrite concentration in healthy individuals [^d456d700]. Circulation Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Meet the First Author, see p

Air pollution is a major cause of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Disentangling the relative contributions of pollutants is challenging, as epidemiological data measuring exposure to one (eg, nitrogen dioxide [NO 2]) is inevitably confounded by exposure to others (eg, particulate matter). Animal studies suggest that inhaled NO 2 has the potential to increase plasma [nitrite]; a chemical originally considered to be physiologically inert before we found that its reduction to nitric oxide protects the myocardium against ischemia-reperfusion injury and lowers blood pressure in humans.

We conducted an acute, randomized, controlled, crossover study to assess the impact of 90 minutes exposure to NO 2 (from sitting next to a domestic gas cooker with gas hobs lit and uncovered) versus control (room air) on plasma [nitrite] (primary end point) and blood pressure (secondary end points) in 12 healthy participants. All underwent both interventions/visits (interval 7–108 days) in a computer-generated randomized order. Baseline characteristics (mean ± SD): 26 ± 4years, 10/12 female, body mass index 21.9 ± 3.0 kg/m 2, systolic blood pressure 113.8 ± 7.9 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 72.8 ± 5.7 mm Hg. The exposure phase was followed by a 90 minutes washout phase at background [NO 2]. Participants fasted for 12 hours before each visit and received 250 mL low-nitrate water at time 0 h/1.5 h. The study was powered for a difference in plasma [nitrite] of 27 ± 40 nmol/L on repeated-measures, 2-way ANOVA (α, 0.05 and β, 0.2) following D'Agostino-Pearson normality-confirmation, with Sidak post-test (GraphPad Prism v8.2.1).

### Human-induced changes in extreme cold surges across the Northern hemisphere [^e8e5bce5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Extreme cold surges, very large temperature drops over a short period of time, have serious impacts on human health, energy supply and ecosystems. While changes in temperature variability and cold extremes in a warming climate are well understood, changes in extreme cold surges and their driving mechanisms are not. Here we show that extreme cold surges have robustly weakened in middle-to-high latitude continents during autumn and winter but have remained almost unchanged in lower latitudes. By diagnosing near-surface thermodynamic budget, we find that this change is mainly induced by anthropogenic forcing. Greenhouse gas forcing decreases the meridional temperature gradient and associated variability in middle-to-high latitudes but has minimal impact in lower latitudes. This leads to similar spatial pattern of changes in nonlinear horizontal temperature advection that dominantly drives the extreme cold surges. Influenced by the same mechanism, extreme cold surges during winter across middle-to-high latitudes will continue to weaken in the future, with an 8%-13% reduction in their strength by the end of the century under the SSP 3–7.0 scenario.

### Effect of pressure support on end-expiratory lung volume and lung diffusion for carbon monoxide [^e976b0cb]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The level of pressure-support ventilation can affect mean airway pressure and potentially lung volume, but its increase is usually associated with a reduced respiratory rate, and the net effects on the gas exchange process and its components, including end-expiratory lung volume, have not been carefully studied. We measured pulmonary conductance for gas exchange based on lung diffusion for carbon monoxide in patients receiving pressure-support ventilation.

Design

Prospective, randomized, crossover study.

Setting

Medical intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients

Sixteen patients mechanically ventilated in pressure-support ventilation mode and free from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Interventions

Two pressure-support ventilation levels (5 cm H2O difference) at the same level of positive end-expiratory pressure.

Measurements and Main Results

End-expiratory lung volume, lung diffusion for carbon monoxide, and SpO2/Fio2 were evaluated. Increasing pressure-support ventilation by 5 cm H2O significantly increased the mean tidal volume from 6.8 to 8.5 mL/kg of predicted body weight and decreased the mean respiratory rate by 6.6 breaths per minute. Although SpO2/Fio2 did not change significantly, there was a slight but significant decrease in lung diffusion for carbon monoxide (average decay rate of 4.5%) at high pressure-support ventilation. The pressure-support ventilation level did not significantly affect end-expiratory lung volume (1737 ± 629 mL at 9.6 ± 2.5 cm H2O pressure-support ventilation level vs. 1749 ± 657 mL at 14.9 ± 2.1 cm H2O pressure-support ventilation level).

Conclusions

A 5-cm H2O increase in pressure-support ventilation neither affected end-expiratory lung volume nor increased the pulmonary volume participating in gas exchange. A target tidal volume closer to 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight than to 8 mL/kg during pressure-support ventilation was associated with better gas exchange.

General principles of biophysical computational models — biophysical computational models can be used for forward simulations of function or inverse identification of system structure and parameters. Forward models are described as useful for sensitivity analyses to evaluate the contribution of normal subject variability to imaging metrics to define a threshold for abnormal and can also predict emergent behavior after parameter changes at the cellular or tissue level. Inverse models are described as useful for deriving information that cannot be measured directly, including distributions of airway or vascular obstruction that produce specific V˙A/Q˙ patterns. Both forward and inverse models can be used to analyze, interpret, and predict.

### Mechanistic exploration of polytetrafluoroethylene thermal plasma gasification through multiscale simulation coupled with experimental validation [^78d25c47]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Based on the evolution of product composition and the characterization of free radical reactions, we speculated that the whole reaction process of PTFE thermal plasma degradation in the presence of oxygen could be divided into five stages as follows. The main plausible reaction pathways in II–IV stages were shown in Fig. 3B.
(I) Heating stage: in the first 54 ps, there existed certain degrees of rotation of PTFE chain, changes in bond length and angle changes but no cleavage of bonds due to the limitations of Van Der Waals and coulomb forces.
(II) Chain initiation stage (pyrolysis): in the period between 54 ps and 58 ps, there may occur the homolytic cleavage of intramolecular C–C bonds in PTFE and the activation of 3 O 2, resulting in the formation of PFC (C 15+) and 1 O 2 radicals. This hypothesis was consistent with the MD simulation results that the perfluorinated macromolecules (C 15+) began to form and gradually increased in this stage, and furthermore, was supported by DFT calculations. According to the DFT results (Fig. 4A), the Gibbs free energy for the C–C bond dissociation in C 8 F 18 molecular gradually declined from 60.43 kcal mol −1 to −96.14 kcal mol −1 as the temperature increase from 298.15 K to 3300 K. This result implied the rise in temperature could drive the pyrolysis reaction. After pyrolysis reaction, the Wiberg bond orders of C–C bonds in ·C 6 F 13 (IM1) and C 2 F 5 ·(IM2) were significantly lower than that of C 8 F 18 (Fig. 4A), which verified that the pyrolysis could weaken the C–C bond and initiate the subsequent carbon backbone shortening. Fig. 4 DFT calculation results on relative energy and structure changes, energy barriers and Wiberg bond order of C–C bond (the red letters) for the two reaction processes. A The pyrolysis of C 8 F 18, B the oxidation of C 6 F 13 ⋅ and release of ⋅CF 2 O 2 from C 6 F 13 OO⋅. calculated by DFT. The color codes for the atoms are red: C, violet: F, yellow: O. represents the energy barrier in standard state (298.15 K, 1 atm). *Indicates the transition state. r represents the energy and enthalpic barrier in reaction state (3300 K, 1 atm). The energies are expressed in units of kilocalories per mole.
(III) Chain transfer stage (oxidation and chain-shortening): the macromolecular PFCs gradually degraded to micromolecular PFCs (C 1–3) through two main possible ways in the period between 58 ps to 75 ps. One way was that PFC radicals react with 1 O 2 /O radicals to produce peroxyl radicals (such as CF 3 (CF 2) n OO·), followed by the stepwise reduction of carbon chain through iterative emissions of C 2 F 4, CF 2 O 2 · and COF 2. The other way was random scission of C–C bonds, similar to that of stage (II). This hypothesis of dual-path PFCs degradation pathway could explain the rapid increase of the micromolecular PFCs (C 1–3) and the existence of PFCs or perfluoro- peroxyl radicals with C 11 -C 20 in this stage, which was also demonstrated by DFT calculation (Fig. 4B). DFT calculations suggested that the addition of 1 O 2 (single-state) to C 6 F 13 · resulted in the formation of peroxyl radicals (C 6 F 13 OO·(double-state)) via a binding energy of 48.93 kcal mol −1 at 3300 K (even lower at temperatures < 3300 K). After that, the Wiberg bond order of the C–C bond at α location away from the OO· group decreased from 0.53 to 0.40, suggesting the higher probability for cleavage. The following DFT calculation presented that CF 2 O 2 · (singlet-state) (IM7) released from C 6 F 13 OO· was a barrier-less, endothermic reaction at 3300 K, with an accessible activation energy barrier of 59.82 kcal mol −1. These results implied that the reaction with 1 O 2 radicals could activate the PFC intermediate and then trigger subsequent carbon-chain shortening reactions, which provided theoretical proof for the facilitating effect of O 2 for the defluorination of PTFE. The follow-up disassociation of C 5 F 11 · (IM8 → C 3 F 7 · + C 2 F 4) (Supplementary Fig. 2), C 3 F 7 ·(IM9 → CF 3 · + C 2 F 4) (Supplementary Fig. 2), and C 2 F 5 ·(IM2 → ·CF 3 + :CF 2) (Fig. 4A) were calculated to have a very low Gibbs free energies of −140.21 kcal mol −1, −94.92 kcal mol −1, and −70.58 kcal mol −1 at 3300 K, indicating the high possibility of random scission of C–C bonds of PFCs in this stage. Briefly, these DFT results supplied theoretical support for the oxidative chain scission pathway and pyrolysis chain scission pathway in this stage.
(IV) Chain termination stage (deep defluorination): in the period between 75 ps to 265 ps, there were numerous intermolecular radical reactions among 1 O 2 /O radicals, peroxyl radicals, PFC radicals and alkene to produce more stable micromolecular species (COF 2, C 2 F 4, F, F 2, CO 2). This speculation could explain the MD simulation results that the end mineralization products gradually predominate in the products and the mineralization rate (MR) (calculated by Eq. (5)) value increased to 80.6 wt.% at the end of this stage. There may exist the homolytic cleavage of C 2 F 4 to form:CF 2 radicals, the reaction of:CF 2 and O 2 to form CF 2 O, and the intermolecular reaction between CF 2 O to form CO 2 and CF 4. DFT calculations were conducted to assess the relative energy and structural changes for these reactions, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 2. The low Gibbs free energy barriers observed at 3300 K, along with supporting evidence from previous experimental research, verified the rationality of the speculation on the main pathway in this stage (Fig. 3B).
(V) Equilibrium stage: after 265 ps, the degradation process was almost completed. The sum of mass proportions of fluoro- C1 compounds, F·, F 2 and CO 2 kept above 90 wt.% and the MR value rose to 95.90 wt.% at 1000 ps. The time autocorrelation functions for temperature, pressure, and total energy, presented in exponential form, were also computed for this process (Supplementary Fig. 15C). Notably, all time autocorrelation functions dropped to 0.001 within 265 ps, verifying that the reaction system reaches equilibrium within 265 ps.

### Climate change and children's health: building a healthy future for every child [^da9ce071]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Causes of climate change — global greenhouse gas (GHG) trends and projected exposures for children are described: Human-generated GHG emissions have become the predominant driver in shaping the earth's climate system; the primary human-generated GHGs are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, and halocarbons, and GHGs serve as a blanket over the earth, absorbing outgoing long-wave infrared radiation and warming the planet. Since the industrial revolution, the growth rate of CO2 atmospheric concentration has been exponential, reaching a level of 416 ppm as of July 2021; since 1750, CO2 concentration has increased by nearly 50%, methane by more than 160%, and nitrous oxide by 23%, a rate of growth unprecedented in 66 million years. Between 1959 and 2019, fossil fuels accounted for 81% of total emissions and land use for 19%; current CO2 concentration is higher than at any point in at least 3 million years, well before Homo sapiens evolved approximately 300 000 years ago. Future emissions will cause further warming, with each additional temperature rise resulting in more frequent and intense extremes in heat, heavy precipitation, and drought, and children born in 2020 will be exposed to an estimated twofold to sevenfold increase in extreme events, most notably heat waves, relative to people born in 1960, with exposures increasing with greater warming.

### School-aged children who are not progressing academically: considerations for pediatricians [^fed096dc]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Academic progress difficulties in school-aged children — summary recommendations state: Pediatricians should take an active role in the prevention, early identification, diagnosis, and treatment of academic progress problems, and to this end, pediatricians should be knowledgeable of relevant AAP resources that allow them to effectively manage the care of school-aged children who are not progressing academically. Care coordination for children who are not progressing academically should take place in the context of the child's medical home, and team-based care must include the pediatrician, specialists, and other health and human services professionals and families, regardless of the location of, or source of payment for, these services. Payment for all the activities, including non– face-to-face visits and coordination required to provide high-quality care to children who are not progressing academically, should be considered by payers. Pediatricians need to understand the rights that all children in the United States have to receive a free and appropriate public education, including those with learning disabilities, developmental disabilities, and chronic health conditions, and understanding these rights allows pediatricians to most effectively support families as they advocate for evaluations and interventions in the public school. Pediatricians should be familiar with the AAP clinical report on IDEA30 so that they are familiar with the law, the processes, and the challenges of the IDEA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Considerations when choosing an approach to evaluation need to include the depth of evaluation necessary, the complexity of the intervention that will be required, the resource costs to families for the various options, and the level of coverage by insurance plan(s) for the recommended evaluations. Pediatricians can most effectively serve their patients by establishing relationships with colleagues who can conduct further diagnostic evaluations when a school-aged child is not progressing academically, including subspecialists (such as developmental-behavioral pediatricians, neurologists, physiatrists, and child and adolescent psychiatrists), psychologists, neuropsychologists, allied health professionals (such as occupational, physical, and speech therapists), and school nurses. Pediatricians can develop an understanding of the different goals of evaluations to guide families to the most appropriate resources. Pediatricians should understand that the purpose of school psychology evaluations is to determine eligibility for education supports, and the purpose of evaluations by psychologists and neuropsychologists is to determine diagnoses and interventions. In schools, interventions are determined by the goals and objectives written in IEPs or 504 plans. Pediatricians may take an active role in the initiation, development, and implementation of IEPs and 504 plans when applicable.

### Dynamics of end expiratory lung volume after changing positive end-expiratory pressure in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients [^054fe02c]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lung recruitment maneuvers followed by an individually titrated positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) are the key components of the open lung ventilation strategy in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The staircase recruitment maneuver is a step-by-step increase in PEEP followed by a decremental PEEP trial. The duration of each step is usually 2 minutes without physiologic rationale.

Methods

In this prospective study, we measured the dynamic end-expiratory lung volume changes (ΔEELV) during an increase and decrease in PEEP to determine the optimal duration for each step. PEEP was progressively increased from 5 to 40 cmH2O and then decreased from 40 to 5 cmH2O in steps of 5 cmH2O every 2.5 minutes. The dynamic of ΔEELV was measured by direct spirometry as the difference between inspiratory and expiratory tidal volumes over 2.5 minutes following each increase and decrease in PEEP. ΔEELV was separated between the expected increased volume, calculated as the product of the respiratory system compliance by the change in PEEP, and the additional volume.

Results

Twenty-six early onset moderate or severe ARDS patients were included. Data are expressed as median [25th-75th quartiles]. During the increase in PEEP, the expected increased volume was achieved within 2[2–2] breaths. During the decrease in PEEP, the expected decreased volume was achieved within 1 [1–1] breath, and 95% of the additional decreased volume was achieved within 8 [2–15] breaths. Completion of volume changes in 99% of both increase and decrease in PEEP events required 29 breaths.

Conclusions

In early ARDS, most of the ΔEELV occurs within the first minute, and change is completed within 2 minutes, following an increase or decrease in PEEP.

To determine the binding preferences of each COF for perfluorinated gases relative to N 2, Ar, H 2, and O 2, we calculated the isosteric heats of adsorption (Q st) for C 3 F 8, c-C 4 F 8, N 2, Ar, H 2, and O 2 using the virial fitting method based on the adsorption isotherms (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Figs. 32–37). Due to the relatively low adsorption amounts of Ar, H 2, and O 2, which resulted in unreasonable fitting parameters, these gases are excluded from the analysis. At near-zero coverage, CPOF-6 exhibited Q st values of 37.2 kJ mol −1 for C 3 F 8 and 33.6 kJ mol −1 for c-C 4 F 8, while CPOF-7 showed slightly lower Q st values of 28.7 kJ mol −1 and 28.9 kJ mol −1, respectively. Notably, the Q st values for N 2 on CPOF-6 and CPOF-7 were significantly lower, at 9.0 kJ mol −1 and 11.9 kJ mol −1, respectively, compared to those for perfluorinated gases. These results suggest that the introduction of fluorine functional groups through pore surface engineering can effectively enhance the adsorption affinity for perfluorinated gases.

### Circadian humidity fluctuation induced capillary flow for sustainable mobile energy [^adb23b77]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

In recent years, several drop-based generators that convert liquid moving –, such as droplet spreading, falling, bouncing, or dragging, into small-scale electricity have been introduced with different advantages. In one case, organic or water drop moving on graphene could output a voltage of a few millivolts due to the so-called drawing potential effect, which depends on the motion velocity. In another case, a strategy containing impinging water drops that spread over a polytetrafluoroethylene film was designed to harvest hydraulic power with low water. In addition, a liquid–liquid triboelectric nanogenerator on the basis of drop falling across liquid membrane is also fabricated with ultra-high charge collection efficiency. These works use dynamic drops, such as rains, to harvest instantaneous electric power and indicate promising prospects of drop-based generators.

Daily humidity fluctuation is the cyclical variations of air humidity, a universal natural phenomenon ongoing all over the world –. In this work, we demonstrate that small humidity fluctuation in the air is able to trigger capillary flow within static ionic liquid (IL) drops and continuously outputs electric power, a different power generation mechanism from previous works –. When a fluid is placed on solid surfaces, the fluid wets the solid with an equilibrium contact angle (CA) θ C, defined by the Young's equation –. Our design is such that a well-shaped fluid drop containing IL (1-Octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride), selected due to negligible evaporation losses alongside their large moisture absorption/desorption capability when exposed to air, is pinned on poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) nanowire array with certain CA (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). The nanowire array, with the diameter of ~90 nm and length of ~2 μm, was chemically modified to enhance surface charge. Electrode (diameter of ~800 μm) was fixed respectively to both center and edge at the bottom of the drop to collect the power. Our concept for integrating IL drop with humidity fluctuation to generate electricity is based on the following hypothesis: (1) moisture absorption/desorption within IL drop would cause directional flow along solid/liquid interfaces, (2) such flow would induce a potential difference due to ion re-distribution.

### An internet-based program to improve self-management in adolescents with type 1 diabetes [^18e79eca]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Adolescents with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive usual care or usual care plus Internet-based problem-solving self-management support. Eligible participants within the Vanderbilt Eskind Pediatric Diabetes Clinic were 13–17 years, had Internet access, were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for at least 6 months, spoke English, and had no disabilities that precluded understanding website content.

Between July and November 2008, participants were block randomized at 2:1 to the intervention group in sets of six. Condition was revealed by the research assistant opening a sealed envelope, generated by the principal investigator. The study was approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board, and parental consent and adolescent assent were obtained at study initiation.

Intervention

Intervention components were designed based on learning, social-cognitive, and self-determination theories. A multidisciplinary team of diabetes professionals and young patients wrote and edited website content. During 11 weeks, six multimedia stories depicted psychosocial barriers to self-management (e.g. time pressure, competing demands, and embarrassment) and approaches to coping and problem solving. Participants were prompted twice to complete problem-solving cycles for personal barriers to self-management. Other activities included 1) a personalized homepage, 2) multimedia presentations on the steps of problem solving and how to use the website, 3) social networking via a peer forum, 4) social comparison of their responses compared with other adolescents, 5) help from a problem-solving expert, and 6) weekly emails that encouraged participation. Participants had no interactions with diabetes clinicians or parents through the YourWay website.

Measures

A1C corresponding to baseline visit and the most recent A1C after the intervention period were collected from medical records. Behavioral measures were administered at baseline and 12 weeks. Adherence was assessed using the Diabetes Behavior Rating Scale. Problem solving was measured by the Diabetes Problem Solving Behaviors scale, a novel 27-item self-report scale that assesses frequencies of problem-solving behaviors associated with diabetes self-management. Internal consistency of this scale was adequate within this study (Cronbach's α = 0.89).

Intervention participants reported their perceptions of the stories after viewing each (responses: 1 = worst to 5 = best). A semi-structured telephone interview with intervention participants assessed technical barriers, satisfaction, and the extent of parent interactions with the adolescent.

c 50/50 ratio at 1 bar and 293 K as calculated by IAST.

Uptake ratios provide a useful indication of the preference of an adsorbent for certain gases over others. For MUF-16, the CO 2 /CH 4 uptake ratio is 39.8 (293 K and 1 bar). This is comparable to [Cd 2 L(H 2 O)] (42.9)and exceeded by only one other reported material (SIFSIX-14-Cu-i, 85) (Supplementary Table 10). Typical physisorbents show a preference for unsaturated hydrocarbons over CO 2, especially when bonding between the guest's π electrons and open metal sites can occur. However, MUF-16 exhibits a uniform preference for CO 2 over all C2 and C3 hydrocarbons at 293 K and 1 bar (Table 1). Here, the uptake ratios fall between 12 (acetylene), 15.6 (ethane) and 8.9 (propene). While the limited uptake of CH 4 is a well-established function of its small size and low polarizability, the low affinity of MUF-16 for larger and more polar/polarizable hydrocarbon guests is notable. Inverted selectivity of this kind, that is, a preference for CO 2 over small hydrocarbons, is a sought after yet seldom reported phenomenon. With an uptake ratio of 12, MUF-16 surpasses previously reported materials that preferentially adsorb CO 2 over C 2 H 2, including SIFSIX-3-Ni (1.2 at 298 K and 0.1 bar), CD-MOF-2 (1.3 at 298 K and 1 bar), K 2 [Cr 3 O(OOCH) 6 (4‐ethylpyridine) 3] 2 [α‐SiW 12 O 40] (4.5 at 278 K and 1 bar), [Mn(bdc)(dpe)] (6.4 at 273 K and 1 bar)and [Tm 2 (OH-bdc) 2 (μ 3 - OH) 2 (H 2 O) 2](2.8 at 298 K and 1 bar) (Supplementary Table 11). The diminished affinity of MUF-16 for C 2 H 2 results from the reversed quadrupole moment of this guest vis-à-vis CO 2 (Supplementary Fig. S10). Since C 2 H 2 is polarised oppositely to CO 2 it is electrostatically repelled by the functional groups that line binding pockets in MUF-16. The upshot is inverse selectivity for CO 2 over acetylene.

### A contorted nanographene shelter [^98b7c8a8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The changes in the absorption spectra induced by the formation of the host-guest complexes afford us an easy way to track the molecular recognition processes. The Job plots for 3H-HBC (Supplementary Fig. 48), 3Me-HBC (Supplementary Fig. 51), and 3F-HBC (Supplementary Fig. 54) with TPACage 6+ all show maxima at mole fractions of 0.5, confirming a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 for all three complexes. The binding affinities between TPACage 6+ and the different c -HBC guests were determined by UV-Vis titrations. The K a value for the 3H-HBC⊂TPACage 6+ complex was determined (Supplementary Fig. 47) to be 1.7 × 10 5 M −1 by following the change in absorbance at 487 nm. The Gibbs free energy (Δ G) was calculated (Table 1) to be −7.1 kcal mol −1, a value which is more negative than that (−4.2 kcal mol −1) for COR⊂TPACage 6+ complex. It follows that the better the size matching between the host and guests, the stronger are the binding affinities. Because of the poor solubility of 3H-HBC in MeCN/CHCl 3 (4:1), it is difficult to obtain the K a value for the 3H-HBC⊂TPACage 6+ complex using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The change in enthalpy (Δ H) on complexing 3H-HBC within TPACage 6+ was estimated (Supplementary Fig. 62) to be −3.2 kcal mol −1 from an isotherm obtained from a single injection experiment. The value of T Δ S was calculated (Table 1) to be 3.9 kcal mol −1, while the change in entropy (Δ S) is 13.1 cal mol −1 K −1. The increase in the entropy upon forming the 3H-HBC⊂TPACage 6+ complex can be attributed most likely to the desolvation of the guest and the expulsion of solvent molecules originally residing inside the cavity of the TPACage 6+, a phenomenon similar to that observed in previous reports. Using the same procedures, the K a values for the 3Me-HBC⊂TPACage 6+ (Supplementary Fig. 50) and the 3F-HBC⊂TPACage 6+ (Supplementary Fig. 53) complexes were determined to be 2.4 × 10 5 and 8.0 × 10 4 M −1, respectively. The Δ H values for the formation of 3Me-HBC⊂TPACage 6+ (Supplementary Fig. 63) and 3F-HBC⊂TPACage 6+ (Supplementary Fig. 64) were estimated to be −3.5 and −2.4 kcal mol −1 by ITC, and the corresponding T Δ S values were calculated to be 3.8 and 4.3 kcal mol −1, respectively. It follows that the formation of the c -HBC⊂TPACage 6+ complexes is driven collectively by favorable entropy and enthalpy changes. The binding constants and enthalpy changes between the c -HBC guests and TPACage 6+ are arranged in the order 3Me-HBC > 3H-HBC > 3F-HBC, indicating that, as the electron density of the guests increases, the binding affinities between the host and guests become stronger in the solution state. The kinetics associated with the encapsulations of the c -HBC guests by the TPACage 6+ can be obtainedby following the change in absorbance with time. The association rate constants (k on) for TPACage 6+ with 3H-HBC, 3Me-HBC, and 3F-HBC were found (Supplementary Figs. 59 −61) to be 7.2 × 10 6, 2.6 × 10 6, and 3.2 × 10 6 M −1 s −1, respectively. These k on values indicate that, as the size of the guests increases, the rates of association between the TPACage 6+ and the c -HBC guests decrease.

The narrative states, "The AAP believes DDH fulfills most of these screening criteria (Table 1), except for an understanding of the natural history of hip dysplasia and an agreed-on policy of whom to treat", and reiterates, "A reasonable goal for screening is to prevent the late presentation of DDH after 6 months of age".

### Ventilator gas delivery wave form substantially impacts plateau pressure and peak-to-plateau pressure gradient determination [^fcde97a8]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

To determine whether plateau pressure (Pplat) measurement is lowered and peak airway pressure (Pawpeak)-to-Plat gradient is increased by measurement on a decelerating compared with square gas delivery wave form.

Methods

Prospective before and after study of mechanically ventilated injured and critically ill patients in an adult surgical intensive care unit. Pplat, Pawpeak, and Pawpeak-to-Pplat gradient were measured on decelerating and square gas delivery wave forms.

Results

Pplat and other routine ventilator parameters were measured in 82 (47 trauma, 35 emergency general surgery) consecutive convenience sampled adult intensive care unit patients on decelerating and then square gas delivery wave forms. Peak gas flow was fixed at 40 L/min; all other parameters (rate, tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure) were held constant. All patients were managed on assist control volume cycled ventilation using fentanyl and midazolam or propofol; no neuromuscular blockade was used. Patients with Pawpeak more than 35 cm H2O were excluded. Comparing decelerating with square gas delivery, mean Pawpeak was lower (25.1 ± 2.3 cm H2O vs. 33.1 ± 2.1 cm H2O; p < 0.0001) and mean Pplat was lower (21.3 ± 1.9 cm H2O vs. 24.8 ± 2.5 cm H2O; p < 0.0001), resulting in a decreased Pawpeak-to-Pplat gradient (3.8 ± 2.1 vs. 8.3 ± 2.3; p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Changing from a decelerating to a square gas delivery wave form significantly increases Pplat and Pawpeak, thereby increasing the Pawpeak-to-Pplat gradient. This increase may prompt unwarranted therapy aimed at reducing the gradient to its normal value of 4 cm H2O pressure or less. Conversely, patients with a high Pawpeak on a square wave form may benefit from transitioning to a decelerating wave form before changing ventilation parameters.
