## Question

Alchalasia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about achalasia management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic pathway and how to confirm achalasia with high-resolution manometry and the Chicago Classification. Then, I should verify the prognostic implications of subtypes and how they guide therapy. Next, I will examine the comparative efficacy and safety of POEM, LHM, and PD, and reconcile guideline nuances. After that, I need to tailor treatment choices by subtype and patient factors, including special populations. Finally, I should confirm post-treatment follow-up, reflux management, and salvage strategies, and close with a concise, subtype-driven algorithm that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic approach, because anchoring on the wrong diagnosis will derail everything. Suspect achalasia in dysphagia to solids and liquids with regurgitation or chest pain, especially when endoscopy is unrevealing and PPIs fail, and then proceed to high-resolution manometry as the criterion standard to confirm impaired EGJ relaxation with absent organized peristalsis and to classify subtypes I, II, or III per the Chicago Classification, with endoscopy primarily to exclude pseudoachalasia and a timed barium esophagram or FLIP as adjuncts when needed [^111xBr4R] [^111rrdkb] [^111bUdd5] [^111UPS7L].

> Wait, let me verify the prognostic weight of subtypes before jumping to treatment. Type II achalasia consistently has the best outcomes across modalities, type I is intermediate, and type III is the most challenging with lower response to LES-only therapies. This subtype gradient is supported by multiple series and underpins phenotype-guided therapy, so I should not ignore it when counseling patients.

> Next, I should review comparative efficacy of definitive therapies. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from single-center series. Network meta-analyses of randomized trials suggest POEM and LHM have comparable 1-year success and both outperform PD, with POEM often ranked highest but not statistically superior to LHM, and with moderate heterogeneity and risk of bias across trials, so I need to communicate uncertainty while emphasizing the trend favoring myotomy-based strategies [^116ySYLY] [^116Hezgb] [^112gXqjm].

> I need to check safety profiles and trade-offs carefully. POEM may have fewer serious adverse events than LHM or PD in some analyses, but it carries a higher risk of post-procedural reflux and erosive esophagitis, whereas PD has lower adverse event rates but lower durability and a need for serial redilations. This means GERD risk counseling and reflux surveillance are integral to POEM decision-making and follow-up [^116Hezgb] [^116ySYLY] [^116V1vBt].

> Now, let me align with guideline positions, and I should double-check for any apparent contradictions. ASGE 2020 recommends offering PD, LHM, or POEM for types I–II based on shared decision-making and local expertise, and to consider POEM as preferred for type III; ACG 2020 similarly supports PD or LHM as effective and equivalent options for suitable candidates and highlights subtype-directed therapy, including POEM for type III; AGA 2024 reiterates offering POEM, LHM, or PD for types I–II and preferring POEM for type III, which reconciles earlier guidance with evolving evidence [^116oGPr2] [^1148VRvK] [^114xmguh] [^116xBUPw].

> For type I or II achalasia, I should confirm that all three definitive options are reasonable and that the choice hinges on patient preference, anatomy, prior interventions, and center expertise. POEM and LHM have comparable efficacy and both outperform PD on average, yet PD remains appropriate, particularly with graded protocols and the option for redilation; shared decision-making should explicitly weigh reflux risk with POEM, durability with LHM, and the possibility of repeat interventions with PD [^116ySYLY] [^116Hezgb] [^115cCguZ].

> For type III achalasia, let me reconsider whether extended myotomy truly changes outcomes. Given the spastic component beyond the LES, POEM with a longer myotomy or a tailored Heller myotomy yields superior symptom relief compared with PD, and guidelines converge on POEM as the preferred first-line approach when available. I should counsel that while success is higher than in historical PD cohorts, reflux risk remains and must be managed proactively [^113zqNBT] [^116xBUPw] [^112YgyUR].

> I should confirm the role of botulinum toxin and oral smooth muscle relaxants, and I need to ensure I am not overstating their place. Botulinum toxin can transiently reduce LES pressure and relieve symptoms in about two-thirds initially, but efficacy wanes by 6–12 months and repeated injections are often less effective; thus, guidelines reserve botulinum toxin for patients unfit for definitive therapy or as a bridge, and they discourage routine use of nitrates or calcium channel blockers for long-term management [^111PSFPF] [^114MyN9t] [^112koofC].

> But wait, what about special populations and scenarios. In older or high-risk patients, botulinum toxin may be a reasonable palliative option. In pediatrics, evidence is limited and many centers favor pneumatic dilation or surgical myotomy, avoiding botulinum toxin as first-line except in medically frail children. In patients with failed initial therapy, salvage with PD, redo myotomy, or crossover to POEM or LHM is appropriate, and esophagectomy is reserved for megaesophagus or end-stage disease after other options fail [^116SfyQx] [^1164a5Cp] [^114xLfp7].

> Next, I should review post-treatment follow-up and reflux surveillance, and I need to ensure I am not missing objective testing. After definitive therapy, assess symptomatic improvement and consider a timed barium esophagram to document emptying. Given elevated reflux risk after POEM and nontrivial risk after LHM, obtain objective acid exposure testing when indicated and offer long-term acid suppression with endoscopic surveillance based on patient preference and expertise, with a low threshold to evaluate recurrent symptoms using endoscopy, barium, manometry, and pH monitoring [^116eWVkN] [^112iTpBs].

> I will now examine salvage strategies for recurrence, and I should double-check that I am not prematurely recommending esophagectomy. For symptomatic recurrence, options include PD, redo myotomy by the same or alternative technique, or conversion between POEM and LHM depending on prior approach and anatomy; esophagectomy is a last resort for failed interventions with dilated, nonfunctional esophagus in surgically fit patients, ideally at high-volume centers [^115HTUne] [^1164a5Cp] [^1118U1CR].

> Let me synthesize a practical, subtype-driven algorithm, and I should confirm it aligns with the major guidelines. Suspected achalasia leads to endoscopy to exclude pseudoachalasia, then high-resolution manometry with Chicago Classification; types I–II are offered PD, LHM with partial fundoplication, or POEM with explicit reflux counseling, whereas type III is steered toward POEM or tailored Heller myotomy; throughout, incorporate patient values, comorbidities, and local expertise, and reserve botulinum toxin for those unfit for definitive therapy [^114t25UW] [^116oGPr2] [^116xBUPw].

> Finally, I should confirm quality-of-care touchpoints that reduce unwarranted variation. Use the Chicago Classification consistently, discuss risks, benefits, and uncertainties of each modality, employ graded pneumatic dilation protocols when PD is chosen, and ensure reflux surveillance pathways after myotomy. These steps are emphasized in quality indicators and contemporary guidelines and help standardize care across centers [^117NM1t5] [^115cCguZ] [^114Zh8w4].

Achalasia is a primary esophageal motility disorder defined by **impaired LES relaxation** and **absent peristalsis**, leading to progressive dysphagia, regurgitation, and weight loss. Diagnosis relies on **high-resolution manometry** (the gold standard) [^111bUdd5] [^111rrdkb], with supportive findings from barium esophagram and endoscopy [^111UPS7L]. Treatment is **palliative** and aims to lower LES pressure: options include POEM, laparoscopic Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication, and pneumatic dilation; POEM is preferred for type III achalasia, while all three are effective for types I–II [^116ySYLY] [^116xBUPw] [^112YgyUR]. botulinum toxin or oral agents are reserved for high-risk patients unfit for definitive therapy [^114MyN9t] [^113bHEEi]. Long-term monitoring is essential due to reflux risk and rare esophageal cancer; **surveillance endoscopy** is advised after 10–15 years [^115mAhee] [^114Zh8w4].

---

## Pathophysiology

Achalasia is characterized by **loss of inhibitory neurons** in the myenteric plexus, leading to impaired LES relaxation and absent peristalsis [^1166y8B4]. The etiology is unknown, but autoimmune and viral triggers are suspected [^115FMwQq].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical symptoms include:

- **Dysphagia**: to solids and liquids [^111xBr4R].
- **Regurgitation**: of undigested food [^114q9iEF].
- **Chest pain**: often retrosternal [^114q9iEF].
- **Weight loss**: from impaired intake [^113E1qay].

Symptoms may be misattributed to GERD, causing delays in diagnosis [^11463DFp].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Gold standard

High-resolution manometry (HRM) is the gold standard, showing incomplete LES relaxation with absent peristalsis and enabling Chicago Classification into types I–III [^111bUdd5] [^115q7DEk].

---

### Adjunctive tests

- **Barium esophagram**: bird-beak narrowing with retained barium [^111UPS7L].
- **Upper endoscopy**: excludes pseudoachalasia and shows dilated esophagus with food stasis [^111UPS7L].
- **FLIP**: assesses EGJ distensibility and can aid diagnosis [^111UPS7L].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment is **palliative**, aiming to reduce LES pressure and improve emptying [^116HPaNE].

| **Modality** | **Indication** | **Efficacy** | **Complications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| POEM | Types I–III; preferred in type III | 85–95% | Higher GERD; low serious AEs [^116Hezgb] [^116xBUPw] |
| LHM + partial fundoplication | Types I–II | 85–95% | Reflux; low leak risk [^114xmguh] |
| Pneumatic dilation | Types I–II | 70–90% | Perforation; reflux [^1127K2uC] |
| Botulinum toxin | High-risk/unfit patients | 50–70% (short-term) | Repeat injections; waning effect [^111PSFPF] |
| Oral agents (nitrates, CCBs) | Temporizing/unfit | Limited, short-lived | Headache, hypotension [^1165ALjE] |

---

POEM offers comparable efficacy to LHM and PD but with **higher GERD risk**; guidelines support POEM or LHM for types I–II and prefer POEM for type III [^116xBUPw] [^113jv1Vu].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

After treatment, **objective testing** (endoscopy, barium, manometry, pH) is recommended for recurrent symptoms [^112iTpBs]. GERD is common after POEM; long-term acid suppression and surveillance endoscopy are advised [^114Zh8w4]. Given the increased risk of esophageal cancer, **surveillance endoscopy** is recommended 10–15 years after diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by subtype: type II has the best response (> 90%), type I is intermediate, and type III has the lowest response; **early treatment** improves outcomes [^116UfcdQ] [^115q7DEk].

---

Achalasia is a chronic motility disorder with characteristic manometric findings; **HRM is central** to diagnosis and subtype classification. Definitive therapies (POEM, LHM, PD) are effective, with POEM favored in type III, while botulinum toxin or oral agents are reserved for high-risk patients. Lifelong follow-up is important due to reflux and cancer risk.

Currently there are three acceptable long-term treatments of achalasia: pneumatic dilatation, laparoscopic Heller myotomy, and botulinum toxin injection. Primarily retrospective studies suggest equal efficacy of pneumatic dilatation and surgical myotomy, especially in centers with expertise in both treatments. Randomized prospective studies find pneumatic dilatation superior to botulinum toxin because of the need for serial frequent treatments with the latter therapy. All cost analysis studies support the superiority of pneumatic dilatation over the two other treatments.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to discuss the efficacy, morbidity and side-effects of innovative management strategies for achalasia that include high-resolution manometry (HRM), pneumatic dilatation, laparoscopic Heller's myotomy (LHM), injection of botulinum toxin into the lower esophageal sphincter and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM).

Recent Findings

HRM has enabled identification of achalasia subtypes that have important prognostic implications. Pneumatic dilatation is a commonly-used and cost-effective method of treating achalasia but has shown poor longevity of symptom relief compared with other modalities and carries a risk of esophageal perforation. LHM is often the preferred, most effective treatment modality, however new studies may show that outcomes are equivalent or even inferior to POEM. Botulinum toxin injection of the lower esophageal sphincter has a waning and short duration of efficacy and is used primarily for patients unsuitable for more definitive invasive procedures. POEM is considered the most effective treatment for type III achalasia but carries a high risk of iatrogenic gastroesophageal reflux disease that might predispose to the development of Barrett's esophagus.

Summary

HRM and POEM are two major innovations in the management of achalasia developed over the past decade. There are now three major management options for patients with achalasia, namely pneumatic dilatation, LHM and POEM. Treatment selection should be tailored to the patient's individual esophageal physiology, physical fitness and dominant symptoms.

### Treatments for achalasia in 2017: how to choose among them [^112CQnGE]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent advances in achalasia diagnostics and therapeutics.

Recent Findings

The cardinal feature of achalasia, impaired lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation, can occur in association with varied patterns of esophageal contractility. The Chicago Classification distinguishes among these as follows: without contractility (type I), with panesophageal pressurization (type II), with premature (spastic) distal esophageal contractions (type III), or even with preserved peristalsis [esophagogastric junction (EGJ) outlet obstruction]. Physiological testing also reveals achalasia-like syndromes that also benefit from achalasia therapies. Coincident with this has been the development of peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), an endoscopic technique for performing an esophageal myotomy. Hence, the option now exists to either selectively ablate the LES (pneumatic dilation, laparoscopic Heller myotomy, or POEM) or to ablate the sphincter and create a myotomy along some or the entire adjacent smooth muscle esophagus (POEM). Each achalasia syndrome has unique treatment considerations; type II achalasia responds well to all therapies, whereas type III responds best to POEM.

Summary

Emerging data support the concept that optimal management of achalasia is phenotype-specific, guided by high-resolution manometry, and, in some instance, functional luminal imaging probe studies. This opinion article reviews the varied characteristic and treatment considerations of achalasia syndromes as currently understood.

### Whose patient is it? The path to multidisciplinary management of achalasia [^116FQszB]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

In the past decade, the introduction of high-resolution manometry and the classification of achalasia into subtypes has made possible to accurately diagnose the disease and predict the response to treatment for its different subtypes. However, even to date, in an era of exponential medical progress and increased insight in disease mechanisms, treatment of patients with achalasia is still rather simplistic and mostly confined to mechanical disruption of the lower esophageal sphincter by different means. In addition, there is partial consensus on what is the best form of available treatments for patients with achalasia. Herein, we provide a comprehensive outlook to a general approach to the patient with suspected achalasia by: 1) defining the modern evaluation process; 2) describing the diagnostic value of high-resolution manometry and the Chicago Classification in predicting treatment outcomes and 3) discussing the available treatment options, considering the patient conditions, alternatives available to both the surgeon and the gastroenterologist, and the burden to the health care system. It is our hope that such discussion will contribute to value-based management of achalasia through promoting a leaner clinical flow of patients at all points of care.

### ACG clinical guidelines: diagnosis and management of achalasia [^113bHEEi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Achalasia — pneumatic dilation (PD) vs medical therapy: We recommend that PD is superior to medical therapy in relieving symptoms and physiologic parameters of esophageal emptying; pharmacotherapy is less effective with shorter duration and poor benefit, and medical therapy is thus recommended only for patients who are not candidates for definitive therapies of PD, LHM, or POEM.

### Modern management of achalasia [^1133dRwJ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Achalasia is a chronic esophageal motility disorder characterized by incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation and aperistalsis resulting in delayed esophageal emptying. Management is aimed at palliation of symptoms and improvement in quality of life. Multiple factors including demographics, severity of disease, and existing comorbidities influence management options.

Recent Findings

Given its low rates of complications, surgical myotomy has become the preferred primary treatment, particularly in young males. However, recent studies describing favorable long-term outcomes for pneumatic dilation make this a reasonable option to consider as first-line therapy for achalasia.

Summary

Pneumatic dilation and surgical myotomy are the most effective therapeutic options for achalasia. Depending on local expertise, either option is acceptable as first-line therapy. There continues to be a limited role for other treatment modalities such as pharamacologic agents and botulinum toxin in certain patient populations.

### 2024 update to SAGES guidelines for the use of peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) in the treatment of achalasia [^117X125h]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

SAGES POEM guideline — intended use and scope state that these guidelines are primarily intended to aid clinicians in making decisions about management of patients diagnosed with achalasia and are also intended to educate, inform policy and advocacy and to define future research needs. Clinical decision making is multifaceted, and these guidelines are intended to suggest, but not mandate, an acceptable approach to management of achalasia, and they can also be used by patients as a basis of discussion with their treating surgeon.

### Treatment and surveillance strategies in achalasia: an update [^115mAhee]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Controversy exists with regard to the optimal treatment for achalasia and whether surveillance for early recognition of late complications is indicated. Currently, surgical myotomy and pneumatic dilation are the most effective treatments for patients with idiopathic achalasia, and a multicenter, randomized, international trial has confirmed similar efficacy of these treatments, at least in the short term. Clinical predictors of outcome, patient preferences and local expertise should be considered when making a decision on the most appropriate treatment option. Owing to a lack of long-term benefit, endoscopic botulinum toxin injection and medical therapies are reserved for patients of advanced age and those with clinically significant comorbidites. The value of new endoscopic, radiologic or surgical treatments, such as peroral endoscopic myotomy, esophageal stenting and robotic-assisted myotomy has not been fully established. Finally, long-term follow-up data in patients with achalasia support the notion that surveillance strategies might be beneficial after a disease duration of more than 10–15 years.

### Impact of high-resolution manometry on achalasia diagnosis and treatment [^114FvYVT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Impact on the treatment of achalasia

Since the underlying defect cannot be reversed, treatment of achalasia remains palliative. Therefore, the aim of all current therapies is the improvement in esophageal food passage by reducing the distal esophageal obstruction. Such improvement will lead to symptomatic relief of dysphagia, regurgitation, as well as weight gain.

This goal can be achieved by pharmacologic therapy; endoscopic treatment with pneumatic dilation (PD) or botulinum toxin (BOTOX) injection; or surgery. Recently, new therapeutic options such as stent implantation or peroral endoscopic myotomy have been reported. However, the efficacy of these treatment options varies and the recommendation for the best therapy is still controversial. Although PD and Heller myotomy seem to be the most effective treatments for achalasia, until now the choice of treatment modality primarily depended on multiple factors, such as patients' characteristics, clinical presentation, local expertise, and patient's preference. In the past, CM criteria for high recurrence rates after PD have been defined. These include younger age, male gender, and LES > 10 mmHg post-dilation. However, some patients do not have a good response either to endoscopic or to operative approaches, whereas others remain symptom-free for more than 10 years after a single PD. Therefore other factors might play a role in the therapeutic success.

The new HREPT subclassification of achalasia distinguishes separate clinical phenotypes that might help predict response to therapy. This scheme is supported by 5 retrospective studies. Table 3 shows a summary of the published studies showing different treatment responses in patients with the 3 achalasia subtypes.

Table 3
Summary studies demonstrating the different treatment results based on the achalasia subclassification

The study by Pandolfino et al inaugurated the 3 subtypes of achalasia based on HREPT results and linked them to clinical outcomes. The authors found that type II patients were significantly most likely to respond to any therapy, such as BOTOX [71%], PD [91%], or Heller myotomy [100%]. In contrast, treatment response was lower for type I (56% overall) or type III (29% overall) patients. Logistic regression analysis found type II to be a predictor of positive treatment response, whereas type III predicted the poorest treatment response to all types of therapy.

### Esophageal achalasia: evaluation and treatment of recurrent symptoms [^116HPaNE]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Esophageal achalasia is a primary esophageal motility disorder of unknown origin. Treatment is palliative and its goal is to decrease the resistance posed by a non-relaxing and often hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter. This goal can be accomplished by different treatment modalities such as pneumatic dilatation, laparoscopic myotomy or peroral endoscopic myotomy. In some patients, however, symptoms tend to recur overtime.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed focused on the management of recurrent achalasia.

Results

The available treatment modalities can be used, alone or in combination. The goal of treatment is to resolve/improve symptoms, avoiding an esophagectomy, an operation linked to significant morbidity.

Conclusions

The treatment of these patients is often very challenging, and the best results are obtained in centers where a multidisciplinary team-radiologists, gastroenterologists, and surgeons-is present.

Regarding specific circumstances for achalasia, more specifically with respect to patients with other spastic motility disorders, ESGE 2020 guidelines recommend to do not use botulinum toxin injections routinely for the treatment of patients with non-achalasia hypercontractile esophageal motility disorders (Jackhammer esophagus, distal esophageal spasm). Administer injections into 4 quadrants of the lower esophageal sphincter and in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus in individual patients, if endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin is chosen.

### Esophageal achalasia: pros and cons of the treatment options [^112Lh6nS]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the choice of treatment for achalasia is multifactorial, and a "one size fits all" approach is not appropriate. All treatments and all patients have various aspects that need to be examined thoroughly before opting for one treatment rather than another. A center specializing in achalasia should have all possible techniques in its armamentarium so that it can choose the most appropriate treatment for a given patient.

### Surgical and endoscopic interventions in the management of idiopathic achalasia [^115oA1N5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (intervention). The objectives are as follows:

To assess the benefits and harms of endoscopic and surgical interventions for idiopathic achalasia, including pneumatic dilation, laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM), and per‐oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), using pairwise meta‐analyses for direct comparisons and network meta‐analysis for integrating direct and indirect comparisons.

### Achalasia: should pneumatic dilation be the primary treatment strategy? [^116sUbYk]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

The best long-term treatment results for patients with idiopathic achalasia have been achieved with pneumatic dilation or surgical myotomy. A new study adds evidence that good or excellent symptomatic results can be achieved in the long term when pneumatic dilation is used as the primary treatment strategy. In cases of early treatment failure (< 2 years), surgery was found to be the best rescue therapy.

### ACG clinical guidelines: diagnosis and management of achalasia [^111UPS7L]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Achalasia — key concept statements for diagnosis and treatment highlight that timed barium esophagram showing retained barium and bird beaking in the appropriate clinical presentation may be diagnostic of achalasia, and endoscopic signs of dilated esophagus with retained saliva and food with puckered and tight gastroesophageal junction to the passage of endoscope should raise clinical suspicion for achalasia; functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP) can be complementary in the evaluation of patients with achalasia before and after treatment; patients with suspected achalasia based on clinical presentation should always undergo upper endoscopy to rule-out pseudoachalasia from an obstructing mass; pharmacologic therapy in achalasia should be reserved for those who cannot undergo definitive therapy and have failed botulinum toxin injection; and serial pneumatic dilation is the most effective non-surgical treatment option for patients with achalasia.

### Management strategies for achalasia [^112hDUqm]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment options for achalasia include oral pharmacologic therapy, endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin, pneumatic dilation, and myotomy (conventionally by laparoscopy, but more recently by an endoscopic approach). Oral pharmacologic agents have fallen out of use because of insufficient efficacy and frequent side effects. Endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin is safe and has good short-term effectiveness, but as the effect invariably wears off after a few months, this treatment is reserved for patients who are not candidates for more definitive treatments. Pneumatic dilation and surgical myotomy are currently considered the most effective treatments, with similar effectiveness in randomized controlled trials with follow-up of up to 2 years. The risk/benefit ratio and choice of therapy depend on patient characteristics (age, comorbidities, disease stage, prior treatments), patient's preference, and locally available expertise. Treatment of patients who fail or relapse after initial therapy is challenging and the success rate of pneumatic dilation or myotomy in this group is lower compared with previously untreated patients. The recently developed peroral endoscopic approach to myotomy has achieved excellent results in early uncontrolled studies, but high-quality randomized trials are needed to ensure widespread adoption is reasonable. Finally, retrospective data suggest that achalasia subtypes as defined by high-resolution esophageal pressure topography may guide treatment choice, but confirmation in prospective outcome studies is awaited.

### Comparative efficacy of first-line therapeutic interventions for achalasia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111U9kpH]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Treatment choice for achalasia represents a common challenge and a matter of debate in clinical practice. Though definitive endoscopic or surgical interventions have been studied, there has been limited synthesis of data on the comparative efficacy of these treatments, in particular since the development of POEM. Through a network meta-analysis, and using GRADE criteria to appraise quality of evidence, we made several key observations on the comparative efficacy and safety of these interventions. First, POEM and LHM may be more effective than PD, and comparable to each other, in decreasing achalasia-related symptoms at 1 year. Second, the risk of GERD was higher with POEM as compared to PD or LHM, but the risk of severe erosive esophagitis was low across all interventions. Overall risk of serious adverse events including perforation was lower with POEM as compared to PD or LHM.

Findings from this meta-analysis combined with consideration of relevant clinical factors can help guide clinicians and patients on treatment selection. Achalasia subtype is well established as critical prognostic factor. While we were unable to compare therapeutic efficacy across achalasia subtypes, prior experiences and studies suggest that efficacy in type III achalasia is greater following POEM with a proximal extended esophageal myotomy compared to LHM without extended myotomy or PD, due to the ability to treat not only the lower esophageal sphincter but also the spasticity in the distal esophageal smooth muscle. As such, the ASGE 2020 guideline on the management of achalasia, the American College of Gastroenterology 2020 guideline for Achalasia, as well as the Best Practice Advice from the American Gastroenterological Association Institute in 2017 recommend POEM as the preferred treatment for management of type III achalasia.

### Achalasia: a systematic review [^116UfcdQ]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Achalasia significantly affects patients' quality of life and can be difficult to diagnose and treat.

Objective

To review the diagnosis and management of achalasia, with a focus on phenotypic classification pertinent to therapeutic outcomes.

Evidence Review

Literature review and MEDLINE search of articles from January 2004 to February 2015. A total of 93 articles were included in the final literature review addressing facets of achalasia epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. Nine randomized controlled trials focusing on endoscopic or surgical therapy for achalasia were included (734 total patients).

Findings

A diagnosis of achalasia should be considered when patients present with dysphagia, chest pain, and refractory reflux symptoms after an endoscopy does not reveal a mechanical obstruction or an inflammatory cause of esophageal symptoms. Manometry should be performed if achalasia is suspected. Randomized controlled trials support treatments focused on disrupting the lower esophageal sphincter with pneumatic dilation (70%-90% effective) or laparoscopic myotomy (88%-95% effective). Patients with achalasia have a variable prognosis after endoscopic or surgical myotomy based on subtypes, with type II (absent peristalsis with abnormal pan-esophageal high-pressure patterns) having a very favorable outcome (96%) and type I (absent peristalsis without abnormal pressure) having an intermediate prognosis (81%) that is inversely associated with the degree of esophageal dilatation. In contrast, type III (absent peristalsis with distal esophageal spastic contractions) is a spastic variant with less favorable outcomes (66%) after treatment of the lower esophageal sphincter.

Conclusions and Relevance

Achalasia should be considered when dysphagia is present and not explained by an obstruction or inflammatory process. Responses to treatment vary based on which achalasia subtype is present.

SAGES guidelines — conclusion and preference statement — report that the desirable outcomes for POEM were judged to be moderate in effect size and undesirable outcomes and effects small; thus, the panel suggests the use of POEM over PD, and appropriate use of PPIs when required. Decision-making should also account for health equity and a patient's comorbidities, and if inequities present a barrier to accessing definitive management for achalasia, clear pathways need to be established to ensure patients receive the standard of care.

Patients with achalasia often present with atypical symptoms. If these occur in the context of "normal" morphological findings, the diagnosis may be delayed for several years. However, a careful interview and the use of modern methods that concentrate on pathophysiologic aspects always allow an early diagnosis and the initiation of therapy that affects most but rarely all symptoms. Finally, regardless of whether this therapy remains partially or totally effective, patients require some follow-up since serious and late complications may occur.

### Current diagnosis and management of achalasia [^113E1qay]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Achalasia is the best characterized primary esophageal motility disorder of the esophagus and typically presents with absent peristalsis of the esophageal body and a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax upon swallowing on manometry, associated with progressively severe dysphagia, regurgitation, aspiration, chest pain, and weight loss. The diagnosis is suggested by barium swallow and endoscopy, and confirmed by manometry. As there is no curative treatment for achalasia, treatment is confined to disruption of the lower esophageal sphincter to improve bolus passage. Treatment modalities available for this purpose include pneumatic dilation, laparoscopic Heller myotomy and since recently peroral endoscopic myotomy or POEM. In this review, we will discuss the current diagnosis, management, and treatment options of achalasia.

### Comparative efficacy of first-line therapeutic interventions for achalasia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112gXqjm]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

There are certain limitations, related to both the network meta-analysis as well as individual studies, which merit further discussion. The studies had a short duration of follow-up, and the primary outcome of this network meta-analysis was focused on short-term (1-year) success. Limited post-intervention follow-up prevents the ability to understand long-term comparative efficacy between interventions, which is critical for a chronic disease. There was also a paucity of direct head-to-head comparative trials, in particular comparing POEM to the other treatments. Further, performance and detection bias related to the non-blinded design of included trials introduced significant risk of bias. Performance and detection bias are not easily avoidable in RCTs testing new devices or techniques in surgery or endoscopy, given the nature of the intervention under study, and this represents a limitation in particular when considering subjective outcomes such as improvement of symptoms in patients with achalasia. Assessment of vital physiologic outcomes by blinded readers can overcome limitations related to blinding in these trials; however, these outcomes were infrequently and/or inconsistently reported in trials data which limit ability to compare post-treatment physiologic efficacy. Similarly, treatment-related adverse events were poorly reported and a thorough assessment of risk–benefit profile could not be performed. Finally, inherent to network meta-analyses is risk of misinterpretation due to conceptual heterogeneity, related to differences in participants, interventions, co-interventions/background treatment, and outcome assessment, which may limit comparability of trials; these cannot be adequately accounted for with study-level synthesis, and individual participant-level pooled analyses will be needed.

In conclusion, based on network meta-analysis, POEM and LHM may be comparable to each other, and both may be more effective than PD, in the definitive management of treatment-naïve patients with achalasia. While the risk of GERD is higher with POEM, overall rate of severe erosive esophagitis is low. Rate of treatment-related serious adverse events may be lower with POEM versus LHM or PD. Future prospective studies comparing long-term efficacy and safety of POEM, LHM, and PD, particularly across specific achalasia subtypes are warranted.

The words "the guideline panel recommends" are used for strong recommendations, and "the guideline panel suggests" for conditional recommendations, as per the GRADE approach. A conditional recommendation signals that the benefits of adhering to a recommendation probably outweigh the harms although it does also indicate uncertainty, and this uncertainty may be due to a lack of high-quality evidence or variability in how individual patients and other stakeholders value the outcomes of interest.

Achalasia in children bears many similarities to the disorder in adults, both in terms of clinical features and in terms of the approach to therapy. Pharmacologic management is of limited temporary benefit until more definitive therapy is undertaken. Intrasphincteric injections of botulinum toxin provides safe but short-term relief from symptoms. Based on our review of the safety and effectiveness of pneumatic dilation, we advocate this procedure as the primary form of definitive therapy for achalasia in children. In patients who do not achieve satisfactory results from a series of graduated pneumatic dilations, Heller myotomy provides safe and effective surgical treatment.

### Outcome reporting in studies of paediatric achalasia: a systematic review [^115Rg4Dt]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Achalasia is a rare disease of oesophageal dysmotility that affects 0.11–1.80 per 100,000 children. Disordered oesophageal peristalsis, high resting tone of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS), and failure of the LOS to relax on swallowing cause affected children to develop progressive dysphagia, vomiting, retrosternal pain and impaired growth. Treatment options are limited and aim to reduce symptoms by lowering LOS pressure. These include medical therapies, endoscopic treatments and surgery. Evidence for an optimal management strategy of children with achalasia is lacking. To date, no large prospective comparative trials have been undertaken in children. Similarly, little is known about how achalasia, and its treatment modalities, impact on a child's quality of life (QoL). There can be no doubt that a greater understanding of the relationships between oesophageal physiology, treatments and outcomes is necessary to improve the care provided to these children. However, before conducting studies comparing treatments in children with achalasia, it is necessary to identify the most important outcome measures for inclusion.

Core outcome sets (COSs) are standardised outcomes that can guide further research and facilitate data pooling and meta‐analysis. The development of COS in rare paediatric disease is essential to allow future studies to report important and comparable outcomes that are relevant to children. No COS has been developed for patients with achalasia, and current measures of treatment success in achalasia, such as the Eckardt score, are not applicable to children.

To inform the creation of a COS for children with achalasia, we performed a systematic review to determine which outcomes are currently reported in clinical research studies relating to children with this condition.

### Esophageal achalasia: pros and cons of the treatment options [^113WcrPh]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Achalasia is a rare disease, with an incidence of 0.5–1.0 patient per 100,000 population a year. It is nonetheless the most common, and most extensively studied esophageal motility disorder. Despite improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, its etiology remains largely obscure. The appearance of a functional obstruction at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ), and the gradual loss of esophageal peristalsis is responsible for the clinical symptoms, with dilation of the gullet progressing in the final stages to decompensated megaesophagus.

As the disease's etiology is unknown, the aim of current treatments is to deal with the functional abnormalities it causes. There is, unfortunately, no treatment available at present for the loss of peristalsis, so the aim of all therapies in use today is to overcome the functional obstruction of the unrelaxing lower esophageal sphincter (LES), trusting that gravity will then ensure the passage of food through an adynamic gullet. Since pharmacological options for achalasia are impractical, or produce disappointing results, it is treated by paralyzing, tearing or cutting the unrelaxing muscle fibers of the LES, either endoscopically or surgically.

The endoscopic treatment of achalasia with pneumatic dilations (PD) or botulinum toxin (BoT) injections was the mainstay of therapy for the disease for most of the second half of the last century, challenged only in the '90s by laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM). Endoscopic treatments have lately been revitalized by the introduction and rapid diffusion of per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). In this paper we review these techniques, pinpointing the pros and cons of each (summarized in Table 1), and suggest a possible flowchart for the treatment of esophageal achalasia in its various manifestations.

### Comparative efficacy of first-line therapeutic interventions for achalasia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116Hezgb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Several interventions with variable efficacy are available as first-line therapy for patients with achalasia. We assessed the comparative efficacy of different strategies for management of achalasia, through a network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons.

Methods

We identified six randomized controlled trials in adults with achalasia that compared the efficacy of pneumatic dilation (PD; n = 260), laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM; n = 309), and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM; n = 176). Primary efficacy outcome was 1-year treatment success (patient-reported improvement in symptoms based on validated scores); secondary efficacy outcomes were 2-year treatment success and physiologic improvement; safety outcomes were risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), severe erosive esophagitis, and procedure-related serious adverse events. We performed pairwise and network meta-analysis for all treatments, and used GRADE criteria to appraise quality of evidence.

Results

Low-quality evidence, based primarily on direct evidence, supports the use of POEM (RR [risk ratio], 1.29; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.99–1.69), and LHM (RR, 1.18 [0.96–1.44]) over PD for treatment success at 1 year; no significant difference was observed between LHM and POEM (RR 1.09 [0.86–1.39]). The incidence of severe esophagitis after POEM, LHM, and PD was 5.3%, 3.7%, and 1.5%, respectively. Procedure-related serious adverse event rate after POEM, LHM, and PD was 1.4%, 6.7%, and 4.2%, respectively.

Conclusions

POEM and LHM have comparable efficacy, and may increase treatment success as compared to PD with low confidence in estimates. POEM may have lower rate of serious adverse events compared to LHM and PD, but higher rate of GERD.

### Endoscopic and surgical treatments for achalasia: who to treat and how? [^113tsaH6]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Achalasia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and altered motility of the esophagus. The traditional, highly effective, surgical approach to relieve obstruction at the LES includes cardiomyotomy. Fundoplication is added to decrease risk of postoperative reflux. Per oral endoscopic myotomy is a new endoscopic procedure that allows division of the LES via transoral route. It has several advantages including less invasiveness, cosmesis, and tailored approach to the length on the myotomy. However, it is associated with increased rate of post-procedural reflux. Various endoscopic interventions are used to address this problem.

### Achalasia [^115FMwQq]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Achalasia is the best understood and most readily treatable esophageal motility disorder. It serves as a prototype for disorders of the enteric nervous system with degeneration of the myenteric neurons that innervate the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and esophageal body. Investigations into the pathogenesis have highlighted the importance of nitric oxide and the possible role of an autoimmune response to a viral insult in genetically susceptible individuals. Advances in diagnostic testing have delineated manometric variants of achalasia that have implications for management. Treatment studies have demonstrated the limited efficacy of botulinum toxin as well as less than ideal, long-term effectiveness of both pneumatic dilation and Heller myotomy. This article incorporates these recent developments into the current understanding of achalasia.

### ACG clinical guidelines: diagnosis and management of achalasia [^111PSFPF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Achalasia — endoscopic pharmacologic therapy with botulinum toxin — has an approximate 50% reduction of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and uses a standard dose of 100 U delivered in 0.5–1.0 mL aliquots; escalating above 100 U has not shown superior benefit. A systematic review concluded it is the least effective treatment compared with other interventions, with symptom relief of 70% at 3 months, 53.3% at 6 months, and 40.6% at 12 months; 46.6% of patients required additional injections and 30% required additional treatment. Although it is the best studied pharmacotherapy and the most effective pharmacological treatment that can be offered, benefits are short lived and it should not be offered as first-line to patients fit for myotomy.

### Treatment of the patient with achalasia [^115efU3A]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In recent years, several studies on the treatment and follow-up of achalasia have been published. This review aims at highlighting interesting publications from the recent years.

Recent Findings

Treatment of achalasia aims at relieving functional obstruction at the level of the esophagogastric junction. Several treatment options such as pneumodilation and laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) are available for this purpose. A large prospective randomized trial comparing pneumodilation and LHM demonstrated comparable success rates and quality of life for the two treatment options. Long-term data demonstrate comparable treatment success rates, when redilation in case of recurrent symptoms after pneumodilation is accepted. The most important risk factor for treatment failure is the manometric subtype, with a worse outcome for type I and type III compared with type II achalasia. Recently, peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has been described with high success rates. Comparative studies with longer follow-up are awaited. A prospective study assessing the risk of esophageal carcinoma in patients with achalasia showed a 28-fold increased risk to develop carcinoma.

Summary

Either LHM or pneumodilation have high comparable short-term clinical success rates. Based on the increased risk to develop esophageal carcinoma, a screening program may be indicated. POEM is a new interesting treatment but longer follow-up data are awaited.

Concluding remarks

The recent emergence of the HRM as a diagnostic tool has helped identify three subtypes of achalasia that show different responsiveness to endoscopic or surgical therapies. This subclassification has facilitated choosing the appropriate treatment for each different patient, thereby increasing overall treatment efficacy. In our opinion, high-risk older patients and those with severe comorbidities should undergo Botox, while all the other patients may be considered as low risk and offered surgical or endoscopic treatment (Fig. 2). The choice between PD or surgery may depend on local expertise.

Figure 2
Therapeutic algorithm for achalasia patients

The role of POEM as a valuable substitute of the traditional therapeutic options will be defined in the immediate future after randomized prospective comparison trials and long-term follow-up studies are published. Pharmacological therapy could be administered to patients waiting for an endoscopic or surgical treatment and to those with high surgical risk whenever the approach with Botox is not possible or has failed. While current treatment of achalasia still focuses on mechanical disruption of the LES, future therapies are anticipated aiming at restoring its function.

### Development of quality indicators for the diagnosis and management of achalasia [^117NM1t5]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of achalasia has improved due to diagnostic and therapeutic innovations. However, variability in care delivery remains and no established measures defining quality of care for this population exist. We aimed to use formal methodology to establish quality indicators for achalasia patients.

Methods

Quality indicator concepts were identified from the literature, consensus guidelines and clinical experts. Using RAND/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Method, experts in achalasia independently ranked proposed concepts in a two-round modified Delphi process based on 1) importance, 2) scientific acceptability, 3) usability, and 4) feasibility. Highly valid measures required strict agreement (≥ 80% of panelists) in the range of 7–9 for across all four categories.

Key Results

There were 17 experts who rated 26 proposed quality indicator topics. In round one, 2 (8%) quality measures were rated valid. In round two, 19 measures were modified based on panel suggestions, and experts rated 10 (53%) of these measures as valid, resulting in a total of 12 quality indicators. Two measures pertained to patient education and five to diagnosis, including discussing treatment options with risk and benefits and using the most recent version of the Chicago Classification to define achalasia phenotypes, respectively. Other indicators pertained to treatment options, such as the use of botulinum toxin for those not considered surgical candidates and management of reflux following achalasia treatment.

Conclusions & Inferences

Using a robust methodology, achalasia quality indicators were identified, which can form the basis for establishing quality gaps and generating fully specified quality measures.

### Comparative efficacy of first-line therapeutic interventions for achalasia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1119AWDZ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Achalasia is a chronic disorder characterized by esophageal dysmotility and inadequate lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation commonly manifesting with dysphagia and regurgitation. In the absence of a cure, the therapeutic goals in achalasia include symptom reduction and improved esophageal emptying. Endoscopic pneumatic dilation (PD) and laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) often combined with an anti-reflux procedure have historically been the two definitive first-line therapies for achalasia, while peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has emerged as an efficacious endoscopic therapy for achalasia over the past decade. Oral and endoscopic pharmacologic treatments are reserved as second-line options for patients that are not candidates for first-line therapy.

PD is the most commonly performed treatment worldwide, and is minimally invasive with long-term success in 50–93% patients, although it usually requires several treatment sessions. On the other hand, LHM combined with an anti-reflux procedure is a more invasive treatment often requiring only one treatment session with success rates of 71% to –92%. In the European Achalasia trial, the success rate of PD and LHM was shown to depend on achalasia subtype with type II achalasia having the highest success rate at 5 years (PD 96%; LHM 88%) and type III achalasia with the poorest success rate at 5 years (PD 48%; LHM 86%). The success rate of POEM in prospective cohorts has been greater than 90% and maintained across achalasia subtypes, thought to be related to the ability to perform a proximal extended myotomy in type III, or spastic achalasia. A consistent observation with POEM has been a higher risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) compared to PD or LHM.

Methods

This systematic review is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) for network meta-analyses (PRISMA-NMA) statement and was conducted following a priori established protocol. We also followed good research practices as outlined in the ISPOR (International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research) report on interpreting indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis for health-care decision making.

Selection criteria

Studies included in this meta-analysis were RCTs with minimum follow-up of 1 year that met the following inclusion criteria: (a) Patients: adults (age > 18 years) with achalasia, treated with (b) Interventions and Comparators: PD, LHM, and POEM, and reported (c) Outcome: treatment success assessed at 1 year.

We excluded (a) observational or non-randomized studies, (b) RCTs of endoscopic botulinum toxin injection, as this is considered second-line therapy for patients who are not candidates for first-line therapy, (c) RCTs of oral therapies reserved for patients who are not candidates for first-line therapy (i.e. oral smooth muscle relaxants), and (c) trials with short duration of follow-up (< 1y).

Search strategy

The search strategy was conducted updating a prior systematic literature review performed as part of the recent American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines through December 2019. Briefly, in this guideline, combinations of subject headings and text words were used, including Esophageal Achalasia OR cardiospasm OR achalasia OR megaesophagus OR mega-esophagus OR megaoesophagus OR mega-oesophagus AND Botulinum Toxins OR botulin* OR botox OR myotomy OR Heller OR peroral OR per oral OR POEM OR LHM OR Dilatation/OR dilatation.

### Long-term outcomes of treatments for achalasia [^116V1vBt]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Idiopathic achalasia is a primary motility disorder of the esophagus that results in dysphagia, weight loss, and impaired quality of life. Several treatment options are available to gastroenterologists, and insights on the long-term outcome of these modalities are discussed.

Recent Findings

Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) represents a novel endoscopic technique in the treatment of achalasia. Studies on long-term outcomes and comparison to other well-known treatment modalities such as laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) and pneumodilation have recently been published. POEM and LHM both have excellent 2-year success rates for relieving achalasia symptoms, but reflux disease and erosive esophagitis are more prevalent following POEM.

Summary

Several treatment modalities with excellent long-term outcomes are available for the treatment of achalasia. The different options should be discussed with patients and treatments should be tailored to their individual needs.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two authors will independently assess the risk of bias (RoB) in the included studies. A third author will adjudicate any discrepancies if needed. We will use the RoB 2 tool following guidance in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions (Higgins 2022). Specifically, we will follow the principle of intention‐to‐treat (ITT) to determine risk of bias, which involves inclusion of all randomized participants regardless of the interventions they actually received.

For each study, we will evaluate the risk of bias using the following domains (Higgins 2022; Sterne 2019):

bias arising from the randomization process;
bias due to deviations from intended interventions;
bias due to missing outcome data;
bias in the measurement of the outcome; and
bias in selection of the reported result.

We will use the. We will track the rationale for each evaluation. For each outcome of a trial, we will report the overall risk of bias in the most severely judged domain, according to guidance in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2022).

Measures of treatment effect

We will report binary outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we will use either the mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs for outcomes evaluated using the same scale, or standardized mean differences (SMD) for outcomes evaluated using different scales.

For all interventions in a network, we will rank their comparative effectiveness using P‐scores in the frequentist network meta‐analysis (NMA). P‐scores quantify the relative superiority of each intervention within the network, with scores ranging from 0 (least effective) to 1 (most effective) (Rücker 2015). We will use these scores to rank treatments across all outcomes in the network, and present this visually using 'rankograms' for each outcome.

### ACG clinical guidelines: diagnosis and management of achalasia [^114q9iEF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder characterized by aberrant peristalsis and insufficient relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. Patients most commonly present with dysphagia to solids and liquids, regurgitation, and occasional chest pain with or without weight loss. High-resolution manometry has identified 3 subtypes of achalasia distinguished by pressurization and contraction patterns. Endoscopic findings of retained saliva with puckering of the gastroesophageal junction or esophagram findings of a dilated esophagus with bird beaking are important diagnostic clues. In this American College of Gastroenterology guideline, we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation process to provide clinical guidance on how best to diagnose and treat patients with achalasia.

### Current trends in the management of achalasia [^111jmK7w]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Despite the recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of achalasia, aetiology remains obscure and this primary oesophageal motor disorder is still considered "idiopathic" in nature. As a consequence, the therapeutic approach remains palliative. Since there is little or no chance of improving the motor abnormalities of the oesophageal body, treatment of achalasia is aimed at symptomatic relief of functional lower oesophageal sphincter obstruction. Pharmacologic treatment induces only a limited and brief improvement. It may be used to treat early cases of achalasia without significant oesophageal dilatation and to manage patients exhibiting some but not all the characteristics of achalasia (e.g. transitional forms). In any event, drug therapy should be seen as a short-term measure and be considered as an alternative only in patients unfit to undergo pneumatic dilatation or surgery. Pneumatic dilatation and surgical myotomy (now increasingly carried out through a minimally invasive approach) remain, therefore, the two main approaches which guarantee long-lasting symptomatic relief. Unfortunately, both pneumatic dilatation and Heller cardiomyotomy are only palliative as neither reliably reverses oesophageal aperistalsis not corrects the incomplete postdeglutition relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. They do, however, improve symptoms by lowering lower oesophageal sphincter pressure thus enhancing oesophageal emptying by gravity. Recently a third approach, consisting in perendoscopic injection of botulinum toxin into the lower oesophageal sphincter is gaining acceptance. Indeed, more endoscopists are finding this kind of treatment attractive because it does not carry the risk of perforation that can occur with pneumatic dilatation. However, since symptomatic improvement with botulinum toxin only lasts a few months, either repeated injections are required or the patient must be switched to other therapy. There may be, however, subsets of patients for whom BoTox injection is the preferred approach. They probably include elderly patients or patients with multiple medical problems who are poor candidates for more invasive procedures as well as those unwilling to have either surgery or pneumatic dilatation. Future approaches to achalasia may markedly change from the suggested algorithm depending on the long-term efficacy and safety as well as cost analysis of BoTox injection and of minimally invasive surgery.

### Achalasia: current therapeutic options [^111TKFMX]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

Achalasia is an esophageal motor disorder characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and absent peristalsis in the smooth muscle esophageal body. As a result, patients typically experience dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss. Over the past 10–15years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the evaluation of therapies for achalasia. Unfortunately, little progress in the development of effective pharmacological treatments has been made. Botulinum toxin injection provides some relief of symptoms in many patients but requires periodic reinjection that may provide progressively less benefit over time. There are now three well-established, safe, and effective therapies for the treatment of achalasia: pneumatic dilation (PD), laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM), and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) which can lead to marked symptom improvement in most patients. Each treatment has a specific constellation of risks, benefits, and recurrence rate. The first-line treatment used will depend on patient preference, achalasia subtype, and local expertise. The recent impressive advances in both the art and science of achalasia therapy are explored with a comprehensive review of the various treatment modalities and comparative controlled clinical trials. In addition, key technical pearls of the procedural treatments are demonstrated.

### ASGE guideline on the management of achalasia [^115xwewz]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Achalasia is a primary esophageal motor disorder of unknown etiology characterized by degeneration of the myenteric plexus, which results in impaired relaxation of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ), along with the loss of organized peristalsis in the esophageal body. The criterion standard for diagnosing achalasia is high-resolution esophageal manometry showing incomplete relaxation of the EGJ coupled with the absence of organized peristalsis. Three achalasia subtypes have been defined based on high-resolution manometry findings in the esophageal body. Treatment of patients with achalasia has evolved in recent years with the introduction of peroral endoscopic myotomy. Other treatment options include botulinum toxin injection, pneumatic dilation, and Heller myotomy. This American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Standards of Practice Guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of achalasia, based on an updated assessment of the individual and comparative effectiveness, adverse effects, and cost of the 4 aforementioned achalasia therapies.

### Achalasia [^1153BhTw]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Endoscopic therapy for achalasia is centered on disrupting or weakening the lower esophageal sphincter. The three traditional treatment options for achalasia are surgical myotomy, pneumatic dilation, and botulinum toxin injection. Pneumatic dilation yields results that are generally better than botulinum toxin injection and may approach a clinical response comparable with surgery. Per oral endoscopic myotomy is a newer endoscopic modality that will likely change the treatment paradigm for achalasia.

### Efficacy of surgical or endoscopic treatment of idiopathic achalasia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116ySYLY]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Treatment of achalasia has changed substantially over the past 20 years. Therapeutic options offered to patients vary, depending on access to both resources and expertise, and include pneumatic dilation (PD), laparoscopic Heller's myotomy (LHM), or per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). Although there are head-to-head trials of these interventions, many of these are small and underpowered, so relative efficacy is unknown. We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis to try to resolve this uncertainty.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and Embase Classic from database inception up to June 11, 2020, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of POEM, LHM, or PD, compared with each other in adults with idiopathic achalasia. We extracted all data as dichotomous outcomes (treatment success or failure) after completion of therapy. We also extracted country of origin, number of centres, duration of follow-up, and primary outcome measure used to define treatment success or failure. Data were extracted for intention-to-treat analyses, with all dropouts assumed to be treatment failures (ie, symptomatic at final point of follow-up), wherever trial reporting allowed this. We pooled data using a random effects model, and assessed heterogeneity between studies using the I² statistic. Risk of bias was examined for all studies. The primary outcome was efficacy, in terms of a dichotomous measure of treatment success or failure, after a minimum of 1 year of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were occurrence of perforation, adverse events, serious adverse events (including death), need for reintervention, need for surgery as a result of complications, development of gastro-oesophageal reflux, or erosive oesophagitis. Efficacy was reported as a pooled relative risk (RR) of treatment failure, with a 95% CI, for each comparison tested, and ranked by therapy according to P-score.

Findings

Of 1044 studies initially assessed, nine were eligible RCTs, which comprised 911 participants in total. None of the nine studies were at low risk of bias. Of the 911 participants 372 (41%) participants were randomly assigned to LHM, 317 (35%) participants to PD, and 222 (24%) participants to POEM. Of the three strategies, POEM was ranked first (RR of failure of treatment 0.33, 95% CI 0.15–0.71; P-score 0.89), then LHM (RR 0.45, 0.26–0.78, P-score 0.61). There was moderate heterogeneity between studies (I² = 61.5%). Both POEM and LHM were superior to PD on direct and indirect comparison, but neither was significantly more effective than the other. There were no significant differences in perforation rates, need for re-intervention or surgery, gastro-oesophageal reflux, erosive oesophagitis, or serious adverse events, but PD was less likely to lead to adverse events than POEM.

Interpretation

POEM and LHM should be the preferred treatments for idiopathic achalasia. PD performed worst in terms of treatment success, and therefore its role in the management of patients with achalasia is less certain.

In the last year, two landmark multicenter RCTs comparing POEM to PD and POEM to LHM have been published providing a framework for assessing comparative efficacy and safety of these interventions to inform optimal first-line intervention for treatment of patients with achalasia. Hence, we performed a pairwise and network meta-analysis combining direct (from RCTs directly comparing treatments of interest) and indirect evidence (from RCTs comparing treatments of interest with a common comparator), to compare the relative efficacy and safety of PD, LHM, and POEM for the management of achalasia. We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria for network meta-analysis to appraise quality of evidence.

### Impact of high-resolution manometry on achalasia diagnosis and treatment [^111uSAZF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

These studies have methodological differences, according to the type of esophageal manometry, treatment modalities, definition of response, and time of follow up. Nevertheless, consistent across all studies was the observation that patients with type II achalasia have the best and patients with type III achalasia have the worst response to treatment. It seems that type II had the best results for PD and surgery seems benefit more type I achalasia patients. Although PD and surgery are not very effective in patients with type III achalasia medical therapy (BOTOX) might be an alternative for these patients.

These results suggest that achalasia subtypes represent unique clinical phenotypes and may offer criteria to plan the optimal treatment for the patient with achalasia, although more prospective data are needed to confirm these first results.

Achalasia — diagnostic and treatment algorithm (Figure 8) directs that patients with "Symptoms of dysphagia ± chest pain and bland regurgitation GERD symptoms not responsive to PPI therapy" undergo "Upper Endoscopy", followed by "High Resolution Manometry, Timed Barium Esophagram (FLIP may be helpful in patients unable to tolerate HRM)" and classification into "Type I or II Achalasia" vs "Type III Achalasia". For Type I or II, definitive therapy options include "Pneumatic Dilation (30/35/40 mm)" with instructions to "May start with 35 mm in young males", "Routine gastrografin is not needed", and "Repeat in 2–4 weeks if no response", plus "Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy" with "Recommend Dor or Toupet fundoplication", and "POEM" with "Standard myotomy length" and "All patients discharged with PPI therapy". For Type III, definitive therapy is "Tailored myotomy via POEM or tailored Heller myotomy", and for "Patients unfit for definitive therapy", options include "Botulinum toxin" and "Smooth muscle relaxants".
