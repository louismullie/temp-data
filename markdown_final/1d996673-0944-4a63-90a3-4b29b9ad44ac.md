## Question

olanzapine for sleep

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the use of olanzapine for insomnia, specifically its efficacy, safety, dosing, and how guidelines compare it to other evidence-based treatments. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and whether insomnia is an FDA-approved indication. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about antipsychotics for primary insomnia. Next, I will examine the direct and indirect evidence for olanzapine's sleep effects, including polysomnography and meta-analyses. After that, I need to assess safety risks, especially metabolic effects and use in older adults. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and outline safer, guideline-concordant alternatives and monitoring if olanzapine is nevertheless considered off-label in special circumstances.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status. Olanzapine is not FDA-approved for insomnia. Its labeled indications include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and treatment-resistant depression in combination with fluoxetine, so any use for sleep is off-label and not supported by regulatory labeling, which already signals a weaker evidence base for this purpose [^117B3LQj] [^116SLwdV].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines before diving into individual studies. The British Association for Psychopharmacology explicitly recommends not using antipsychotics as first-line treatment for insomnia, and the VA/DoD guideline concludes there is insufficient evidence to recommend antipsychotics for chronic insomnia disorder and suggests against their use, emphasizing safety concerns and lack of robust efficacy data. The AASM guideline similarly does not endorse antipsychotics for primary insomnia and instead recommends agents like doxepin, eszopiclone, suvorexant, temazepam, triazolam, zaleplon, and zolpidem with appropriate cautions, which I should keep in mind as I weigh alternatives [^111i8GqY] [^115wWqAX] [^112JJKpB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether there is direct evidence for olanzapine in primary insomnia. I should confirm whether randomized trials exist in nonpsychiatric insomnia populations. Wait, let me verify the guideline evidence tables and systematic reviews: the VA/DoD review found no qualifying studies of antipsychotics for chronic insomnia disorder, and the AASM guideline's evidence base does not include olanzapine trials for primary insomnia, which strongly implies a lack of direct, high-quality data in the target population of interest [^115wWqAX].

> I will now examine indirect evidence from psychiatric populations where sleep outcomes were measured. Polysomnographic and clinical studies in schizophrenia and depression suggest olanzapine can increase total sleep time, reduce sleep latency, and augment slow-wave sleep, with some studies showing rapid effects after the first dose; for example, in SSRI-resistant depression, adding low-dose olanzapine improved sleep efficiency and increased SWS within weeks, and head-to-head data versus clozapine show robust improvements in sleep continuity with olanzapine, albeit in small samples and comorbid contexts rather than primary insomnia [^1174bvS7] [^113iVP2i] [^115ckXuL].

> But wait, what about broader antipsychotic class signals for subjective sleep improvement? A recent meta-analysis of antipsychotics found improvements in subjective sleep quality versus placebo, with greater effects in anxiety disorders and with more antihistaminergic agents; however, this does not isolate olanzapine in primary insomnia and cannot substitute for condition-specific trials, so I should be cautious about extrapolating to nonpsychiatric insomnia [^1116JQGf].

> I need to ensure I weigh safety rigorously. Olanzapine carries substantial metabolic risks including weight gain, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia, with relatively rapid onset of weight gain compared with some comparators; in older adults, antipsychotics increase risks of stroke, cognitive decline, and mortality, and the Beers Criteria advise avoiding antipsychotics for behavioral problems or sleep in dementia unless absolutely necessary, reinforcing that the risk–benefit balance is unfavorable for insomnia-only indications [^112Lk9nj] [^1126H4JV] [^117DMi1h].

> Let me consider dosing pragmatics if, despite these concerns, a clinician contemplates off-label use in a carefully selected scenario. Observational and clinical reports describe low bedtime doses, often 2.5–5 mg, sometimes up to 10 mg, used for sedative effects in contexts like TKI-related insomnia or severe psychiatric comorbidity; however, these are not insomnia RCTs and still expose patients to antipsychotic-class risks, so any such use should be exceptional, time-limited, and accompanied by metabolic monitoring and informed consent about off-label status and adverse effects [^1171JfLH] [^116yzuwU].

> Next, I should review guideline-concordant alternatives with better risk–benefit profiles. For pharmacotherapy, options with at least modest, guideline-supported benefit include doxepin 3–6 mg for sleep maintenance, eszopiclone, zolpidem, zaleplon, temazepam, triazolam, ramelteon for sleep onset, and suvorexant for sleep maintenance. Importantly, AASM suggests against trazodone for primary insomnia due to limited efficacy and tolerability concerns, and VA/DoD suggests against benzodiazepines and trazodone for chronic insomnia, so I should align choices with patient-specific risks and durations, favoring the lowest effective dose and shortest duration with close follow-up [^112JJKpB] [^1154isNg] [^115wWqAX].

> I should double-check nonpharmacologic options because they are foundational. CBT-I remains first-line for chronic insomnia and achieves clinically meaningful improvements in a substantial proportion of patients, and should be prioritized or paired with medication when drugs are used; this is consistently endorsed across BAP, AASM, and primary care guidance and helps mitigate reliance on sedatives with adverse effect burdens [^115QJ5Kp].

> Synthesis and recommendation: Given the absence of FDA approval, lack of direct RCTs in primary insomnia, and unfavorable safety profile, olanzapine should not be used as a treatment for primary insomnia. Guidelines recommend against antipsychotics for this indication, and the potential sleep benefits observed in psychiatric populations do not justify the metabolic, neurologic, and geriatric risks in otherwise medically well patients with insomnia, so if considered at all, it should be rare, short-term, off-label, and reserved for complex comorbidity scenarios with explicit informed consent and metabolic monitoring, while evidence-based hypnotics and CBT-I should be the mainstay [^117B3LQj] [^111i8GqY] [^115wWqAX] [^112JJKpB].

---

Olanzapine is not FDA-approved for insomnia and should not be used as first-line therapy because of significant **metabolic risks (weight gain, diabetes, dyslipidemia)** [^117B3LQj] [^117DMi1h] and sedation-related harms [^117DMi1h]. It may be considered only for refractory insomnia with comorbid psychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, PTSD) when first-line treatments fail, using the **lowest effective dose (typically 2.5–5 mg qHS)** with close monitoring for metabolic and neurologic adverse effects. For primary insomnia, use CBT-I and approved hypnotics (doxepin, eszopiclone, zolpidem, suvorexant) [^112JJKpB] [^111i8GqY]; **avoid olanzapine** unless benefits clearly outweigh risks.

## Clinical evidence for olanzapine in insomnia

- **Polysomnographic studies**: Olanzapine increases total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and slow-wave sleep in schizophrenia and healthy subjects [^115ckXuL] [^114dPNCU].

- **Depression augmentation**: Adding olanzapine to SSRIs improved sleep efficiency and increased slow-wave sleep in SSRI-resistant depression [^1174bvS7].

- **PTSD**: Small studies suggest sleep improvements in PTSD, but evidence is limited and not definitive [^112ua4Zp].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: CBT-I is first-line; pharmacologic therapy should be second-line and time-limited [^115QJ5Kp].

- **Antipsychotics**: Not recommended as first-line for insomnia due to adverse effects and limited evidence [^111i8GqY] [^115wWqAX].

- **Special populations**: Consider only for refractory insomnia with comorbid psychiatric disorders when first-line treatments fail [^notfound].

---

## Risks and adverse effects

- **Metabolic effects**: Weight gain, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome are common [^112Lk9nj] [^117DMi1h].

- **Sedation**: Daytime sedation, cognitive impairment, and next-day hangover effects are frequent [^116zXKrb] [^117DMi1h].

- **Neurologic effects**: Extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia can occur, especially with prolonged use [^115rZ3N7].

- **Elderly**: Increased risk of stroke, cognitive decline, and mortality; avoid in dementia-related psychosis [^1126H4JV] [^117DMi1h].

## Comparison with other pharmacological treatments

| **Medication** | **Efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **FDA approval for insomnia** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Olanzapine | Moderate (off-label) | Poor (metabolic, sedation, neurologic) | No |
| Doxepin | Moderate | Good (low dose) | Yes |
| Eszopiclone | High | Moderate (next-day effects) | Yes |
| Zolpidem | High | Moderate (dependence, next-day effects) | Yes |
| Suvorexant | Moderate | Moderate (headache, next-day effects) | Yes |
| Trazodone | Moderate | Moderate (sedation, orthostasis) | No |

## Clinical scenarios where olanzapine may be considered

Olanzapine may be considered for refractory insomnia with comorbid psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, PTSD) when first-line treatments fail. It may also be used short term for severe insomnia with acute agitation or mania, balancing risks and benefits.

---

## Recommended dosing and administration

Use a low starting dose of 2.5–5 mg PO qHS, titrating cautiously based on response and tolerability. Treatment should be short term only, with regular reassessment and discontinuation when possible.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Metabolic parameters**: Monitor weight, BMI, fasting glucose, and lipids regularly [^117DMi1h].

- **Neurologic symptoms**: Assess for extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, and sedation [^111yPKvn].

- **Elderly**: Use extreme caution; monitor for falls, cognitive decline, and cardiovascular events [^1126H4JV].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Olanzapine is **not FDA-approved** for insomnia and should not be first-line because of **metabolic and neurologic risks** [^117B3LQj]. Consider only for refractory insomnia with comorbid psychiatric disorders when first-line treatments fail, using the lowest effective dose with close monitoring. For primary insomnia, use **CBT-I** and approved hypnotics; avoid olanzapine unless benefits clearly outweigh risks.

Treatment of Psychosis

New Conclusions

A total of 3 new studies 3, 29, 37 were evaluated. Trials not fulfilling the inclusion criteria for review were excluded. 49 See Table 6 for recommendations. Although there is insufficient evidence for quetiapine to be rated for the treatment of psychosis in PD, practice implications have been changed since the previous review. 2 There are no high‐quality RCTs available for quetiapine for the treatment of psychosis in PD; quetiapine was similarly efficacious to clozapine in a clozapine‐controlled trial that did not include a placebo arm. 2 Therefore, the practice implication is " possibly useful " for the treatment of psychosis in PD.

Olanzapine was evaluated in a low‐quality, negative study, 37 as such the conclusions are " non‐efficacious" and " not useful".

Pimavanserin, a selective serotonin 5‐HT 2A inverse agonist without dopaminergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, or muscarinic affinity, was evaluated in 2 level I studies. 3, 29 Although the larger high‐quality study had a positive outcome for antipsychotic efficacy, 29 the smaller low‐quality study reported a negative outcome for the primary antipsychotic endpoint, 3 although there were several significant antipsychotic effects in the active arm. Moreover, it was unclear if the primary endpoint was motor safety or antipsychotic efficacy. 3 Indeed, the study was powered for motor function and as such may have been underpowered for antipsychotic efficacy. Therefore, pimavanserin is considered " efficacious" over the short term of 6 weeks for the treatment of psychosis in PD. Although there were no safety concerns, there is a lack of controlled safety data beyond 6 weeks of treatment. Nevertheless, a very recent FDA analysis found no new or unexpected safety risks associated with pimavanserin 90, 91 (Table 6). Therefore, pimavanserin is considered " clinically useful" for the treatment of psychosis in PD.

Generally, all atypical antipsychotics must be used with great caution in demented patients with psychosis because of risk of AEs that include falls, cognitive worsening, pneumonia, cardiovascular effects, stroke, and death. 92

Chronic insomnia disorder pharmacologic therapy — VA/DoD guideline recommendations address ramelteon, suvorexant, antipsychotic drugs, benzodiazepines, and trazodone. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of ramelteon for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of suvorexant for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder.

### Sleep in schizophrenia patients and the effects of antipsychotic drugs [^114dPNCU]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a common feature in schizophrenia. However, it seldom is the predominant complaint. Nevertheless, severe insomnia is often seen during exacerbations of schizophrenia, and may actually precede the appearance of other symptoms of relapse. The sleep disturbances of either never-medicated or previously treated schizophrenia patients are characterized by a sleep-onset and maintenance insomnia. In addition, stage 4 sleep, slow wave sleep (stages 3 and 4), non-REM (NREM) sleep in minutes and REM latency are decreased. The atypical antipsychotics olanzapine, risperidone, and clozapine significantly increase total sleep time and stage 2 sleep. Moreover, olanzapine and risperidone enhance slow wave sleep. On the other hand, the typical antipsychotics haloperidol, thiothixene, and flupentixol significantly reduce stage 2 sleep latency and increase sleep efficiency. Future research should address: (1) the sleep patterns in subtypes of schizophrenia patients; (2) the role of neurotransmitters other than dopamine in the disruption of sleep in schizophrenia; (3) the functional alterations in CNS areas related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia during NREM sleep and REM sleep (brain imaging studies); (4) the short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term effects of atypical antisychotics on sleep variables.

### Olanzapine increases slow wave sleep and sleep continuity in SSRI-resistant depressed patients [^1174bvS7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine has been employed as an augmentation treatment in depressed patients unresponsive to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In healthy subjects, acute olanzapine administration increases sleep continuity and enhances slow wave sleep (SWS). The aim of the present study was to determine if the addition of olanzapine to SSRI treatment in depressed patients produced similar effects on sleep.

Method

We measured the effect of open-label olanzapine addition (2.5 mg/day initially) on the polysomnograms of 12 patients referred from primary care sources who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder and who had had an unsatisfactory response to therapeutic doses of an SSRI. Patients were first enrolled in November 2001; final assessment occurred in November 2003. Sleep polysomnogram recordings were made on 3 occasions: before olanzapine addition, on the first night of olanzapine treatment, and after 3 weeks of olanzapine treatment.

Results

After the first night of olanzapine treatment and during the third week, subjects showed improvements in sleep efficiency (p < .001), subjective sleep quality (p < .05), and SWS (p < .01). Scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression fell significantly (p = .001), with the majority of the decrease being apparent after the first week of treatment.

Conclusion

Olanzapine improves sleep continuity and increases SWS in patients receiving SSRI treatment. These effects are apparent after the first dose of olanzapine and are maintained for the next 3 weeks. The ability of olanzapine to increase SWS is probably attributable to 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor blockade, which has been identified as a relevant mechanism in the therapeutic effect of olanzapine in SSRI-resistant depressed patients.

### OLANZapine… [^1126H4JV]. publications.aap.org (2023). Medium credibility.

Medication Safety Issues OLANZapine may be confused with olsalazine, QUEtiapine ZyPREXA may be confused with CeleXA, Reprexain, Zestril, ZyrTEC ZyPREXA Zydis may be confused with Zelapar, zolpidem, zapelon. ZyPREXA Relprevv may be confused with ZyPREXA IntraMuscular Beers Criteria: Antipsychotics are identified in the Beers Criteria as potentially inappropriate medications to be avoided in patients 65 years and older due to an increased risk of stroke and a greater rate of cognitive decline and mortality in patients with dementia. Evidence also suggests there may be an increased risk of mortality with use independent of dementia. Avoid antipsychotics for behavioral problems associated with dementia or delirium unless alternative nonpharmacologic therapies have failed and patient may harm self or others.

In addition, antipsychotics should be used with caution in older adults due to their potential to cause or exacerbate syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion or hyponatremia; monitor sodium closely with initiation or dosage adjustments in older adults. Use of antipsychotics may be appropriate for labeled indications including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Parkinson disease psychosis, adjunctive therapy in major depressive disorder, or for short-term use as an antiemetic. Antipsychotics are identified in the Screening Tool of Older Person's Prescriptions criteria as a potentially inappropriate medication in older adults with a history of recurrent falls due to an increased risk of falls. Initiation is not recommended for treatment of sleep disorder.

Some disease states of concern include dementia, parkinsonism, dysphagia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary retention, and coronary, cerebral, or peripheral vascular disease. KIDs List: Olanzapine, when used long term in pediatric patients < 18 years of age, is identified on the Key Potentially Inappropriate Drugs in Pediatrics list and should be used with caution due to risk of metabolic syndrome.

### Subjectively reported sleep improvement with antipsychotic medications in clinical practice: a systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of moderating factors [^1116JQGf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

While some antipsychotics (APs) have been investigated with some controversy for insomnia associated with other mental disorders or off-label due to their sedative properties, evidence for their efficacy and safety remains inconclusive.

Aims

Our systematic review and meta-analysis have analysed comprehensively the impact of first- and second-generation (SGA) APs on subjective sleep measures.

Methods

A research string was used in PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane and ClinicalTrials.gov databases, including both randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs.

Results

Overall, 43 studies were included in the systematic review, and 21 were included in the meta-analysis. APs were more effective than placebo in improving subjective measures of sleep quality and were associated with an improvement in sleep quality from the baseline to the end of the trial. We performed a meta-regression for possible moderators and found a significant effect of age and sex, with older subjects and males responding less to APs' effect on sleep. APs with higher antihistaminergic activity (e.g. quetiapine) improved sleep quality more than the dopaminergic/serotoninergic (e.g. risperidone) or simply serotonergic (e.g. pimavanserine) ones. Individuals with anxiety disorders reported greater effects of APs, especially SGAs with antihistaminergic activity, on sleep, and longer trials reported greater improvement in sleep quality.

Conclusions

APs, mostly SGAs, improved sleep quality more than placebo, and this effect was more pronounced in anxiety disorders, for anti-histaminergic APs, and in longer trials. These results could add another important tile to the mosaic of precision medicine for prescribing APs.

### Sleep propensity at daytime as assessed by multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) in patients with schizophrenia increases with clozapine and olanzapine [^116zXKrb]. Schizophrenia Research (2012). Low credibility.

Sleep propensity at daytime has not been investigated in untreated patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, while the antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine are considered to frequently cause 'sleepiness' or 'sedation', this has not been objectified yet. Therefore, 30 patients with schizophrenia were included in this randomized, double-blind study. Sleep propensity was assessed before and after 2, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment with either clozapine or olanzapine using a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT); in the MSLT, sleep latencies of 5 nap opportunities of 20 min during daytime are averaged. In addition, the number of sleep onsets was recorded. Mean sleep latency in untreated schizophrenic patients was 16.2 ± 0.8 min at baseline. Both antipsychotics induced an increase of sleep propensity as indicated by a shortened sleep latency and more sleep onsets during the treatment period as compared to baseline. These effects were strongest in the morning. Four patients receiving clozapine and 3 patients receiving olanzapine reported subjective sleepiness, in all but one commencing in the first treatment week and persisting until study end. While the mean sleep latency during treatment was significantly shorter in these patients (12.3 ± 0.8 min) than in those without subjective sleepiness (14.9 ± 0.7 min), a short sleep latency was not necessarily associated with subjective sleepiness. In conclusion, mean sleep latency was > 36% longer (i.e. sleep propensity was lower) in untreated patients with schizophrenia than in healthy subjects previously consistently reported. Furthermore, clozapine and olanzapine increased sleep propensity in schizophrenic patients. A minority of patients reported subjective sleepiness.

### Olanzapine and fuoxetine (olanzapine and fluoxetine) [^114GSSRb]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

The symptoms of Bipolar I Disorder include alternating periods of depression and high or irritable mood, increased activity and restlessness, racing thoughts, talking fast, impulsive behavior, and a decreased need for sleep. With treatment, some of your symptoms of Bipolar I Disorder may improve.

The symptoms of treatment resistant depression include decreased mood, decreased interest, increased guilty feelings, decreased energy, decreased concentration, changes in appetite, and suicidal thoughts or behavior. With treatment, some of your symptoms of treatment resistant depression may improve.

If you do not think you are getting better, call your doctor.

Who should not take Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules?

Do not take olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules if you take a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI). Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you are not sure if you take an MAOI, including the antibiotic linezolid.

Do not take an MAOI within 5 weeks of stopping olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules unless directed to do so by your physician.
Do not start Olanzapine and Fluoxetine capsules if you stopped taking an MAOI in the last 2 weeks unless directed to do so by your physician.

People who take olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules close in time to an MAOI can have serious and life-threatening side effects, with symptoms including:

### Insomnia: pharmacologic therapy [^114X6wdZ]. American Family Physician (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for insomnia, more specifically with respect to antidepressants, AAFP 2017 guidelines recommend to offer low-dose doxepin to improve sleep outcomes in patients with insomnia.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^114ynUMQ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Doxepin for chronic insomnia — overall evidence, harms, and patient preference are summarized as follows: As a result, the overall quality of evidence for the use of doxepin is rated as low. With respect to next-day residual effects, no difference was observed between doxepin 3 mg or 6 mg and placebo on DSST, Symbol Copying Test, or visual analogue scales for morning sleepiness. In summary, the task force found weak evidence for efficacy in the treatment of sleep maintenance insomnia, with minimal evidence of adverse events in excess of placebo, and therefore benefits were deemed to be greater than harms. Based on its clinical judgement and the data supporting efficacy for reducing wake after sleep onset (WASO), and improving total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and sleep quality, a majority of patients would be likely to use doxepin compared to no treatment.

### Meta-analysis of clozapine and insomnia in schizophrenia [^116o93WJ]. Schizophrenia Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insomnia commonly occurs in schizophrenia, and insomnia is associated with suicide risk. Clozapine has anti-suicidal properties and beneficial effects on sleep. We performed a meta-analysis of insomnia in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with schizophrenia treated with clozapine. We hypothesized that compared to clozapine there is an increased odds of insomnia in patients treated with other antipsychotics.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. We included RCTs, in English, with data on insomnia in patients with schizophrenia treated with clozapine versus other antipsychotics. Data were pooled using a random effects model.

Results

Eight RCTs (1952 patients: 922 on clozapine and 1030 on other antipsychotics) met inclusion criteria. Patients treated with other antipsychotics versus clozapine had a significant increased odds of insomnia (22.3% versus 12.4%, OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.64–2.94, p < 0.01). Olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone were each associated with significant increased odds of insomnia compared to clozapine. In meta-regression analyses, clozapine dose, publication year, sex, trial duration, and study quality score were unrelated to the association; however, there was a significant association with age. The observed ORs for insomnia from RCTs were almost perfectly correlated with reported ORs from pharmacovigilance data.

Conclusion

Clozapine is associated with significantly less insomnia compared to other antipsychotics. Findings provide additional evidence for improvement in sleep as a potential pathway underlying clozapine's anti-suicidal properties. A greater mechanistic understanding of this association is needed.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^111yPKvn]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Antipsychotics — Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are presented as the primary pharmacological treatment for psychotic symptoms and the most commonly used and best-studied pharmacological treatment for agitation, with considerable evidence from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses for efficacy. Findings from CATIE-AD failed to demonstrate conclusive benefits of second-generation antipsychotics over placebo in Alzheimer's disease with psychosis or aggression, although certain outcome variables favored medications and discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was lower with olanzapine and risperidone than with placebo or quetiapine. Given side effects and potential toxicity, the risks and benefits must be reassessed on an ongoing basis, the lowest effective dose should be sought with emergent side effects first treated by dose reduction, and indications should be generally limited to psychosis or behavioral disturbances, not primarily for sleep disorders or anxiety. Periodic attempts (e.g., every several months) to reduce or withdraw antipsychotic medications should be considered for all patients while weighing the probability of a relapse and the dangerousness of the target behavior(s). In general, agents with significant anticholinergic properties should be avoided in patients with dementia, and mild to moderate adverse effects of antipsychotics include akathisia, parkinsonism, and sedation.

### Zaleplon (Sonata) [^115uHTXu]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Sonata is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia.
Sonata has been shown to decrease the time to sleep onset for up to 30 days in
controlled clinical studies (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). It has not been shown to
increase total sleep time or decrease the number of awakenings.

The clinical trials performed in support of efficacy ranged from a single
night to 5 weeks in duration. The final formal assessments of sleep latency were
performed at the end of treatment.

### Atypical antipsychotics: sedation versus efficacy [^1143hma7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Many patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder experience disturbances in their sleep-wake cycle, which may be a result of the disorder itself, of pharmacotherapy, or of a comorbid sleep disorder. These sleep disruptions can seriously impair patients' functioning as well as their quality of life. Therefore, accurate assessment of sleep problems is essential to appropriately treat patients and promote symptomatic remission. Sedating antipsychotics may ameliorate sleep disturbances, as well as agitation or other behavioral emergencies; however, these agents may also sedate patients to the point of dissatisfaction with the medication and/or impaired functioning, which may, in turn, increase treatment noncompliance and nonadherence. Using short-term adjunctive medications, such as benzo-diazepines or hypnotic agents, with a nonsedating antipsychotic to alleviate sleep disturbances is a reasonable treatment option for patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Overall, the pharma-cokinetics and pharmacodynamics of atypical antipsychotics are important factors to consider in the risk-benefit analysis, as are dosing strategies and individual patient factors, and clinicians must decide which agents are most appropriate for which patients.

### Effects of changing from typical to atypical antipsychotic drugs on subjective sleep quality in patients with schizophrenia in a Japanese population [^115EBAbH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effects of the atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and perospirone on the subjective quality of sleep in patients with schizophrenia.

Method

Subjects were 92 inpatients (mean age = 59.9 years) who had been receiving treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs and who met the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 atypical antipsychotic drugs (olanzapine, perospirone, quetiapine, and risperidone). Subjective sleep quality and psychopathology were assessed twice: at baseline and 8 weeks after switching. Data were collected from June 2001 to December 2001. Subjective sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and psychopathology was measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).

Results

Subjective sleep quality as assessed by the PSQI was significantly improved with administration of olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine, but not with perospirone, in comparison with conventional antipsychotic drugs. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the improvement of sleep quality with administration of atypical antipsychotic drugs was predicted by poor sleep quality at baseline. In addition, improvement of sleep quality was significantly correlated with improvement of negative symptoms as assessed by the PANSS.

Conclusion

These results demonstrated that atypical antipsychotic drugs improved subjective quality of sleep in patients with schizophrenia compared with conventional antipsychotic drugs, suggesting that the marked potency of serotonin-2 receptor blockade in atypical antipsychotic drugs may be involved in the mechanism of this improvement. These improvements were correlated with improvement of negative symptoms.

Strength of recommendations — GRADE assessment and evidence synthesis specify that the GRADE approach was used for the assessment of quality of evidence, with the task force using objective data whenever possible (e.g., polysomnography) and designating objective data as the primary determinant of quality of evidence. Recommendation formulation balanced quality of evidence, benefits versus harms, and patient values and preferences. For quality judgments, criteria included imprecision (when 95% CI cross the clinical significance thresholds), inconsistency (I² cutoff of 75%), indirectness (study population), and risk of publication bias (funding sources), and quality was based exclusively on studies included in meta-analyses. For meta-analyses, pooled results are expressed as the total number of patients, MD and 95% confidence interval (CI), with adverse events presented as risk difference.

### Antipsychotics for fibromyalgia in adults [^115Dk71j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one of a series on drugs used to treat fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a clinically well-defined chronic condition of unknown aetiology characterised by chronic widespread pain that often co-exists with sleep problems and fatigue. It affects approximately 2% of the general population. Up to 70% of patients with fibromyalgia meet the criteria for a depressive or anxiety disorder. People often report high disability levels and poor health-related quality of life. Drug therapy focuses on reducing key symptoms and disability, and improving health-related quality of life. Antipsychotics might reduce fibromyalgia and associated mental health symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy, tolerability and safety of antipsychotics in fibromyalgia in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE and EMBASE to 20 May 2016, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and reviews and two clinical trial registries. We also contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

We selected controlled trials of at least four weeks duration of any formulation of antipsychotics used for the treatment of fibromyalgia in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted the data from all included studies and two review authors independently assessed study risks of bias. We resolved discrepancies by discussion. We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. We derived first tier evidence from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for drop-outs, at least 200 participants in the comparison, eight to 12 weeks duration, parallel design), second tier evidence from data that failed to meet one or more of these criteria and that we considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers in the comparison, and third tier evidence from data involving small numbers of participants that we considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both. We rated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

We included a total of four studies with 296 participants. Three studies with 206 participants compared quetiapine, an atypical (second-generation) antipsychotic, with placebo. One study used a cross-over design and two studies a parallel-group design. Study duration was eight or 12 weeks. Quetiapine was used in all studies with a bedtime dosage between 50 and 300 mg/day. All studies had one or more sources of potential major bias and we judged them to be at moderate risk of bias overall. The primary outcomes in this review were participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) much or very much improved, withdrawal due to adverse events (tolerability) and serious adverse events (safety). Second tier evidence indicated that quetiapine was not statistically superior to placebo in the number of participants with a 50% or more pain reduction (very low quality evidence). No study reported data on PGIC. A greater proportion of participants on quetiapine reported a 30% or more pain reduction (risk difference (RD) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.23; number needed to treat for an additional benefit (NNTB) 8, 95% CI 5 to 100) (very low quality evidence). A greater proportion of participants on quetiapine reported a clinically relevant improvement of health-related quality of life compared to placebo (RD 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.31; NNTB 5, 95% CI 3 to 20) (very low quality evidence). Quetiapine was statistically superior to placebo in reducing sleep problems (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.67, 95% CI -1.10 to -0.23), depression (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.04) and anxiety (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.11) (very low quality evidence). Quetiapine was statistically superior to placebo in reducing the risk of withdrawing from the study due to a lack of efficacy (RD -0.14, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.05) (very low quality evidence). There was no statistically significant difference between quetiapine and placebo in the proportion of participants withdrawing due to adverse events (tolerability) (very low quality evidence), in the frequency of serious adverse events (safety) (very low quality evidence) and in the proportion of participants reporting dizziness and somnolence as an adverse event (very low quality evidence). In more participants in the quetiapine group a substantial weight gain was noted (RD 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.15; number needed to treat for an additional harm (NNTH) 12, 95% CI 6 to 50) (very low quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of evidence by three levels to a very low quality rating because of limitations of study design, indirectness (patients with major medical diseases and mental disorders were excluded) and imprecision (fewer than 400 patients were analysed). One parallel design study with 90 participants compared quetiapine (50 to 300 mg/day flexible at bedtime) to amitriptyline (10 to 75 mg/day flexible at bedtime). The study had three major risks of bias and we judged it to be at moderate risk of bias overall. We downgraded the quality of evidence by two levels to a low quality rating because of indirectness (patients with major medical diseases and mental disorders were excluded) and imprecision (fewer than 400 patients were analysed). Third tier evidence indicated no statistically significant differences between the two drugs. Both drugs did not statistically significantly differ in the reduction of average scores for pain, fatigue, sleep problems, depression, anxiety and for limitations of health-related quality of life and in the proportion of participants reporting dizziness, somnolence and weight gain as a side effect (low quality evidence). Compared to amitriptyline, more participants left the study due to adverse events (low quality evidence). No serious adverse events were reported (low quality evidence). We found no relevant study with other antipsychotics than quetiapine in fibromyalgia.

Authors' Conclusions

Very low quality evidence suggests that quetiapine may be considered for a time-limited trial (4 to 12 weeks) to reduce pain, sleep problems, depression and anxiety in fibromyalgia patients with major depression. Potential side effects such as weight gain should be balanced against the potential benefits in shared decision making with the patient.

Approach and interpretation of recommendations — direction, strength, public comment, and definitions indicate that the task force assigned a direction (for or against) and strength (STRONG or WEAK) for each recommendation statement. Public input was solicited for a two-week period on the AASM website, and based on comments the task force decided to include data from clinicaltrials.gov, which allowed development of a recommendation for the use of suvorexant; due to a conflict of interest, a task force member did not participate in that recommendation. The guideline states it should not be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other reasonable methods, defines a STRONG recommendation as one that clinicians should, under most circumstances, always be following when pharmacological treatment is indicated, and states that a WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in appropriateness and requires that the clinician use his/her clinical knowledge and experience and refer to the individual patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action.

### The effects of second generation antipsychotic drugs on sleep variables in healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia [^115ckXuL]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a common feature in schizophrenia, and is characterized by an increase of sleep latency (SL), as well as reductions in total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SE). Regarding sleep architecture, non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep latency are decreased, whereas REM sleep tends to remain unchanged. According to polysomnographic studies, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone administration increased TST and/or SE in healthy subjects. Additionally, olanzapine and ziprasidone augmented SWS, while changes corresponding to REM sleep were inconsistent. Furthermore, administration of clozapine, olanzapine and paliperidone to patients with schizophrenia was followed in most instances by a significant reduction of SL and an increase of TST and SE. In addition, olanzapine and paliperidone augmented SWS and REM sleep. By contrast, quetiapine administration further disrupted sleep as judged by the increase of SL, wake time after sleep onset (WASO) and REM sleep latency, and the reduction of SWS and REM sleep. No consistent effects on sleep variables were obtained during treatment with risperidone. To date, no polysomnographic studies have been published on the effects of aripiprazole, asenapine, iloperidone and lurasidone on sleep in either healthy subjects or patients with schizophrenia. Taken together, this evidence supports the conclusion that second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) including clozapine, olanzapine and paliperidone may ameliorate insomnia in patients with schizophrenia.

Temazepam for the treatment of chronic insomnia — recommendation and evidence summary: We suggest that clinicians use temazepam as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. [WEAK] This recommendation is based on trials of 15 mg doses of temazepam. Three randomized controlled trials had small sample sizes of 19, 20, and 34 subjects, respectively, and the overall quality of evidence from these studies is moderate. For temazepam 15 mg, meta‑analyses were conducted for sleep latency (SL), total sleep time (TST), and sleep quality; two studies were included for SL and showed a reduction in subjective SL that exceeded the threshold for clinical significance, while TST meta‑analysis showed improvement in subjective TST of 0.25 standard deviations that was not clinically significant versus placebo. Adverse‑effects data were minimal and did not suggest a high frequency of treatment‑emergent adverse events. Meta‑analysis for temazepam 30 mg was not possible; individual‑study data indicate temazepam 30 mg appears to have significant efficacy for improving subjective SL and TST, and both 15 mg and 30 mg showed a clinically significant effect on objective number of awakenings (NOA), although objective NOA at 20 mg revealed no significant effect. The task force judged that the benefits of temazepam 15 mg appear to be greater than the potential harms.

### Position paper for the treatment of nightmare disorder in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position paper [^112h7RpA]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) position statements — treatment of nightmare disorder in adults are as follows: Image rehearsal therapy is recommended for the treatment of PTSD-associated nightmares and nightmare disorder. The following may be used for the treatment of PTSD-associated nightmares: cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, and exposure, relaxation, and rescripting therapy. The following may be used for the treatment of nightmare disorder: cognitive behavioral therapy, exposure, relaxation, and rescripting therapy, hypnosis, lucid dreaming therapy, progressive deep muscle relaxation, sleep dynamic therapy, self-exposure therapy, systematic desensitization, and testimony therapy. Pharmacologic options that may be used for PTSD-associated nightmares include the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine, risperidone and aripiprazole, clonidine, cyproheptadine, fluvoxamine, gabapentin, nabilone, phenelzine, prazosin, topiramate, trazodone, and tricyclic antidepressants; for nightmare disorder, nitrazepam, prazosin, and triazolam may be used, whereas clonazepam and venlafaxine are not recommended. For context, positions of "recommended" and "not recommended" indicate that a treatment option is clearly useful or ineffective/harmful for most patients, respectively, and positions of "may be used" indicate that the evidence or expert consensus is less clear.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^117DMi1h]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Antipsychotics for chronic insomnia disorder — quetiapine risks and monitoring: Evidence on using low-dose quetiapine is limited to a few studies and case series with short duration, small sample sizes, and vague and incomplete details, making efficacy inconclusive. Doses typically used for insomnia are lower than the FDA-recommended dosage of 150–800 mg/day, and all antipsychotics, including low-dose quetiapine, are known for causing harms; quetiapine has a black box warning indicating a 1.6 to 1.7 fold increase in mortality in elderly populations with dementia-related psychosis. All antipsychotics carry a strong recommendation in the 2023 Beers Criteria to avoid their use in the elderly except in schizophrenia or bipolar disorders due to an increased risk of cerebrovascular accident and a greater rate of cognitive decline and mortality in persons with dementia; anticholinergic effects, including sedating and hypotensive effects, occur with all antipsychotics in varying frequency and severity. It is advised that routine monitoring of metabolic parameters be conducted with all antipsychotics due to the risk of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain, and active-duty service member use of an antipsychotic may affect deploy ability.

### Efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone in the treatment of early psychosis: a randomized, double-blind 52-week comparison [^117FvHsq]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This 52-week randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose, multicenter study evaluated the overall effectiveness (as measured by treatment discontinuation rates) of olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone in patients early in the course of psychotic illness.

Method

Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine (2.5–20 mg/day), quetiapine (100–800 mg/day), or risperidone (0.5–4 mg/day) administered in twice-daily doses. Statistical analyses tested for noninferiority in all-cause treatment discontinuation rates up to 52 weeks (primary outcome measure) based on a prespecified noninferiority margin of 20%.

Results

A total of 400 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine (N = 133), quetiapine (N = 134), or risperidone (N = 133). The mean modal prescribed daily doses were 11.7 mg for olanzapine, 506 mg for quetiapine, and 2.4 mg for risperidone. At week 52, all-cause treatment discontinuation rates were 68.4%, 70.9%, and 71.4% for olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone, respectively. Reductions in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were similar for the three treatment groups, but reductions in PANSS positive subscale scores were greater in the olanzapine group (at 12 weeks and at 52 weeks or withdrawal from study) and the risperidone group (at 12 weeks). The most common elicited adverse events for olanzapine were drowsiness (53%), weight gain (51%), and insomnia (38%); for quetiapine, drowsiness (58%), increased sleep hours (42%), and weight gain (40%); and for risperidone, drowsiness (50%), menstrual irregularities in women (47%), and weight gain (41%).

Conclusions

Olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone demonstrated comparable effectiveness in early-psychosis patients, as indicated by similar rates of all-cause treatment discontinuation.

### Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbance in remitted schizophrenia and bipolar disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116XMMta]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

A second important finding was that, despite evidence for difficulties in sleep initiation and maintenance, which is consistent with insomnia, total time spent asleep and in bed were also significantly increased with large effect sizes in both disorders, consistent with hypersomnia. Though definitions are imprecise, hypersomnia is receiving increasing attention as a core sleep phenotype in bipolar disorder, but remains under-recognized and rarely addressed in schizophrenia. Importantly, the elevated sleep duration parameters in schizophrenia argue that this phenotype may be equally, if not more prevalent, in schizophrenia. Causes of hypersomnia are poorly understood, but may include greater circadian predisposition for long-sleep duration; reduced drive for wakefulness arising from longer time in bed; anergia and fatigue associated with depression and the negative symptom dimension; fewer scheduled daytime occupational and social activities, and use of sleep as a means to escape from distressing symptoms. Additionally, first- and second-generation antipsychotics bind to sleep-wake regulating receptor families, and increase sleep duration and continuity in patients and controls. Agents such as clozapine and olanzapine have a particularly pronounced sleep-promoting and consolidating action,: the significantly greater sleep duration in schizophrenia in comparison to bipolar disorder may therefore follow from the more frequent use of sedative antipsychotics, and at higher doses. The medication meta-regression provided support for this hypothesis, where higher doses of antipsychotic were associated with increased total sleep time, and greater sedative antipsychotic prescription predicted reduced sleep latency. Mood stabilizers are less sedative, although lithium has been shown to lengthen and slow down the circadian period, increasing sleep duration.

Reduced mean motor activity over the 24-hour period in patients, and the associated trend toward an attenuation of the relative amplitude in both disorders, signifies a flattening of the rest-activity profile. This is consistent with an interplay between the 2 contrasting phenotypes described above: decreased daytime activity (consistent with greater sedentary behavior and the effects of sedative medication) and increased activity within the main sleep episode (consistent with fragmented sleep). A vicious cycle can therefore be established, where a reduced drive for wakefulness, secondary to the factors discussed in the previous paragraph, leads to longer time in bed, longer total sleep time, but also reduced sleep propensity, which in turn drives elevated sleep latency and sleep fragmentation (supplementary figure 16). Such a sleep phenotype is consistent with clinical experience and has been induced in volunteers in laboratory studies, where extension of the sleep opportunity promotes not only greater total sleep time, but also longer sleep latency and poorer sleep efficiency.

### Antipsychotic medications and sleep problems in patients with schizophrenia [^117HJp1E]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sleep problems are common and related to a worse quality of life in patients with schizophrenia. Almost all patients with schizophrenia use antipsychotic medications, which usually increase sleep. Still, the differences in subjective sleep outcomes between different antipsychotic medications are not entirely clear.

Methods

This study assessed 5466 patients with schizophrenia and is part of the nationwide Finnish SUPER study. We examined how the five most common antipsychotic medications (clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, and risperidone) associate with questionnaire-based sleep problems in logistic regression analyses, including head-to-head analyses between different antipsychotic medications. The sleep problems were difficulties initiating sleep, early morning awakenings, fatigue, poor sleep quality, short (≤ 6 h) and long sleep duration (≥ 10 h).

Results

The average number of antipsychotic medications was 1.59 per patient. Clozapine was associated with long sleep duration (49.0% of clozapine users vs 30.2% of other patients, OR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.83–2.30, p < .001). Olanzapine and risperidone were in head-to-head analyses associated with less sleep problems than patients using aripiprazole, quetiapine, or no antipsychotic medication. Aripiprazole and quetiapine were associated with more insomnia symptoms and poorer sleep quality. Patients without antipsychotic medications (N = 159) had poorer sleep quality than patients with antipsychotic use, and short sleep duration was common (21.5% of patients not using antipsychotics vs 7.8% of patients using antipsychotics, OR = 2.97, 95% CI 1.98–4.44, p < .001).

Conclusions

Prevalence of sleep problems is markedly related to the antipsychotic medication the patient uses. These findings underline the importance of considering and assessing sleep problems when treating schizophrenia patients with antipsychotics.

### Pharmacologic treatment of insomnia disorder: an evidence report for a clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians [^112AiBos]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacologic interventions are often prescribed for insomnia disorder.

Purpose

To assess the benefits, harms, and comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for adults with insomnia disorder.

Data Sources

Several electronic databases (2004-September 2015), reference lists, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents.

Study Selection

35 randomized, controlled trials of at least 4 weeks' duration that evaluated pharmacotherapies available in the United States and that reported global or sleep outcomes; 11 long-term observational studies that reported harm information; FDA review data for nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics and orexin receptor antagonists; and product labels for all agents.

Data Extraction

Data extraction by single investigator confirmed by a second reviewer; dual-investigator assessment of risk of bias; consensus determination of strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant improved short-term global and sleep outcomes compared with placebo, although absolute effect sizes were small (low- to moderate-strength evidence). Evidence for benzodiazepine hypnotics, melatonin agonists, and antidepressants, and for most pharmacologic interventions in older adults, was insufficient or low strength. Evidence was also insufficient to compare efficacy within or across pharmacotherapy classes or versus behavioral therapy. Harms evidence reported in trials was judged insufficient or low strength; observational studies suggested that use of hypnotics for insomnia was associated with increased risk for dementia, fractures, and major injury. The FDA documents reported that most pharmacotherapies had risks for cognitive and behavioral changes, including driving impairment, and other adverse effects, and they advised dose reduction in women and in older adults.

Limitations

Most trials were small and short term and enrolled individuals meeting stringent criteria. Minimum important differences in outcomes were often not established or reported. Data were scant for many treatments.

Conclusion

Eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant may improve short-term global and sleep outcomes for adults with insomnia disorder, but the comparative effectiveness and long-term efficacy of pharmacotherapies for insomnia are not known. Pharmacotherapies for insomnia may cause cognitive and behavioral changes and may be associated with infrequent but serious harms.

### Low doses of mirtazapine or quetiapine for transient insomnia: a randomised, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial [^113MoHdY]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Low doses of the antidepressant mirtazapine or the neuroleptic quetiapine are often prescribed off-label for insomnia. However, studies on the effects on sleep and hangover effects the following day are scarce. In this randomised, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial, the influence of 7.5 mg mirtazapine and 50 mg quetiapine on both normal sleep and sleep disturbed by acoustic stress (traffic noise) as a model for transient insomnia was assessed. Additionally, hangover effects on next-day alertness and cognitive functioning were examined. A total of 19 healthy men without sleep complaints completed three treatment sessions, each session consisting of three consecutive nights in one of the mirtazapine, quetiapine or placebo conditions. Sleep was assessed using polysomnography and the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire. Daytime sleepiness and cognitive functioning were assessed using the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, Digit Symbol Substitution Task, Psychomotor Vigilance Task and an addition task. Under acoustic stress, both mirtazapine and quetiapine increased total sleep time by half an hour and reduced the number of awakenings by 35–40% compared to placebo. While quetiapine specifically increased the duration of non-rapid eye movement sleep, stage N2, mirtazapine mainly increased deep sleep stage N3. Subjects reported that both mirtazapine and quetiapine eased getting to sleep and improved sleep quality. Both drugs caused daytime sleepiness and lessened sustained attention. These findings support the use of low doses of mirtazapine and quetiapine for the treatment of insomnia. Further prospective studies on the long-term effects regarding effectiveness and adverse effects are needed.

### Multimodal sleep, an innovation for treating chronic insomnia: case report and literature review [^113RAJHB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The authors present the clinical case of a 67-year-old man with severe insomnia for 5 years with an exacerbation about 1 year before consultation. He did not have enough concentration and energy for his daily work and developed depression and anxiety because of his excessive daytime sleepiness. During his insomniac state, a drug treatment provided partial relief, but the effects were not long-lasting. Consequently, the drug dosage increased, and major side effects gradually manifested. We decided to use a completely new therapeutic strategy for this patient to improve his sleep quality and mental symptoms. In time, the patient could stop oral medications and that is multimodal sleep. After the end of multimodal sleep, the patient typically experiences improvement in sleep quality and architecture. Additionally, the dosage of hypnotics used before multimodal sleep is discontinued without severe withdrawal symptoms.

### Assessment of strategies for switching patients from olanzapine to risperidone: a randomized, open-label, rater-blinded study [^112zLU3o]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Medication

The oral dose of risperidone for all patients in all three strategies was 1 mg twice daily for the first 3 days, followed by 2 mg twice daily for the next 4 days. Further dose adjustments or conversion to a single daily dose could be made at the end of the first week according to the investigator's judgment. Patients were randomly assigned to discontinue olanzapine according to one of the following three treatment strategies (Figure 1):

Figure 1
Dosing schedules for the three strategies.

(1) Abrupt: olanzapine was discontinued on the day of risperidone initiation (beginning of week 0).

(2) Gradual 1: the study entry dose of olanzapine was reduced by half (or as close to half of the starting dose as possible) on the day of risperidone initiation. The reduced dose of olanzapine was given for 1 week and then discontinued. The risperidone dose was adjusted as described above.

(3) Gradual 2: the study entry dose of olanzapine remained unchanged for the first week of the study while risperidone was initiated and adjusted as described above. At the end of the first week, the dose of olanzapine was reduced to half of the study entry dose (or as close to half of the starting dose as possible) and then discontinued at the end of the second week.

Any other medication prescribed at a steady dose for at least 3 weeks before randomization could be continued during the trial. Any psychotropic medication other than antipsychotics prescribed before randomization was continued at the study entry dose throughout the trial. The only psychotropic medications that could be introduced during the study period were lorazepam (at most 12 mg/day) for agitation or anxiety and zolpidem tartrate (at most 10 mg/day) for insomnia. Medications prescribed before the trial to control movement disorders could be discontinued or the dose reduced or increased. Benztropine or propranolol could be initiated to control reversible movement disorders if clinically necessary.

### Risperidone versus olanzapine for schizophrenia [^115rZ3N7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Antipsychotic medication is a mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia. Risperidone and olanzapine are popular choices among the new generation drugs.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effects, safety and cost effectiveness of risperidone compared with olanzapine for treating schizophrenia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (Sept 2005) which is based on regular searches of, amongst others, BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. We also contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included all clinical randomised trials comparing risperidone with olanzapine for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

Main Results

We found no difference for the outcome of unchanged or worse in the short term (n = 548, 2 RCTs, RR 1.00 CI 0.88 to 1.15). One study favoured olanzapine for the outcome of relapse/rehospitalisation by 12 months (n = 279, 1 RCT, RR 2.16 CI 1.31 to 3.54, NNH 7 CI 3 to 25). Most mental state data showed the two drugs to be as effective as each other (n = 552, 2 RCTs, RR 'no < 20% decrease PANSS by eight weeks' 1.01 CI 0.87 to 1.16). Both drugs commonly cause adverse events: 75% given either drug experience an adverse event; 20% anticholinergic symptoms; both groups experienced insomnia although it was more frequent with risperidone (n = 1588, 5 RCTs, RR 1.41 CI 1.15 to 1.72, NNH 15 CI 9 to 41); about 30% experienced sleepiness (n = 1713, 6 RCTs, RR 0.92 CI 0.79 to 1.07). People given either drug often experienced some extrapyramidal symptoms (n = 893, 3 RCTs, RR 1.18 CI 0.75 to 1.88); 25% of people using risperidone required medication to alleviate these symptoms (n = 419, 2 RCTs, RR 1.76 CI 1.25 to 2.48, NNH 8 CI 4 to 25). People allocated to risperidone were less likely to gain weight compared with those given olanzapine and the weight gain was often considerable and of quick onset (n = 984, 2 RCTs, RR gain more than 7% of their baseline weight in short term 0.47 CI 0.36 to 0.61, NNH 7 CI 6 to 10). Risperidone participants were less likely to leave the study due to metabolic side effects and weight gain compared with olanzapine (n = 667, 1RCT, RR 0.19 CI 0.08 to 0.45). Patients on risperidone were more likely to experience abnormal ejaculation (n = 370, 2 RCTs, RR 4.36 CI 1.38 to 13.76, NNH 20 CI 6 to 176). Both drugs are associated with high attrition rates; in the long term consistent findings show that 66% of those allocated risperidone left the study early compared with 56% given olanzapine (n = 1440, 5 RCTs, RR 1.17 CI 1.08 to 1.27, NNH 11 CI 7 to 23).

Authors' Conclusions

We know very little of the effects of these drugs regarding service outcomes, general functioning and behaviours, engagement with services and treatment satisfaction from evaluative studies. There was generally a high rate of attrition in the trials and there appears to be little to differentiate between risperidone and olanzapine except on issues of adverse effects. Both drugs are associated with a reduction in psychotic symptoms but both commonly cause unpleasant adverse effects.

### Therapeutic options in the treatment of insomnia [^117NP9tP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies both have roles in the treatment of insomnia. The benzodiazepines, when first introduced, were a major improvement over earlier treatments for insomnia in terms of their safety and efficacy. Since then, the nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists have been developed, which have provided advantages over the older medications and are currently first-line medication treatment for insomnia. Although antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are often prescribed for the treatment of insomnia, they are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this indication and have side effects that are sometimes severe. New types of medications that have different modes of action from the benzodiazepine receptor agonists are now being developed, and one, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, has recently been approved for treatment of insomnia. Nonpharmacologic therapies can also help patients learn how to fall asleep faster and improve sleep quality. It is important for physicians to teach patients good sleep hygiene as part of their treatment. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective in the treatment of insomnia, alone and in combination with pharmacotherapy, but finding a qualified provider can be difficult and the patient must be willing to take the time to learn the therapies and wait for them to show effect.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112JJKpB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this guideline is to establish clinical practice recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is clinically indicated. Unlike previous meta-analyses, which focused on broad classes of drugs, this guideline focuses on individual drugs commonly used to treat insomnia. It includes drugs that are FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, as well as several drugs commonly used to treat insomnia without an FDA indication for this condition. This guideline should be used in conjunction with other AASM guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of chronic insomnia in adults.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of four experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, and patient values and preferences. Literature reviews are provided for those pharmacologic agents for which sufficient evidence was available to establish recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guideline for clinicians in choosing a specific pharmacological agent for treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is indicated. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should, under most circumstances, follow. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients, but should not be construed as an indication of ineffectiveness. GRADE recommendation strengths do not refer to the magnitude of treatment effects in a particular patient, but rather, to the strength of evidence in published data. Downgrading the quality of evidence for these treatments is predictable in GRADE, due to the funding source for most pharmacological clinical trials and the attendant risk of publication bias; the relatively small number of eligible trials for each individual agent; and the observed heterogeneity in the data. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. We suggest that clinicians use suvorexant as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use eszopiclone as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use zaleplon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use zolpidem as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use triazolam as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use temazepam as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use ramelteon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use doxepin as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use trazodone as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use tiagabine as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use diphenhydramine as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use melatonin as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use tryptophan as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use valerian as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK).

Safety

Adverse events were generally reported to be mild. Adverse events were reported in 73%, 90%, and 79% of the abrupt, gradual 1, and gradual 2 groups, respectively; these were mild or moderate in 93%, 89%, and 91% of patients who experienced an adverse event. Adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients in any treatment group were insomnia, anxiety, sedation, somnolence, headache, and aggravated psychosis (Table 4). The overall between-group difference in the incidence of aggravated psychosis was significant (p = 0.0483, exact test). The incidence of movement disorders was low in the three treatment groups throughout the 6-week study. Discontinuation because of an adverse event was reported in 5%, 15%, and 5% in the abrupt, gradual 1, and gradual 2 groups, respectively (Table 1). Discontinuations because of adverse events during the first 2-week transition period were low in all three study groups, with one each in the abrupt and gradual 2 groups and two in the gradual 1 group. The incidence of movement disorders was low in all three groups during the first 2 weeks, with one report in each group.

Table 4
Adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients in any treatment group.

No significant changes from baseline to week 6 or endpoint were seen in vital signs, body weight, or anthropometric measurements in any treatment group, with the exception of a significant reduction in mean standing diastolic blood pressure at week 6 and endpoint in the abrupt group only (-6.6 mmHg at week 6, p = 0.005; and -5.5 mmHg at endpoint, p = 0.0167; paired t -test). In the gradual 1 and 2 groups the respective values were -1.6 and 0.1 mmHg and 2.2 and 2.2 mmHg.

Significant improvements from baseline to endpoint in levels of total cholesterol (-8.22 mg/dl; p = 0.0075), very-low-density lipoprotein (-4.11 mg/dl; p = 0.0359), apolipoprotein A1 (-4.32 mg/dl; p = 0.0372), apolipoprotein B (-8.42 mg/dl; p < 0.0001), and triglycerides (-20.5 mg/dl; p = 0.0364) were seen in the pooled patient group (paired t -test). These data have been discussed in more detail elsewhere.

### COVID-19 patients managed in psychiatric inpatient settings due to first-episode mental disorders in wuhan, China: clinical characteristics, treatments, outcomes, and our experiences [^116yzuwU]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Possibly because these patients were psychotropic-naïve before admission, they responded very well and quickly to psychotropic medications: as displayed in Fig. 2, from baseline to week 2, the proportion of patients with mild psychotic symptoms had decreased from 60.0 to 5.6%, and proportions of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms also substantially decreased from 96.0 to 27.8% and from 96.0 to 38.9%, respectively. In addition, doses of psychotropic medications used in the COVID-19 group were generally lower than the control group (i.e. olanzapine: 2.5–5 mg/day for combination therapy and 10–15 mg/day for monotherapy). The use of olanzapine in treating mental disorders in COVID-19 patients deserves to be emphasized despite its side effect of metabolic syndrome and obesity. Because many patients had insomnia and decreased appetite, a low-dose olanzapine alone or in combination with other medication was administered to nearly a half of the patients. Olanzapine has relatively potent sedative and appetite-increasing effects, which may be of benefit to certain patients. Indeed, we did observe that patients slept well and ate well after the administration of olanzapine. We consider that psychiatric medication treatment is an essential component of the symptomatic treatment strategy for COVID-19 patients with mental disorders, even more important than respiratory treatment. This is because it facilitates adherence with the respiratory treatment and hence may lead to the earlier recovery of patients.

### Current, emerging, and newly available insomnia medications [^115yN292]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Research into the sleep-wake cycle has provided new treatment targets for patients with insomnia as well as a better understanding of how medications affect sleep processes. Current insomnia medications, including benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, focus on enhancing sleep-promoting systems through broad antagonism of GABA. Other medications that promote sleep by blocking wake-promoting systems include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antihistamines, but adverse effects and nonspecific therapeutic effects limit their use. New and emerging insomnia medications are focusing on blocking wake-promoting systems via more selective antagonism of orexin, serotonin, and norepinephrine. These medications may offer improved efficacy with fewer adverse effects.

### The efficacy and the incidence of drowsiness with different modified administrations of olanzapine in preventing chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting… [^1139sXTj]. ASCO (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract 121 Background: Olanzapine is now widely used for preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The recommended oral administration is 10 mg at bedtime. However, drowsiness is one of common side effects of olanzapine. Several modified administrations of olanzapine, such as dose reduction and early taken are being tried in clinical practice to avoid drowsiness. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 500 patients who used olanzapine for CINV from January 2018 to January 2019 in our department. Eligible criteria include patients who used the constant administration of olanzapine for at least four days to prevent acute and delayed CINV. Patients were grouped into three groups according to three different administrations of olanzapine as full dose, half dose, and early taken. Eligible patients were randomly selected in each group as a ratio of 1: 1:

1.

The frequency of CINV, the incidence of drowsiness and the duration of olanzapine administration were collected and compared. Results: There are 267 patients met the criteria and 48 patients in each group. The median frequency of CINV per day in all 144 patients was 3, 1, 1 on day 1 to 3 after chemotherapy respectively. The frequency of CINV was not different among three groups. The incidence of drowsiness was 38%, 20%, and 23% in full dose, half dose and early taken groups. The median days of administration were 5, 10 and 6 days in full dose, half dose and early taken group, respectively. Conclusions: Modified administration of olanzapine, both by dose reduction and early taken, could have similar effect in preventing CINV but reduced the incidence of the side effect as drowsiness. Further study should be done to explore the proper administration of olanzapine in preventing CINV.

### Optimal duration of risperidone or olanzapine adjunctive therapy to mood stabilizer following remission of a manic episode: a CANMAT randomized double-blind trial [^114c3zhL]. Molecular Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Trial design and interventions

This study was a multi-center three-parallel-group randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with up to 52 weeks of follow-up. After obtaining informed consent, patients were randomized to one of the three groups. Randomizations were stratified by drug combination and by center. The treating clinicians and all research personnel except the trial statistician and the pharmacist were blinded to treatment arm allocations. Patients randomized to the '0-weeks' group tapered and discontinued risperidone or olanzapine over 2 weeks beginning on the day of randomization and received placebo substitution for the remaining 50 weeks. Patients randomized to the '24-weeks' group received risperidone or olanzapine for 24 weeks. The antipsychotic was tapered and discontinued over the next 2 weeks with the placebo substitution for the remaining 26 weeks. Patients randomized to the '52-weeks' group continued risperidone or olanzapine for 52 weeks. All patients continued the same mood stabilizer (lithium or valproate) they had been taking at study entry and serum levels were maintained within the therapeutic ranges (0.6–1.2 mmol/L for lithium and 350–830 μmol/L for valproate) throughout the 52 weeks. The dose and type of atypical antipsychotic were the same as the patient had been on at entry into the study. Allowed dosages for risperidone were 1–6 mg per day and olanzapine 5–25 mg per day. Patients were not allowed to receive any other psychotropic medication except benzodiazepines for sedation and anti-parkinsonian medication for extrapyramidal side effects. Patients were allowed to receive psychoeducation and counseling regarding sleep hygiene, healthy daily routines and rhythms, alcohol and substance abuse, anxiety management, conflict resolution and problem solving, as clinically indicated as part of their ongoing clinical care.

### The assessment and management of insomnia: an update [^112xjy2k]. World Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Insomnia poses significant challenges to public health. It is a common condition associated with marked impairment in function and quality of life, psychiatric and physical morbidity, and accidents. As such, it is important that effective treatment is provided in clinical practice. To this end, this paper reviews critical aspects of the assessment of insomnia and the available treatment options. These options include both non-medication treatments, most notably cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, and a variety of pharmacologic therapies such as benzodiazepines, "z-drugs", melatonin receptor agonists, selective histamine H1 antagonists, orexin antagonists, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and non-selective antihistamines. A review of the available research indicates that rigorous double-blind, randomized, controlled trials are lacking for some of the most commonly administered insomnia therapies. However, there are an array of interventions which have been demonstrated to have therapeutic effects in insomnia in trials with the above features, and whose risk/benefit profiles have been well characterized. These interventions can form the basis for systematic, evidence-based treatment of insomnia in clinical practice. We review this evidence base and highlight areas where more studies are needed, with the aim of providing a resource for improving the clinical management of the many patients with insomnia.

### Olanzapine and clozapine differently affect sleep in patients with schizophrenia: results from a double-blind, polysomnographic study and review of the literature [^113iVP2i]. Schizophrenia Research (2014). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia is associated with impaired sleep continuity. The second generation antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine have been reported to improve sleep continuity but also to rarely induce restless legs syndrome (RLS). The aims of this randomized double-blind study were to compare the effects of clozapine and olanzapine on sleep and the occurrence of RLS. Therefore, polysomnographies were recorded and RLS symptoms were assessed in 30 patients with schizophrenia before and after 2, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment with either clozapine or olanzapine. Treatment with both antipsychotics increased total sleep time, sleep period time and sleep efficiency and decreased sleep onset latency. These changes were similar in both groups, occurred during the first 2 treatment weeks and were sustained. For example, sleep efficiency increased from 83% (olanzapine) and 82% (clozapine) at baseline to 95% at week 2 and 97% at week 6 in both treatment groups. Sleep architecture was differently affected: clozapine caused a significantly stronger increase of stage 2 sleep (44%) than olanzapine (11%) but olanzapine a significantly stronger increase of REM-sleep. Olanzapine caused an 80% increase of slow wave sleep whereas clozapine caused a 6% decrease. No patient reported any of 4 RLS defining symptoms at baseline. During treatment, 1 patient of each group reported at one visit all 4 symptoms, i.e. met the diagnosis of an RLS. In conclusion, sleep continuity similarly improved and sleep architecture changed more physiologically with olanzapine. Neither of the antipsychotics induced RLS symptoms that were clinically relevant.

### Adjunctive olanzapine for SSRI-resistant combat-related PTSD: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^112ua4Zp]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), particularly in combat veterans with chronic illness, is often refractory to standard pharmacological interventions. There is a need to test adjunctive treatments to boost response.

Method

Subjects were 19 patients with PTSD who were minimally responsive to 12 weeks of treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) at maximum tolerated dose. Outcomes were compared among subjects whose treatment was augmented with 8 weeks of double-blind olanzapine or placebo administration.

Results

Olanzapine augmentation was associated with statistically significantly greater reduction than placebo in specific measures of posttraumatic stress, depressive, and sleep disorder symptoms. Clinician-rated global response rates did not, however, significantly differ between groups.

Conclusions

This is most likely the first double-blind, placebo-controlled study of an adjunct to SSRIs for PTSD. Despite the small group size, the findings suggest a role for olanzapine or other atypical antipsychotics in treating SSRI-resistant PTSD. Sleep symptoms may especially benefit.

Sleep disorders are common in the general population and even more so in clinical practice, yet are relatively poorly understood by doctors and other health care practitioners. These British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines are designed to address this problem by providing an accessible up-to-date and evidence-based outline of the major issues, especially those relating to reliable diagnosis and appropriate treatment. A consensus meeting was held in London in May 2009. Those invited to attend included BAP members, representative clinicians with a strong interest in sleep disorders and recognized experts and advocates in the field, including a representative from mainland Europe and the USA. Presenters were asked to provide a review of the literature and identification of the standard of evidence in their area, with an emphasis on meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials where available, plus updates on current clinical practice. Each presentation was followed by discussion, aimed to reach consensus where the evidence and/or clinical experience was considered adequate or otherwise to flag the area as a direction for future research. A draft of the proceedings was then circulated to all participants for comment. Key subsequent publications were added by the writer and speakers at draft stage. All comments were incorporated as far as possible in the final document, which represents the views of all participants although the authors take final responsibility for the document.

Background

Description of the condition

Insomnia involves difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep with associated daytime consequences, not due to environmental factors or inadequate sleep opportunities, as defined by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD‐3). Chronic insomnia persists for at least three months, with symptoms occurring at least three times per week, while short‐term insomnia lasts less than three months. Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder, with approximately 6% to 10% of the population meeting the criteria for insomnia; up to 25% of adults being dissatisfied with their sleep; and up to 10% to 15% experiencing insomnia symptoms severe enough to cause daytime distress or impairments. Insomnia prevalence increases with age and is twice as prevalent in women as in men. It often presents independently or alongside other medical or psychiatric conditions such as chronic pain, fibromyalgia, cancer, major depression, or substance misuse. It is characterised by dissatisfaction with sleep quality or duration, difficulty falling asleep, waking up at night or too early in the morning, or non‐restorative sleep, leading to daytime fatigue, low energy, cognition issues, and mood disturbances.

Despite its high prevalence and burden, insomnia often remains unrecognised and untreated, being a major public health issue due to the associated increased risk for medical (e.g. hypertension), psychiatric (e.g. depression), and occupational (e.g. absenteeism) morbidity and mortality. Treatment should be initiated promptly when individuals report sleep disturbances, particularly if these complaints are severe enough to meet the criteria for an insomnia disorder. Treatment options include non‐pharmacological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBTi) and sleep hygiene education, which are first‐line treatments with reported improvement in approximately 60% of patients. Pharmacological therapies include antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, trazodone), benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g. flurazepam, eszopiclone), and antipsychotics (e.g. quetiapine, olanzapine).

### Olanzapine and fluoxetine [^116tUPK5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5. **Increase in weight (weight gain)**: Weight gain is common in people who take olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Children and adolescents (10 to 17 years old) who received olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, were more likely to gain weight and to gain more weight than adults. Some people may gain a lot of weight while taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, so you and your doctor should check your weight regularly. Talk to your doctor about ways to control weight gain, such as eating a healthy, balanced diet, and exercising.

What are olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules?

Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are a prescription medicine used for:

short-term treatment of episodes of depression that happen with Bipolar I Disorder in people age 10 or older.
treatment of episodes of depression that do not respond to 2 other medicines, also called treatment resistant depression, in adults.

Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules contain two medicines, olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride.

It is not known if olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are safe and effective in children under the age of 10.

The symptoms of Bipolar I Disorder include alternating periods of depression and high or irritable mood, increased activity and restlessness, racing thoughts, talking fast, impulsive behavior, and a decreased need for sleep. With treatment, some of your symptoms of Bipolar I Disorder may improve.

### Effect of interventions for the management of sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1127ngmr]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Given that the pathophysiology of long COVID and its impact on sleep is not fully understood, the development of targeted treatments remains uncertain. Currently, there is no standardized protocol specifically addressing long COVID–associated sleep disturbances, though interventions involving nonpharmacological approaches are increasingly explored due to their generally lower risks and side effects. Guezguez et alsuggest that recommendations endorsed by the European Academy for managing sleep problems during the pandemic can be extended to patients with long COVID. This includes cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, sleep hygiene improvement, and relaxation therapies. On the pharmacological side, National Center for Infectious Diseases physicians manage symptoms through the use of melatoninand antidepressants. However, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends against the use of melatonin and trazodone for the treatment of chronic insomnia, citing insufficient evidence of efficacy. The application of these agents in long COVID may reflect off-label use driven by clinical need, although further research is warranted. This divergence reflects a broader lack of consensus on managing of long COVID–associated sleep disturbances, underscoring the need for high-quality studies to inform standardized care and determine the long-term effectiveness and safety of various interventions for sleep disturbances in long COVID.

This research aims to compile and evaluate current evidence on the interventions for sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID, through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. By assessing effectiveness, it seeks to identify promising interventions and pinpoint areas requiring further research, aiming to enhance clinical decision-making and care quality for affected individuals.

### Risperidone versus olanzapine for schizophrenia [^112Lk9nj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Antipsychotic medication is a mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia and risperidone and olanzapine are the most popular treatment choice of the new generation drugs.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effects, safety and cost effectiveness of risperidone compared with olanzapine for treating schizophrenia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (June 2004) which is based on regular searches of, amongst others, BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. We also contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included all clinical randomised trials comparing risperidone with olanzapine for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

Main Results

We found no difference for the outcome of unchanged or worse in the short term (n = 548, 2 RCTs, RR 1.00 CI 0.88 to 1.15). One study, sponsored by the manufactures of olanzapine, favoured this drug for the outcome of relapse/rehospitalisation by 12 months (n = 279, RR 2.16 CI 1.31 to 3.54, NNT 7 CI 4 to 25). Most mental state data showed the two drugs to as effective as each other (n = 552, 2 RCTs, RR 'no < 20% decrease PANSS by eight weeks' 1.01 CI 0.87 to 1.16). At least two thirds of people given risperidone or olanzapine experienced an adverse event (n = 300, 2 RCTs, RR 1.16 CI 0.70 to 1.94). About 20% had anticholinergic symptoms (n = 719, 3 RCTs, RR 1.12 CI 0.77 to 1.63) and 20% of both groups experienced insomnia (n = 594, 3 RCTs, RR 1.33 CI 0.95 to 1.85) and approximately 33% sleepiness (n = 719, 4 RCTs, 0.99 CI 0.79 to 1.23). One third of people given either drug experienced some extrapyramidal symptoms (n = 893, 3 RCTs, RR 1.18 CI 0.75 to 1.88) but 25% of people using risperidone require medication to alleviate extrapyramidal adverse effects (n = 419, 2 RCTs, RR 1.76 CI 1.25 to 2.48, NNH 8 CI 4 to 25). People allocated to risperidone were less likely to gain weight compared with those given olanzapine and the weight gain resulting from olanzapine can be considerable and of rapid onset (n = 377, 1 RCT, RR gain more than 7% of their baseline weight 0.40 CI 0.23 to 0.70, NNT 8 CI 6 to 17). Risperidone may cause more sexual dysfunction than olanzapine (n = 370, 2 RCTs, RR abnormal ejaculation 4.36 CI 1.38 to 13.76, NNH 20 CI 6 to 176; n = 31, 1 RCT, RR impotence 2.43 CI 0.24 to 24.07). Within trials both drugs are associated with equal attrition (n = 1217, 7 RCTs, RR leaving the study early 1.17 CI 0.92 to 1.49).

Authors' Conclusions

Data regarding quality of life and economic outcomes are difficult to interpret, and for both these highly marketed new drugs we know very little from evaluative studies regarding service outcomes, general functioning and behaviour, engagement with services and treatment satisfaction. There is little to differentiate between risperidone and olanzapine except on the issue of adverse effects and both these drugs have unpleasant adverse effects. Risperidone is particularly associated with movement disorders and sexual dysfunction. Olanzapine can cause considerable rapid weight gain. This review highlights the need for large, independent, well designed, conducted and reported pragmatic randomised studies.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^112Fxg5n]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DOD Clinical Practice Guideline — antidepressants, antihistamines, and antipsychotics for chronic insomnia disorder: The systematic evidence review did not identify any evidence that met inclusion criteria regarding these agents in treating chronic insomnia disorder. Antidepressants and first-generation antihistamines are often considered for insomnia due to sedating/drowsiness properties, and diphenhydramine and doxylamine succinate are indicated to help reduce the difficulty in falling asleep, but evidence for using these agents and other antihistamines is not supported by rigorous data. Antipsychotics are used off-label, with quetiapine the most common, often in patients with concomitant psychiatric disorders.

### Sedation as a side effect of the treatment of mental disorders [^116sUFst]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Many patients with schizophrenia experience disturbances in their sleep-wake cycle, which may be a result of the disorder itself, of pharmacotherapy, or of a comorbid sleep disorder. These sleep disruptions can seriously impair patients' functioning as well as their quality of life. Therefore, accurate assessment of sleep problems is essential to appropriately treat patients and promote symptomatic remission. The sedative versus therapeutic effects of atypical antipsychotics should be considered in the risk-benefit analysis performed before and while medicating patients.

Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed.
Call the healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings.
Keep all follow-up visits with the healthcare provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms.

Call a healthcare provider right away if you or your family member has any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you:

thoughts about suicide or dying
attempts to commit suicide
new or worse depression
new or worse anxiety
feeling very agitated or restless
panic attacks
trouble sleeping (insomnia)
new or worse irritability
acting aggressive, being angry, or violent
acting on dangerous impulses
an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania)
or other unusual changes in behavior or mood.

What else do I need to know about antidepressant medicines?

Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenly can cause other symptoms.
Antidepressants are medicines used to treat depression and other illnesses. It is important to discuss all the risks of treating depression and also the risks of not treating it. Patients and their families or other caregivers should discuss all treatment choices with the healthcare provider, not just the use of antidepressants.
Antidepressant medicines have other side effects. Talk to the healthcare provider about the side effects of the medicine prescribed for you or your family member.
Antidepressant medicines can interact with other medicines. Know all of the medicines that you or your family member takes. Keep a list of all medicines to show the healthcare provider. Do not start new medicines without first checking with your healthcare provider.
Not all antidepressant medicines prescribed for children are FDA approved for use in children. Talk to your child's healthcare provider for more information.

### Olanzapine for managing side effects from antiangiogenic tyrosine-kinase inhibitors [^1171JfLH]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Side effects from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are common and burdensome. Olanzapine is useful for managing symptoms from conventional chemotherapy, but its role in treating TKI-related side effects is unclear.

Objectives

Examine the efficacy of olanzapine for TKI-induced nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, and insomnia.

Methods

All patients prescribed olanzapine with lenvatinib, cabozantinib, axitinib, or tivozanib at Mayo Clinic between January 2018 and June 2024 were assessed for inclusion. For baseline assessment, clinical notes documenting symptoms and indication(s) for starting olanzapine were reviewed. Notes and portal messages from the first three months after starting olanzapine were then evaluated for qualitative descriptions of change in symptom burden. Data were categorized as "improved", "worsened", "stable", or "missing data", with each symptom domain analyzed independently, when olanzapine was prescribed for multiple interrelated symptoms.

Results

Sixty patients received olanzapine, most commonly 5 mg (n = 37, 61.7%) or 2.5 mg (n = 16, 26.6%). Indications included nausea without vomiting (n = 35), anorexia (n = 25), nausea with vomiting (n = 16), weight loss (n = 16), and insomnia (n = 11). It was given for multiple symptoms in 32 patients. Within the first 3 months, 85% of patients had improvement in nausea without vomiting, 93% in nausea with vomiting, 74% in appetite, and 85% in sleep. Among 34 patients with weight loss prior to olanzapine, 50% gained weight (median: 6.1 kg), 26% stabilized (± 1 kg), and 24% continued to lose weight. Only 4 patients discontinued olanzapine due to side effects.

Conclusion

Olanzapine appears effective in treating TKI-induced nausea, vomiting, anorexia, insomnia, and weight loss, warranting further investigation in prospective studies.

Ramelteon for the treatment of chronic insomnia — recommendation and evidence appraisal: We suggest that clinicians use ramelteon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. [WEAK] Four RCTs investigated ramelteon; the overall quality of evidence was downgraded to very low due to substantial heterogeneity, imprecision, and potential publication bias. The overall evidence was weakly in favor of effectiveness for sleep onset disturbance only, with minimal increase in PSG-determined total sleep time well below the threshold for clinical significance, and measures of sleep efficiency and sleep quality showed no clinically significant improvement. There was no evidence of significant difference from placebo for any adverse events, and based on clinical judgement the task force determined that the majority of well-informed patients would use ramelteon over no treatment.

Flurazepam — adverse effects and next-day impairment: At 30 mg, 68% of subjects experienced an adverse event versus 43% on placebo, and approximately 50% reported somnolence; another trial found a significant increase in side effects with 30 mg and that 73% of "undetermined" effects were somnolence. No significant difference in adverse events was observed for 15 mg versus placebo and no difference in somnolence rates for 30 mg versus placebo. Performance effects included significant impairment with 30 mg and significantly shorter Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) sleep latencies at the beginning and end of treatment; additional impairments were noted in digit symbol substitution, serial learning, and divided attention. Somnolence occurred in 1 of 13 flurazepam subjects versus 4/14 placebo. A crossover study reported impaired daytime performance with 30 mg and a higher "hangover effect", with morning drowsiness/hangover in 11 of 30 on flurazepam, 3 of 30 during the 15 mg period, and 2 of 30 on placebo. Adverse events were 73% with 30 mg and 23% with placebo in another study.

### Optimizing treatment for insomnia [^117Hf3YP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

By tailoring the mechanism of action and effects of therapy to the specific nature of each patient's insomnia and other conditions, clinicians can offer personalized care in an attempt to achieve an improved risk-benefit ratio compared to that of a "one-size-fits-all" treatment strategy. To move toward this personalization and optimization of treatment, clinicians need awareness of the specific effects of interventions and the subpopulations with insomnia who would benefit from each intervention. This report reviews insomnia treatments, focusing on effects associated with mechanism of action.

### Deprescribing antipsychotics for behavioral and… [^113QGiFA]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

- Antipsychotics prescribed for primary or secondary insomnia, in which comorbidities are under control, should be discontinued without tapering. From the AFP Editors. Antipsychotics have been shown to be effective for treating behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in older persons and are commonly used to treat insomnia; however, these medications are often continued in the long term without appropriate supervision and reassessment of their benefit. Because these medications are linked to significant adverse effects, including a greater risk of death and increased cerebrovascular events, deprescribing is recommended in appropriate patients. As part of the Deprescribing Guidelines in the Elderly Project, a Canadian team consisting of two family physicians, one geriatric psychiatrist, two geriatricians, and four pharmacists has provided recommendations to guide physicians in deprescribing antipsychotics for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia and insomnia. The team concluded that the benefits of deprescribing outweigh the harms in this population. If the patient has been taking the medication long term, or the initial symptoms were severe, a slower tapering method is recommended with monitoring for signs of withdrawal, such as delusions, and benefits, such as improved alertness. It should be noted that tapering approaches should be individualized based on the patient's initial dosage, availability of other dosage options, and tolerance to tapering. Insomnia There is limited evidence to support the use of antipsychotics in insomnia.

Regardless of treatment duration, antipsychotics prescribed for primary or secondary insomnia in which comorbidities are under control should be discontinued without tapering. If the duration of treatment with antipsychotics has been short, immediate discontinuation is recommended. If treatment duration has been longer or there are concerns about adverse effects, a tapering regimen should be considered before discontinuation. If insomnia returns, counseling on the importance of reducing substances such as caffeine and alcohol and on nonpharmacologic options to aid with sleep should be provided. Other medications can be considered based on their safety and effectiveness.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116jL6Yv]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — evidence grading and meta-analysis constraints states that quality of evidence grades for randomized clinical trials begin at HIGH and are downgraded progressively for heterogeneity, imprecision, and/or potential publication bias; since the vast majority of studies in this field are industry sponsored, the quality of evidence for nearly all of these studies is, therefore, reduced from HIGH to MODERATE, and when heterogeneity and imprecision are accounted for, the quality of evidence for many treatments considered is LOW or VERY LOW. Meta-analysis requires specific data (numerical data for a given outcome, presented as mean and standard deviation), many studies do not report data in the required format, resulting in exclusion of substantial amounts of data from the formal meta-analyses, and while these studies are discussed and considered in formulation of recommendations, the inability to include such data in meta-analysis represents a distinct limitation.

### Sleep and treatment outcome in posttraumatic stress disorder: results from an effectiveness study [^112vEEiC]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

The strengths of this study include use of a representative sample of consecutively referrals, and the combination of the longitudinal design of assessing sleep and PTSD symptoms at each treatment session with the statistical method to analyze the data, which allowed studying the course of the symptomatology as well as a sophisticated way of dealing with missing data. Furthermore, the data collection method made sure that outcome scores at the last treatment session were available for every patient, including dropouts.

This study provides a clear answer to the clinically relevant question of whether clinicians should be hesitant to start trauma‐focused psychological therapy for PTSD if the patient reports significant sleep problems: overall, self‐reported levels of sleep problems at the start of treatment did not predict treatment effectiveness. However, in those with comorbid depression, lower self‐reported sleep quality predicted slower improvement in PTSD symptoms. It therefore appears advisable to assess depression and sleep disturbances in patients with PTSD. Although these symptoms appear to be part of the PTSD syndrome and improve in parallel with PTSD symptoms during trauma‐focused treatment, patients with comorbid depression and sleep problems required more treatment sessions to achieve comparable outcomes. It remains to be tested whether they might further benefit from additional interventions targeting sleep or depression that could be added to the trauma‐focused treatment. It also remains to be tested whether treating remaining sleep problems with either specific psychological sleep interventions, or medication that have shown to be effective in reducing sleep complaints in PTSD (e.g. olanzapine, prazosin) 47, 48, 49 could further improve sleep. In conclusion, most people with PTSD report sleep problems and only for those with comorbid depression poorer self‐reported sleep quality, not sleep duration, was related to slower recovery, but not treatment outcome at the end of treatment. For those without comorbid depression, self‐reported sleep problems do not affect the degree to which they benefit in the short or long term from trauma‐focused cognitive therapy for PTSD.

Nightmare disorder — atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, risperidone) have limited clinical data. A single case series of olanzapine augmentation in 5 combat veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD reported a rapid improvement in nightmares with doses ranging from 10–20 mg/day, but without comparison to an appropriate control. For risperidone, an open-label trial reported an average maximum dose of 2.3 ± 0.6 mg (range 1–3 mg) per day, a statistically significant decrease in the CAPS recurrent distressing dreams item at 6 weeks (baseline: 5.4 ± 1.9, 6 weeks: 3.8 ± 2.8), and a reduction in the percent of patients reporting nightmares (baseline: 90.2% ± 36.7%, 6 weeks: 19.0% ± 21.5%); there was no mention of side effects. In a retrospective chart review of 10 civilian patients, the dose of risperidone ranged from 0.5–2.0 mg/day and eighty percent of patients reported an improvement in their symptoms, including nightmares, after the first use; no side effects were reported.

### Orexin receptor antagonists in the treatment of insomnia associated with psychiatric disorders: a systematic review [^113anT9i]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Should insomnia comorbid with psychiatric disorders be treated as a disorder independent of psychiatric symptoms?

Recently, the term "secondary insomnia" has been eliminated from the DSM-5 and other guidelines as insomnia can persist even after the primary symptoms of psychiatric disorders have been resolved. Insomnia is now regarded as a distinct disorder independent of psychiatric disorders. Based on this concept, treatment with insomnia medications should be considered for insomnia symptoms that are not sufficiently improved by psychiatric medications.

Insomnia associated with psychiatric disorders is often treated with drugs that have a strong sedative effect on the underlying disorder, which can effectively address hyperarousal and sleep disorders that commonly occur in the acute phase of a psychiatric condition. However, they are not approved for insomnia and have not been rigorously studied for insomnia comorbid with psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, the use of sedative medications for psychiatric disorders presents several challenges. First, the effects of psychiatric medications on sleep can result in excessive sedation during the day, leading to reduced daytime functioning and quality of life. This is particularly true during the maintenance phase of treatment when symptoms of the primary illness have abated and the sedative effects of medication initiated during the acute phase have become more prominent. Even taking medication before bedtime may impair daytime functioning if the clinical effects persist beyond the desired duration. In addition, sedating psychiatric medications may be associated with specific adverse effects. For example, although quetiapine, clozapine, and olanzapine can influence sleep by their antihistamine effects, they are associated with weight gain and elevated blood lipids. These safety issues may prevent the administration of sufficient doses of psychiatric medications to improve insomnia symptoms, further preventing the adequate management of insomnia. According to the findings of this review, suvorexant and lemborexant showed no clear adverse effects on psychiatric disorders comorbid with insomnia. In addition, DORAs are expected to have a low dependence due to their differential mechanism of action from older benzodiazepine hypnotics, making them a promising treatment option for insomnia comorbid with psychiatric disorders.

### Treatment of chronic insomnia in adults [^115QJ5Kp]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Insomnia affects 30% of the U.S. population, with 5% to 15% meeting criteria for chronic insomnia. It can negatively impact quality of life, decrease productivity, increase fatigue and drowsiness, and put patients at higher risk of developing other health problems. Initial treatment focuses on nonpharmacologic therapies such as cognitive behavior therapy, which improves negative thought patterns and behaviors through sleep restriction, stimulus control, and relaxation techniques. Other nonpharmacologic treatments include exercise, mindfulness, and acupuncture. If these approaches are ineffective, pharmacologic agents may be considered. Medications such as benzodiazepines and Z-drugs are often prescribed for insomnia but should be avoided, if possible, due to short- and long-term risks associated with their use. Melatonin receptor agonists are safer and well tolerated but have limited effectiveness. Dual orexin receptor antagonists are effective in patients who have sleep maintenance insomnia or difficulty with sleep onset. Evidence for the use of antihistamines to treat insomnia is generally lacking, but doxylamine is effective for up to four weeks.

This British Association for Psychopharmacology guideline replaces the original version published in 2010, and contains updated information and recommendations. A consensus meeting was held in London in October 2017 attended by recognised experts and advocates in the field. They were asked to provide a review of the literature and identification of the standard of evidence in their area, with an emphasis on meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials where available, plus updates on current clinical practice. Each presentation was followed by discussion, aiming to reach consensus where the evidence and/or clinical experience was considered adequate, or otherwise to flag the area as a direction for future research. A draft of the proceedings was circulated to all speakers for comments, which were incorporated into the final statement.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: a systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^117U8AdT]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Search method

A comprehensive search for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, controlled interventional studies and observational studies was conducted using a predeveloped search term on four databases: PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.

The PICOS-framework was used to develop a search term (population: people over 65 years, intervention: BDLM, comparator: no limits, outcomes: see list above 'Types of outcomes' and study design: systematic reviews, meta-analyses, controlled interventional studies and observational studies). The full search term can be found as Additional file 1.

The search was conducted on the 19th of June 2019 by a data research team at the University of Witten using the OVID interface for each database.

Data management

Search results were saved on EndNote X9 reference management software. Upon retrieval, results were de-duplicated.

Selection of studies

The titles and abstracts identified were independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers. Full text articles were obtained for all references meeting the inclusion criteria, or where there was uncertainty about inclusion. VS, LH and EM were involved in this task.

Consensus was established and in case of disagreement arbitrated by AS.

Reference lists of included studies and studies identified via snowballing were screened for eligibility.

Studies excluded in full text were listed with a justification for exclusion.

Data extraction

Data extraction was conducted independently using a previously developed standardized data extraction form. Data items extracted were study design, objective, data of participants, intervention and comparator, study duration, outcome measures and sponsors. Completeness and accuracy of data extraction were double-checked by two further independent reviewers.

Quality appraisal

For different study designs distinct validated tools of assessment were used to evaluate quality. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were appraised using the critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews (AMSTAR2), clinical studies utilizing the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2), and for observational studies the critical appraisal skills program checklist (CASP) was used.

Quality appraisal was carried out by two independent researchers (VS and EM) and in case of disagreement arbitrated by a third reviewer (AS).

Data synthesis

A descriptive and narrative summary of results with a focus on clinical endpoints was formulated. Quality of included studies was described. In case of data from included studies being homogenous enough in terms of treatments, study duration, study design and outcomes, a meta-analysis of results was calculated.

### Efficacy and safety of esmirtazapine in adult outpatients with chronic primary insomnia: a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study and open-label extension [^113UbrUv]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Esmirtazapine (1.5–4.5 mg) has demonstrated short-term sleep-promoting effects in nonelderly outpatients with chronic insomnia. This phase 3, randomized, double-blind study (NCT00631657) and its open-label extension (NCT00750919) investigated efficacy and safety of long-term esmirtazapine treatment in adult outpatients with chronic insomnia.

Methods

Participants were randomized to receive esmirtazapine 4.5 mg or placebo for 6 months; those receiving esmirtazapine were then rerandomized to esmirtazapine or placebo for an additional 7 days. Participants could enter the 6-month open-label extension with esmirtazapine 4.5 mg. The primary objective of the double-blind study was to assess long-term efficacy of esmirtazapine vs placebo on self-reported total sleep time. Assessing long-term safety and tolerability were secondary and primary objectives of the double-blind and extension studies, respectively.

Results

Overall, 457 participants received treatment in the double-blind study (esmirtazapine, n = 342; placebo, n = 115) and 184 participants (prior esmirtazapine, n = 136; prior placebo, n = 48) received esmirtazapine in the extension. In the double-blind study, a 48.7-minute increase in average nightly total sleep time was observed for esmirtazapine vs placebo (95% confidence interval, 35.0–62.5; P < .0001) at months 4–6. There was no evidence of residual effects on next-day alertness or daytime functioning and no evidence of rebound insomnia or withdrawal symptoms upon treatment discontinuation. Esmirtazapine was generally well tolerated; somnolence and weight gain were the most common adverse events.

Conclusions

Esmirtazapine improved sleep duration vs placebo over at least 6 months. There was no evidence of next-day residual effects or of withdrawal symptoms or rebound insomnia following abrupt treatment discontinuation.

### Antidepressants for insomnia in adults [^11577JAF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Insomnia disorder is a subjective condition of unsatisfactory sleep (e.g. sleep onset, maintenance, early waking, impairment of daytime functioning). Insomnia disorder impairs quality of life and is associated with an increased risk of physical and mental health problems including anxiety, depression, drug and alcohol abuse, and increased health service use. hypnotic medications (e.g. benzodiazepines and 'Z' drugs) are licensed for sleep promotion, but can induce tolerance and dependence, although many people remain on long-term treatment. Antidepressant use for insomnia is widespread, but none is licensed for insomnia and the evidence for their efficacy is unclear. This use of unlicensed medications may be driven by concern over longer-term use of hypnotics and the limited availability of psychological treatments.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of antidepressants for insomnia in adults.

Search Methods

This review incorporated the results of searches to July 2015 conducted on electronic bibliographic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to 2015), Embase (1980 to 2015) and PsycINFO (1806 to 2015). We updated the searches to December 2017, but these results have not yet been incorporated into the review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults (aged 18 years or older) with a primary diagnosis of insomnia and all participant types including people with comorbidities. Any antidepressant as monotherapy at any dose whether compared with placebo, other medications for insomnia (e.g. benzodiazepines and 'Z' drugs), a different antidepressant, waiting list control or treatment as usual.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and extracted data using a data extraction form. A third review author resolved disagreements on inclusion or data extraction.

Main Results

The search identified 23 RCTs (2806 participants). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with placebo: three studies (135 participants) compared SSRIs with placebo. Combining results was not possible. Two paroxetine studies showed significant improvements in subjective sleep measures at six (60 participants, P = 0.03) and 12 weeks (27 participants, P < 0.001). There was no difference in the fluoxetine study (low quality evidence). There were either no adverse events or they were not reported (very low quality evidence). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) compared with placebo: six studies (812 participants) compared TCA with placebo; five used doxepin and one used trimipramine. We found no studies of amitriptyline. Four studies (518 participants) could be pooled, showing a moderate improvement in subjective sleep quality over placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.56 to -0.21) (moderate quality evidence). Moderate quality evidence suggested that TCAs possibly improved sleep efficiency (mean difference (MD) 6.29 percentage points, 95% CI 3.17 to 9.41; 4 studies; 510 participants) and increased sleep time (MD 22.88 minutes, 95% CI 13.17 to 32.59; 4 studies; 510 participants). There may have been little or no impact on sleep latency (MD -4.27 minutes, 95% CI -9.01 to 0.48; 4 studies; 510 participants). There may have been little or no difference in adverse events between TCAs and placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21; 6 studies; 812 participants) (low quality evidence)'. ther' antidepressants with placebo: eight studies compared other antidepressants with placebo (one used mianserin and seven used trazodone). Three studies (370 participants) of trazodone could be pooled, indicating a moderate improvement in subjective sleep outcomes over placebo (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.02). Two studies of trazodone measured polysomnography and found little or no difference in sleep efficiency (MD 1.38 percentage points, 95% CI -2.87 to 5.63; 169 participants) (low quality evidence). There was low quality evidence from two studies of more adverse effects with trazodone than placebo (i.e. morning grogginess, increased dry mouth and thirst).

Authors' Conclusions

We identified relatively few, mostly small studies with short-term follow-up and design limitations. The effects of SSRIs compared with placebo are uncertain with too few studies to draw clear conclusions. There may be a small improvement in sleep quality with short-term use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone compared with placebo. The tolerability and safety of antidepressants for insomnia is uncertain due to limited reporting of adverse events. There was no evidence for amitriptyline (despite common use in clinical practice) or for long-term antidepressant use for insomnia. High-quality trials of antidepressants for insomnia are needed.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112Nmeir]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Sleep outcomes — definitions used in this guideline are as follows: Sleep latency is defined as the time to fall asleep following bedtime; polysomnography (PSG) sleep latency may be reported as time to onset of first epoch of N1 (Stage 1) sleep or, in more recent studies, as latency to persistent sleep (LPS), or time to onset of first 10 consecutive min of sleep. Total sleep time is defined as the total time spent in bed, minus sleep latency and wake after sleep onset. Wake after sleep onset is defined as the sum of wake times from sleep onset to the final awakening. Sleep efficiency is defined as the percentage of time spent in bed during which sleep occurs; it is calculated as (TST / time in bed) × 100. Number of awakenings is defined as the number of awakenings after sleep onset, excluding the final awakening. Quality of sleep is a patient-reported measure, the definition of which varies by measurement tools and patient perceptions.

### Actigraphic monitoring of activity and rest in schizophrenic patients treated with olanzapine or risperidone [^116rCbfm]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2011). Low credibility.

Metabolic disturbances are a growing concern for the treatment of schizophrenia. As decreased activity and poor sleep quality are risk factors for metabolic disturbances, we investigated the activity and sleep patterns of schizophrenic patients using actigraphy. Seventy-three patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (mean age 29.2 ± 10.2 years, 27 females) treated with olanzapine (n = 54) or risperidone (n = 19) and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were examined. Actigraphic recordings were obtained throughout seven consecutive days. The Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were used to assess sleep and daytime sleepiness. Drug side effects were evaluated with the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) Side Effect Rating Scale and Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS). Mental status was rated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS). The patients had lower mean 24 h-activity (p < 0.001) and mean 10 h-daytime-activity (p < 0.001), and longer time in bed (p < 0.001). Higher PANSS scores, especially in the negative symptoms scale, were related to lower activity (rₛ = −0.508, p < 0.001). Higher depressive symptoms were related to lower mean 24 h-activity (rₛ = −0.233, p = 0.049), longer time in bed (rₛ = 0.315, p = 0.007) and higher AIS (rₛ = 0.377, p = 0.001) and ESS scores (rₛ = 0.321, p = 0.006). Healthy females presented higher activity than healthy males (p < 0.001). Similar but not significant gender differences were observed in the patients. These findings show that patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine or risperidone exhibit low physical activity and altered sleep pattern which may promote metabolic side effects. These changes are linked to negative and depressive symptoms.
