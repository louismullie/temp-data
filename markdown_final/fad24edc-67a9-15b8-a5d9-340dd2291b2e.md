## Question

Can focal phlegmom be treated by rochepin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "rochepin" can treat a "focal phlegmom". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "rochepin" actually refers to and whether that maps to a known antibiotic. Then, I should verify what "focal phlegmom" means clinically and in which anatomic contexts it is described. Next, I will review evidence-based management of phlegmon across common scenarios to see if antibiotics alone suffice or if source control is needed. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, scenario-specific recommendation and confirm dosing and duration where supported by guidelines or studies.

> Let me first confirm the drug name. Wait, let me verify the spelling: "rochepin" does not correspond to a standard antibiotic name. I initially wondered if this might be a brand or regional name, but I should double-check the likely intended agent. Given the context and common practice patterns, the most plausible match is ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin often used parenterally for intra-abdominal and other serious infections, and frequently referred to by a manufacturer name in some regions. I will proceed assuming ceftriaxone is the intended agent, while noting that if the user meant a different drug, I should correct course accordingly [^notfound].

> Next, I should review what "focal phlegmon" implies. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: "phlegmon" is a diffuse inflammatory infiltrate without a liquefied pus cavity, whereas an abscess is a walled-off collection of pus. Management differs because abscesses often require drainage for source control, whereas phlegmons may respond to antibiotics alone if the host is stable and the process is localized. I need to ensure I anchor the discussion to specific anatomic contexts where phlegmon is commonly managed, such as appendiceal, diverticular, Crohn's disease, mastitis, and deep neck or other soft-tissue infections [^143efc60] [^53a5e2a1] [^00719549] [^88b6999a].

> For appendiceal phlegmon or abscess, I should confirm the standard approach. The WSES 2020 guidelines support nonoperative management with antibiotics as a reasonable first-line strategy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess, with percutaneous drainage added if an abscess is present and accessible. Early appendectomy is also acceptable in experienced hands, but nonoperative care avoids the morbidity of urgent surgery in inflamed planes. Success rates are high, though recurrence can occur and interval appendectomy is not routinely mandated after successful nonoperative care. I should also note that ceftriaxone is commonly included in empiric regimens for complicated intra-abdominal infection, often paired with metronidazole for anaerobic coverage when indicated [^a5cc46bb] [^5a89b1a8] [^d10705b1] [^4877a0cc].

> For diverticulitis with phlegmon, let me consider the evidence. Contemporary guidelines endorse nonoperative management with broad-spectrum antibiotics for complicated diverticulitis, including phlegmon, reserving drainage for larger abscesses and surgery for failure or peritonitis. Small abscesses and phlegmons frequently resolve with antibiotics alone, and routine antibiotics are not required for uncomplicated diverticulitis. Again, ceftriaxone is a reasonable component of empiric therapy when combined appropriately for anaerobes and local resistance patterns [^e00d9d98] [^f7af9f8a] [^d55176e7].

> In Crohn's disease, I need to check the role of anti-TNF therapy. Abdominal phlegmon in penetrating Crohn's disease is often managed with antibiotics first to control infection, followed by anti-TNF therapy once sepsis risk is mitigated. This strategy can avert resection in a meaningful subset, though careful selection and follow-up are essential. Ceftriaxone may be used as part of initial empiric coverage, but definitive therapy hinges on immunomodulation and multidisciplinary care rather than antibiotics alone [^b2254b34] [^a1e4f86d].

> For lactational breast phlegmon, I should confirm the approach. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine recommends extended antibiotics for phlegmon, close follow-up, and interval imaging because phlegmon can evolve into a drainable abscess. Supportive measures and reassessment are key, and ceftriaxone is a reasonable parenteral option when systemic therapy is indicated, with tailoring to local resistance and clinical response [^00719549] [^e423231d] [^a1d5d9cc].

> For deep neck space or other soft-tissue phlegmons, I need to ensure I don't conflate phlegmon with abscess. Early surgical drainage is indicated when there is suppurative material or airway compromise, whereas early cellulitis or phlegmon without pus may be treated with IV antibiotics and close observation. Ceftriaxone is commonly used empirically for severe odontogenic or deep neck infections, often with metronidazole or clindamycin for anaerobes, with escalation based on culture results and clinical trajectory [^88b6999a] [^4f8a3468].

> Let me synthesize and answer the question directly. Yes, ceftriaxone ("rochepin") can be used to treat focal phlegmon, but its effectiveness depends on the anatomic site, severity, and whether there is accompanying abscess or systemic instability. In many intra-abdominal and soft-tissue phlegmons, ceftriaxone as part of an appropriate empiric regimen — often combined with anaerobic coverage when indicated — is effective, with success rates commonly exceeding 80–90% in appendiceal and diverticular phlegmon managed nonoperatively. However, if a phlegmon coexists with a drainable abscess or the patient deteriorates, source control with drainage or surgery becomes necessary, and antibiotics alone will be insufficient [^a5cc46bb] [^d10705b1] [^e00d9d98] [^143efc60].

> I should double-check dosing and duration pragmatics. Typical adult dosing of ceftriaxone for complicated intra-abdominal infection is 1–2 grams IV every 24 hours, frequently paired with metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8–12 hours when anaerobic coverage is indicated. Duration commonly ranges from 7 to 10 days, individualized to clinical response, with step-down to oral therapy when stable. For lactational phlegmon, extended courses of 10–14 days or longer are not unusual given the propensity for persistent inflammation and the need for close follow-up imaging to document resolution [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the "focal phlegmon" is actually a small abscess on imaging? I need to ensure we distinguish phlegmon from abscess because that changes management. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound or cross-sectional imaging can help differentiate, and if a collection is present, image-guided drainage improves outcomes and reduces failure of nonoperative therapy. Thus, ceftriaxone remains appropriate, but source control with drainage should be added when an abscess is identified or suspected [^9f1c47a7] [^52ea9544] [^143efc60].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. Ceftriaxone is an appropriate empiric antibiotic for focal phlegmon in many scenarios, particularly intra-abdominal and selected soft-tissue infections, provided the patient is hemodynamically stable and there is no immediate need for surgical source control. Outcomes are best when therapy is tailored to site, severity, and imaging findings, with escalation to drainage or surgery if the patient fails to improve or if an abscess declares itself. If the user truly meant a different drug named "rochepin", please clarify so I can correct the recommendation accordingly [^a5cc46bb] [^143efc60] [^e00d9d98] [^00719549].

Ceftriaxone (Rocephin) is appropriate for **focal phlegmon** when there is no abscess or systemic instability, as it provides broad-spectrum coverage for common pathogens. If an abscess is present or the patient is unstable, **source control with drainage or surgery is essential** [^143efc60] and should be combined with antibiotics. Use ceftriaxone with metronidazole for anaerobic coverage in intra-abdominal or deep infections, and tailor therapy to culture results and clinical response [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios and management strategies

Focal phlegmon can occur in **various anatomical locations**, each with specific management considerations:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Management strategy** | **Role of ceftriaxone** |
|-|-|-|
| Appendiceal phlegmon | Nonoperative management with antibiotics is recommended as first-line treatment [^a5cc46bb] [^d10705b1] | Ceftriaxone is effective; combine with metronidazole for anaerobic coverage [^notfound] |
| Diverticulitis with phlegmon | Nonoperative management with antibiotics is standard [^e00d9d98] [^d55176e7] | Ceftriaxone is effective; combine with metronidazole for anaerobic coverage [^notfound] |
| Crohn's disease with phlegmon | Antibiotics followed by anti-TNF therapy after source control is recommended [^b2254b34] [^a1e4f86d] | Ceftriaxone is effective; combine with metronidazole for anaerobic coverage [^notfound] |
| Lactational breast phlegmon | Extended antibiotics are recommended [^00719549] [^e423231d] | Ceftriaxone is effective; monitor for progression to abscess [^a1d5d9cc] |
| Deep neck space infection | Early surgical drainage is recommended [^notfound] | Ceftriaxone is effective; combine with metronidazole for anaerobic coverage [^notfound] |

## Evidence supporting ceftriaxone use in focal phlegmon

Ceftriaxone is a **third-generation cephalosporin** with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including common pathogens implicated in focal phlegmon. Clinical guidelines and studies support its use in nonoperative management of focal phlegmon, particularly in intra-abdominal infections such as appendiceal and diverticular phlegmon [^a5cc46bb] [^e00d9d98]. For example, the WSES guidelines recommend nonoperative management with antibiotics for appendiceal phlegmon, and ceftriaxone is commonly used as part of the antibiotic regimen [^a5cc46bb]. Similarly, in diverticulitis with phlegmon, ceftriaxone is effective when combined with metronidazole to cover anaerobes [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While ceftriaxone is effective in many scenarios, **certain limitations and considerations must be addressed**:

- **Absence of abscess**: Ceftriaxone is appropriate when there is no abscess or systemic instability. If an abscess is present, source control with drainage or surgery is essential [^143efc60] [^ec799f3b].
- **Anaerobic coverage**: In intra-abdominal or deep infections, combine ceftriaxone with metronidazole to cover anaerobes [^notfound].
- **Resistance patterns**: Local resistance patterns should guide antibiotic selection, and therapy should be adjusted based on culture results and clinical response [^4e7f1198].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Renal function, allergies, and comorbidities must be considered when selecting antibiotics [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Nonoperative management of focal phlegmon with antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, has been associated with favorable outcomes. Recurrence rates vary by condition: appendiceal phlegmon has a recurrence rate of approximately 7.4% [^d10705b1], whereas diverticulitis with phlegmon has a recurrence rate of approximately 22% at 10 years [^d55176e7]. These figures underscore the importance of careful patient selection, close monitoring, and individualized treatment plans [^ec799f3b].

---

Ceftriaxone (Rocephin) is effective for **focal phlegmon** in stable patients without abscess, especially for intra-abdominal infections. Combine with metronidazole when anaerobic coverage is needed, and escalate to drainage or surgery if the patient deteriorates or an abscess forms [^143efc60].

### Treating appendicitis with antibiotics [^1255c062]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A nonsurgical approach using antimicrobial agents has been advocated as the initial treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis. Several studies and meta-analyses explored this approach. Because many of these studies included individuals with resolving appendicitis, their results were biased. Antimicrobials, however, are warranted and needed for the management of surgical high-risk patients with perforated appendicitis and those with localized abscess or phlegmon. Randomized placebo-controlled trials that focus on early identification of complicated acute appendicitis patients needing surgery and that prospectively evaluate the optimal use of antibiotic treatment in patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis are warranted.

Background

Phlegmonous gastritis (PG) is a rare and potentially fatal disease characterized by bacterial infection of the gastric wall. However, its clinical features are nonspecific, which may delay its diagnosis and treatment.

Case Report

We report a case of a previously healthy 53-year-old woman with localized PG complicated by subphrenic abscess formation who was treated successfully with antibiotics and percutaneous catheter drainage. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Early diagnosis and treatment initiation are important to improving outcomes. Emergency physicians should consider PG a differential diagnosis of acute abdomen.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^9c0d7058]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Meta-analyses and a recent guideline acknowledge that conservative management of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics can be successful for patients who wish to avoid surgery. However, guidance as to specific management does not exist.

Methods

PUBMED and EMBASE search of trials describing methods of conservative treatment was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Results

Thirty-four studies involving 2,944 antibiotic-treated participants were identified. The greatest experience with conservative treatment is in persons 5 to 50 years of age. In most trials, imaging was used to confirm localized appendicitis without evidence of abscess, phlegmon, or tumor. Antibiotics regimens were generally consistent with intra-abdominal infection treatment guidelines and used for a total of 7 to 10 days. Approaches ranged from 3-day hospitalization on parenteral agents to same-day hospital or ED discharge of stable patients with outpatient oral antibiotics. Minimum time allowed before response was evaluated varied from 8 to 72 hours. Although pain was a common criterion for nonresponse and appendectomy, analgesic regimens were poorly described. Trials differed in use of other response indicators, that is, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and reimaging. Diet ranged from restriction for 48 hours to as tolerated. Initial response rates were generally greater than 90% and most participants improved by 24 to 48 hours, with no related severe sepsis or deaths. In most studies, appendectomy was recommended for recurrence; however, in several, patients had antibiotic retreatment with success.

Conclusion

While further investigation of conservative treatment is ongoing, patients considering this approach should be advised and managed according to study methods and related guidelines to promote informed shared decision-making and optimize their chance of similar outcomes as described in published trials. Future studies that address biases associated with enrollment and response evaluation, employ best-practice pain control and antibiotic selection, better define cancer risk, and explore longer time thresholds for response, minimized diet restriction and hospital stays, and antibiotic re-treatment will further our understanding of the potential effectiveness of conservative management.

### Early versus delayed appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess [^06c73618]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2017. Acute appendicitis (inflammation of the appendix) can be simple or complicated. Appendiceal phlegmon and appendiceal abscess are examples of complicated appendicitis. Appendiceal phlegmon is a diffuse inflammation in the bottom right of the appendix, while appendiceal abscess is a discrete inflamed mass in the abdomen that contains pus. Appendiceal phlegmon and abscess account for 2% to 10% of acute appendicitis. People with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess usually need an appendicectomy to relieve their symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting) and avoid complications (e.g. peritonitis (infection of abdominal lining)). Surgery for people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess may be early (immediately after hospital admission or within a few days of admission), or delayed (several weeks later in a subsequent hospital admission). The optimal timing of appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess is debated.

Objectives

To assess the effects of early appendicectomy compared to delayed appendicectomy on overall morbidity and mortality in people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and five trials registers on 11 June 2023, together with reference checking to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all individual and cluster-randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of language, publication status, or age of participants, comparing early versus delayed appendicectomy in people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs that randomised 828 participants to early or delayed appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon (7 trials) or appendiceal abscess (1 trial). The studies were conducted in the USA, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. All RCTs were at high risk of bias because of lack of blinding and lack of published protocols. They were also unclear about methods of randomisation and length of follow-up. 1. Early versus delayed open or laparoscopic appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon We included seven trials involving 788 paediatric and adult participants with appendiceal phlegmon: 394 of the participants were randomised to the early appendicectomy group (open or laparoscopic appendicectomy as soon as the appendiceal mass resolved within the same admission), and 394 were randomised to the delayed appendicectomy group (initial conservative treatment followed by delayed open or laparoscopic appendicectomy several weeks later). There was no mortality in either group. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of early appendicectomy on overall morbidity (risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 2.86; 3 trials, 146 participants; very low-certainty evidence), the proportion of participants who developed wound infections (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.02; 7 trials, 788 participants), and the proportion of participants who developed faecal fistulas (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.36 to 8.49; 5 trials, 388 participants). Early appendicectomy may reduce the abdominal abscess rate (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.80; 4 trials, 626 participants; very low-certainty evidence), reduce the total length of hospital stay by about two days (mean difference (MD) -2.02 days, 95% CI -3.13 to -0.91; 5 trials, 680 participants), and increase the time away from normal activities by about five days (MD 5.00 days; 95% CI 1.52 to 8.48; 1 trial, 40 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain. 2. Early versus delayed laparoscopic appendicectomy for appendiceal abscess We included one trial involving 40 paediatric participants with appendiceal abscess: 20 were randomised to the early appendicectomy group (emergent laparoscopic appendicectomy), and 20 were randomised to the delayed appendicectomy group (initial conservative treatment followed by delayed laparoscopic appendicectomy 10 weeks later). There was no mortality in either group. The trial did not report on overall morbidity, various complications, or time away from normal activities. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of early appendicectomy on the total length of hospital stay (MD -0.20 days, 95% CI -3.54 to 3.14; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

For the comparison of early versus delayed open or laparoscopic appendicectomy for paediatric and adult participants with appendiceal phlegmon, very low-certainty evidence suggests that early appendicectomy may reduce the abdominal abscess rate. The evidence is very uncertain whether early appendicectomy prevents overall morbidity or other complications. Early appendicectomy may reduce the total length of hospital stay and increase the time away from normal activities, but the evidence is very uncertain. For the comparison of early versus delayed laparoscopic appendicectomy for paediatric participants with appendiceal abscess, data are sparse, and we cannot rule out significant benefits or harms of early versus delayed appendicectomy. Further trials on this topic are urgently needed and should specify a set of criteria for use of antibiotics, percutaneous drainage of the appendiceal abscess prior to surgery, and resolution of the appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. Future trials should include outcomes such as time away from normal activities and length of hospital stay.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^52ea9544]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with a periappendiceal abscess can be managed with percutaneous image-guided drainage in surgical departments with ready access to diagnostic and interventional radiology. When percutaneous drainage is not available surgery is suggested (Recommendation 1B).

In approximately 10% of patients, a periappendiceal abscess and inflammatory phlegmon is present at diagnosis. This is more frequently encountered in the situation of a delayed diagnosis. Clinical features of complicated appendicitis such as mass and abscess may include fever, tachycardia, palpation of mass, and extension of area of tenderness and rebound. Surgical management varies because a proportion of these cases will evolve into an ileocecal resection or a right-sided hemicolectomy if operated in the acute setting. In recent years, high success rates of 76–97% and low incidences of complications have been reported in patients with appendicitis associated with abscess and/or mass, after conservative management; thus, performing non-surgical treatments, such as antibiotic therapy and percutaneous drainage, during the initial period have been proven to be effective and safe. However, a necessary condition for conservative management of these patients is an easy access to diagnostic and interventional radiology to perform a percutaneous drainage. When percutaneous drainage is not available, surgery is suggested.

In patients treated conservatively, interval appendectomy may be not necessary following initial non-operative treatment of complicated appendicitis. However, interval appendectomies should always be performed for patients with recurrent symptoms (Recommendation 2B).

Traditionally, an interval appendectomy has been offered to patients who initially underwent a non-operative approach to their appendiceal mass. However, the role of the interval appendectomy has been questioned, and controversy continues whether interval appendectomy is appropriate for adults with an appendiceal abscess. The main debate revolves around the recurrence rate, the complication rate of an interval appendectomy, and the potential for underlying malignancy. The results of a review by Andersonn and Petzold, based mainly on retrospective studies, supported the practice of non-surgical treatment without interval appendectomy in patients with appendiceal abscess or phlegmon. However, the patient should be informed about the risk of recurrence especially in the presence of appendicolith. The risk of missing another underlying condition (cancer or Crohn disease) is low, but motivates a colonoscopy in patients above the age of 40 years.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^78851d44]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Most trials of conservative treatment used ultrasound or CT imaging to evaluate the diagnosis of appendicitis and exclude patients with findings of or abscess. No consensus exists regarding definitions of complicated appendicitis and its complement and studies varied regarding specific criteria to distinguish these entities. For example, some studies excluded patients with any evidence of perforation or abscess. Others allowed small lesions (e.g. abscess <5 cm), consistent with a functional definition of uncomplicated appendicitis as appendicitis that would otherwise receive urgent appendectomy and complicated appendicitis as appendicitis accompanied by a major abscess or phlegmon that would preclude surgery (other than percutaneous drainage) or perforation with diffuse peritonitis that would require urgent operation. Both ultrasound and CT imaging correlate poorly with operative findings, – with one RCT reporting 18% of surgery-randomized patients having complicated appendicitis at operation.However, since antibiotic treatment without surgery is a standard approach for treatment of appendicitis accompanied by major phlegmon or abscess because of a high success rate and avoidable ileocecectomy, this may not be an important distinction other than the expected response time and a potentially increased risk of occult malignancy. Some RCTs in adults did not use routine imaging,, with an associated high rate of unnecessary surgery in one study.Patients diagnosed with uncomplicated appendicitis based only on clinical evaluation who do not respond to antibiotics must be considered to have other conditions such as complicated appendicitis, tumor, inflammatory bowel disease, or gynecological disorders.

Imaging-identified appendicolith was associated with antibiotic nonresponse in some studies,,,,, and not in others. –,,,,–,,,, In all trials, clinicians who assessed response were not blinded to baseline findings. It is possible that knowledge of the recognized association of appendicolith with perforation may have biased subsequent evaluation and led to a false association with nonresponse. Lack of blinding of the clinicians evaluating antibiotic response to findings on presentation is a general limitation of past studies to allow identification of response predictors. Also, studies generally did not describe all qualifying patients and compare characteristics of those enrolled and not enrolled to identify potential selection biases. If patients with more mild illness tended to be enrolled, either generally or among subgroups perceived as high risk (e.g. those with appendicolith, leukocytosis, severe pain), as might occur with a nontraditional treatment approach, then response rates could be inflated and differences associated with certain findings obscured.

We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal (23 August 2016) and ClinicalTrials.gov (23 August 2016) for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included all individual and cluster-randomised controlled trials, irrespective of language, publication status, or age of participants, comparing early versus delayed appendicectomy in people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified the trials for inclusion, collected the data, and assessed the risk of bias. We performed meta-analyses using Review Manager 5. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included two randomised controlled trials with a total of 80 participants in this review. 1. Early versus delayed open appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmonForty participants (paediatric and adults) with appendiceal phlegmon were randomised either to early appendicectomy (appendicectomy as soon as appendiceal mass resolved within the same admission) (n = 20), or to delayed appendicectomy (initial conservative treatment followed by interval appendicectomy six weeks later) (n = 20). The trial was at high risk of bias. There was no mortality in either group. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of using either early or delayed open appendicectomy onoverall morbidity (RR 13.00; 95% CI 0.78 to 216.39; very low-quality evidence), the proportion of participants who developed wound infection (RR 9.00; 95% CI 0.52 to 156.91; very low quality evidence) or faecal fistula (RR 3.00; 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52; very low quality evidence). The quality of evidence for increased length of hospital stay and time away from normal activities in the early appendicectomy group (MD 6.70 days; 95% CI 2.76 to 10.64, and MD 5.00 days; 95% CI 1.52 to 8.48, respectively) is very low quality evidence. The trial reported neither quality of life nor pain outcomes. 2. Early versus delayed laparoscopic appendicectomy for appendiceal abscessForty paediatric participants with appendiceal abscess were randomised either to early appendicectomy (emergent laparoscopic appendicectomy) (n = 20) or to delayed appendicectomy (initial conservative treatment followed by interval laparoscopic appendicectomy 10 weeks later) (n = 20). The trial was at high risk of bias. The trial did not report on overall morbidity or complications. There was no mortality in either group. We do not have sufficient evidence to determine the effects of using either early or delayed laparoscopic appendicectomy for outcomes relating to hospital stay between the groups (MD -0.20 days; 95% CI -3.54 to 3.14; very low quality of evidence). Health-related quality of life was measured with the Pediatric Quality of Life Scale-Version 4.0 questionnaire (a scale of 0 to 100 with higher values indicating a better quality of life). Health-related quality of life score measured at 12 weeks after appendicectomy was higher in the early appendicectomy group than in the delayed appendicectomy group (MD 12.40 points; 95% CI 9.78 to 15.02) but the quality of evidence was very low. This trial reported neither the pain nor the time away from normal activities.

Authors' Conclusions

It is unclear whether early appendicectomy prevents complications compared to delayed appendicectomy for people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. The evidence indicating increased length of hospital stay and time away from normal activities in people with early open appendicectomy is of very low quality. The evidence for better health-related quality of life following early laparoscopic appendicectomy compared with delayed appendicectomy is based on very low quality evidence. For both comparisons addressed in this review, data are sparse, and we cannot rule out significant benefits or harms of early versus delayed appendicectomy.Further trials on this topic are urgently needed and should specify a set of criteria for use of antibiotics, percutaneous drainage of the appendiceal abscess prior to surgery and resolution of the appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. Future trials should include outcomes such as time away from normal activities, quality of life and the length of hospital stay.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^25371a6d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Anatomic extent of infection

Assessing the origin and extent of the infectious process is important to define the treatment approach. In uIAIs, the infectious process only involves a single organ, not extending beyond. In cIAIs, the infectious process extends beyond the organ into the peritoneal cavity, leading to abscess formation or diffuse peritonitis. A limitation of this classification is that it does not describe patients’ complexity. On the other hand, in its simplicity, extension of the infectious process identifies those patients who need both source control and antibiotic therapy. In principle, patients with uIAIs (e.g. most cases of acute appendicitis and cholecystitis) can be managed with either surgical source control or antibiotics alone. Patients with uncomplicated appendicitis or acute cholecystitis undergoing adequate source control do not need post-operative antibiotics.

Statement 4

In the event of uIAIs, such as acute appendicitis or acute cholecystitis, if the focus of infection is controlled by appropriate surgical management, post-operative antibiotic therapy is not necessary. In the event of cIAIs, treatment generally involves source control and antibiotic therapy. Selected patients with perforated diverticulitis (including those with an abscess < 4 cm in diameter), a peri-appendiceal mass or phlegmon, or a perforated gastroduodenal ulcer (i.e. no sepsis, peritonitis, or extravasation by water-soluble contrast gastroduodenography) can be managed without definitive source control if responding satisfactorily to antibiotic therapy and other supportive measures (Low-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

Statement 5

For patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, appendectomy is the standard treatment. If source control is adequate, post-operative antibiotic therapy is not necessary. Treatment by antibiotics alone may be used in selected non-pregnant patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis and no appendicolith. However, non-operative management (NOM) is less effective than surgery in the long term due to a high recurrence rate (High-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

Statement 6

In patients with uncomplicated acute cholecystitis, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard treatment. If source control is adequate, post-operative antibiotic therapy is not necessary. If early cholecystectomy is not performed, interval cholecystectomy should be planned between 6 and 12 weeks after the episode of acute cholecystitis (Moderate-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^94358ffb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Sallinen et al. reported results of non-operative management in patients with CT verified extra-luminal air. This study showed that non-operative treatment was feasible therapy only for hemodynamically stable patients with CT findings of pericolic extra-luminal air or only a small amount of distant intraperitoneal air in the absence of clinical diffuse peritonitis or fluid in the fossa of Douglas. A large amount of distant intraperitoneal air or distant retroperitoneal air even in the absence of clinical generalized peritonitis was associated with a high failure rate (57–60%) of non-operative management.

Recent WSES guidelines for management of acute left colonic diverticulitis state that patients with CT findings of distant air without diffuse fluid may be treated by conservative treatment in selected cases; however, a risk of treatment failure and need for emergency surgery exists.

Antibiotics alone may be used to treat patients with early, non-perforated appendicitis, although there is a significant risk of subsequent recurrence.

In patients with complicated appendicitis, presenting with abscess or phlegmon, the optimal management strategy has been somewhat controversial. Several studies have found that non-operative treatment for a peri-appendiceal abscesses or masses results in fewer complications and shorter overall hospitalization.

In 2010, a meta-analysis was published comparing conservative treatment (i.e. antibiotic therapy with or without percutaneous abscess drainage) to appendectomy for the treatment of complicated appendicitis (cases exhibiting abscess or phlegmon). Seventeen studies (16 non-randomized/retrospective and one non-randomized/prospective) reported clinical data for 1572 patients of whom 847 patients received conservative treatment and 725 underwent acute appendectomy. Conservative treatment was associated with significantly fewer complications, wound infections, abdominal/pelvic abscesses, ileus, bowel obstruction, and additional follow-up surgeries. No significant differences were found in the overall length of hospitalization or in the duration of intravenous antibiotic infusion. Overall, clinical data supports the utility of conservative management rather than appendectomy in selected patients presenting with a peri-appendiceal abscess or phlegmon.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis: 2020 update of the WSES jerusalem guidelines [^a5cc46bb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Statement 6.1 Non-operative management is a reasonable first-line treatment for appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess. Percutaneous drainage as an adjunct to antibiotics, if accessible, could be beneficial, although there is a lack of evidence for its use on a routine basis. Laparoscopic surgery in experienced hands is a safe and feasible first-line treatment for appendiceal abscess, being associated with fewer readmissions and fewer additional interventions than conservative treatment, with a comparable hospital stay. Recommendation 6.1 We suggest non-operative management with antibiotics and—if available—percutaneous drainage for complicated appendicitis with a periappendicular abscess, in settings where laparoscopic expertise is not available [QoE: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Weak; 2B].

Statement 6.2 Operative management of acute appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess is a safe alternative to non-operative management in experienced hands and may be associated with shorter LOS, reduced need for readmissions, and fewer additional interventions than conservative treatment. Recommendation 6.2 We suggest the laparoscopic approach as treatment of choice for patients with complicated appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess where advanced laparoscopic expertise is available, with a low threshold for conversion. [QoE: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Weak; 2B].

Q.6.2: Is interval appendectomy always indicated for patients with acute appendicitis following successful NOM?

The reported rate of recurrence after non-surgical treatment for perforated AA and phlegmon is up to 12%. In order to avoid this quite high chance of recurrence, some authors recommend routine elective interval appendectomy following initial conservative management. However, this procedure is associated with a non-negligible rate of morbidity of 12.4%. The systematic review by Hall et al. including three retrospective studies for a total of 127 cases of non-surgical treatment of appendix mass in children, showed that after successful non-operative treatment the risk of recurrent AA was found to be 20.5%. Overall, the complications reported included SSI, prolonged postoperative ileus, hematoma formation, and small bowel obstruction, but the incidence of any individual complication was not determined.

### Recurrent granulomatous cheilitis associated with Crohn's disease successfully treated with ustekinumab: case report and literature review [^a2c8faa2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

We present the clinical case of a 70-year-old male ex-smoker with a history of diabetes and high blood pressure. Aged 56 years, an exploratory laparotomy was performed in 2005 due to severe abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. A phlegmon including terminal ileum and cecum was resected. The gross examination of the resected specimen showed a discontinuous pattern of inflammation with several small aphthous ulcers and two large serpiginous ulcers. Focal chronic inflammation, focal crypt irregularity and granulomas in the histologic examination allowed diagnosis of ileal CD.After surgery, and due to mild abdominal symptoms and recurrent pauciarticular arthritis in the ankles, he was treated with salazopyrin, methotrexate and short steroid cycles. Infliximab was started in 2010 due to corticosteroid dependence.

He remained asymptomatic in the abdominal area for 7 years, but in 2014 he needed infliximab escalation (5 mg/kg every 6 weeks) due to recurrent arthropathy. In 2016, methotrexate was withdrawn due to leukopenia and anaemia. That year the patient presented diffuse lip swelling with speech and swallowing difficulties. The patient had reported a similar episode in 2009, providing an anatomical pathology report from a biopsy taken from the inside lining of the lower lip with a diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis (non-necrotizing epithelioid granulomas, oedema, lymphangiectasia, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration). Treatment with oral corticosteroids was given, achieving remission. With infliximab trough levels of 6 μg/mL and negative antibodies, infliximab was optimized (7.5 mg/kg every 6 weeks). Despite optimization, at 1 month cheilitis relapsed and peripheral arthropathy persisted, and he required repeated cycles of prednisone at low doses during 2017. An endoscopy did not reveal lesions in anastomosis or neo-terminal ileum (Rutgeerts score i0).

### Abdominal phlegmons in Crohn's disease: outcomes following antitumor necrosis factor therapy [^a1e4f86d]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

An abdominal phlegmon is an inflammatory mass that can develop in the setting of penetrating Crohn's disease (CD). Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibody therapy is typically avoided in CD complicated by phlegmon because of concern for peritoneal infection but may offer an effective alternative to surgical resection after infection has been controlled with antibiotics. The aim of this study was to examine outcomes for patients with CD who developed an abdominal phlegmon that was subsequently treated with an anti-TNF antibody.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of all CD patients attending Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2004 and 2010 with an abdominal phlegmon who were treated with an anti-TNF antibody in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this treatment regimen.

Results

There were 13 patients with CD complicated by a phlegmon treated with antibiotics and an anti-TNF antibody at our center between 2004 and 2010. Ten were male. Median time (interquartile range) from diagnosis to development of the phlegmon was 5.9 (1.9-22.7) years. The phlegmon was associated with an abscess in 12 patients. In addition to anti-TNF therapy, all patients were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Anti-TNF therapy was effective without complications in all subjects. Two patients eventually had surgery more than a year after initiating anti-TNF treatment.

Conclusions

Penetrating CD complicated by phlegmon formation may be safely and effectively managed with a combination of antibiotics and anti-TNF therapy. Larger, prospective trials are required to confirm these initial findings.

### Nonsurgical treatment of appendiceal abscess or phlegmon: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d10705b1]. Annals of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

A systematic review of the nonsurgical treatment of patients with appendiceal abscess or phlegmon, with emphasis on the success rate, need for drainage of abscesses, risk of undetected serious disease, and need for interval appendectomy to prevent recurrence.

Summary Background Data

Patients with appendiceal abscess or phlegmon are traditionally managed by nonsurgical treatment and interval appendectomy. This practice is controversial with proponents of immediate surgery and others questioning the need for interval appendectomy.

Methods

A Medline search identified 61 studies published between January 1964 and December 2005 reporting on the results of nonsurgical treatment of appendiceal abscess or phlegmon. The results were pooled taking the potential clustering on the study-level into account. A meta-analysis of the morbidity after immediate surgery compared with that after nonsurgical treatment was performed.

Results

Appendiceal abscess or phlegmon is found in 3.8% (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.6-4.9) of patients with appendicitis. Nonsurgical treatment fails in 7.2% (CI: 4.0-10.5). The need for drainage of an abscess is 19.7% (CI: 11.0-28.3). Immediate surgery is associated with a higher morbidity compared with nonsurgical treatment (odds ratio, 3.3; CI: 1.9-5.6; P < 0.001). After successful nonsurgical treatment, a malignant disease is detected in 1.2% (CI: 0.6-1.7) and an important benign disease in 0.7% (CI: 0.2-11.9) during follow-up. The risk of recurrence is 7.4% (CI: 3.7-11.1).

Conclusions

The results of this review of mainly retrospective studies support the practice of nonsurgical treatment without interval appendectomy in patients with appendiceal abscess or phlegmon.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis: 2020 update of the WSES jerusalem guidelines [^5a89b1a8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2014 Cochrane review on the use of laparoscopy for the management of acute lower abdominal pain in women of childbearing age showed that laparoscopy was associated with an increased rate of specific diagnoses. A significant difference favoring the laparoscopic procedure in the rate of removal of normal appendix compared to open appendectomy was found.

Statement 5.3 Surgeon's macroscopic judgment of early grades of acute appendicitis is inaccurate and highly variable. The variability in the intra-operative classification of appendicitis influences the decision to prescribe postoperative antibiotics and should be therefore prevented/avoided. Recommendation 5.3 We suggest appendix removal if the appendix appears “normal” during surgery and no other disease is found in symptomatic patients [QoE: Low; Strength of recommendation: Weak; 2C].

Topic 6: Management of perforated appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess

Q.6.1: Is early appendectomy an appropriate treatment compared with delayed appendectomy for patients with perforated acute appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess?

The optimal approach to complicated AA with phlegmon or abscess is a matter of debate.

In the past, immediate surgery has been associated with a higher morbidity if compared with conservative treatment, while the non-surgical treatment of appendicular abscess or phlegmon has been reported to succeed in over 90% of patients, with an overall risk of recurrence of 7.4% and only 19.7% of cases of abscess requiring percutaneous drainage.

The meta-analysis by Similis et al. (including 16 non-randomized retrospective studies and one non-randomized prospective study for a total of 1572 patients, of whom 847 treated with conservative treatment and 725 with appendectomy) revealed that conservative treatment was associated with significantly less overall complications (wound infections, abdominal/pelvic abscesses, ileus/bowel obstructions, and re-operations) if compared to immediate appendectomy.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^f7af9f8a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

A prospective, single-arm, study overviewed the safety and efficacy of symptomatic (non-antibiotic) treatment for CT-proven uncomplicated acute diverticulitis during a 30-day follow-up period. Overall, 161 patients were included in the study, and 153 (95%) completed the 30-day follow-up. A total of 14 (9%) patients had pericolic gas. Altogether, 140 (87%) patients were treated as outpatients, and 4 (3%) of them were admitted to the hospital during the follow-up. The primary outcome measure of the study was to find the incidence of complicated diverticulitis. None of the patients developed complicated diverticulitis or required surgery, but 2 days (median) after inclusion, antibiotics were given to 14 (9%, 6 orally, 8 intravenously) patients. A recent Dutch randomized controlled trail of observational versus systemic antibiotic treatment (DIABOLO trial) for a first episode of CT-proven ALCD Hinchey stages 1a and 1b confirmed that observational treatment without antibiotics did not prolong recovery and could be considered appropriate in these patients.

This study included 22 clinical sites involving 528 patients; Hinchey modified stages 1a (confined pericolic inflammation or phlegmon) to 1b (pericolic or mesocolic abscess) and Ambrosetti’s “mild/moderate” diverticulitis stage confirmed within 24 h by CT were included. Patients with previous diverticulitis, higher Hinchey stages, or “severe” diverticulitis on Ambrosetti’s classification were excluded. The antibiotic treatment was a 10-day course of IV amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 1200 mg four times daily for at least 48 h. After 48 h, the administration route could be switched to per os, 625 mg three times daily. For observational treatment, patients had to meet the criteria of tolerating a normal diet, temperature less than 100.4 °F, a pain score below 4 on a visual analogue scale (using only acetaminophen for pain control), and the ability to support self at the same level as before illness. If the patient deteriorated, CT was repeated and antibiotic treatment was started if the temperature rose above 102.2 °F, blood cultures were positive, or the patient was septic.

Medical advice for first treatment

Treatment recommendations for bite wounds:

Immediate presentation and treatment of the bite wound.
Debridement and irrigation with isotonic electrolyte solution.
X-ray to exclude fractures or foreign bodies.
Preferably open wound treatment, but loose-fitting sutures for large defects.
Immobilization in a plaster cast or splint.
If the epidermis is not intact, general broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Consider tetanus vaccination.
Consider rabies vaccination if travel history or risk area is positive.
Contact the poison control center in case of venomous snakebite and obtain antidote if necessary.
Medical wound check via general practitioner.

If the bite wound is infected:

Early surgical treatment of hand or foot phlegmons.
Thorough surgical debridement.
Second-look surgery for severe findings.
Cast immobilization.
Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and later adjustment to the resistogram.
Laboratory tests need not be abnormal.
Daily medical check-ups until infection-free, conducted by hospital doctors or general practitioners.
Occupational therapy and physiotherapy for hand phlegmon after the infection has subsided.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis: 2020 update of the WSES jerusalem guidelines [^c68f8d9d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

These updated consensus guidelines were written under the auspices of the WSES by the acute appendicitis working group.

The coordinating researcher (S. Di Saverio) invited six experienced surgeons (G. Augustin, A. Birindelli, B. De Simone, M. Podda, M. Sartelli, and M. Ceresoli) with high-level experience in the management of AA to serve as experts in this 2020 update of the WSES Jerusalem guidelines. The experts reviewed and updated the original list of key questions on the diagnosis and treatment of AA addressed in the previous version of the guidelines. The subject of AA was divided into seven main topics: (1) diagnosis, (2) non-operative management of uncomplicated AA, (3) timing of appendectomy and in-hospital delay, (4) surgical treatment, (5) intra-operative grading of AA, (6) management of perforated AA with phlegmon or abscess, and (7) antibiotic prophylaxis and postoperative antibiotic treatment.

Both adults and pediatric populations were considered and specific statements and recommendations were made for each of two groups. Pediatric patients were defined as including children and adolescents aged between 1 and 16 years old. Infants were excluded from this review.

Based upon the list of topics, research questions (Patients/Population, Intervention/Exposure, Comparison, Outcome (PICO)) were formulated, reviewed, and adopted as guidance to conduct an exploratory literature search (Table 1).

Table 1 
Research topics and key questions

The searches were conducted in cooperation with a medical information specialist from the University of Bologna (A. Gori). A computerized search of different databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and new citations were included for the period April 2015 to June 2019. No search restrictions were imposed. Search syntaxes have been reported in (Supplemetary material file 1).

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^53a5e2a1]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) definitions—uncomplicated versus complicated and peritonitis subtypes—note that much literature uses these categories, with uncomplicated IAI traditionally limited to a hollow viscus and complicated IAI extending into normally sterile abdominal sites; some conditions remain borderline. Complicated IAI may present as secondary or tertiary peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscesses, or phlegmon. Secondary peritonitis arises from perforation of a hollow viscus but the term does not always imply infection and lacks detail on extent or chronicity, both of which may affect prognosis. There is less agreement on tertiary peritonitis; one consensus group defined it as infection that persisted or recurred more than 48 hours after apparently successful management of secondary peritonitis. Some clearly complicated conditions, such as peri-appendiceal phlegmon, may be managed without a source control procedure or microbiologic analysis.

### Phlegmonous gastritis associated with kaposi sarcoma: a case report and review of the literature [^f6cbb295]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

We report a case of phlegmonous gastritis associated with Kaposi sarcoma in a 37-year-old, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive man who presented with an acute abdomen. Computed tomographic scan revealed free fluid in the abdominal cavity and a thickened gastric wall. A partial gastrectomy was performed. The resected portion of stomach had a hemorrhagic, necrotic thickened wall and showed extensive, acute suppurative inflammation, especially in the submucosa, with focal transmural involvement. Beneath an area of healing ulceration, a focus of Kaposi sarcoma was present. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus was grown from peritoneal fluid, and treatment with numerous antibiotics was initiated. After a difficult postoperative course that responded to 8 weeks of antibiotic therapy, the patient was medically stable and discharged from the hospital on antiretroviral therapy for HIV. Phlegmonous gastritis is a rare and rapidly progressive bacterial infection of the gastric wall. Kaposi sarcoma is one of the most common malignancies in HIV-positive patients, and gastric involvement is relatively common in those patients with systemic Kaposi sarcoma. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of phlegmonous gastritis associated with Kaposi sarcoma, and it represents a rare survival following surgical and antibiotic therapy.

### Management of salivary gland malignancy: ASCO guideline (...) [^a01769d0]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

Literature review and clinical interpretation. 11, 14This technique, while slightly more invasive than FNAB and marginally more prone to minor complications, is potentially slightly more accurate and more likely to provide a specific diagnosis. 15, 60It may prove to be beneficial in individuals with nondiagnostic FNAs and/or those where there is a concern for lymphoma. CNB has a lower inadequacy rate. There was a trend toward improved 10-year OS in the nerve resection group. In the same study, the use of adjuvant RT did increase LC at 5 years and trended toward better 10-year OS.

Therefore, based on the evidence of the importance of clear surgical margins on LC in salivary cancer, as well as the functional and quality-of-life implications of facial nerve sacrifice, it is recommended to resect facial nerve branches only when this will allow for complete margin clearance or when the nerve is grossly infiltrated or encased by malignancy.

### A comprehensive review of abdominal infections [^e5a11814]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Traditionally, patients who present with an abscess or phlegmon then undergo elective surgery to avoid the high risk of recurrence and further complications. Recently though, some have begun to question the need for operative therapy when initial management with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics is successful. Two authors have found that perforation, which is the most common cause of mortality in complicated diverticulitis, is more likely to be the initial presentation of disease, rather than a manifestation of recurrence. They concluded that abscesses in complicated diverticulitis might then be adequately managed with antibiotics and drainage alone.

While conservative management may be appropriate in uniloculated abscesses, timely initial operative management is required for cases in which abscesses are large, multiloculated, or inaccessible, as well as in cases of free perforation, or diffuse peritonitis. Acute diverticulitis is complicated by free perforation in approximately 1.5% of episodes. The standard procedure in cases of peritonitis is a Hartmann's procedure. However, the Hartmann's procedure is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and while it can be reversed in 3-6 months, 30-70% of patients never undergo reversal[-]. Recently, it has been suggested that primary resection and anastomosis should be preferred. Finally, laparoscopic resections for complicated diverticulitis have also been shown to be safe; and, in spite of longer operative times, they are associated with fewer major complications, less pain, and shorter hospital stays.

### Current management of acute appendicitis in adults: what you need to know [^c51170c2]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute appendicitis is one of the most common acute surgical diseases in the world today. Acute appendicitis can present with a well-recognized clinical presentation with abdominal pain which localize in the right lower quadrant. This presentation is more typical in men than in women of child baring age. Several clinical and laboratory calculations can be used to increase the likelihood of making a correct diagnosis. Various imaging modalities can be used to make the diagnosis which include ultrasound, computer tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Each study has well known sensitivity/specificity of positive predictive value of making the diagnosis of appendicitis. The management of acute appendicitis is based on the presentation of the patient and dividing it into uncomplicated and complicated disease. Each requires management with antibiotics and followed with timely appendectomy. Recent studies have demonstrated nonoperative management of uncomplicated appendicitis without no fecalith that can be managed with antibiotics alone. Complicated acute appendicitis should undergo timely surgical intervention. Patients presenting with a large appendiceal abscess or phlegmon should undergo percutaneous drainage and antibiotic management. There are certain patient populations that should be considered for surgical intervention. Pregnant patients as well as immunosuppressed patients should undergo timely surgical intervention to decrease the risk of complications. This review outlines the current principles of the diagnosis, imaging, and treatment of acute appendicitis based on the best available evidence of acute appendicitis in adults.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^05cd737a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis

The appendectomy remains the treatment of choice for acute appendicitis. Antibiotic therapy is a safe means of primary treatment for patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, but this conservative approach is less effective in the long-term due to significant recurrence rates. (Recommendation 1A).

Although the standard treatment for acute appendicitis has historically been the appendectomy, the medical community has recently seen a notable increase in the use of antibiotic therapy as a primary means of treatment.

Several meta-analyses have been published overviewing a series of randomized trials comparing antibiotic therapy to appendectomies for acute uncomplicated appendicitis (cases without abscesses or phlegmon) [-].

Although non-operative, antibioitic-mediated treatments of uncomplicated appendicitis are associated with significantly fewer complications, more manageable pain control, and shorter patient sick leave, this conservative approach features high rates of recurrence and is therefore inferior to the traditional appendectomy.

Considering that only a small number of RCTs of poor methodological quality are currently available, well-designed RCTs are required to better assess the effects of an antibiotic-based approach in conservative treatments of uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

Given this controversy, the appendectomy remains the treatment of choice for acute appendicitis. Non-operative antibiotic treatment may be used as an alternative treatment for specific patients for whom surgery is contraindicated.

Both open and laparoscopic appendectomies are viable approaches to surgical treatment of acute appendicitis (Recommendation 1A).

Several randomized trials have compared the diagnostic and therapeutic advantages of laparoscopic and conventional open appendectomies in the treatment of acute appendicitis.

While the trials demonstrated a reduction in wound infections for the laparoscopic appendectomy group, they also exhibited a threefold increase in intra-abdominal abscesses.

### Xantogranulomatous pyeloneprhritis in children [^45f364e8]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Management

The management of XPN differs between focal and diffuse form.

Focal XPN

Owing to the difficult differential diagnosis of focal XPN with renal tumours (Wilms’s tumour), it is often necessary to perform either image-guided biopsy or intraoperative biopsy to avoid unnecessary nephrectomy. In focal XPN, treatment modes are partial nephrectomy, drainage of XPN abscess, or broad-spectrum antibiotic. There have been case reports of successful medical management of focal XPN, but it is unusual because of uncertain prognostic.

Diffuse XPN

Clinical and imaging features are suggestive of diffuse XPN and biopsy is not required before nephrectomy, which remains as the standard of care for diffuse disease. Nevertheless, the indication for nephrectomy is not always straightforward. There is no published evidence suggesting whether differential function can be used to guide the treatment of diffuse XPN. Differential function of near 20% is used as a recommendation for nephrectomy. Up to 80.5% of the affected kidneys are non-functioning.

Surgery of diffuse XPN can be difficult as a result of inflammatory processes extending beyond the kidney (Fig. 17), and although laparoscopic procedure is the first option, sometimes it must be changed to lumbotomy or anterolateral transperitoneal approach. Cutaneous fistula, bowel fistula and delayed wound healing have been reported as complications; consequently, in order to improve the surgical results, it is recommended to drain the perirenal and/or renal abscess prior to surgery.

Fig. 17 
Surgical procedure. Presence of multiples adherences and adenopathies around the kidney during the nephrectomy

The management of bilateral XPN is difficult due to the risk of permanent renal dysfunction. Partial nephrectomy is advocated but more recently conservative management with antibiotic therapy has been proposed.

The diffuse type of XPN is associated with a worse prognosis compared to the focal type, although no recurrence of XPN in the healthy contralateral kidney has been reported.

Introduction:

Here, we present first real-life experience with i.v. fosfomycin in a subgroup of patients with cSSTI from an ongoing international study.

Methods:

Prospective, non-interventional and monitored European multicenter study (FORTRESS; NCT02979951). The primary objective is clinical success, defined as clinical cure or improvement incl. microbiological cure at end of fosfomycin treatment. cSSTI was defined according to common definitions (US, EU).

Results:

Twenty-four of 245 currently (Jan 20) enrolled patients with severe infections had cSSTI (11 female, 13 male; mean age 58y), of which 17 (71%) were treated in intensive care. Fourteen (58%) patients had at least one additional risk factor for cSSTI. Ten (42%) patients had sepsis or septic shock at baseline. Fourteen patients (58%) had surgical site infections, 18 (75%) non-necrotizing cSSTI, thereof 14 (78%) with abscess formation, and four (17%) necrotizing cSSTI (fasciitis, cellulitis/severe phlegmon, abscess). Twenty cases (83%) of cSSTI were considered as acute and four (17%) as chronic infections. Eighteen (75%) infections were microbiologically confirmed. Causative pathogens were mostly staphylococci (15/24 patients; 63%), particularly methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (n=10/24 patients; 42%), E. faecium (1/24 patients; 4%), streptococci (n=5/24 patients; 21%), and Gram-negative species (n=12/24 patients; 50%). I.v. fosfomycin was used in a dose of 14 g/day (median) for a mean duration of 20 days, often in combination with carbapenems, penicillins or cephalosporins. Clinical success was reported in 19/24 (79%) patients, in 12/15 (80%) patients with abscess involvement, and in 8/10 (80%) patients with concomitant sepsis or septic shock. Fifteen adverse events were considered being related to fosfomycin treatment.

Conclusions:

These interim data from clinical practice emphasize that i.v. fosfomycin is a useful combination partner for treatment of cSSTI even in life-threatening cases.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis: 2020 update of the WSES jerusalem guidelines [^497fb3cd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and aims

Acute appendicitis (AA) is among the most common causes of acute abdominal pain. Diagnosis of AA is still challenging and some controversies on its management are still present among different settings and practice patterns worldwide.

In July 2015, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) organized in Jerusalem the first consensus conference on the diagnosis and treatment of AA in adult patients with the intention of producing evidence-based guidelines. An updated consensus conference took place in Nijemegen in June 2019 and the guidelines have now been updated in order to provide evidence-based statements and recommendations in keeping with varying clinical practice: use of clinical scores and imaging in diagnosing AA, indications and timing for surgery, use of non-operative management and antibiotics, laparoscopy and surgical techniques, intra-operative scoring, and peri-operative antibiotic therapy.

Methods

This executive manuscript summarizes the WSES guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of AA. Literature search has been updated up to 2019 and statements and recommendations have been developed according to the GRADE methodology. The statements were voted, eventually modified, and finally approved by the participants to the consensus conference and by the board of co-authors, using a Delphi methodology for voting whenever there was controversy on a statement or a recommendation. Several tables highlighting the research topics and questions, search syntaxes, and the statements and the WSES evidence-based recommendations are provided. Finally, two different practical clinical algorithms are provided in the form of a flow chart for both adults and pediatric (< 16 years old) patients.

Conclusions

The 2020 WSES guidelines on AA aim to provide updated evidence-based statements and recommendations on each of the following topics: (1) diagnosis, (2) non-operative management for uncomplicated AA, (3) timing of appendectomy and in-hospital delay, (4) surgical treatment, (5) intra-operative grading of AA, (6),management of perforated AA with phlegmon or abscess, and (7) peri-operative antibiotic therapy.

### Descending necrotizing mediastinitis: ten years' experience [^526018ac]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Descending necrotizing mediastinitis is a rare disease that is usually caused by a spreading, diffuse inflammatory reaction (phlegmon) to an odontogenic infection or peritonsillar abscess. Reported mortality rates range from 25 to 40%. The use of antibiotics and advances in resuscitation procedures and critical care techniques have not essentially improved survival, and an effective treatment has not been clearly established. We report the findings of our 10-year study of 21 patients affected by phlegmon and/or fasciitis of the neck. The aim of our contribution is to help define the clinical criteria and diagnostic procedures that will improve the early diagnosis of mediastinal sepsis secondary to neck fasciitis and to suggest optimal treatment approaches. Our experience indicates that (1) cervical drainage alone is sufficient for cases of cervical phlegmon or mediastinal involvement that are limited to a single superior mediastinal space and (2) thoracotomy and drainage of mediastinal collections is necessary when mediastinal sepsis is more extensive.

### The management of intestinal penetrating Crohn's disease [^3b103804]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) leads to the development of complications through progressive uncontrolled inflammation and the transmural involvement of the bowel wall. Most of the available literature on penetrating CD focuses on the perianal phenotype. The management of nonperianal penetrating complications poses its own set of challenges and can result in significant morbidity and an increased risk of mortality. Few controlled trials have been published evaluating this subgroup of patients for clinicians to use for guidance. Utilizing the available evidence, we review the epidemiology, presentation, and modalities used to diagnosis and assess intestinal fistulas, phlegmons, and abscesses. The literature regarding the medical, endoscopic, and surgical management options are reviewed providing physicians with a therapeutic framework to comprehensively treat these nonperianal penetrating complications. Through a multidisciplinary evidence-based approach to the complex sequela of CD outcomes can be improved and patient's quality of life enhanced.10.1093/ibd/izx108_video1izx108_Video5754037501001.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^143efc60]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Surgical Infection Society—source control timing and selective nonoperative management in intra-abdominal infection (IAI) emphasizes that expeditious source control is the standard, but certain highly selected patients with localized IAI have been treated successfully with antibiotic therapy alone, including those with acute colonic diverticulitis limited to peri-colonic tissues, perforated appendicitis with a peri-appendiceal phlegmon, selected localized upper gastrointestinal perforations, and relatively small diverticular or peri-appendiceal abscesses (generally less than 3–4 cm in diameter). For timing, most patients with peritonitis should undergo a source control procedure within 24 hours of diagnosis, and studies suggested that delays of only 3–6 hours were associated with increased death; multivariable analyses indicate time from diagnosis to source control predicts death. Accordingly, most patients with IAI should undergo source control within 24 hours, and patients with sepsis or septic shock should undergo earlier source control, although a short delay to allow for rapid resuscitation may be needed in hemodynamically unstable sepsis.

### Nonoperative management of appendiceal phlegmon or abscess in children less than 3 years of age [^264b14d5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The peak incidence of acute appendicitis occurs in the second decade of life, while it is uncommon to face appendicitis in children younger than 3 years of age. The incidence is approximately 2.3% of all children with acute appendicitis in this young age group. Inability of a young child to communicate to the parents or clinicians, atypical presentation, and other associated illness may delay the diagnosis. So, perforated appendices could be already present in 60–100% when the diagnosis is performed in young children. Some surgeons preferred immediate operations even if intra- and post-operative complications were higher because the anatomic immaturity and an inadequate omental barrier of young children might lead to diffusion of appendiceal inflammation. However, some studies had reported that the ability to localize intraperitoneal inflammatory processes was well-developed. An appendix mass is discovered at the time of presentation in about 33 to 50% of young children under 3 years of age.

Although some reviews report antibiotic therapy is safe and effective, first-line treatment of acute appendicitis remains to be appendectomy, especially laparoscopic appendectomy. The best treatment strategy for APA is very controversial. Immediate appendectomy may be technically demanding because of the distorted anatomy and the difficulties to close the appendiceal stump because of the inflamed tissues. It is rare but it exists that the exploration has to end up in an ileocaecal resection or a right-sided hemicolectomy due to the technical problems or a suspicion of malignancy because of the distorted tissues. So, nonoperative management is suggested because of a good and extensively documented success rate. The disadvantages of nonoperative management are that the actual pathology remains unclear and that appendicitis can “recur” after successful nonsurgical treatment. Many researches indicated the risks of recurrence and undetected serious diseases were very low and supported the nonoperative treatment [,–]. In 2015, the World Society of Emergency Surgery Jerusalem guidelines also suggested that nonoperative management was a reasonable first-line treatment for APA. Weber and Di Saverio advocated for a clinical approach that is tailored to the individual patient’s circumstances and reflective of the situational realities of each patients. However, these researches mainly focus on adults and older children. Little experience exists with the nonoperative treatment of APA in children less than 3 years old.

### Nonoperative management of appendiceal phlegmon or abscess in children less than 3 years of age [^c885304b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

It is allowed to diagnose children appendicitis by CT scan in our country and Simanovsky N et al. had reported non-diagnostic or equivocal US in the evaluation of acute abdominal pain in children younger than 10 years old is probably sufficient to justify the additional CT radiation burden. CT scanning had been done in most young children because the ultrasonic diagnosis was uncertain, little experience existed with the nonoperative treatment of APA, and the effect of an appendicolith on clinical outcomes was unclear. The diagnostic performance of US depends on the technique of the examiners, and it is not always easy to detect the presence or absence of an appendicolith in APA. Now, the use of CT scan had been obviously decreased in our hospital because of higher success rate for nonoperative treatment and no correlation between clinical outcomes and the presence of appendicolith if APA could be diagnosed by US.

This review has some limitations. It was a single-center research. The number of patients was small because of the lower morbidity and the higher pre-operative misdiagnosis. Another limitation was that the data were retrospectively collected. These might have resulted in some degree of bias. Additional prospective trials with a larger number of subjects are needed to validate our conclusions about the optimal management of APA in young children.

The high-quality RCT by Mentula et al. (not included in the Cochrane review), conversely, demonstrated that LA in experienced hands is a safe and feasible first-line treatment for appendiceal abscess. In this study, early LA was associated with fewer readmissions and fewer additional interventions than conservative treatment, with a comparable hospital stay. Patients in the laparoscopy group had a 10% risk of bowel resection and 13% risk of incomplete appendectomy. There were significantly fewer patients with unplanned readmissions following LA (3% versus 27%, P = 0.026). Additional interventions were required in 7% of patients in the laparoscopy group (percutaneous drainage) and 30% of patients in the conservative group (appendectomy). Conversion to open surgery was required in 10% of patients in the laparoscopy group and 13% of patients in the conservative group. The rate of uneventful recovery was 90% in the laparoscopy group versus 50% in the conservative group (P = 0.002).

Luo et al. analyzed the outcomes of 1,225 patients under 18 years of age who had non-surgical treatment for an appendiceal abscess between 2007 and 2012 in Taiwan. The authors compared outcomes of percutaneous drainage with antibiotics or antibiotics alone. Of 6,190 children having an appendiceal abscess, 1,225 patients received non-operative treatment. Patients treated with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics had a significantly lower rate of recurrent AA, significantly smaller chance of receiving an interval appendectomy, and significantly fewer postoperative complications after the interval appendectomy than those without percutaneous drainage treatment. In addition, patients treated with percutaneous drainage were significantly less indicated to receive an interval appendectomy later.

Two recent meta-analyses addressed the role of early appendectomy in children with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. The meta-analysis by Fugazzola et al. found that children with appendiceal abscess/phlegmon reported better results in terms of complication rate and readmission rate if treated with NOM. Similarly, the meta-analysis by Vaos et al. reported that NOM was associated with lower rates of complications and wound infections, whereas the development of IAA and postoperative ileus was not affected by the treatment of choice. In both the meta-analyses, early appendectomy was associated with reduced length of hospital stay.

MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH ACUTE APPENDICITIS (AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE SURGERY OF TRAUMA ACUTE APPENDICITIS SEVERITY OF ILLNESS)

(Additional classification of appendicitis commonly used are as follows: uncomplicated appendicitis [nonperforated, no abscess, or phlegmon] or complicated appendicitis [perforated appendicitis, periappendicular abscess or peritonitis, defined as acute inflammation of the peritoneum secondary to infection of the appendix].) (Fig. 4)

Figure 4 
American Association for the Surgery of Trauma — Appendicitis Grades.Reused with permission from the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma.

American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Grade I (mild) represents mild appendicitis without significant inflammation (uncomplicated appendicitis). The current literature demonstrates that nonoperative management with antibiotics and pain control is noninferior to surgical treatment. Although early appendectomy is likely the most expeditious treatment, patient-centered concerns such as a desire to avoid surgery or timing of surgery should be discussed and considered as part of shared decision-making. A publicly available decision support tool called AppyOrNot provides an educational video to assist patient decision-making. The presence of a fecalith does not preclude nonoperative management, although the likelihood of requiring additional procedures is higher. The report of long-term outcomes from the Comparison of outcomes of antibiotic drugs and appendectomy trial confirmed that the hazard ratio for appendectomy among patients with an appendicolith compared with those without an appendicolith was 2.9 within 48 hours but was not difference thereafter from 48 hours to 30 days (Hazard ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.8–2.4) and from 31 days to 2 years (Hazard ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.8–1.6). –
American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Grades II to IV (moderate to severe) (complicated appendicitis) represents increasing degrees of inflammation, development of periappendiceal fluid collections, abscess formation, progression of gangrenous appendicitis, and peritonitis. The decision between initial appendectomy versus initial nonoperative management is complex, as patients with larger phlegmon and more advanced inflammatory changes involving surrounding organs may benefit from initial nonoperative management. Decision-making should be individualized based on patient factors and surgeon experience. Some patients presenting with sepsis will require preoperative fluid resuscitation in addition to early antibiotics. Minimally invasive approaches to appendectomy have become the procedure of choice. If not available, an open appendectomy is indicated. – Patients presenting with perforated appendicitis and a large inflammatory tumor (phlegmon) with abscess are best managed with early broad-spectrum antibiotics and percutaneous drainage (80% successful) for source control. A surgical approach to abscess drainage, either by minimally invasive or open technique, may be indicated if drainage and antibiotics fail to resolve the infection.
American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Grade V (most severe) represents the most severe presentation of free perforation due to acute appendicitis in the abdominal cavity. Patients are commonly present in septic shock and Sepsis 3 guidelines for resuscitation should be followed.These are surgical emergencies. Treatment consists of resuscitation, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, pharmacological cardiovascular support, and emergent operative management.

### Nonoperative management of appendiceal phlegmon or abscess in children less than 3 years of age [^4b13accf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in children. In young children less than 3 years of age, however, the incidence of appendicitis is low (approximately 2.3% of all children with acute appendicitis); thus, appendicitis in this age group is easily missed by pediatricians. Furthermore, in young children, the clinical symptoms and physical signs of appendicitis are atypical and frequently overlap with other common gastrointestinal diseases. Therefore, delayed diagnosis and a higher perforation rate occur more often. The appendiceal phlegmon or abscess (APA) at presentation occurs in about 33 to 50% in this young age group. The optimal management of APA is controversial, especially in APA with an appendicolith. The debates predominantly focus on the effects of an appendicolith and the success rate of nonoperative treatment. Some surgeons preferred immediate operation for APA, whereas some researches supported nonsurgical management with antibiotics because appendectomy could be technically difficult and complication rates rose. The presence of an appendicolith might predict failure of nonoperative treatment of APA, and immediate appendectomy may be a better choice. Some studies found no correlation between clinical outcomes and the presence of an appendicolith. Current studies mainly focused on adults and older children; however, little experience exists with the nonoperative treatment of APA during the first 3 years of life. The purposes of this retrospective study were to evaluate the appendicolith effects and the success rate of nonoperative management for APA in children under 3 years old.

### Global hospital-based disease management of acute diverticulitis: a prospective, international cohort study [^b6674af3]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study participants

Data were collected from adult patients (18 years and older) presenting to a study site with acute diverticulitis (newly incident within the audit period). Inclusion in the study followed a confirmed diagnosis of acute diverticulitis through CT scan imaging or intraoperatively during emergency surgery. Patients were included regardless of severity of the acute diverticulitis (acute uncomplicated through to fecal peritonitis), mode of presentation (outpatient clinic, inpatient admission, emergency department consultation), or subsequent treatment (admission vs discharge, surgery vs no surgery). Patients who had been previously admitted with acute diverticulitis and then re-presented with a new episode during the study period were also included with time to presentation from prior episodes recorded. Patients with diverticulosis only (the presence of colonic diverticulum without evidence of acute inflammation or complication per CT scan) or bowel perforation due to other confirmed bowel conditions were excluded.

Following identification and inclusion, patients were subsequently classified by the central research team (by review of imaging report or operative note as uncomplicated (defined as the presence of a mildly inflamed segment of colon only) or complicated (defined as an inflamed segment of colon/phlegmon with/without associated complicated features such as abscess formation, localized or generalized free fluid or free air). Complicated cases were then further classified by central review of the CT findings according to the modified Hinchey classification,stages Ia/Ib representing a phlegmon alone or with associated abscess/localized air. Distant pelvic abscesses were classified as Hinchey II and stages III (purulent peritonitis) and IV (feculent peritonitis) were clarified by central review of the operative findings in those patients’ undergoing surgery.

Short-term (30-day) treatment outcome was defined as ‘successful’ if the patient did not require any escalation of treatment and was discharged. Treatment ‘failure’ was defined as any treatment escalation or reintervention within 30-days of index treatment (including readmission).

### A comprehensive review of abdominal infections [^e7c8a8e6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Diverticulitis

Diverticular disease has increased since the turn of the 20th century. The prevalence of diverticular disease among the general population is unknown, but at autopsy more than 50% of people over 80 years old are affected. The lifetime prevalence of diverticulitis among patients with diverticulosis is 10-25%.

The standard treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis is bowel rest and antibiotics. Most patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis respond to conservative management. Two studies found that patients who did not respond to antibiotics within 48 hours were more likely to require prolonged hospital stays for IV antibiotics and/or surgical intervention.

Diverticulitis can be complicated by phlegmon, abscess, or free perforation and is generally classified according to modified Hinchey criteria. Approximately 15-20% of cases are associated with abscesses. In cases of uniloculated abscess, the initial treatment is usually percutaneous drainage; although, in small abscesses (< 4 cm), antibiotics have been used as a primary treatment with success rates comparable to drainage. When percutaneous drainage is performed it has success rates of up to 90%. Of importance, the success of percutaneous drainage also seems to be dependent upon location. Ambrosetti and colleagues found that compared to mesocolic abscesses, pelvic abscesses were more aggressive, needed earlier drainage, and were more likely to require surgery.

### Predictive factors for failure of nonoperative management in perforated appendicitis [^ca69a1fd]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Identifying patients on admission with perforated appendicitis who have phlegmon or abscess initially selected for but likely to fail nonoperative management may avoid delays in definitive treatment.

Methods

Patients older than 15 years presenting to a university tertiary care hospital with perforated appendicitis and abscess or phlegmon and planned nonoperative management were reviewed. Comorbidities, clinical findings, laboratory markers, radiographic findings, and nonsurgical treatments associated with failure of nonoperative management were recorded.

Results

Eighty-nine patients were identified, and 69 were managed successfully to discharge without operation. Length of stay was greater in the failure group (11 days vs. 5 days, p = 0.001), and intensive care unit care was more common (10% vs. 0%, p = 0.049). On univariate and multivariate analyses, smoking (odds ratio [OR], 13.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-142; p = 0.039), tachycardia (OR, 4.93; 95% CI, 1.21-20.06; p = 0.026), and generalized abdominal tenderness (OR, 5.52; 95% CI, 1.40-21.73; p = 0.015) were associated with failure of nonoperative management. On computed tomographic scan, the failure group had higher rates of abscess (75% vs. 55%, p = 0.110), and their abscesses were more likely smaller than 50 mm (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.01-7.92; p = 0.043).

Conclusion

Patients with perforated appendicitis and phlegmon or abscess who smoke or present with tachycardia, generalized abdominal tenderness, and abscesses smaller than 50 mm are more likely to fail nonoperative management and should be considered for early operation. These findings should be validated prospectively.

### Management of acute appendicitis in adults: a practice management guideline from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma [^c02c3fc1]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis (AA) has been considered one of the most common acute surgical conditions in the world. Recent studies, however, have suggested that nonoperative management (NOM) with a course of antibiotics (ABX) may be as effective as surgery in treating appendicitis. As there are evolving perspectives regarding the optimal therapy for appendicitis, we sought to provide recommendations regarding the role of NOM with the administration of antibiotics (antibiotics-first approach) in uncomplicated AA as well as the need for routine interval appendectomy (RIA) in those presenting with appendiceal abscess or phlegmon (AAP) initially managed without appendectomy.

Methods

A writing group from the Guidelines Committee of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the current literature regarding appendicitis in adult populations. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was applied and meta-analyses and evidence profiles generated.

Results

When comparing antibiotics-first therapy to surgery for uncomplicated AA in adult populations, we found that perforation and recurrence of disease were the only outcomes consistently represented in the literature. For perforation, we were unable to make a definitive conclusion based on the degree of heterogeneity among the six randomized controlled trials reviewed. The risk of recurrence at 1 year with antibiotics-first treatment was 15.8% (95% confidence interval, 12.05-118.63). Critical outcomes could not be evaluated with the current literature. In NOM patients for AAP, the risk of recurrence was 24.3% if RIA was not performed (95% confidence interval, 2.74-73.11).

Conclusion

Based on the completed meta-analysis and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation profiles, we were unable to make a recommendation for or against the antibiotics-first approach as primary treatment for uncomplicated AA. For NOM with AAP, we conditionally recommend against RIA in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. This review reveals multiple limitations of the published literature, leaving ample opportunities for additional research on this topic.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic and recurrent diverticulitis [^2f0fc37b]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

In Western countries the prevalence of diverticular disease has increased over the past century. Although, most patients remain asymptomatic, among those who experience an attack of diverticulitis, one-third will have recurrent symptoms, and a further third will have a subsequent episode. The indications for surgery after treatment of acute diverticulitis is still under debate. Uncomplicated disease less commonly as thought, progresses to a life threatening situation such as free perforation. Among those who develop complicated diverticulitis, it is often their first presentation. Fistula to the urinary tract often require surgery; however, complicated disease such as an abscess or phlegmon can be managed conservatively and subsequent surgery is selective depending on the recovery from the initial episode. Patients with chronic diverticular disease (persistent pain in the absence of inflammation) have greatly improved quality of life with surgery. The question of greater virulence of disease among young patients may no longer be true and recommendations for surgery may parallel that of older patients. Immunocompromised patients should have definitive surgical therapy early on in the course of the disease. Right-sided disease remains uncommon in the Western world and a conservative approach in the absence of free perforation is recommended. In right-sided disease and in young patients, misdiagnosis is common. In the elective setting, a laparoscopic approach is rapidly becoming preferred because of less morbidity and shorter hospital stay. The treatment of diverticular disease is rapidly undergoing reevaluation, and novel therapies and increased conservative approaches are evolving. Prospective randomized trials are needed, but remain difficult owing to the uncertain natural history of the disease.

### American Association for the Surgery of Trauma emergency general surgery guideline summaries 2018: acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, acute diverticulitis, acute pancreatitis, and small bowel obstruction [^bcd174d1]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute appendicitis management guidelines summary

Multiple societies have published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of appendicitis. Notably, a consensus statement was published in Surgical Endoscopy in 2015, and a summary from the World Society of Emergency Surgery was published in the World Journal of Emergency Surgery in 2016. Several other comprehensive guidelines covering imaging recommendations, antimicrobial prophylaxis and duration, laparoscopic versus open surgical approach, and optimal management of perforated appendicitis have been published. This review summarizes and references evidence-based guidelines for appendicitis by stage, as a reference guide for surgeons practicing emergency general surgery.

Key points

Laparoscopic appendectomy is considered the gold standard for acute appendicitis and should be the procedure of choice, except when laparoscopy is contraindicated or not feasible. Studies have demonstrated the laparoscopic approach is equivalent to, or better than, the open technique in most circumstances. Conversion to open may be necessary in technically difficult cases, however. Laparoscopic appendectomy is safe in the obese, elderly patients, pediatric patients and pregnant patient populations, including in the third trimester.

Non-operative therapy is a reasonable approach in uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Patients should be educated that the possibility of recurrence exists. Non-operative therapy may also be considered in some cases of acute appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess.In most other situations, appendectomy is the standard of care.

CT imaging is more reliable that ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The use of intravenous contrast may improve the sensitivity of this test and is generally recommended when CT imaging is performed. Exceptions to CT may be pursued in pregnant women and children to minimize exposure to radiation. Ultrasound is preferred for diagnosis in pregnant patients and children. If ultrasound is equivocal, MRI would be the next diagnostic test of choice.

Preoperative antibiotics should be administered as soon as the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is made. There is no indication for postoperative antibiotics in uncomplicated appendicitis.There are also no data supporting improvement in clinical outcomes with any given scoring system for acute appendicitis.

Technical maneuvers, such as peritoneal irrigation, variations in appendiceal stump closure or methods of mesenteric vascular control have demonstrated no difference in outcomes.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 36: the mastitis spectrum, revised 2022 [^dedb25ac]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Clinical Protocol #36—the mastitis spectrum—states that scientific evidence demonstrates that mastitis “encompasses a spectrum of conditions resulting from ductal inflammation and stromal edema,” and that the “pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of each condition in the mastitis spectrum (ductal narrowing, inflammatory mastitis, bacterial mastitis, phlegmon, abscess, galactocele, and subacute mastitis) will be discussed hereunder,” with “Early postpartum engorgement, a distinct condition” also reviewed. It describes progression whereby “If ductal narrowing and alveolar congestion are worsened by overstimulation of milk production, then inflammatory mastitis can develop, and acute bacterial mastitis may follow,” which “can progress to phlegmon or abscess, particularly in the setting of tissue trauma from aggressive breast massage,” and notes that “Galactoceles, which can result from unresolved hyperlactation, can become infected” and “Subacute mastitis occurs in the setting of chronic mammary dysbiosis, with bacterial biofilms narrowing ductal lumens.” Protocol scope statements emphasize that “These protocols serve only as guidelines for the care of breastfeeding mothers and infants and do not delineate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as standards of medical care,” and that “Variations in treatment may be appropriate according to the needs of an individual patient.” Inclusivity language specifies that “The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine recognizes that not all lactating individuals identify as women” and that the position is “to interpret clinical protocols within the framework of inclusivity of all breastfeeding, chestfeeding, and human milk-feeding individuals.” The document also states that it “now replaces ABM Protocols #4, Mastitis, and #20, Engorgement, which will both be retired; ABM Protocols #32 (Management of Hyperlactation) and #35 (Supporting Breastfeeding During Maternal or Child Hospitalization) may serve as useful adjuncts to this protocol.”

### Current diagnosis and management of acute colonic diverticulitis: what you need to know [^117c9a3a]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a common disease treated by acute care surgeons. Acute uncomplicated colonic diverticulitis involves thickening of the colon wall with inflammatory changes and less commonly requires the expertise of a surgeon; many cases may be treated as an outpatient with or without antibiotics. Complicated diverticulitis involves phlegmon, abscess, peritonitis, obstruction, stricture, and/or fistula and usually requires inpatient hospital admission, treatment with antibiotics, and consideration for intervention including operative management. This review will discuss what the acute care surgeon needs to know about diagnosis and management of acute colonic diverticulitis.

### The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland consensus guidelines in emergency colorectal surgery [^e00d9d98]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 1.4

Can acute diverticulitis be managed non‐operatively?

Recommendation: Antibiotics may be omitted in uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Patients with complicated acute diverticulitis should be administered broad‐spectrum antibiotics and most can be treated non‐operatively, but regular clinical re‐evaluation must be undertaken to determine success or failure of treatment.

Level of evidence: I

Grade of recommendation: A

Consensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)

There is no evidence mandating the use of routine antibiotics in uncomplicated AD. Conservative treatment strategy without antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated AD has proven to be safe, with long‐term outcomes, in terms of recurrence, complications and need for surgery, being similar to those treated with antibiotics. However, CRP level >170 mg/l is a risk factor for non‐antibiotic treatment failure and selective, rather than routine, omission of antibiotics is still recommended.

There is no evidence to support a particular antibiotic regime, route or duration for complicated AD. Antibiotics are indicated in all cases of complicated AD. If a drainage procedure is indicated, there is no evidence to support a prolonged course of antibiotics after source control is achieved.

Approximately 20% of patients with AD will have complicated disease and the majority can be treated conservatively with antibiotics, including many cases with abscesses and pericolic extraluminal air. Mesocolic abscesses (Modified Hinchey 1b) are more likely than pelvic or intra‐abdominal abscesses to respond to antibiotics alone and Hinchey II patients with abscesses smaller than 4 cm in size can also usually be treated with antibiotics alone. Simultaneous abscess and perforation occur in around 18% of patients and the presence of an abscess increases the risk of failure of non‐operative management. Isolated pericolic extraluminal gas—defined as free gas no more than 5 cm from the site of inflammation—is found in up to 15% of patients with complicated AD, and 6% of patients with isolated pericolic extraluminal air will need emergency surgery (ES) with a 2% 30‐day mortality rate. Even in patients with free gas, provided there is an absence of severe peritonitis or sepsis, up to one‐third can be successfully managed non‐operatively. The decision to persist with non‐operative therapy in complicated AD must take into account the patient's physiological state, response to treatment through regular review and associated comorbidities.

### Interobserver variability in the classification of appendicitis during laparoscopy [^b36fd3e6]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Outcomes

Participants were first asked to classify the appendix in the video as indicative of no appendicitis, simple appendicitis or complex appendicitis (classification 1). No definition of simple and complex appendicitis was given beforehand. Participants were also asked to rank the appendix as normal, phlegmonous, gangrenous, perforated and/or abscess (classification 2). These answers were subsequently categorized following the definition of Bhangu and colleagues (classification 3) 5. Where gangrenous appendix, perforated appendix and/or abscess was identified, the answer was categorized as indicating complex appendicitis. If only normal or phlegmonous was selected, the answer was categorized as not indicating complex appendicitis (Table 1). Finally, participants were asked to choose whether they would prescribe postoperative antibiotic treatment (yes or no). After assessing the videos, participants were asked to answer some questions about local hospital protocols and their personal opinion on the indications for postoperative antibiotic treatment, and on the duration and route of administration of such treatment.

### Surgical treatment of awn aspiration causing bronchopleural fistula and bronchiectasis: case reports [^1d68d32c]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Case 2

A 9-year-old boy presented at our department with a 6-day long history of awn inhalation. At the time of the accident, leading symptoms involved coughing and vomiting. Fragments of awn had also been found in his vomit and stool. After 2 days, fever and chest pain developed, thus chest X-ray was performed in a county hospital showing no apparent abnormalities. Despite having been started on amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and azithromycin, intensity of the right sided chest pain increased. Blood count showed leucocytosis (14,76 × 10 6 /μL) with neutrophil predominance, and elevated CRP (99,4 mg/L). On the sixth day of aspiration repeated chest X-ray revealed right sided infiltration with pleural effusion. Rigid bronchoscopy was performed under general anaesthesia without any endobronchial pathology detected. Bronchial fluid was collected with negative bacteriological results. During an observational period, antibiotic therapy was completed with clindamycin, after which symptoms and blood markers improved on the sixteenth day (white blood cell: 10,000 × 10 6 /μL without left shift, CRP: 19,77 mg/L). Regular chest ultrasound and X-ray confirmed regression of infiltration and effusion, however 16 days later a round shaped lesion with possible abscess formation was detected at the site of the right lower lobe. Chest computed tomography showed a 41 × 20 mm area with decreased air content in segment 6 of the right lung, involving the pleura (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 
Computed tomography picture of pleuropneumonia in Case 2

Surgery was indicated based on the history of awn inhalation, localized lung abscess with pleural effusion, and the known course of awn aspiration, potentially leading to the involvement of intrathoracic organs, and perforation through the chest wall. Focal adhesions between the right lower lobe and the diaphragm were found during posterolateral thoracotomy, and successful removal of a 4-cm-long awn particle from the pleura and the abscess wall around segment 6 was carried out (Figs. 2 and 3). Possible presence of a residual foreign body could not have been excluded, thus surgical resection became inevitable. Segmentectomy was performed due to localized inflammation in segment 6 on CT. Previously described symptoms were relieved after surgery, and follow-up chest radiography showed no signs of the former abscess. The patient was discharged on the 8th postoperative day. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of a chronic granulomatous inflammation resulting from aspiration.

### Conservative treatment of aortic graft infection [^a6b1c3dc]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Conservative, nonresectional management of aortic graft infections is the optimal management for selected patients with aortic graft infections. The best candidates are those patients who have significant comorbidities, or where the existing aortic graft is in a location that precludes excision without causing a high likelihood of morbidity and/or mortality, such as thoracoabdominal and aortic arch grafts. When considering the conservative approach, computed tomographic angiography, supplemented by Indium(111) leukocyte scanning, is the best combination of diagnostic tests. Contraindications to a conservative approach are infected anastomotic aneurysms, graft-enteric fistulas, and suture-line hemorrhage. Needle aspiration of perigraft fluid or phlegmon, under ultrasound or computed tomography guidance, is useful to both culture the infection and provide drainage. A conservative approach should not be considered when the graft infection is due to invasive Gram-negative organisms, such as Pseudomonas or Salmonella species. Once a conservative approach is selected as the best treatment option, drainage of an infected perigraft space is critical to success, and can be performed either percutaneously or with open surgery, whether an endograft or surgically placed graft is in place. If open drainage is required, the perigraft space should be debrided and catheters placed for long-term antibiotic irrigation. With continuous antibiotic irrigation until the cultures are negative, followed by life-long oral antibiotics, there are multiple case reports and small series of long-term survivors. Whether the aortic graft infection is cured or controlled is debated, but outcomes for high-risk patients and those with grafts in critical vascular beds are often superior to a high-risk surgical graft resection.

### Safety and efficacy of antibiotics compared with appendicectomy for treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^80db9497]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Hansson et al reported that 43/202 patients randomised to antibiotic treatment had either local or general peritonitis compared with 47/167 patients randomised to appendicectomy.Ninety-six patients randomised to antibiotic therapy had appendicectomy subsequently, of whom 25 had peritonitis. On the basis of per protocol analysis, 50/250 patients had perforation in the surgery group compared with 6/119 patients in the antibiotic group. This included 3/12 recurrences after antibiotic treatment. Forty-two patients in the appendicectomy group were reported to have gangrenous appendicitis, 128 had phlegmonous appendicitis, and 30 were reported to have other diagnoses. However, this group included 83 patients who crossed over from antibiotic treatment to appendicectomy evaluated per protocol.

In the study by Styrud et al,six of 120 patients who underwent surgery had perforation, whereas seven of the 15 patients (total 128 patients) in the antibiotic group who had surgery during their primary admission had perforation. Of those who had recurrences, 5/16 patients had perforation in the antibiotic group. Eriksson et al reported one perforation each in the surgery and antibiotic groups.

A total of 13 patients who were readmitted after successful initial antibiotic treatment had either perforated or gangrenous appendicitis compared with 22 patients (10 perforated and 12 gangrenous appendicitis) in those who crossed over to surgery after initial randomisation to the antibiotic group (n=126). The overall risk of perforated or gangrenous appendicitis in the antibiotic treated group was 7.4%

Readmissions

Figure 2shows that 68/345 (20%) patients treated with antibiotics were readmitted with recurrence of symptoms. In this group, four patients had normal appendix and 13 (19%) had complicated appendicitis. Three patients were treated successfully with another course of antibiotics.

### Acute phlegmonous esophagitis [^5a45b97c]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Acute phlegmonous esophagitis (APE) is a rare disease caused by bacterial infection of the oesophagus, typically involving the submucosal and muscularis layers. Patients may present with chest pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, dyspnoea, fever, nausea and vomiting, making diagnosis difficult. We present two cases of APE, both young females who presented with dysphagia and odynophagia. The first patient had a history of surgery (left mastoidectomy) which might have functioned as a nidus for infection, whereas the second patient had uncontrolled diabetes. CT findings in both patients revealed diffuse oesophageal thickening, and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy showed erythema and ulcerations. Both patients were managed conservatively using intravenous antibiotics and supportive therapy. APE is associated with a high mortality rate and warrants early diagnosis and treatment. CT is the preferred non-invasive diagnostic modality. Treatment includes systemic antibiotics, nutritional support and timely endoscopic or surgical intervention. Invasive intervention is indicated in patients not responding to medical therapy or in those with complications.

### A comprehensive review of abdominal infections [^cb3f114f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Though acute appendicitis is a very common entity, its management still contains areas of controversy including the role of laparoscopy, and the emerging role of medical management. These decisions can be complicated by the presence of an abscess or phlegmon.

Surgical management of acute appendicitis has been the gold standard of treatment for decades. However, many groups have proposed that in select patients, acute uncomplicated appendicitis can be treated with antibiotics alone. Initial success rates for conservative management of acute appendicitis range from 88-95%; however, recurrence is common, occurring in up to 35% of cases.

Both laparoscopic and open appendectomy are safe and effective. In large reviews, laparoscopic appendectomy has been associated with fewer surgical site infections, less pain, shorter hospital stays, and more rapid return to normal activity. Common disadvantages found include increased cost and longer operative times. Additionally, laparoscopy has been associated with increased risk of intra-abdominal abscess formation, especially in the presence of perforation or gangrene. In these cases, open surgery may be preferred. Ultimately, the differences in outcomes between laparoscopic and open appendectomy are largely equivocal and the decision should be based on available technology and surgeon expertise, with increased consideration for laparoscopy in young female or obese patients.

Management of patients presenting with abscess or phlegmon is conservative, with antibiotics and drainage initially. Traditionally this has been followed by interval appendectomy. However, recently the need for interval appendectomy has been questioned. Controversy primarily surrounds the issues of recurrence and potential for malignancy. In a large review the recurrence rate was 7.4% and the risk of malignancy 1.2%. This is in accord with similar studies that conclude that in asymptomatic patients, interval appendectomy has no advantages over a thorough work up for inflammatory appendiceal masses.

### Optimizing antibiotic treatment of skin infections in pediatric emergency and urgent care centers [^5a0a447f]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to optimize antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated skin/soft tissue infections (SSTIs) discharged from pediatric emergency departments (EDs) and urgent cares (UCs).

Methods

Pediatric patients aged 0 to 18 years discharged from 3 pediatric EDs and 8 UCs with a diagnosis of uncomplicated SSTIs were included. Optimal treatment was defined as 5 days of cephalexin for nonpurulent SSTIs and 7 days of clindamycin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for purulent SSTIs. Exclusion criteria included erysipelas, folliculitis, felon, impetigo, lymphangitis, paronychia, perianal abscess, phlegmon, preseptal or orbital cellulitis, and cephalosporin allergy. Baseline data were collected from January 2018 to June 2019. Quality improvement (QI) interventions began July 2019 with a revised SSTI guideline, discharge order set, and maintenance of certification (MOC) QI project. MOC participants received 3 education sessions, monthly group feedback, and individual scorecards. Balancing measures included return visits within 10 days requiring escalation of care. Data were monitored through March 2021.

Results

In total, 9306 SSTIs were included. The MOC QI project included 50 ED and UC physicians (27% of eligible physicians). For purulent SSTI, optimal antibiotic choice, plus duration, increased from a baseline median of 28% to 64%. For nonpurulent SSTI, optimal antibiotic choice, plus duration, increased from a median of 2% to 43%. MOC participants had greater improvement than non-MOC providers (P < .010). Return visits did not significantly change pre- to postintervention, remaining <2%.

Conclusions

We improved optimal choice and reduced duration of antibiotic treatment of outpatient SSTIs. MOC participation was associated with greater improvement and was sustained after the intervention period.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound in the differentiation between phlegmon and abscess in Crohn's disease and other abdominal conditions [^9f1c47a7]. European Journal of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to differentiate between intra-abdominal phlegmon and abscess.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all contrast-enhanced ultrasound performed between June 2006 and May 2012 to identify patients with the terms "inflammatory mass", "phlegmon" or "abscess" on the sonographic report. The initial CEUS report was used for the diagnosis of phlegmon or abscess.

Results

71 inflammatory masses in 50 patients were identified in CEUS examination. 57 masses, 21 phlegmons and 36 abscesses, were confirmed by other imaging techniques, percutaneous drainage or surgery. CEUS specificity for the diagnosis of abscess was 100%. Kappa coefficient between CEUS and other techniques in the diagnosis of phlegmon or abscess was excellent (kappa=0.972). Only in one patient surgery detected a small abscess (<2 cm) within a phlegmon that not was detected by CEUS. Statistically significant differences were found between the size of the abscesses before and after contrast agent injection. The interobserver agreement in the diagnosis of phlegmon or abscess was excellent (kappa=0.953).

Conclusions

CEUS is an accurate method for differentiating between intra-abdominal phlegmon and abscess in gastrointestinal conditions, especially in CD. Its use may help to better define the size of the collections and avoid other techniques that use ionizing radiation. CEUS should be used to confirm an inflammatory mass identified at US.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with complicated appendicitis [^cc0474b9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Complicated appendicitis (appendicitis with abscess, perforation, or generalized peritonitis) poses a significant burden on healthcare systems, with incidence up to 28-29%. Current management options include antibiotic therapy and up-front surgery, antibiotic therapy and percutaneous drainage, or antibiotic therapy alone. There is no consensus on treatment guidelines in current literature. This study aims to better define treatment algorithms for patients presenting with acute complicated appendicitis by evaluating clinical outcomes in those treated with or without surgery.

Methods

We performed a single-institution, retrospective review of 220 adult patients (≥18 years old) treated for acute complicated appendicitis from January 2017 to June 2022. Demographic and clinicopathologic variables were collected and analyzed. We compared patients who were managed non-operatively versus operatively. Regression modeling was used to determine factors associated with non-operative management (NOM) and those predictive of failure of NOM.

Results

Our analysis showed 26.3% patients with acute complicated appendicitis underwent NOM (n=58), versus 73.6% underwent operative management at index admission (n=162). Within the NOM group, 55.1% patients were treated with antibiotics alone (n=32) versus 44.8% with percutaneous drainage (n=26). Within the operative cohort, 88.7% of patients underwent appendectomy (n=142). Age, body mass index, comorbidities, vital signs and laboratory values on admission were similar between both groups. Clinical factors predictive of initial NOM were perforation (OR 7.9, 95% CI 3.7-16.5) and phlegmon (OR 6.3, 95% CI 2.8-14.1) at presentation. Clinical factors predictive of failure of NOM requiring surgery on index admission or within 30 days was larger abscess and/or phlegmon size (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.0-3.0).

Conclusion

There may be a role in identifying clinical factors in patients with complicated appendicitis that favor non operative versus operative management. Larger abscess and/or phlegmon size could be a predictor of failure of NOM.

### WSES guidelines for the management of acute left sided colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^e21bd682]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Radiological imaging techniques that are used for diagnosing acute diverticulitis in the emergency setting are computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US). CT imaging is becoming by now the gold standard in the diagnosis and staging of patients with ALCD. CT imaging with intravenous contrast has excellent sensitivity and specificity. CT findings in patients with ALCD may include diverticulosis with associated colon wall thickening, fat stranding, phlegmon, extraluminal gas, abscess formation or intra-abdominal diffuse fluid. CT imaging can go beyond accurate diagnosis of ALCD; CT criteria may be also used to determine the grade of severity and may drive treatment planning of patients. US is a real-time dynamic examination with wide availability and easy accessibility and may be useful in diagnosing and managing critically ill patients who cannot be moved to CT. Its limitations include operator-dependency, poor assessment in obese patients, difficulty in the detection of free air and deeply located abscesses.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported diagnostic accuracy of the clinical diagnosis and diagnostic modalities in patients with suspected diverticulitis was published in 2014. Summary sensitivity estimates for US were 90 % (95 % CI: 76-98 %) versus 95 % (95 % CI: 91-97 %) for CT (p = 0.86). Summary specificity estimates for US were 90 % (95 % CI: 86-94 %) versus 96 % (95 % CI: 90-100 %) for CT (p = 0.04).

Although CT is the most sensitive imaging investigation for patients with suspected acute diverticulitis, a step-up approach with CT performed after an inconclusive or negative US, has been proposed as safe and alternative approach for patients with suspected acute diverticulitis. Magnetic resonance imaging, which is not constrained by the operator dependency limitation of ultrasound, until now is difficult to perform at the emergency department.

### Multicentre study of non-surgical management of diverticulitis with abscess formation [^3aba8e11]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

Short‐term outcomes were: treatment failure, complications (colonic obstruction, perforation and fistula formation), clinical deterioration/progression of disease, emergency surgery (all unscheduled operations), readmissions, persistent diverticulitis (complaints lasting more than 30 days) and death. Long‐term outcomes were: recurrent (un)complicated diverticulitis episodes, sigmoid resection and death. Short term was defined as the first 30 days after diagnosis of abscess, or during the primary admission if a patient was still in hospital after 30 days, whereas long term was defined as the period thereafter. Treatment failure was defined as the composite outcome of complications, readmissions, persistent diverticulitis, emergency surgery, death or need for PCD in the no‐PCD group. Recurrent diverticulitis was registered as complicated in the presence of a phlegmon, abscess, fistula, stenosis or perforation, whereas uncomplicated diverticulitis was registered if it was mentioned in the medical record as recurrent disease, in the absence of the abovementioned complications.

Which classification should be used in patients with ALCD?

There are multiple classification systems for ALCD. None has been conclusively proven to be superior in predicting patient outcomes, and therefore, a specific recommendation cannot be provided.

ALCD ranges in severity from uncomplicated phlegmonous diverticulitis to complicated diverticulitis including abscess and/or perforation.

For the past three decades, the Hinchey classification has been the most used classification in the international literature.

In patients with surgical findings of abscesses and peritonitis, Hinchey et al. classified the severity of acute diverticulitis into four levels:
Pericolic abscess
Pelvic, intra-abdominal, or retroperitoneal abscess
Generalized purulent peritonitis
Generalized fecal peritonitis

In recent years, the management of ALCD has changed dramatically.

Computer tomography (CT) imaging has become a primary diagnostic tool in the diagnosis and staging of patients with ALCD, and more detailed information provided by CT scans led to several modifications of the Hinchey classification [,–].

In 1989, Neff et al. presented a new classification of ALCD based on CT findings. It consisted of five stages, ranging from radiological diagnosis of uncomplicated (stage 0) to pneumoperitoneum with abundant free liquid (stage 4) :
0 Uncomplicated diverticulitis; diverticula, thickening of the wall, increased density of the pericolic fat
1 Locally complicated with local abscess
2 Complicated with pelvic abscess
3 Complicated with distant abscess
4 Complicated with other distant complications

In 2002, Ambrosetti et al. classified ALCD into severe or moderate disease. In this classification, the CT scan determined the grade of severity guiding the physician in the treatment of acute complications. Moderate diverticulitis was defined by wall thickening of ≥ 5 mm and signs of pericolic fat inflammation. Severe diverticulitis was defined by wall thickening accompanied by abscess, extraluminal gas, or extraluminal contrast:
Moderate diverticulitis Localized sigmoid wall thickening (≥ 5 mm) Pericolic fat stranding

### A febrile 67-year-old man with pulmonary consolidation and contralateral nodules [^5a580400]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 67-year-old man who currently smoked (45 pack-years) was referred to the emergency department for fever and exacerbation of cough over the last week. The current illness began 1 month earlier with nonproductive cough and exertional dyspnea. He did not report anorexia, hemoptysis, or weight loss. Outpatient treatment with cefditoren and moxifloxacin did not improve his symptoms. No remarkable medical history was reported. The patient was admitted for further evaluation.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^d55176e7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis—epidemiology, complications, and recurrence: An estimated 5% to 10% of patients with diverticulosis may develop acute diverticulitis, and from 2000 to 2007 the estimated prevalence in the general population was 180 cases per 100 000 persons per year. However, in about 12% of cases, patients have complicated diverticulitis, which is defined as inflammation associated with abscess, a phlegmon, a fistula, an obstruction, bleeding, or perforation. Among patients with an index or second episode of acute diverticulitis, the reported rate of recurrence at 10 years is 22% or 55%, respectively; approximately 200 000 hospitalizations occur annually in the United States, with national costs totaling more than $8 billion annually in recent years.

### Managing empyema in adults [^e8ec5f8c]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

A collection of pus in the pleural space (empyema) is a dangerous condition that is usually a complication of pneumonia. Empyema can be associated with a delayed response of pneumonia to antibacterial treatment. It can lead to septicaemia, disseminated abscesses and prolonged hospitalisation. Reported mortality rates are typically 7-33%, but may exceed 50% in elderly patients or those with significant comorbidity, such as malignancy, diabetes mellitus or alcohol abuse. Here we review the management of adults with empyema.

The standard curative treatment for diffuse XGP is antibiotic therapy and nephrectomy but focal XGP can be treated with antibiotics or nephron-sparing surgery. Korkes F et al. reported 41 cases of XGP, and all patients underwent nephrectomy. Except for two died from septic shock after surgery, the rest of the patients recovered well. Çaliskan S et al. reported 13 cases of XGP, of which one patient underwent partial nephrectomy and 12 patients underwent nephrectomy. Perioperative and postoperative complications did not occur. Chlif et al. reported a series where they treated three patients with localized XGP with partial nephrectomy. After a mean follow-up of 34.6 months, no recurrence of XGPN has been noted. In our case, the patient had diffuse pyelonephritis, and the initial treatment with holmium laser lithotripsy and antibiotics failed, and nephrectomy was finally performed.

Coccidioidomycosis—hematogenous dissemination recognition focuses on lesion characteristics and typical presentations. Although patients with cellular immune deficiencies are especially susceptible, most patients with coccidioidal lesions outside of the lungs have no identified immune deficiencies. Extrapulmonary lesions are focal areas of tissue destruction that result from the acute inflammatory response engendered by actively rupturing spherules, and pulmonary symptoms or radiographic abnormalities may be minimal or completely absent. Chronic skin ulceration or subcutaneous abscesses are the consequence of cutaneous and soft tissue dissemination, and headache and focal skeletal pain are common with CM or osteomyelitis, respectively. Although such lesions may wax and wane over many months and even years, they usually are progressive and seldom resolve completely without medical intervention, and tissue-destructive lesions are nearly always readily evident from focal signs and symptoms; their absence is strong evidence that disseminated infection is not present.

### Building toolkits for COPD exacerbations: lessons from the past and present [^d8dbb0f3]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

The treatment of exacerbations has remained short-acting bronchodilators and corticosteroids with or without antibiotics for 30 years, almost irrespective of the underlying cause. However, with global concerns about antibiotic use and an increasing number of clinical trials of new or repurposed therapeutics given at the time of exacerbation, identifying the exacerbation trigger has never felt more relevant. Can clinical evaluation alone help identify the cause?

From the late 1990s onwards, a body of evidence supported the concept that the presence of purulent sputum at exacerbation presentation was indicative of a bacterial exacerbation (eg Stockley et al,) and this has been used ever since as a potential biomarker for bacterial infections. However, there are concerns about the ability of patients to self-report sputum colour without training or a colour chart to refer to Daniels et al and in some studies, sputum colour could not differentiate between a viral or bacterial aetiology.A landmark study in 2011suggested that exacerbations could be stratified using inflammatory profile. Here, 55% of exacerbations were associated with bacteria, 29% with a virus, most commonly rhinovirus, 28% with a significant sputum eosinophilia and 14% with no significant inflammation (termed pauci-inflammatory). Of note, these groupings did not reflect differences in symptom burden, clinical presentation or sputum colour, which could not differentiate between causes,meaning clinicians could not predict what the cause or inflammatory profile of the exacerbation was using standard clinical evaluation alone. This has important but perhaps predictable implications for clinical practice. Moving forward, as with other acute presentations of chronic disease, we should not rely on clinical symptoms, signs or non-specific investigations to direct a stratified approach to exacerbation treatment. Given COPD is an inflammatory disease, the immune response may provide aetiological insight.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: randomised placebo controlled trial [^d0cb3d9e]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

One of the results of this study is that antibiotic treatment was not more effective than placebo in shortening the duration of cough. Systematic analyses of clinical trials also suggest that antibiotics may achieve a reduction, albeit marginal, in the duration of the symptoms.A review of the Cochrane Library showed that patients given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough than were those given placebo (risk ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.85), but these results came from only four clinical trials with 275 participants in total.Another randomised clinical trial, based on data from the genomics to combat resistance against antibiotics in community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in Europe (GRACE) study, not included in the Cochrane Library review, has recently been published.It constitutes, by far, the largest study carried out, including 16 networks in 12 European countries with 2061 adults aged 18 or older with acute cough of less than one month’s duration as the prominent symptom, and once pneumonia was excluded on the basis of clinical grounds. Symptoms rated moderately bad or worse, which was considered as the main outcome, lasted a median of six days in the group allocated to amoxicillin 3 g daily and seven days in the placebo group, with a non-significant difference (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.18). Similar to our study design, Stott and colleagues included only patients with acute bronchitis and purulent sputum and did not observe any statistically significant differences in the resolution of cough between the group treated with antibiotics and the group assigned to the control.Current guidelines, endorsed by several national societies, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the European Respiratory Society, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, do not recommend the routine use of antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bronchitis in otherwise normal people.None the less, after their introduction in the 1940s, antibacterial agents were rapidly embraced for treatment of acute bronchitis. At present, more than 60% of patients receive antibiotics for acute bronchitis, and it is currently one of the five most commonly cited infections for excessive antibiotic use in outpatients.Many doctors may not give antibiotics on the first visit, but are more likely to prescribe these antibacterials on subsequent visits, mainly if discoloured sputum is present. In a prospective study of more than 3000 adults with acute cough due a lower respiratory tract infection in 13 European countries, Butler and colleagues observed that patients who presented discoloured sputum were prescribed antibiotics 3.2 times more often than those patients without discoloured sputum.In other studies this odds ratio of antibiotic prescribing in the presence of discoloured sputum ranged from 2.1 to 4.8.This aspect is even more important since more than half of the patients with acute bronchitis report the production of purulent sputum.Peroxidase released by the leucocytes in sputum causes the colour changes; hence, colour alone should not be considered indicative of bacterial infection.Another explanation for the frequent prescription of antibiotics is the lack of distinction between acute and chronic bronchitis. This may explain why clinicians perceive antibiotics to be more beneficial to smokers.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^bbb83163]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis—lumbar puncture indications for newly diagnosed infection—In patients with recently diagnosed coccidioidal infection, we recommend lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis only in patients with unusual, worsening, or persistent headaches, or with other focal or new local neurologic deficits (strong, moderate). Headache is nearly always produced by coccidioidal meningitis (CM), but it is also a common (21%) symptom in uncomplicated primary coccidioidal pneumonic disease; if the headache is modest in severity and dissipates in approximately a week, a lumbar puncture is not required, whereas if the headache is the predominant symptom or is consistent, persistent, and progressive, lumbar puncture is required. In contrast, unless signs or symptoms of central nervous system involvement are present, routine analysis of CSF is unnecessary, and in the absence of symptoms, CM is unlikely.

### Nonoperative management of right colonic diverticulitis using radiologic evaluation [^5998bc6f]. Colorectal Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Although a few reviews have been conducted, nonoperative management may be the mainstay of therapy for uncomplicated right colonic diverticulitis. With increasing use of radiological evaluation for diverticulitis, the status of the disease is becoming more accessible. In this study, clinical outcomes of nonoperative management for right colonic diverticulitis were assessed according to disease status using radiological evaluation.

Method

From April 2000 to March 2007, 296 patients were admitted for acute right colonic diverticulitis upon first attack and were treated with nonoperative management. The status of diverticulitis was classified using ultrasonography and/or computed tomography as inflamed diverticulum or phlegmon in 276 patients or pericolic abscess in 20 patients. Uncomplicated diverticulitis was defined as inflamed diverticulum or phlegmon. Length of hospital stay, antibiotic use, failure of initial therapy and the incidence of recurrence after nonoperative management were assessed.

Results

The mean length of hospital stay and antibiotic use were 6 and 4.7 days respectively. All patients were successfully treated with the initial medical therapy and their hospital stays were uneventful. Of the 276 patients with an uncomplicated diverticulitis, two patients (1%) had a recurrence during follow-up that could be managed nonoperatively. Of the 20 patients with pericolic abscesses, four patients (20%) had a recurrence. One patient underwent laparoscopic ileocolic resection and the other patients were treated nonoperatively.

Conclusion

Nonoperative management may be the treatment of choice for right colonic diverticulitis with inflamed diverticulum or phlegmon. Diverticulitis with pericolic abscess should be treated with additional care.

### Predicting deep neck space abscess using computed tomography [^4f8a3468]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate objective measures that could increase the positive predictive value of computed tomography (CT) in diagnosing deep neck space infections (DNSIs).

Methods

A retrospective analysis of patients surgically treated at a tertiary care hospital for DNSIs for more than 2 years were reviewed. Patients who had had CT with contrast scanning suggestive of deep neck space abscess within 24 hours before surgery were included. The average Hounsfield units for each abscess were calculated. Based on the intraoperative finding of pus, the patients were divided into groups. Student t tests compared the average Hounsfield units, white blood cell count, and maximum temperature between the groups. Outcomes were measured by comparing overall length of hospital stay, length of postoperative stay, and complications.

Results

Of the 32 patients surgically drained, 24 (75%) had discreet collections of pus, whereas 12 (25%) did not. Hounsfield unit measurement was not reliable in distinguishing abscess from phlegmon. None of the other clinical variables studied to distinguish abscess from phlegmon were statistically different either. A statistical difference between the 2 groups was not identified.

Conclusion

Although CT with contrast plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of DNSIs, the decision for surgical drainage of an abscess should be made clinically. A negative exploration rate of nearly 25% despite careful selection criteria should be expected.

### Dysphagia and thickened esophageal wall: the application of ultra-slim gastroscope in the diagnosis and treatment of phlegmonous esophagitis [^1785e69d]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

A 61-year-old woman presented with persistent sore throat for 17 days and progressively worsening dysphagia for 13 days. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed a thickened wall of the entire esophagus and blurring of the peri-esophageal fat space (Fig. 1). Standard gastroscope could not be passed through the esophageal entrance because of significant pharyngeal stenosis and edema, and pus oozing was seen at the entrance of the esophagus (Fig. 2). Pharyngeal infection was considered. After intravenous antibiotics (Fig. 3), infection was controlled but dysphagia remained without any sign of relief. On day 50, an ultra-slim gastroscope revealed three mucosal defects with a diameter of 4–10 mm in the esophagus 18–23 cm from the incisors. The endoscope was entered through the largest mucosal defect into the submucosal layer and white thin pus was found within several submucosal cavities, which formed after self-absorption of pus and indicated phlegmonous esophagitis (Video 1). Enteral nutrition is performed through an endoscopic indwelling gastric tube. On day 55, chest CT showed a significant reduction of esophageal wall thickening (Fig. 4). On day 63, repeat gastroscopy showed two of the three previous mucosal defects healed and one remained there with a size of 5 mm, which was closed by two metal clips. The patient then started eating orally and was discharged on day 70. Phlegmonous esophagitis is rare and there is no standard treatment for phlegmonous esophagitis. Available treatment options include infection control with antibiotics, endoscopic incision, or surgery (Fig. 5). We report the first video of complete access into the abscess cavities of spontaneously ruptured phlegmonous esophagitis, which was achieved with a favorable therapeutic outcome by endoscopic placement of a gastric tube under direct visualization. We believe that gastric tube placement, rather than endoscopic incision or surgery, can result in good outcomes and enable early enteral nutrition in phlegmonous esophagitis with primary spontaneous rupture.

Colonic diverticulosis and diverticulitis

Diverticular disease is characterised by the presence of multiple outpouchings, most commonly located in the sigmoid colon or left colon. It predominantly affects older individuals, with approximately 80% exhibiting the condition by the age of 80. However, diverticular disease is estimated to affect 5–10% of individuals by the age of 45. Symptoms of diverticulitis typically include persistent pain and tenderness in the left iliac fossa.

Diverticulitis is characterised by bowel wall thickening, pericolonic stranding, and the presence of diverticula (Fig. 6). T2-WI is useful in identifying the inflamed intestinal wall and detecting associated intraperitoneal fluid. Intravenous gadolinium-enhanced sequences further aid in identifying inflammation and abscess formation.

Complicated diverticulitis may present with phlegmon, small abscess, perforation, or fistulas, which occur in approximately 14% of cases. The most common type of fistula is the enterovesical fistula, identifiable on MRI by the presence of air within the bladder.

Treatment is guided by disease stage and patient comorbidities, with conservative management for localised disease, percutaneous drainage for large abscesses, and emergency surgery for advanced stages.

The differential diagnosis primarily includes colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

CRC

CRC is the third most prevalent malignancy in women. Risk factors for CRC include familial and personal medical history, lifestyle factors, and genetic predispositions. Early-stage CRC may be asymptomatic, or patients may present nonspecific symptoms such as rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, fatigue and unexplained weight loss. On MRI, CRC commonly manifests as irregular bowel wall thickening with intermediate SI on T2-WI, demonstrating restricted diffusion on high b -value DWI and low values on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. The identification of lymphadenopathy and extramural extension, including invasion of adjacent structures, is critical for staging and treatment planning. Definitive diagnosis requires recto-colonoscopy with histopathological confirmation of malignancy.
