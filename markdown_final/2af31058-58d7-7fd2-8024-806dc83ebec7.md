## Question

anti M on type and screen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anti-M on a type and screen, including what it is, how it behaves serologically, when it is clinically significant, how to manage it in transfusion and pregnancy, and what pitfalls to avoid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immunology and serologic behavior of anti-M. Then, I should verify its clinical significance across settings, especially transfusion and HDFN. Next, I will review management strategies, including when to provide M-negative units and how to handle serologic interference. Finally, I should consider special scenarios like cold autoantibodies, anti-CD38 therapy, and documentation requirements, and close with a concise, actionable summary.

> Let me first confirm the basics: anti-M is an antibody directed against the M antigen in the MNS blood group system, typically IgM and saline-reactive at room temperature, with variable IgG components that may react at 37°C and in the antiglobulin phase, which is why it can occasionally cause problems beyond the bench [^116QZT3a] [^112vix3h].

> Wait, let me verify the serologic behavior because this drives risk. Most anti-M is IgM and inactive at 37°C, making it "cold" and often clinically insignificant for transfusion, but a subset has IgG that reacts at 37°C and in the IAT, which can mediate hemolysis; this mixed IgM/IgG profile is the key pivot for clinical decision-making [^112vix3h].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical significance. I initially thought anti-M was "never significant", but that is too absolute. I should double-check exceptions: IgG anti-M can cause acute and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, and although rare, anti-M has been implicated in HDFN, so I need to keep both transfusion and obstetric contexts in mind before labeling it benign [^112vix3h] [^111Hehy4].

> Next, I should review transfusion management. If anti-M is detected, I need to check for 37°C reactivity and IgG components; if there is 37°C or IAT reactivity, I should transfuse M antigen-negative RBCs to mitigate hemolysis risk, whereas if it is purely cold-reactive IgM, routine crossmatching may suffice, though some centers still prefer M-negative units in surgical or hypothermic settings to be conservative [^116JN9DX] [^112vix3h].

> I will now examine obstetric implications. Anti-M is a rare cause of HDFN, but it does occur; therefore, if a maternal antibody screen reveals anti-M, I should confirm the antibody identity and titer, assess paternal M status, and follow fetal surveillance protocols, recognizing that severe HDFN from anti-M is uncommon but possible and warrants standard prenatal management rather than reassurance alone [^111Hehy4] [^112ZKyj2].

> But wait, what if anti-M is causing ABO/Rh typing discrepancies? Let me consider serologic interference. Anti-M can agglutinate reverse grouping cells that express M, creating reverse typing anomalies; in that case, I should absorb the plasma with M-positive O cells to remove anti-M and then repeat ABO typing to resolve the discrepancy before proceeding to crossmatch [^116JN9DX].

> I need to ensure I address cold autoantibody contexts. Anti-M can behave like a cold agglutinin and may be confused with nonspecific cold antibodies; prewarming techniques and careful temperature-controlled testing help distinguish true anti-M from benign cold autoagglutinins that could otherwise mask or mimic alloantibodies, preventing unnecessary delays or mismatched transfusions [^114dcA1C].

> Next, I should review special drug interferences. Anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies such as daratumumab and isatuximab cause pan-reactive indirect antiglobulin test positivity that can obscure alloantibodies; if a patient on these agents needs transfusion, I should obtain a baseline type and screen before therapy, consider phenotyping or genotyping, and use DTT-treated RBCs or genotyping-based matching to mitigate interference and safely issue units [^111b7GDG] [^114dBMLr] [^112SfXKt].

> Let me think about documentation and communication. I should confirm that the transfusion record clearly notes the presence of anti-M, its thermal amplitude, and whether M-negative RBCs are required; this is especially important if the patient may present elsewhere or if future surgeries are planned, to avoid redundant workups and delays in emergency settings [^116JN9DX].

> To synthesize, I should confirm the following: anti-M is usually a cold-reactive IgM with limited clinical significance, but IgG components that react at 37°C can cause hemolytic transfusion reactions and, rarely, HDFN; therefore, I must characterize thermal reactivity and isotype, transfuse M-negative RBCs when 37°C reactivity or IgG is present, manage pregnancy with standard alloimmunization protocols, and use absorption or genotyping strategies to resolve serologic interference when needed [^116JN9DX] [^112vix3h] [^111Hehy4] [^116QZT3a].

Anti-M is a **cold-reactive IgM antibody** that is usually clinically insignificant but can cause **hemolysis at low temperatures** or in special circumstances (e.g. hypothermia, large-volume transfusion) [^116JN9DX] [^115zZkAy]. Most anti-M is **naturally occurring** and does not react at 37°C, so routine transfusion with standard crossmatch is generally safe [^116JN9DX]. However, if anti-M reacts at 37°C or causes a positive crossmatch, **M-negative RBCs should be selected** to avoid hemolysis [^112vix3h]. Anti-M is rarely implicated in HDFN, but if detected in pregnancy, monitor the fetus for hemolysis and consider M-negative blood if transfusion is needed [^111Hehy4] [^112ZKyj2].

---

## Immunological characteristics of anti-M

- **Isotype**: Predominantly IgM, with occasional IgG components [^116JN9DX].
- **Thermal range**: Typically reacts at room temperature or lower; some variants react at 37°C [^116JN9DX].
- **Natural occurrence**: Commonly found in individuals without prior transfusion or pregnancy, suggesting natural occurrence [^116JN9DX].

---

## Clinical significance in transfusion medicine

### Hemolytic transfusion reactions

- **Acute hemolytic reactions**: Rare, usually mild, and associated with cold-reactive IgM anti-M [^115zZkAy].
- **Delayed hemolytic reactions**: Rare but documented, often due to IgG anti-M or anamnestic responses [^112vix3h].
- **Risk factors**: Hypothermia, large-volume transfusion, or high anti-M titers increase hemolysis risk [^116JN9DX].

---

### Transfusion management

- **Standard crossmatch**: Generally sufficient if anti-M is cold-reactive and does not react at 37°C [^116JN9DX].
- **M-negative RBCs**: Use when anti-M reacts at 37°C or causes a positive crossmatch to prevent hemolysis [^112vix3h].
- **Emergency transfusion**: Non-crossmatched ABO-compatible RBCs may be given if urgently needed, with close monitoring [^111b7GDG].

---

## Clinical significance in pregnancy

- **HDFN risk**: Anti-M is a rare cause of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) [^111Hehy4].
- **Monitoring**: If anti-M is detected, monitor fetal hemolysis with ultrasound and MCA Doppler; consider M-negative blood for intrauterine transfusion if severe [^notfound].
- **Postnatal management**: Newborns may require phototherapy or transfusion if hemolysis is significant [^notfound].

---

## Laboratory detection and differentiation

- **Initial screening**: Antibody screens may detect anti-M as unexpected reactivity, often at room temperature [^116JN9DX].
- **Differentiation**: Use panel cells and temperature-controlled testing to distinguish anti-M from other cold agglutinins (e.g. anti-I, anti-H) [^114dcA1C].
- **Crossmatching**: Perform at 37°C and include an antiglobulin phase to detect clinically significant variants [^116JN9DX].

---

## Summary of clinical implications

| **Clinical scenario** | **Clinical significance** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|
| Routine transfusion | Usually insignificant | Standard crossmatch |
| Anti-M reacts at 37°C | Significant | M-negative RBCs |
| Large-volume transfusion | Potential hemolysis | M-negative RBCs |
| Pregnancy | Rare HDFN | Monitor fetus; M-negative blood if needed |

---

Anti-M is **usually benign** but can cause hemolysis when it reacts at 37°C or in special settings; **individualized transfusion management** — using M-negative RBCs when indicated — and **obstetric monitoring** when detected in pregnancy are essential to safe care [^116JN9DX] [^111Hehy4].

### Anti-M-induced delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction [^112vix3h]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-M is most often assumed to be naturally occurring and can be comprised of a mixture of predominantly immunoglobulin(Ig)M with a lesser IgG component. Anti-M-antibodies usually do not react at 37°C and therefore are considered to be of little clinical significance.

Methods

A 28-year-old man presented with hemorrhagic shock from numerous injuries sustained in a motor vehicle collision. The patient received several units of red blood cells (RBCs). The antibody screen, the direct antiglobulin test (DAT), and the RBC genotype were sent for laboratory evaluation.

Results

A total of 12 days after the first antibody screening result was negative (7 days after transfusion), the lowest hemoglobin value was 5.5 g per dL, and we observed a positive antibody screening result and DAT with immunoglobulin (Ig)G anti-M identified. After transfusion of 4 units of M antigen-negative RBC, the post-transfusion hemoglobin level increased to 8.9 g per dL.

Conclusion

Obtaining M antigen-negative compatible RBCs is necessary in patients demonstrating IgG anti-M in plasma.

### The impact of anti-M antibodies on patient blood typing and transfusion safety: a retrospective study [^116JN9DX]. Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-M antibodies are a group of frequently detected, naturally occurring antibodies, most of which are immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies, inactive at 37 °C, and clinically insignificant in blood transfusion experiments, except for their effect on blood groups. Anti-M antibodies may be clinically significant in some exceptional cases, however, such as cardiac surgery, when the core body temperature drops, resulting in hemolytic transfusion reactions. The present study was conducted to explore the interference caused by the presence of anti-M antibodies on blood group identification, analyze the necessity of detecting such antibodies in advance for transfusion compatibility testing and clinical transfusion, and explore the importance of O-antigen erythrocytes in routine blood typing, especially in screening for IgM-class antibodies.

Methods

This study was initiated by collecting blood typing specimens from January 2021 to December 2023 in the Blood Transfusion Department, where the O cell control tubes showed agglutination in the blood group reverse serotyping, which were ultimately determined to be influenced by the anti-M antibodies. This study further analyzed the absorption of plasma using M antigen-positive type O erythrocytes, followed by repeat ABO typing with either the absorbed plasma or standard reverse grouping erythrocytes without M antigen. Our subsequent steps included a cross-matching test with manual tube testing, the Polybrene method, and antiglobulin test, monitoring of the hemoglobin value after transfusion.

Results

A total of 11 patients had anti-M antibodies detected in their serum. Among these 11 patients, 9 had blood type discrepancies identified during blood typing, and the other 2 cases were identified as type O. We saw 4 cases of IgM-type antibodies, 1 case of IgG-type antibodies, and 7 cases of IgM-type and IgG-type antibodies. The forward and reverse typing of 9 samples showed consistent results after serum reverse typing was rechecked by O cell absorption. Cross-matching was compatible with blood donors without M antigen, and 7 of these patients were treated with transfusion, all of whom had elevated hemoglobin levels after transfusion, with no adverse transfusion reactions.

Discussion

In specimens with irregular anti-M antibodies, serum absorption can be used to eliminate the interference caused by the irregular antibodies and obtain the correct experimental results. Moreover, the addition of type O red blood cells in the experiment can improve the detection rate of partial antibodies. For specific patients, such as individuals undergoing surgery, regardless of whether the antibody reacts at 37 °C, we recommend choosing M antigen-negative donors for blood transfusion to ensure the safety of blood transfusion for patients in clinical settings.

### Differences in performance characteristics among four high-throughput assays for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using a common set of patient samples [^116QXRoa]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

The best use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing remains an open question. Regardless of whether clinical or epidemiologic use is planned, the predictive values are important to consider, particularly in areas with low pretest probability (eg, mass screening). Both the throughput of an assay and in particular its specificity are crucial parameters for clinical laboratory implementation if large-scale serology testing is desirable in a low-prevalence environment.

Approaches for anti–SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays involve differing antigens (eg, nucleocapsid vs spike protein and full-length vs subdomains) and/or immunoglobulin isotypes (eg, immunoglobulin G [IgG], immunoglobulin M [IgM], total). A preferred combination may evolve depending on the desired purpose of testing as our understanding of COVID-19 matures, including breadth and duration of antibody responses, neutralizing effects of antibodies, and antigen choices for vaccines. It is possible that appropriate assays for detection of prior viral infection may be different from those to confirm a vaccine response.

Given the uncertain and shifting landscape for clinical laboratories, we sought to compare a common set of serum samples across four commercial assays as part of our evaluation for potential implementation of high-throughput testing. These findings will help inform the strengths and limitations of each assay in a directly comparable manner.

### Confusing blood group antibodies in obstetrics: focus on the risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn [^111Hehy4]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

During routine prenatal antibody screening, maternal reactivity is sometimes detected for which the clinical significance is unclear. As a result, the strategy for monitoring these antibodies during pregnancy, to mitigate the risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN), may be uncertain. This review focuses on four such immune responses in obstetrics: anti-G, anti-M, warm reactive autoantibodies, and apparent nonspecific immune responses that cannot be further classified. The relationship of these antibodies to HDFN is a primary focus. Related concerns, including maternal and neonatal transfusion considerations and candidacy for Rh immune globulin, are also addressed. · Pregnant patients with anti-G who lack anti-D are candidates for Rh immune globulin. · Anti-M is a rare cause of HDFN. · Warm reactive autoantibodies in pregnancy are unlikely to be clinically significant. · Unless the patient is experiencing active hemolysis. · Nonspecific reactivity is unlikely to be clinically significant in pregnancy.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: multiple myeloma, version 1.2025 [^115BA6xS]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma — laboratory interferences with anti-CD38 antibodies: By binding to CD38 on RBCs, daratumumab and isatuximab-irfc may result in false-positive indirect antiglobulin test (indirect Coombs test), masking detection of antibodies to minor antigens and interfering with serologic testing; therefore, type and screen should be performed before using daratumumab or isatuximab-irfc. Monoclonal antibodies used for myeloma treatment can produce a false-positive serum immunofixation if the M protein is IgG kappa, and in such instances special interference testing or mass spectrometry-based assessment may be used to differentiate between the two.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of increasing significance: time to screen? [^115EY2bV]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incurable plasma-cell malignancy multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for 2% of all cancer diagnoses and cancer deaths in the UKand the USA.MM is consistently preceded by well-defined earlier states termed monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). The recognition that a period of MGUS universally heralds MM, alongside the advent of less toxic MM therapies, have strengthened the argument for earlier intervention. As a result, therapeutic algorithms for MM have transitioned over the last decade to treating earlier stages of disease, in patients with biomarkers of malignancy and no end-organ damage, using standard anti-myeloma therapy. However, the increasing focus on early intervention in MM highlights the need to re-assess methods of early detection, including screening.

Monoclonal gammopathy (MG) describes a clonal B-cell or plasma-cell dyscrasia leading to the production of a monoclonal protein discernible against a background of polyclonal immunoglobulins. Traditionally, MG is considered a benign premalignant condition and therefore research on MG has thus far concentrated on drivers of malignant transformation. However, there is growing evidence that MG can cause organ damage via mechanisms independent of tumor growth. For example, there has been increasing attention on the ability of small but 'dangerous' B-cell clones to cause paraprotein-mediated tissue damage, a phenomenon termed monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS). Furthermore, several large epidemiological studies have reported excess morbidity and mortality associated with a diagnosis of MG, with uncertain biological mechanisms. Thus, accumulating evidence suggests that MG is of increasing significance.

Here, we outline current understanding, describing both the malignant and non-malignant mechanisms by which MG can cause tissue damage. Specifically, we question whether active systematic identification of MG cases through population or targeted screening should be considered in the context of growing evidence of the clinical importance of this condition.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of increasing significance: time to screen? [^112V7Cm4]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Paraprotein-mediated tissue damage

MGCS has become a well-recognized entity that includes a wide range of non-cancerous MG-associated clinical presentations. The mechanisms reported thus far include deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulin or amyloid fibrils (for example, in type I cryoglobulinemia and light chain amyloidosis; AL amyloidosis), autoantibody activity of the immunoglobulin (for example, anti-MAG antibodies in IgM-related neuropathy) and aberrant complement-activation (for example, in C3-glomerulonephritis and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome). The most recognized forms of MGCS are AL amyloidosis, monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS), monoclonal gammopathy of neurological significance (MGNS) and monoclonal gammopathy of cutaneous significance.

The incidence of AL amyloidosis is around 12 cases per million person-years and the prevalence is around 30,000 to 45,000 cases in Europe and the USA. As with many forms of MGCS, AL amyloidosis remains underdiagnosed and earlier detection is key to improving survival. Presenting symptoms are often non-specific; therefore, a high index of clinical suspicion alongside screening tests for organ damage, such as albuminuria and cardiac biomarkers, can be key to an early diagnosis. Despite advances in treatments, the reported mortality rate is 25% within 6 months of diagnosis.

### Detection of anti-IH and transient adult anti-I in infectious mononucleosis potentially masking other red blood cell alloantibodies [^114dcA1C]. Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A 29-year-old man with multiple co-morbidities, including alcoholic cirrhosis, was admitted for severe alcohol-related hepatitis, epistaxis, and fever of unknown cause. With no history of transfusions, the patient's hemoglobin level had dropped from 100 g/L to 81 g/L, with a platelet count of 46 × 109/L. Pretransfusion testing was ordered for potential transfusion.

Methods

Automated group and antibody screen performed on the Quidel Ortho Clinical Diagnostics Vision platform and all complex investigation performed by the conventional manual tube method.

Results

Pretransfusion tests showed that the patient was A RhD positive on forward grouping, while the reverse grouping showed an unexpected agglutination in A1 and A2 cells. Stronger agglutination reactions were noted at room temperature. The routine 3-cell antibody screen was negative but showed panreactivity on the saline room-temperature 11-cell panel and nonreactive at 37°C and on the indirect antiglobulin test (IAT). A stronger reaction was observed when the patient's plasma was tested against cord (i) cells than with adult (I) cells. It was concluded that a compound cold antibody anti-IH was present. A compatible O RhD positive red blood cell (RBC) unit was transfused to the patient which was noted to be M positive in addition to 2 A RhD positive platelet units. In the subsequent episode, viral serology returned a positive high avidity index with Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus mononucleosis assays implying a reinfection or reactivation of both infectious mononucleosis and cytomegalovirus mononucleosis. Therefore, transient anti-i was not ruled out. A new group and screen sample was obtained that demonstrated the same discrepancy in the reverse grouping, but the antibody screen revealed an anti-M alloantibody. An additional 3 crossmatch compatible group O RhD positive, M negative RBC units was transfused, but no clinically significant increment in hemoglobin was observed. A further 3 crossmatch compatible group A RhD positive, M negative RBC units were transfused, finally producing an increment increase in hemoglobin level.

Discussion

This report highlights that benign cold antibodies can often be a nuisance in the investigation of RBC alloantibodies. Prewarming techniques must be used to eliminate these interferences and discrepancies, while titration of these cold agglutinins at different temperatures can help differentiate them.

### Prevalence and clinical significance of anti-SSA antibody in the Chinese health screening population [^112KHm7J]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Detection of autoantibodies has been extensively utilized in diagnosing and assessing the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Autoantibodies typically appear in the body before any clinical or biomedical signs, remaining latent for many years, and provoking a significant autoimmune response before manifesting the disease. For instance, antimitochondrial antibodies can be detected in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) over a decade before the clinical onset. In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the emergence of autoantibodies follows a predictable pattern, with a gradual buid-up of specific autoantibodies preceding the onset of SLE.

Anti-Sjögren's syndrome type A (anti-SSA) antibody, a major component of the antinuclear antibody spectrum (ANAs), is highly valuable in diagnosing CTD, with positivity rates ranging from 20% to 60% in SLE, and up to 60% to 75% in pSS. Moreover, anti-SSA autoantibodies play a direct pathological role in neonatal lupus, being associated with congenital heart block and skin lesions. Besides, anti-SSA antibodies are also present in other conditions such as myositis, dermatomyositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic sclerosis, antisynthetase syndrome, and cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Despite this, there is a shortage of epidemiologic data on the distribution and clinical characteristics of the anti-SSA antibody-positive population. Furthermore, research on the early warning value of anti-SSA in the absence of autoimmune disease symptoms is limited. Arbuckle et al. found that anti-SSA antibodies appeared on average 3–4 years before the diagnosis of SLE. Theander et al. studied 117 patients with pSS who had serum samples available before diagnosis, discovering that the median interval between the initial detection of autoantibodies and the diagnosis of pSS was 4.5 years for anti-SSA.

This study primarily aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anti-SSA antibodies in a health screening population. Secondary aims included comparing clinical and laboratory features in anti-SSA-positive individuals with matched autoantibody-negative controls and evaluating the development of connective tissue diseases (CTD) over the years in individuals with available follow-up data.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^116XHxPK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 antibody types and kinetics — diagnostic considerations note that there are 2 general types of antibodies, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and nonneutralizing (binding) antibodies, and commercially available anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests can measure single immunoglobulin classes (IgM, IgG, or IgA) or total antibody and differentiate nAbs from binding antibodies. IgM antibodies are typically produced first after infection and are used as a measure of recent infection, whereas IgG antibodies generally develop later than IgM antibodies and remain elevated for months to years after infection. Although IgM antibodies can be detected within the first 2 weeks of symptoms in some patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection appears unusual in that IgM and IgG more commonly rise together, more than 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of increasing significance: time to screen? [^1173eMBV]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous manifestations of MG are classified into several subgroups. Group I conditions are pathologically caused by malignant or clonal plasma cells (for example, polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin disease; POEMS), group II conditions are strongly associated with a MG, group III conditions are anecdotally linked to MG and group IV conditions are related to immunoglobulins or M-proteins that may or may not be clonal. Treatments are generally specific to the dermatological condition, aside from group I/II conditions for which clonally directed treatment may be employed.

The true incidence and prevalence of MGCS are unknown due to suboptimal monitoring, lack of established diagnostic criteria and the reliance on multiple specialties to identify MGCS through a high index of suspicion. The main challenge in MGCS is distinguishing symptoms caused directly by the MG clone and its resultant monoclonal protein, and those that are merely coincidental; for example, only half of patients with clinically suspected MGRS have the condition on biopsy. Evidence suggests that treatment of the underlying plasma-cell or B-cell clonal disorder can ameliorate symptoms and prevent irreversible organ damage in MGCS. Further studies, both large-scale epidemiological and biological, are required to fully understand the etiology of MG-related disorders. In order to achieve this, thought needs to be given to how cohorts of MG patients can be established, and we hypothesize that improving detection and monitoring of MG will enhance recognition of MGCS cases to this end.

Other monoclonal gammopathy-related morbidity

Higher mortality rates in MG unrelated to malignant progression have been observed. A UK cohort study of 2,193 newly diagnosed MG patients demonstrated excess morbidity and mortality associated with the diagnosis.MG patients had a 5-year overall survival of 71.9% compared to 80.1% in age-matched controls and were significantly more likely to have a higher comorbidity index score.MG patients also had significantly higher rates of hospital attendance, particularly for renal and rheumatological issues, both prior to and after diagnosis. Several large populationbased studies show similar findings of increased morbidity and mortality associated with MGUS;, for example, in a Swedish population study, MG patients had a survival ratio of 0.70 compared to matched population controls. In keeping with these findings, results from the PROMISE study and Mass General Brigham Biobank, investigating patients at high risk of developing MG, demonstrated an increased all-cause mortality associated with patients who had screen-detected MG.

### Uncommon types of autoantibodies-detection and clinical associations [^11138uKU]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunofluorescence is a basic method for detection of autoantibodies in serum. It is used as screening for people with symptoms suggesting autoimmune process and disease. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) assay detecting antibodies against nuclear proteins used commonly for diagnosis of systemic autoimmune disease, although antibodies against cytoplasmic components and mitotic structures are usable in clinic. The majority of ANA nuclear patterns have been comprehensively studied with increasing data. However, the cytoplasmic and mitotic patterns are underestimated and still require further assessment. In this review the clinical associations and significance of uncommon types of autoantibodies are presented and discussed.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^114cPvDf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — discussion context highlights that early in the pandemic there was intense interest in identifying a correlate of protective immunity, and research showed that prior infection and vaccination reduce risk and that neutralizing antibodies and higher binding antibody concentrations provide greater risk reduction; yet despite these discoveries, and after almost 500 million infections and administration of 13.5 billion vaccine doses, the hope for a single marker of protection remains unrealized, current clinical indications for antibody testing are few, and seroprevalence approaches 100% in most human populations.

### Neonatal and obstetrical outcomes of pregnancies complicated by alloimmunization [^113ZNTrV]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Despite advances in the prevention of rhesus (Rh)(D) alloimmunization, alloantibodies to Rh(D) and non-Rh(D) red blood cell antigens continue to be detected in ∼4% of US pregnancies and can result in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). Recent reports on HDFN lack granularity and are unable to provide antibody-specific outcomes. The objective of this study was to calculate the frequency of alloimmunization in our large hospital system and summarize the outcomes based on antibody specificity, titer, and other clinical factors.

Methods

We identified all births in a 6-year period after a positive red blood cell antibody screen result during pregnancy and summarized their characteristics and outcomes.

Results

A total of 707 neonates were born after a positive maternal antibody screen result (3.0/1000 live births). In 31 (4%), the positive screen result was due to rhesus immune globulin alone. Of the 676 neonates exposed to alloantibodies, the direct antibody test (DAT) result was positive, showing antigen-positivity and evidence of HDFN in 37% of those tested. Neonatal disease was most severe with DAT-positive anti-Rh antibodies (c, C, D, e, E). All neonatal red blood cell transfusions (15) and exchange transfusions (6) were due to anti-Rh alloimmunization. No neonates born to mothers with anti-M, anti-S, anti-Duffy, anti-Kidd A, or anti-Lewis required NICU admission for hyperbilirubinemia or transfusion.

Conclusions

Alloimmunization to Rh-group antibodies continues to cause a majority of the severe HDFN cases in our hospital system. In neonates born to alloimmunized mothers, a positive DAT result revealing antigen-positivity is the best predictor of anemia and hyperbilirubinemia.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^1113jzy1]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Maternal anti-erythrocyte antibody algorithm — screening and bilirubin monitoring proceeds by asking "Maternal antibody screen done?"; if "No", proceed to "Infant DAT and blood type as soon as possible"; if "Yes" and "Maternal antibody screen positive?", obtain "Infant DAT and blood type as soon as possible" and then assess "Infant DAT positive?". If DAT is positive, verify "All true? 1. Infant DAT only positive to anti-Rh(D) 2. Mother received RhIG during pregnancy 3. Mother known not to be anti-Rh(D) positive before RhIG"; if not all are true, the pathway states "The infant has a hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factor" and to "Measure TcB or TSB Immediately, then Every 4 hours 2 times, then Every 12 hours 3 times" and "Follow guidelines, using recommendations 10 and 17, with Figure 3 and Figure 7 for therapy decisions after each TcB or TSB measure"; if the maternal screen is negative or all listed conditions are met, "Return to guidelines".

### Laboratory detection and initial diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies [^114NJBNs]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Good practice statements (GPS) literature review strategy — beginning with "Existing guideline or systematic review (SR) on topic", if a source exists and the "Guideline or SR is less than 4 years old", reviewers "Review and update the guideline or SR literature search", use a "Signals approach: Title-abstract screen by co-chairs", then manage evidence so that "Studies that support the guideline or SR - Exclude" while "Studies that refute the guideline or SR - Include", proceed to "Data Extraction / Evidence Tables", and "Endorse the guideline recommendations". If no existing guideline or SR is available, conduct a "Keyword / Targeted Search", undertake "Full text review by co-chairs", and ask "Is there data or discussion to support draft GPS?"; if supportive, proceed to "Draft GPS" and "Panel consensus".

### Binding and neutralizing anti-AAV antibodies: detection and implications for rAAV-mediated gene therapy [^1174qCRJ]. Molecular Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessment of anti-adeno-associated virus (AAV) antibodies in patients prior to systemic gene therapy administration is an important consideration regarding efficacy and safety of the therapy. Approximately 30%-60% of individuals have pre-existing anti-AAV antibodies. Seroprevalence is impacted by multiple factors, including geography, age, capsid serotype, and assay type. Anti-AAV antibody assays typically measure (1) transduction inhibition by detecting the neutralizing capacity of antibodies and non-antibody neutralizing factors, or (2) total anti-capsid binding antibodies, regardless of neutralizing activity. Presently, there is a paucity of head-to-head data and standardized approaches associating assay results with clinical outcomes. In addition, establishing clinically relevant screening titer cutoffs is complex. Thus, meaningful comparisons across assays are nearly impossible. Although complex, establishing screening assays in routine clinical practice to identify patients with antibody levels that may impact favorable treatment outcomes is achievable for both transduction inhibition and total antibody assays. Formal regulatory approval of such assays as companion diagnostic tests will confirm their suitability for specific recombinant AAV gene therapies. This review covers current approaches to measure anti-AAV antibodies in patient plasma or serum, their potential impact on therapeutic safety and efficacy, and investigative strategies to mitigate the effects of pre-existing anti-AAV antibodies in patients.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^113xg5it]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Kidney transplant recipients with membranous nephropathy — anti-PLA2R screening and recurrence risk: Patients who are known to have developed kidney failure due to MN or who have an unknown etiology should be screened for the presence of anti-PLA2R antibodies before transplant, because the presence of circulating anti-PLA2R antibodies at the time of transplantation will quickly initiate a process of recurrent MN in the allograft; if transplanted with very high anti-PLA2R antibody levels or if significant levels persist or increase after transplantation, recipients will likely develop clinically apparent recurrent MN that may need additional immunosuppressive treatment with anti-CD20 agents; there are no data about whether to postpone transplant until antibody levels can be reduced or what threshold titer is acceptable, so each case should be considered on an individual basis, aligning with Practice Point 3.4.3 on evaluation of a kidney transplant recipient with MN (Figure 36).

### Effectiveness of tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, to inform COVID-19 diagnosis: a rapid systematic review [^112W22CB]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Objectives

We undertook a rapid systematic review with the aim of identifying evidence that could be used to answer the following research questions: (1) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to inform COVID-19 diagnosis? (2) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus to inform COVID-19 diagnosis?

Design and Setting

Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic test accuracy. We systematically searched for all published evidence on the effectiveness of tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, up to 4 May 2020, and assessed relevant studies for risks of bias using the QUADAS-2 framework.

Main Outcome Measures

Measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value) were the main outcomes of interest. We also included studies that reported influence of testing on subsequent patient management, and that reported virus/antibody detection rates where these facilitated comparisons of testing in different settings, different populations or using different sampling methods.

Results

38 studies on SARS-CoV-2 virus testing and 25 studies on SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing were identified. We identified high or unclear risks of bias in the majority of studies, most commonly as a result of unclear methods of patient selection and test conduct, or because of the use of a reference standard that may not definitively diagnose COVID-19. The majority were in hospital settings, in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Pooled analysis of 16 studies (3818 patients) estimated a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% CI 81.5% to 92.2%) for an initial reverse-transcriptase PCR test. For antibody tests, 10 studies reported diagnostic accuracy outcomes: sensitivity ranged from 18.4% to 96.1% and specificity 88.9% to 100%. However, the lack of a true reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis makes it challenging to assess the true diagnostic accuracy of these tests. Eighteen studies reporting different sampling methods suggest that for virus tests, the type of sample obtained/type of tissue sampled could influence test accuracy. Finally, we searched for, but did not identify, any evidence on how any test influences subsequent patient management.

Conclusions

Evidence is rapidly emerging on the effectiveness of tests for COVID-19 diagnosis and management, but important uncertainties about their effectiveness and most appropriate application remain. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy should be interpreted bearing in mind the absence of a definitive reference standard to diagnose or rule out COVID-19 infection. More evidence is needed about the effectiveness of testing outside of hospital settings and in mild or asymptomatic cases. Implementation of public health strategies centred on COVID-19 testing provides opportunities to explore these important areas of research.

### Inclisiran (Leqvio) [^115NnFh2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.6 Immunogenicity

The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of inclisiran.

The immunogenicity of LEQVIO has been evaluated using screening and confirmatory immunoassays for the detection of binding anti-inclisiran antibodies.

Samples from 1,830 patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trials were tested for anti-drug antibodies [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Confirmed positivity was detected in 33 (2%) patients prior to receiving LEQVIO and in 90 (5%) patients during the 18 months of treatment with LEQVIO. Approximately 31 (2%) LEQVIO-treated patients with a negative sample at baseline had a persistent anti-inclisiran antibody response, defined as two confirmed positive samples separated by at least 16 weeks or a single confirmed positive final sample. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-inclisiran antibodies on pharmacodynamics, safety, or effectiveness of LEQVIO over the treatment duration of 18 months. However, the long-term consequences of continuing LEQVIO treatment in the presence of anti-inclisiran binding antibodies are unknown.

### Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction caused by anti-M antibodies: a case report and literature review [^115zZkAy]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

We report a rare case of acute hemolytic reactions caused by immunoglobulin (Ig)M anti-M antibody and present a literature review.

Case Report

A 61-year-old male patient who underwent blood transfusion developed fever, chills, soy sauce-colored urine, and changes in laboratory test results, including persistently decreased hemoglobin levels, neutrophilia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, acute kidney injury, mild acute liver injury, and activation of the coagulation system, indicating acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR). Antibody screening and major crossmatching results indicated weak positive at 37°C for both posttransfusion and pretransfusion sample. Subsequent serological examinations indicated the presence of IgM anti-M antibodies in plasma but the direct antiglobulin and elution tests were negative. Antibody hemolytic activity assay confirmed AHTR caused by anti-M. The transfused red blood cells were MM and the patient is NN. These signs and symptoms disappeared rapidly and required no additional interventions before discharge.

Conclusion

The accurate diagnosis of anti-M antibody-mediated acute hemolysis is essential for guiding treatment decisions.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116QAarU]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus infection — diagnosis and screening in adults and adolescents with HIV: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends testing all people over the age of 18, including those with HIV, for chronic HBV infection. Initial testing should include a triple screening panel for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc total), and anti-HBs. In acute infection, HBsAg can be detected 4 weeks (range 1–9 weeks) after exposure, and anti-HBc immunoglobulin M (IgM) is usually detectable at the onset of symptoms. See CDC's Clinical Testing and Diagnosis for Hepatitis B for information on how to interpret laboratory results.

Anti-CD38 interference — impact and pre-transfusion planning states that anti-CD38 interference can delay issuing red blood cells (RBCs) and may mask clinically significant alloantibodies; to avoid problems, hospitals "should set up procedures to inform the transfusion service" before therapy, and before a patient begins taking anti-CD38, "A baseline type and screen should be performed", a "baseline phenotype or genotype may be considered", and "Genotyping can be performed after the patient receives anti-CD38", with some studies suggesting "a more targeted approach for extended antigen phenotyping/genotyping".

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^111FKQWh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 antigens targeted by serology describes that coronavirus genomes encode four major structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N); both the S and N proteins are immunogenic in humans and current serologic tests target antibodies against these antigens. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein has been a focus for vaccine development and targeted antibody therapies because neutralizing antibodies against this region effectively block viral entry, and the N protein is an RNA-binding protein that is abundantly expressed during infection and plays a role in RNA transcription and replication.

### Clinical significance of anti-Ro52 (TRIM21) antibodies non-associated with anti-SSA 60kDa antibodies: results of a multicentric study [^116n4hsY]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Ro52 antigen has recently been identified as TRIM21 protein, but the clinical significance of anti-Ro52/TRIM21 antibodies remains controversial. The aim of this multicentric study was to investigate the significance of anti-Ro52 antibodies without anti-SSA/Ro60 antibodies in various connective diseases. Sera were selected by each laboratory using its own method (ELISA, immunodot or Luminex technology), and then performed with ANA Screen BioPlex™ reagent (BIO-RAD). Among the 247 screened sera, 155/247 (63%) were confirmed as anti-Ro52 positive and anti-SSA/Ro60 negative. These sera were analyzed for the detection of other antibodies in relation with clinical settings. Isolated anti-Ro52 antibodies were detected in 89/155 (57%) sera. For the remaining sera (66/155), the main antibodies associations were Sm/SmRNP or Chromatin (n = 38; 57%), Jo1 (n = 17; 26%) and CenpB (n = 9; 14%). Clinical data from the 155 patients showed high prevalence in autoimmune diseases (73%) including myositis or dermatomyositis (n = 30), lupus (n = 23); Sjögren and/or sicca syndrome (n = 27); CREST or Systemic sclerosis (n = 11) and autoimmune hepatitis (n = 11). We found that pulmonary manifestations were often associated with the presence of anti-Ro52 antibodies (n = 34, 22%), in addition with anti-tRNA synthetases, anti-SRP or anti-Ku antibodies (18/34) or isolated in half of cases (16/34). Separate detection of anti-Ro52 antibodies might be useful in related antisynthetase syndrome diagnosis. The presence of anti-Ro52 antibodies should probably precede development of autoimmune disease and must induce sequential follow-up of positive patients, particularly in interstitial lung disease progression.

### Daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj (human recombinant) (Darzalex faspro) [^113rZ5ro]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on the mechanism of action, DARZALEX FASPRO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. DARZALEX FASPRO may cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX FASPRO and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

The combination of DARZALEX FASPRO with lenalidomide, thalidomide or pomalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women, because lenalidomide, thalidomide or pomalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the lenalidomide, thalidomide or pomalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy.

5.6 Interference with Serological Testing

Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect antiglobulin test may persist for up to 6 months after the last daratumumab administration. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient's serum [see References (15)]. The determination of a patient's ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX FASPRO. Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX FASPRO [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.7 Interference with Determination of Complete Response

Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some DARZALEX FASPRO-treated patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.

### An update on autoantibodies in the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^116HZv8m]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) have become pivotal biomarkers for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and have revolutionized understanding of the heterogeneous disease spectrum that affects both adults and children. The discovery and characterization of MSAs have substantially enhanced patient stratification based on clinical phenotype, thereby facilitating more precise diagnosis and ultimately improving management strategies. Advances in immunoassay technologies in the past 20 years have further propelled the field forward, enabling the detection of a growing repertoire of autoantibodies with high specificity and sensitivity; however, evolving research over the past decade has revealed that even within antibody-defined subsets, considerable clinical diversity exists, suggesting a broader spectrum of disease manifestations than previously acknowledged. Challenges persist, particularly among patients who are seronegative, where the failure to identify certain rare MSAs stems from the use of diverse detection methodologies and inadequate consensus-guided standardization and validation protocols. Bridging these diagnostic gaps is crucial for optimizing patient care and refining prognostic stratification in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.

### Antibody tests for identification of current and past infection with SARS-CoV-2 [^114DFC1d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and resulting COVID-19 pandemic present important diagnostic challenges. Several diagnostic strategies are available to identify current infection, rule out infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response. Serology tests to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 aim to identify previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and may help to confirm the presence of current infection.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of antibody tests to determine if a person presenting in the community or in primary or secondary care has SARS-CoV-2 infection, or has previously had SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the accuracy of antibody tests for use in seroprevalence surveys.

Search Methods

We undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. We conducted searches for this review iteration up to 27 April 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated antibody tests (including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, and lateral flow assays) in people suspected of current or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection. We also included studies of people either known to have, or not to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. We included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests (RT-PCR) and clinical diagnostic criteria).

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed possible bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. We extracted 2x2 contingency table data and present sensitivity and specificity for each antibody (or combination of antibodies) using paired forest plots. We pooled data using random-effects logistic regression where appropriate, stratifying by time since post-symptom onset. We tabulated available data by test manufacturer. We have presented uncertainty in estimates of sensitivity and specificity using 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We included 57 publications reporting on a total of 54 study cohorts with 15,976 samples, of which 8526 were from cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies were conducted in Asia (n = 38), Europe (n = 15), and the USA and China (n = 1). We identified data from 25 commercial tests and numerous in-house assays, a small fraction of the 279 antibody assays listed by the Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics. More than half (n = 28) of the studies included were only available as preprints. We had concerns about risk of bias and applicability. Common issues were use of multi-group designs (n = 29), inclusion of only COVID-19 cases (n = 19), lack of blinding of the index test (n = 49) and reference standard (n = 29), differential verification (n = 22), and the lack of clarity about participant numbers, characteristics and study exclusions (n = 47). Most studies (n = 44) only included people hospitalised due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. There were no studies exclusively in asymptomatic participants. Two-thirds of the studies (n = 33) defined COVID-19 cases based on RT-PCR results alone, ignoring the potential for false-negative RT-PCR results. We observed evidence of selective publication of study findings through omission of the identity of tests (n = 5). We observed substantial heterogeneity in sensitivities of IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies, or combinations thereof, for results aggregated across different time periods post-symptom onset (range 0% to 100% for all target antibodies). We thus based the main results of the review on the 38 studies that stratified results by time since symptom onset. The numbers of individuals contributing data within each study each week are small and are usually not based on tracking the same groups of patients over time. Pooled results for IgG, IgM, IgA, total antibodies and IgG/IgM all showed low sensitivity during the first week since onset of symptoms (all less than 30.1%), rising in the second week and reaching their highest values in the third week. The combination of IgG/IgM had a sensitivity of 30.1% (95% CI 21.4 to 40.7) for 1 to 7 days, 72.2% (95% CI 63.5 to 79.5) for 8 to 14 days, 91.4% (95% CI 87.0 to 94.4) for 15 to 21 days. Estimates of accuracy beyond three weeks are based on smaller sample sizes and fewer studies. For 21 to 35 days, pooled sensitivities for IgG/IgM were 96.0% (95% CI 90.6 to 98.3). There are insufficient studies to estimate sensitivity of tests beyond 35 days post-symptom onset. Summary specificities (provided in 35 studies) exceeded 98% for all target antibodies with confidence intervals no more than 2 percentage points wide. False-positive results were more common where COVID-19 had been suspected and ruled out, but numbers were small and the difference was within the range expected by chance. Assuming a prevalence of 50%, a value considered possible in healthcare workers who have suffered respiratory symptoms, we would anticipate that 43 (28 to 65) would be missed and 7 (3 to 14) would be falsely positive in 1000 people undergoing IgG/IgM testing at days 15 to 21 post-symptom onset. At a prevalence of 20%, a likely value in surveys in high-risk settings, 17 (11 to 26) would be missed per 1000 people tested and 10 (5 to 22) would be falsely positive. At a lower prevalence of 5%, a likely value in national surveys, 4 (3 to 7) would be missed per 1000 tested, and 12 (6 to 27) would be falsely positive. Analyses showed small differences in sensitivity between assay type, but methodological concerns and sparse data prevent comparisons between test brands.

Authors' Conclusions

The sensitivity of antibody tests is too low in the first week since symptom onset to have a primary role for the diagnosis of COVID-19, but they may still have a role complementing other testing in individuals presenting later, when RT-PCR tests are negative, or are not done. Antibody tests are likely to have a useful role for detecting previous SARS-CoV-2 infection if used 15 or more days after the onset of symptoms. However, the duration of antibody rises is currently unknown, and we found very little data beyond 35 days post-symptom onset. We are therefore uncertain about the utility of these tests for seroprevalence surveys for public health management purposes. Concerns about high risk of bias and applicability make it likely that the accuracy of tests when used in clinical care will be lower than reported in the included studies. Sensitivity has mainly been evaluated in hospitalised patients, so it is unclear whether the tests are able to detect lower antibody levels likely seen with milder and asymptomatic COVID-19 disease. The design, execution and reporting of studies of the accuracy of COVID-19 tests requires considerable improvement. Studies must report data on sensitivity disaggregated by time since onset of symptoms. COVID-19-positive cases who are RT-PCR-negative should be included as well as those confirmed RT-PCR, in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) and China National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (CDC) case definitions. We were only able to obtain data from a small proportion of available tests, and action is needed to ensure that all results of test evaluations are available in the public domain to prevent selective reporting. This is a fast-moving field and we plan ongoing updates of this living systematic review.

### Clinical utility of anti-signal recognition particle antibody in the differential diagnosis of myopathies [^114ZexNj]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Auto-antibodies to signal recognition particle (SRP) are known to be specific to PM among rheumatic disorders, but the specificity in myopathic diseases remains unclear. The clinical utility of anti-SRP antibody in the differential diagnosis of myopathies has not been studied. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether detection of anti-SRP antibody can discriminate of PM from muscular dystrophy (MD).

Methods

We report a patient with a childhood onset myopathy, in whom it was clinically difficult to make a differential diagnosis of PM or MD for 21 yrs, despite repeated muscle biopsies. Myositis-specific auto-antibodies to RNA-associated antigens were screened in this particular case as well as in 105 serum samples from various types of MD and 84 from PM patients using RNA immunoprecipitation. The MD and PM serum samples were obtained from different institutions. The presence of anti-SRP antibody was confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation combined with immunodepletion of SRP from the antigen.

Results

Anti-SRP antibody was positive in the present patient, supporting the diagnosis of PM. Anti-SRP antibody was detected in seven (8.3%) patients with PM, but in none of the patients with MD. Myositis-specific auto-antibodies were not detected in any of the patients with MD.

Conclusion

Anti-SRP antibody is useful for discriminating PM from MD among patients with myopathies.

### An Italian multicenter study on anti-NXP2 antibodies: clinical and serological associations [^114t5jFu]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Anti-NXP2 antibodies, also known as anti-MJ, were first described as a marker of juvenile DM, and later also found in adult onset DM. A peculiar clinical spectrum, associated with anti-NXP2 antibodies, characterized by DM rash, in particular Gottron's papules, heliotropic rash, peripheral oedema and periungual telangiectasias, dysphagia and calcinosis has been described.

These clinical associations are (mostly) based on the detection of anti-NXP2 by IP. However, the availability of IP assay is confined to few research centres, whereas, nowadays, laboratories are widely using commercially available immunoassays, such as LB, for the detection for MSA or MAA.

This large Italian multicentre study analysed the clinical spectrum associated with anti-NXP2 antibodies detected by LB, confirming previously described associations, namely skin rash, facial rash, heliotropic rash, periorbital oedema and calcinosis. In contrast, symptoms associated with overlap myositis or ASS were not found to be associated with NXP2 antibodies, including ILD, thus confirming previous data.

When detected only by LB, we found anti-NXP2 antibodies significantly associated with IBM: this unusual observation was not reported in other case series, reviewed in a recent meta-analysis, and was not confirmed when anti-NXP2 antibodies were searched by IP. In fact, double-positive NXP2 patients were mostly affected by DM. IBM is a different type of IIM, with peculiar clinical and histological features, recently characterized by a new autoantibody specificity, known as anti-cN1A.

Anti-NXP2 antibodies were confirmed by IP in 31 on 52 available sera (60%). When the 31 double-positive patients were compared with IIM NXP2− patients, the previously described clinical associations were confirmed with higher significance, and dysphagia and myositis were also added as associated with anti-NXP2 antibodies. Most of the papers reported a strict correlation between anti-NXP2 antibodies and dysphagia, whilst the occurrence of myositis in anti-NXP2-positive patients is less evident in different cohorts. Nevertheless, a severe muscle weakness with myalgia, with higher levels of CK or necrotizing histological features have been described in some NXP2+ case series.

Multivariate analysis, performed on 31 double-positive sera, confirmed the association between NXP2 and DM, and a negative association with ILD was also assessed.

### Isatuximab (Sarclisa) [^114dBMLr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Laboratory Test Interference

Interference with Serological Testing (Indirect Antiglobulin Test)

SARCLISA binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and may result in a false positive indirect antiglobulin test (indirect Coombs test). This interference with the indirect Coombs test may persist for approximately 6 months after the last infusion of SARCLISA. The indirect antiglobulin test was positive during Isa-Pd treatment in 68% of the tested patients, and during Isa-Kd treatment in 63% of patients. In patients with a positive indirect antiglobulin test, blood transfusions were administered without evidence of hemolysis. ABO/RhD typing was not affected by SARCLISA treatment.

Before the first SARCLISA infusion, conduct blood type and screen tests on SARCLISA-treated patients. Consider phenotyping prior to starting SARCLISA treatment. If treatment with SARCLISA has already started, inform the blood bank that the patient is receiving SARCLISA and SARCLISA interference with blood compatibility testing can be resolved using dithiothreitol-treated RBCs. If an emergency transfusion is required, non–cross-matched ABO/RhD-compatible RBCs can be given as per local blood bank practices [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Interference with Serum Protein Electrophoresis and Immunofixation Tests

SARCLISA is an IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be incidentally detected on both serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein. This interference can impact the accuracy of the determination of complete response in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.6	Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on the mechanism of action, SARCLISA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. SARCLISA may cause fetal immune cell depletion and decreased bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with SARCLISA and for 5 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. The combination of SARCLISA with pomalidomide or lenalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women because pomalidomide or lenalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the pomalidomide or lenalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy.

### Isatuximab (Sarclisa) [^113A281N]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1	Laboratory Test Interference

Interference with Serological Testing

SARCLISA, an anti-CD38 antibody, may interfere with blood bank serologic tests with false positive reactions in indirect antiglobulin tests (indirect Coombs tests), antibody detection (screening) tests, antibody identification panels, and antihuman globulin crossmatches in patients treated with SARCLISA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Interference with Serum Protein Electrophoresis and Immunofixation Tests

SARCLISA may be incidentally detected by serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation assays used for the monitoring of M-protein and may interfere with accurate response classification based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. In patients with persistent very good partial response, where interference is suspected, consider using an FDA-cleared isatuximab-irfc-specific IFE assay to distinguish isatuximab from any remaining endogenous M protein in the patient's serum to facilitate determination of a complete response.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^112LXTnw]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia guideline — KAS 1 directs that if the maternal antibody screen is positive or unknown because the mother did not have prenatal antibody screening, the infant should have a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and the infant's blood type should be determined as soon as possible using either cord or peripheral blood, with Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade B and a Recommendation. The guideline notes that early DAT testing identifies newborn infants at risk for immune-mediated hemolytic disease and early hyperbilirubinemia born to mothers who carry anti-erythrocyte antibodies, acknowledges a small risk from an extra blood draw and false-negative or false-positive DAT results, and states that the benefit of early DAT testing likely exceeds these harms in infants born to mothers with positive or unknown antibody screen results.

ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo INTENDED USE The ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for the simultaneous qualitative detection of human immunodeficiency virus p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV type 1 and/or type 2 in. infection in pediatric subjects and in pregnant women. An ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo reactive result does not distinguish between the detection of HIV-1 p24 antigen, HIV-1 antibody, or HIV-2 antibody. The ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo assay is not intended for use in screening blood or. Antibodies against HIV are nearly always detected in AIDS patients and HIV-infected asymptomatic individuals. 5, 6 Phylogenetic analysis classifies HIV type 1 into groups M, N, O, and P. 7–10 HIV-1 group M is composed of genetic subtypes and. may be detected in HIV-1-infected individuals.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^111o97UM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has evolved during the pandemic as seroprevalence in global populations has increased. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serology literature and construct updated best practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing. This guideline is an update to the fourth in a series of rapid, frequently updated COVID-19 guidelines developed by IDSA.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations and identify unmet research needs pertaining to the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests for diagnosis, decisions related to vaccination and administration of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma in immunocompromised patients, and identification of a serologic correlate of immunity.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists and experts in systematic literature reviewed, identified, and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations.

Results

The panel recommends against serologic testing to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first two weeks after symptom onset (strong recommendations, low certainty of evidence). Serologic testing should not be used to provide evidence of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients with a high clinical suspicion and repeatedly negative nucleic acid amplification test results (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Serologic testing may assist with the diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). To seek evidence for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the panel suggests testing for IgG, IgG/IgM, or total antibodies to nucleocapsid protein three to five weeks after symptom onset (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). In individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination, we suggest against routine serologic testing given no demonstrated benefit to improving patient outcomes (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence.) The panel acknowledges further that a negative spike antibody test may be a useful metric to identify immunocompromised patients who are candidates for immune therapy.

Conclusions

The high seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 worldwide limits the utility of detecting anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody. The certainty of available evidence supporting the use of serology for diagnosis was graded as very low to low. Future studies should use serologic assays calibrated to a common reference standard.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^117EnCSv]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Maternal anti-erythrocyte antibodies — neonatal testing and DAT interpretation are specified as follows: "If the maternal antibody screen is positive or unknown because the mother did not have prenatal antibody screening, the infant should have a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and the infant's blood type should be determined as soon as possible using either cord or peripheral blood. (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade B, Recommendation)". "The DAT helps to identify infants at risk for hyperbilirubinemia attributable to hemolysis. DAT-negative infants may be managed with usual care". For Rh immune globulin (RhIG) contexts, "Mothers who received RhIG can have a positive antibody screen for anti-Rh(D), and RhIG can cause a positive DAT (anti-Rh[D]) in the infant but generally no hemolysis". When "an infant's DAT is known to be positive only to anti-Rh(D) because the mother received RhIG during pregnancy and the mother was known not to have Rh(D) antibodies before receiving RhIG, the infant can be treated as if the infant is DAT negative", but "any infant with a positive DAT attributable to an antibody other than anti-Rh(D) following maternal receipt of RhIG should be considered to be DAT positive". Additional testing guidance states: "If the maternal blood type is Rh(D)−, the Rh type of the infant should be determined to assess the need for administration of RhIG to the mother". When "the maternal blood is O+ and the maternal antibody screen is negative, it is an option to test the cord blood for the infant's blood type and/or DAT". Moreover, "Determining the infant's blood type or DAT is not necessary if bilirubin surveillance and risk assessment follows this clinical practice guideline and appropriate follow-up after discharge is arranged. Otherwise, this testing should be done".

### Clinical phenotype associations with various types of anti-dsDNA antibodies in patients with recent onset of rheumatic symptoms. results from a multicentre observational study [^11625Rgb]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

When analysing the ANA-positive subset of the patients, the CLIFT association with clinical phenotypes consisting of proteinuria, haematuria, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, cutaneous vasculitis and alopecia persisted. On the other hand, pleuritis and proteinuria defined the clinical phenotypes associated with any of the anti-dsDNA tests in ANA-negative patients. These observations suggest that the presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies in ANA-negative patients may be of less clinical significance, supporting the view that testing for antibodies to dsDNA is not indicated in ANA-negative sera. Detection in ANA-negative patients of anti-dsDNA antibodies with low avidity may, in a worst case scenario, lead to incorrect diagnosis and classification.

The purpose of this study was to reach more insight into the linkage between anti-dsDNA antibody detection and clinical and laboratory manifestations without the restriction posed by existing SLE classification criteria. Our findings provide clinical support for a diagnostic role of CLIFT-determined anti-dsDNA antibodies, however, only in a limited number of key SLE manifestations, proteinuria in particular. These findings challenge the broad role of ELISA-based anti-dsDNA antibody testing in diagnosis and classification of SLE as presently defined.

### Heterogenous humoral and cellular immune responses with distinct trajectories post-SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population-based cohort [^111nEtYK]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To better understand the development of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity over time, a detailed evaluation of humoral and cellular responses is required. Here, we characterize anti-Spike (S) IgA and IgG in a representative population-based cohort of 431 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals up to 217 days after diagnosis, demonstrating that 85% develop and maintain anti-S responses. In a subsample of 64 participants, we further assess anti-Nucleocapsid (N) IgG, neutralizing antibody activity, and T cell responses to Membrane (M), N, and S proteins. In contrast to S-specific antibody responses, anti-N IgG levels decline substantially over time and neutralizing activity toward Delta and Omicron variants is low to non-existent within just weeks of Wildtype SARS-CoV-2 infection. Virus-specific T cells are detectable in most participants, albeit more variable than antibody responses. Cluster analyses of the co-evolution of antibody and T cell responses within individuals identify five distinct trajectories characterized by specific immune patterns and clinical factors. These findings demonstrate the relevant heterogeneity in humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 while also identifying consistent patterns where antibody and T cell responses may work in a compensatory manner to provide protection.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^115tnwmD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — assay selection, timing, and indications are summarized as follows: Wherever possible, serologic assays with established high sensitivity and specificity (eg, ≥ 99.5%) should be employed. IgG, IgG/IgM, and total antibody tests appear to have better sensitivity and specificity than other immunoglobulin classes and perform best when used between 3 to 5 weeks after symptom onset; testing should not be done during the first 2 weeks of symptoms because antibody production is often not detectable until week 3 or later, and few data are available after 8 weeks of symptoms. IgG, IgG/IgM, or total antibody assays are suggested over an IgM assay. The clinical indications for antibody testing to support a diagnosis of COVID-19 are limited, and the panel identified only 1 clinical situation in which antibody testing is recommended: to assist with the diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). A negative spike antibody test may be a useful metric to identify immunocompromised patients who are candidates for immune therapy or to prioritize administration of monoclonal therapies when supplies are limited. The current high seroprevalence of anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies reduces the value of antibody testing for epidemiologic purposes, and although higher antibody titers and presence of neutralizing antibodies correlate with reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a correlate of immune protection from infection has not been defined.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^1159UGHL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA serologic testing — limited potential uses and test types: The panel identified very few clinical scenarios in which serologic testing may be useful, including assisting in the diagnosis of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C) and using a negative spike antibody test to identify immunocompromised patients who are candidates for immune therapy or to prioritize monoclonal therapies when supplies are limited. When antibody testing is done, the panel makes a weak recommendation for using SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgG/IgM, or total antibodies and against using IgM; IgA tests were not considered because of past poor performance and rare testing in clinical laboratories.

### The management of antibodies in heart transplantation: an ISHLT consensus document [^115B2saD]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2018). Medium credibility.

HLA antibody detection — assay types and comparative characteristics are outlined for pre- and post-transplant use. Several methods can be used pre-transplant to assess sensitization and risk of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), post-transplant for monitoring donor-specific antibodies (DSA), and for monitoring the efficacy of desensitization therapy. The complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay is the oldest, most variable, least sensitive, least specific, but most clinically relevant method; recipient serum is mixed with donor T- and B-lymphocytes and complement, a cytotoxic reaction suggests the presence of complement-fixing DSA, and sensitivity is enhanced by the addition of anti-human globulin (AHG). Bead-based platforms report mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), and MFI does not represent antibody titer but reflects antibody–antigen binding strength or bead saturation; diluting sera can eliminate effects of IgM or complement 1 (C1) that interfere with binding. Flow panel reactive antibody (PRA) testing uses bead panels representing Class I (A, B, C) or Class II (DR, DP, DQ) HLA, is often used for initial screening with a qualitative positive or negative result on an incomplete panel, is more sensitive than CDC but lacks allele specificity other than class, underestimates PRA, requires expert interpretation, and it is possible to miss antibodies. Luminex (LMX) PRA uses panels with a full cell's equivalent of Class I or II HLA, is more sensitive than CDC but less sensitive than single antigen beads (SAB), is non-specific, underestimates PRA, requires expert analysis, and broadly reactive sera can be difficult if not impossible to analyze, though it leaves antigens in their theoretically native configuration. LMX SAB IgG uses beads coated with a unique HLA antigen/allele on each bead, detects bound antibody with an anti-IgG antibody, and SAB are the most sensitive, specific, and unambiguous of the bead assays.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^111LaH5n]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma — hospitalized patients: The guideline panel suggests against COVID-19 convalescent plasma for persons hospitalized with COVID-19. The text notes that, based on limited studies and mechanistic reasoning, COVID-19 convalescent plasma may be more effective if given at high titers early in the course of hospitalization, in patients with undetectable or low levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, or in those with a humoral immune deficiency, but current randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not reported outcomes in such pre-specified subpopulations. It further indicates that additional clinical trials may be needed to determine whether there is a benefit and at what dose, and that future studies in hospitalized patients should focus on humoral immunodeficiencies early in the course of COVID-19 and should also consider screening for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies at RCT entry with outcomes assessed by antibody levels.

### Antibody tests for identification of current and past infection with SARS-CoV-2 [^1156Mb4Q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnostic challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in rapid development of diagnostic test methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serology tests to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 enable detection of past infection and may detect cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection that were missed by earlier diagnostic tests. Understanding the diagnostic accuracy of serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection may enable development of effective diagnostic and management pathways, inform public health management decisions and understanding of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology.

Objectives

To assess the accuracy of antibody tests, firstly, to determine if a person presenting in the community, or in primary or secondary care has current SARS-CoV-2 infection according to time after onset of infection and, secondly, to determine if a person has previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Sources of heterogeneity investigated included: timing of test, test method, SARS-CoV-2 antigen used, test brand, and reference standard for non-SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Search Methods

The COVID-19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern (which includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) was searched on 30 September 2020. We included additional publications from the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre (EPPI-Centre) 'COVID-19: Living map of the evidence' and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health 'NIPH systematic and living map on COVID-19 evidence'. We did not apply language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated commercially produced serology tests, targeting IgG, IgM, IgA alone, or in combination. Studies must have provided data for sensitivity, that could be allocated to a predefined time period after onset of symptoms, or after a positive RT-PCR test. Small studies with fewer than 25 SARS-CoV-2 infection cases were excluded. We included any reference standard to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests (RT-PCR), clinical diagnostic criteria, and pre-pandemic samples).

Data Collection and Analysis

We use standard screening procedures with three reviewers. Quality assessment (using the QUADAS-2 tool) and numeric study results were extracted independently by two people. Other study characteristics were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. We present sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each test and, for meta-analysis, we fitted univariate random-effects logistic regression models for sensitivity by eligible time period and for specificity by reference standard group. Heterogeneity was investigated by including indicator variables in the random-effects logistic regression models. We tabulated results by test manufacturer and summarised results for tests that were evaluated in 200 or more samples and that met a modification of UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) target performance criteria.

Main Results

We included 178 separate studies (described in 177 study reports, with 45 as pre-prints) providing 527 test evaluations. The studies included 64,688 samples including 25,724 from people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2; most compared the accuracy of two or more assays (102/178, 57%). Participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were most commonly hospital inpatients (78/178, 44%), and pre-pandemic samples were used by 45% (81/178) to estimate specificity. Over two-thirds of studies recruited participants based on known SARS-CoV-2 infection status (123/178, 69%). All studies were conducted prior to the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and present data for naturally acquired antibody responses. Seventy-nine percent (141/178) of studies reported sensitivity by week after symptom onset and 66% (117/178) for convalescent phase infection. Studies evaluated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (165/527; 31%), chemiluminescent assays (CLIA) (167/527; 32%) or lateral flow assays (LFA) (188/527; 36%). Risk of bias was high because of participant selection (172, 97%); application and interpretation of the index test (35, 20%); weaknesses in the reference standard (38, 21%); and issues related to participant flow and timing (148, 82%). We judged that there were high concerns about the applicability of the evidence related to participants in 170 (96%) studies, and about the applicability of the reference standard in 162 (91%) studies. Average sensitivities for current SARS-CoV-2 infection increased by week after onset for all target antibodies. Average sensitivity for the combination of either IgG or IgM was 41.1% in week one (95% CI 38.1 to 44.2; 103 evaluations; 3881 samples, 1593 cases), 74.9% in week two (95% CI 72.4 to 77.3; 96 evaluations, 3948 samples, 2904 cases) and 88.0% by week three after onset of symptoms (95% CI 86.3 to 89.5; 103 evaluations, 2929 samples, 2571 cases). Average sensitivity during the convalescent phase of infection (up to a maximum of 100 days since onset of symptoms, where reported) was 89.8% for IgG (95% CI 88.5 to 90.9; 253 evaluations, 16,846 samples, 14,183 cases), 92.9% for IgG or IgM combined (95% CI 91.0 to 94.4; 108 evaluations, 3571 samples, 3206 cases) and 94.3% for total antibodies (95% CI 92.8 to 95.5; 58 evaluations, 7063 samples, 6652 cases). Average sensitivities for IgM alone followed a similar pattern but were of a lower test accuracy in every time slot. Average specificities were consistently high and precise, particularly for pre-pandemic samples which provide the least biased estimates of specificity (ranging from 98.6% for IgM to 99.8% for total antibodies). Subgroup analyses suggested small differences in sensitivity and specificity by test technology however heterogeneity in study results, timing of sample collection, and smaller sample numbers in some groups made comparisons difficult. For IgG, CLIAs were the most sensitive (convalescent-phase infection) and specific (pre-pandemic samples) compared to both ELISAs and LFAs (P < 0.001 for differences across test methods). The antigen(s) used (whether from the Spike-protein or nucleocapsid) appeared to have some effect on average sensitivity in the first weeks after onset but there was no clear evidence of an effect during convalescent-phase infection. Investigations of test performance by brand showed considerable variation in sensitivity between tests, and in results between studies evaluating the same test. For tests that were evaluated in 200 or more samples, the lower bound of the 95% CI for sensitivity was 90% or more for only a small number of tests (IgG, n = 5; IgG or IgM, n = 1; total antibodies, n = 4). More test brands met the MHRA minimum criteria for specificity of 98% or above (IgG, n = 16; IgG or IgM, n = 5; total antibodies, n = 7). Seven assays met the specified criteria for both sensitivity and specificity. In a low-prevalence (2%) setting, where antibody testing is used to diagnose COVID-19 in people with symptoms but who have had a negative PCR test, we would anticipate that 1 (1 to 2) case would be missed and 8 (5 to 15) would be falsely positive in 1000 people undergoing IgG or IgM testing in week three after onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a seroprevalence survey, where prevalence of prior infection is 50%, we would anticipate that 51 (46 to 58) cases would be missed and 6 (5 to 7) would be falsely positive in 1000 people having IgG tests during the convalescent phase (21 to 100 days post-symptom onset or post-positive PCR) of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Authors' Conclusions

Some antibody tests could be a useful diagnostic tool for those in whom molecular- or antigen-based tests have failed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including in those with ongoing symptoms of acute infection (from week three onwards) or those presenting with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. However, antibody tests have an increasing likelihood of detecting an immune response to infection as time since onset of infection progresses and have demonstrated adequate performance for detection of prior infection for sero-epidemiological purposes. The applicability of results for detection of vaccination-induced antibodies is uncertain.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of increasing significance: time to screen? [^113Uhzvx]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Who, if anyone, should we screen for monoclonal gammopathy?

As early interventions for MG continue to develop, it is also important to consider which population group would benefit the most from screening. A recent review of National Health Service screening programs highlighted targeted screening as a means of improving cost-effectiveness and reducing the risk-to-benefit ratio by focusing on individuals at a higher risk of developing the condition. Several well-established risk factors for MG provide a strong basis for defining a population for targeted screening, including increasing age, male gender, black ethnicityand having a first-degree relative with MG. Other potential risk factors for MG, such as high body mass indexand immune-related conditions, may further contribute to delineating a high-prevalence group suitable for screening. The PROMISE study is an example of targeted screening of those within a higher-prevalence group, and includes adults aged over 40 years old, identified as Black/African American or with a family history of myeloma or a precursor state. Interim 3-year data on the first 2,960 participants screened demonstrated a 10% prevalence of MG, a higher rate than previous estimates in the Minnesota cohort, which therefore helps to corroborate this approach. An alternative strategy would be opportunistic screening, for example combining serum protein electrophoresis with other primary care screening blood tests, such as cholesterol. A recent study demonstrated an increased prevalence of MG (5.3%) in unselected emergency medical admissions, which also highlights medical inpatients as a possible group for opportunistic screening. However, further prospective evidence is required to assess the long-term implications of opportunistic screening as an approach. Population screening carries the highest resource burden and risk of psychosocial impact on otherwise healthy individuals. A population-based MG screening study ongoing in Iceland, iStopMM, has screened 75,422 individuals over the age of 40 and identified 3,725 individuals with MGUS. Patients were randomized to three arms: no follow-up, standard follow-up according to current practice, or an intensive diagnostic and follow-up pathway. After 3 years of follow-up, MG patients in the intensive follow-up arm of the study had significantly higher detection rates of lymphoproliferative disorders, specifically smoldering WM, SMM and MM, demonstrating that early detection of these malignancies through screening is possible. Results from longer-term follow-up are required to determine whether this enhanced detection translates into better outcomes for patients.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^112TGnUk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Benefits and harms — regardless of target, serologic assays are likely to provide poor estimates of recent infection by SARS-CoV-2; although specificity was high in evaluated studies, they were performed before widespread SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection. In the current highly vaccinated population, specificity of anti-spike IgG as a marker of prior infection is expected to be low because the spike antigen is the target for most available vaccines, whereas a positive IgM or IgG nucleocapsid result is indicative of prior infection in most individuals except those vaccinated with inactivated whole-virus vaccines available outside the United States.

### Managing adults with screen-detected islet autoantibody positivity: a pragmatic framework [^114qL1Gu]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

New disease-modifying therapies, such as teplizumab, offer opportunities to delay the clinical onset of type 1 diabetes but require islet autoantibody screening to identify individuals at increased risk of progression to diabetes. As type 1 diabetes screening programmes expand, clinicians will increasingly encounter a new group of people: adults who test positive for islet autoantibodies but have not yet been diagnosed with diabetes. Although international guidelines outline management for both children and adults, considerable uncertainties remain, particularly for adults. In adults with islet autoantibody positivity, the lower risk of progression to type 1 diabetes compared with children, combined with the high background prevalence of mild non-autoimmune dysglycaemia, presents substantial challenges for clinical management. This Personal View aims to add clarity to international consensus guidelines, proposing a pragmatic framework for managing adults with islet autoantibody positivity. Although fitting within a UK National Health Service setting, we feel this framework is also relevant to other health systems.

### Prevalence and characterization of anti-VWF antibodies in a population of patients with type 3 VWD [^111z5aHL]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Screening assay detects VWF-specific antibodies among type 3 VWD cohort. Patients enrolled in the Zimmerman Program were screened for IgG (●) and IgM (■) antibodies that bind to rVWF by ELISA. High-titer positive control (+ Ctrl) and negative control (T3 Ab –) plasma was run on every test plate. Fifty-one healthy controls (HCs) established a threshold for positivity (dotted lines). This initial screen detected 15 of 49 patients with type 3 VWD (Type 3) positive for either IgG (11/49) or IgM (4/49) anti-VWF antibodies.

During assay development, we compared plasma-derived VWF and rVWF as potential sources for the VWF capture. When plasma-derived VWF was the source of antibody capture, we noted a significant increase in IgG OD in type O healthy controls compared with non-O; however, this was corrected for by using rVWF (Figure 3). Similarly, we investigated the binding of VWF to the microtiter plate and found that VWF was best bound directly to the plastic wells because the use of monoclonal mouse anti-human VWF antibodies to capture the VWF led to false positives in some healthy controls. Additionally, the plastic of the microtiter ELISA plates made a difference because we found that high binding hydrophilic polystyrene plastic (ThermoFisher Scientific) led to IgG/IgM detection even without bound VWF in healthy control and VWD plasma, but this observation went away with the use of medium binding hydrophobic polystyrene plates (data not shown).

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 192: management of alloimmunization during pregnancy [^114eYutf]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Other antibodies — clinical relevance and management notes indicate that the most frequently encountered antibodies other than D are Lewis (Lea and Leb) and I antibodies, and like most cold agglutinins, Lewis and I antigens do not cause erythroblastosis fetalis because they are predominantly of the immunoglobulin M type and they are poorly expressed on fetal and newborn erythrocytes, whereas Kell antibodies (anti-K) can produce erythroblastosis fetalis. Often, Kell alloimmunization is caused by prior transfusion, amniotic fluid analysis has been reported to correlate poorly with the severity of fetal anemia in Kell sensitization, and these patients may benefit from more aggressive fetal assessment such as measurement of the peak systolic velocity in the fetal middle cerebral artery, although optimal care of Kell-sensitized patients is controversial.

### Antibodies as biomarkers for cancer risk: a systematic review [^114V8xhr]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the past few decades, it is evident that a substantial body of work has been undertaken to identify the most immunogenic TAAs and their associated tumour-reactive antibodies and autoantibodies, with the end goal being the development of assays to measure the presence of such antibodies (alone or in combination with other markers) for use in cancer screening and diagnostics. Many of these studies have focussed on cancers where screening tests are currently lacking and, or in tumour types such as e.g. in lung cancers, hepatocellular carcinomas, and ovarian cancers in which earlier detection and prompt clinical intervention could provide substantial survival benefits.

Some autoantibodies were frequently observed in association with multiple cancer types for example anti-p53 antibodies are detected in breast, colorectal oesophageal, lung, and ovarian cancers. While the detection of anti-p53 antibodies alone is not a very sensitive marker for cancer, a combination with other antibody biomarkers and clinical characteristics could provide additional value for risk stratification. Anti-MUC1 antibodies mark another autoantibody found to be associated with several cancer types and appear to correlate with a more favourable prognosis. MUC1 (also known as CA 15.3) is a transmembrane mucin, a glycoprotein with O-glycosylated tandem repeats, overexpressed in cancer, in particular in breast cancer. MUC1 has been also found aberrantly glycosylated in cancer compared to normal tissue, and some reported anti-MUC1 antibodies are actually against these aberrantly glycosylated variants. Anti-MUC1 antibodies MUC1 have shown a positive association with breast cancer when in combination with 1 or more of the listed autoantibodies p53, c-myc, HER2, NY-ESO-1, BRCA2. Anti-MUC1 IgG1 antibodies have also shown a positive association with ovarian cancer. Another report on lung cancer shows a positive association with high sensitivity for squamous cell lung cancer and moderate sensitivity for all lung cancers, for an autoantibody panel which includes MUC1 (p53, c-myc, HER2, NY-ESO-1, CAGE, and MUC1, GBU4-5). Of interest are also antibodies targeting cyclin B1, a protein involved in the transition from G2 to M phase of the cell cycle. Anti-cyclin B1 antibodies have been found to increase in lung cancer, with low to moderate prediction potential as individual autoantibody, and oesophageal carcinoma, with high specificity and moderate sensitivity in predicting cancer risk when in a panel with other 7 autoantibodies (p53, IMP1, P16, P62, c-myc, Survivn, and Koc). However, in patients with breast cancer they have been found to decrease compared to healthy volunteers and they were actually considered to have a protective role in breast cancer development. Given that many identified autoantibodies to one antigen have low sensitivity and/or specificity as biomarkers for individual cancer types, the development of panels of multiple autoantibodies may provide better sensitivity for cancer or specific cancer types.

### Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in long-COVID-Markers of protection or elevated risk? A systematic review [^112ou8Pv]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-COVID affects a significant number of COVID-19 survivors, profoundly impacting daily life and work. Although research suggests a potential link between antibody levels and long-COVID risk, findings remain inconclusive. Understanding antibody dynamics could support the identification of patients at risk, improve long-COVID diagnosis, and guide protective strategies such as vaccination. Despite growing evidence, no systematic review has yet evaluated the current literature on this topic. We therefore aimed to synthesise and evaluate existing evidence on the association between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres and long-COVID, with the goal of clarifying their potential role in predicting long-COVID risk, guiding patient management, and informing future research directions. Studies published in PubMed/Medline databases between January 2020 and October 2024 were included without language restrictions. Studies on body fluids other than serum/blood were excluded. Study selection and quality assessment was conducted independently by two researchers. After screening 949 studies, 58 studies encompassing 53,739 individuals, and 7812 long-COVID patients, were included. Evidence was highly heterogenous but most studies reported an association between anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies and long-COVID, although the nature of the association appeared to be dependent on time from acute infection. Low anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies during acute COVID-19 were associated with increased risk of long-COVID. The association between low anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies during acute COVID-19 and long-COVID suggests that maintaining sufficiently high antibody levels may be protective. However, the current evidence level is low and further studies with sufficient power are required to confirm this association and to potentially determine protective cutoffs.

### Clinical significance of anti-annexin V antibody in acute cerebral ischemia [^112YiR1V]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) are associated with vascular occlusive events. Lupus anticoagulant (LA) and anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) are two aPLs commonly used for screening test. However, other aPLs are reported to play a role in the thrombotic events in other disorders, especially autoimmune disease. We investigated the clinical significance of the anti-annexin V antibody (aAV) in patients with acute cerebral ischemia; annexin V promotes anticoagulant activity via inhibition of prothrombin activation.

Methods

A total of 187 patients with acute cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack, and 66 control subjects were included in this prospective study. IgG type aAV was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent sandwich assay in the patient and control groups. The presence of LA and aCL were determined in the patient group using the usual screening method.

Results

IgG aAV was detected in 26 of the 187 patients (13.9%), but only in three of the 66 control subjects (4.5%; P = 0.043). Among the 26 aAV positive patients, only five patients were positive for LA or aCL. The presence of IgG aAV was significantly associated with acute cerebral ischemia: one stroke event (OR, 4.39; 95% CI, 1.21–16.01), and two or more stroke events (OR, 3.91; 95% CI, 1.09–14.07).

Conclusion

IgG aAV was detected in a significant percentage of the patients with acute cerebral ischemia compared with the control group. The presence of IgG aAV did not usually coincide with LA or aCL. Thus aAV should be considered as a possible associated factor for acute cerebral ischemia.

### Laboratory detection and initial diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies [^114QdNeS]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Assessing the strength of recommendations — development of recommendations required that the panel review identified evidence and make key judgments, including determining significant findings for each key question or outcome and determining any regulatory requirements and/or evidence that support a specific action. The overall strength of evidence for each key question or outcome is graded as High, Moderate, Low, and Very Low, and the strength of recommendations is designated as Strong or Conditional. According to the GRADE approach, the strength of a recommendation demonstrates the extent to which an EP is confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh undesirable effects, with strong recommendations indicating high confidence that desirable effects outweigh undesirable effects, and conditional recommendations reflecting more central or dispersed judgments indicating lower confidence.

### Anti-MOG antibody: the history, clinical phenotype, and pathogenicity of a serum biomarker for demyelination [^11788kEJ]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a protein exclusively expressed on the surface of oligodendrocytes and myelin in the central nervous system. MOG has been identified as a putative candidate autoantigen and autoantibody target in demyelination for almost three decades, with extensive literature validating its role in murine models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Seminal studies using murine anti-MOG antibodies have highlighted the fact that antibodies that target epitopes of native MOG in its conformational state, rather than linearized or denature`d MOG, are biologically relevant. However, the relevance of anti-MOG antibodies in humans has been difficult to decipher over the years due to varying methods of detection as well as the fact that it was assumed that these antibodies would be clinically associated with multiple sclerosis. There is now international consensus that anti-MOG antibodies are important in both pediatric and adult demyelination, and the clinical association of MOG antibody-associated demyelination has been refined to include acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, relapsing and bilateral optic neuritis, and transverse myelitis. Anti-MOG antibodies are now thought not to be associated with multiple sclerosis in adults. Patients with MOG antibody-associated demyelination appear to have a unique clinical, radiological, and therapeutic profile, which represents a major advance in their diagnosis and management. It is imperative to understand whether anti-MOG antibodies are indeed pathogenic, and if so, their mechanisms of action. As it has become apparent that there are differences in MOG epitope binding between species, translation of animal studies to human demyelination should be analyzed in this context. Further work is required to identify the specific epitope binding sites in human disease and pathogenic mechanisms of anti-MOG antibodies, as well optimal therapeutic strategies to improve prognosis and minimize disability in these patients.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^116wrikF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The availability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serologic testing has rapidly increased. Current assays use a variety of technologies, measure different classes of immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin combinations and detect antibodies directed against different portions of the virus. The overall accuracy of these tests, however, has not been well-defined. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serology literature and construct best practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing. This guideline is the fourth in a series of rapid, frequently updated COVID-19 guidelines developed by IDSA.

Objective

IDSA's goal was to develop evidence-based recommendations that assist clinicians, clinical laboratories, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests in a variety of settings. We also highlight important unmet research needs pertaining to the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests for diagnosis, public health surveillance, vaccine development and the selection of convalescent plasma donors.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists and experts in systematic literature review identified and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on eight diagnostic recommendations.

Conclusions

Information on the clinical performance and utility of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests are rapidly emerging. Based on available evidence, detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may be useful for confirming the presence of current or past infection in selected situations. The panel identified three potential indications for serologic testing including: 1) evaluation of patients with a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 when molecular diagnostic testing is negative and at least two weeks have passed since symptom onset; 2) assessment of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children; and 3) for conducting serosurveillance studies. The certainty of available evidence supporting the use of serology for either diagnosis or epidemiology was, however, graded as very low to moderate.

### Prevalence and characterization of anti-VWF antibodies in a population of patients with type 3 VWD [^115nj8qv]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

von Willebrand disease (VWD) is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by quantitative or qualitative defects in the von Willebrand factor (VWF) protein. Type 3 VWD has a severe bleeding phenotype caused by the absence of VWF, in which treatment usually involves replacement therapy with VWF-containing products. The immune system can react to the VWF product and form anti-VWF antibodies to neutralize or clear the VWF, which can compromise efficacy of treatment or lead to anaphylaxis. Current diagnostic testing is limited to the detection of anti-VWF antibodies that neutralize VWF binding to platelets by using a ristocetin cofactor assay. We set out to develop assays to identify both neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies to screen, quantify, and characterize anti-VWF antibodies in samples from the Zimmerman Program, a large multicenter study of patients with VWD. We detected anti-VWF immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM antibodies in 18% of 49 unrelated individuals with type 3 VWD. The antibodies ranged in concentration and consisted of 33% nonneutralizing and 67% neutralizing to factor VIII, collagen III, platelet glycoprotein Ib alpha (GPIbα), and/or collagen IV binding. Of the positive type 3 VWD samples, 8 of 9 were IgG, which were further subclassified into mostly IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies. Through a series of testing methods, we identified VWF-specific antibodies in 9 unrelated individuals with type 3 VWD with varying demographics, bleeding phenotypes, and genetic variants. This anti-VWF antibody testing strategy provides a useful tool to assess risk and better navigate treatment options for patients with type 3 VWD.

### Prevalence and characterization of anti-VWF antibodies in a population of patients with type 3 VWD [^114rk7UW]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Screening assay to detect VWF-specific IgG and IgM antibodies

As an initial screen of human plasma for the presence of anti-VWF antibodies, we developed an ELISA method using rVWF to detect VWF-specific antibodies in patients with VWD and control cohorts. A known positive (positive control) and a negative control (T3 Ab –) for each of the IgG and IgM assays was included on every plate. The distribution of healthy control plasma (N = 51) established the cut points used to classify samples as potentially positive using an upper-negative limit at the 95th percentile (IgG = 0.0122 OD; IgM = 0.0077 OD), resulting in 2 of 51 healthy control plasmas (4%) with anti-VWF antibody levels above the cut point for both IgG and IgM. This initial screen detected VWF-specific antibodies in 15 of 49 patients with type 3 VWD (IgG, 11/49 [22%]; IgM, 4/49 [8%]; Figures 1 and 2).

### Binding and neutralizing anti-AAV antibodies: detection and implications for rAAV-mediated gene therapy [^112BppHM]. Molecular Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Anti-AAV antibody seroprevalence depends on numerous factors, such as AAV capsid serotype, age, assay type (Figure 2 A), and geographical location (Figure 2 B). Other factors that may affect seroprevalence include donor health (healthy or diseased), and the use of immunosuppressants, such as rituximab and cyclosporine. Substantial cross-reactivity of anti-AAV antibodies between the serotypes is evident, which is most likely explained by the high degree of AAV capsid sequence homology. Kruzik et al. (2019) found that 87% of individuals with NAbs directed against multiple AAV serotypes exhibited higher titers against AAV2, suggesting that the lower titers against AAV5 and AAV8 in the same sample may be due to cross-reactivity of anti-AAV2 NAbs. Future studies interrogating the amino acid or conformational motifs driving cross-reactive anti-AAV antibody responses are needed to improve our understanding of the variations in immunogenicity across serotypes.

Figure 2
Anti-AAV antibody seroprevalence ranges for different AAV serotypes and across geographical regions using the hemophilia A and B population as an example

The published anti-AAV antibody seroprevalence rates vary widely according to a variety of factors, including (A) different AAV serotypes, and (B) across geographical regions (using AAV6 data from three separate reports as an example). Other factors that may influence seroprevalence rates include assay type, donor health and age, and the use of some medications, such as immunosuppressants. ∗As these studies were performed in different regions/countries using different assay types, the seroprevalence rates cannot be directly compared. AAV, adeno-associated virus; TAb, total antibody; TI, transduction inhibition.

Assays to screen for anti-AAV antibodies

Several methods have been developed to detect anti-AAV antibodies prior to GTx administration. To date, transduction inhibition (TI) assays and total antibody (TAb) assays have been routinely used in clinical trials. These assays typically use patient plasma or serum samples, but for the remainder of this text such samples will be referred to as serum samples for simplicity reasons. Clinical trial registration documentation and prescribing information for rAAV GTx may include the assay design and the threshold of the anti-AAV antibody titer to determine patient eligibility (screening titer cutoff), which varies from study to study.

### New-onset IgG autoantibodies in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^117SneEM]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The vast majority of studies on SARS-CoV-2 proteins have focused on viral structural proteins to develop efficient and accurate diagnostic assays, and to identify specific epitopes on surface proteins for the development of vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. These proteins are also the major focus of the immune response in most infected individuals. Here, we developed a multiplexed viral protein array that enables simultaneous measurement of antibody responses against 28 different proteins from 13 different viruses. We determined that non-structural proteins are recognized by antibodies in a large proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, suggesting that B cell responses expand over time to involve additional viral molecules. IgG antibody levels against NSP1 and ME correlated positively with the presence of at least one autoantibody. We hypothesize that prolonged inability to eradicate and clear virus expands the adaptive immune response to target non-structural viral proteins, some of which might physically interact or cross-react with autoantigens in the context of an intense local or systemic inflammatory environment, exceeding a threshold for breaking tolerance to self. In contrast, patients who rapidly mount neutralizing antibody responses to the viral spike protein abort "intraviral epitope spreading" and may be less likely to develop autoantibodies. Why anti-SARS-CoV-1 RBD IgG responses associate with autoantibody-positive patients is unclear. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether broad B cell responses play any direct pathogenic role in patients with prolonged hospital courses or in patients with long-term sequelae of COVID-19 infection; to correlate anti-viral responses with autoantibodies targeting traditional autoantigens or cytokines over time using much larger COVID-19 cohorts including patients who are asymptomatic or have a mild disease; and to explore whether specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins might cross-react with autoantigens discovered in our screens.

### Comparison of the solid-phase red cell adherence assay and tube method for detection and identification of red blood cell antibodies [^112quvMu]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Identifying antibodies to red blood cell antigens is one of transfusion medicine's critical responsibilities. The International Society of Blood Transfusion recognizes 354 red blood cell antigens. Accurate identification of clinically significant alloantibodies is imperative for preventing hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. We compared the performance of the tube (polyethylene glycol-indirect antiglobulin test [PEG-IAT]) and solid-phase red cell adherence assay techniques.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study on all antibody screens performed between 2007 and 2021 at Stanford Transfusion Services. Initially, 631,535 antibody screens were performed using a solid-phase technique. Subsequent antibody identifications were performed using a combination of tube testing and solid-phase techniques.

Results

Antibody screening resulted in 28,316 (4.5%) positive samples. Antibody identification performed on both platforms identified 50 discordant samples. The anti-E antibody had the lowest sensitivity (98.99%) in the automated solid-phase technique, while anti-Jkb had the lowest sensitivity (98.78%) with the PEG-IAT method.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first robust, 15-year study comparing methodologic sensitivity to detect clinically significant alloantibodies. The incidence of discordant results between PEG-IAT and the solid-phase technique was low. Among discordant samples, anti-Jka was commonly detected using the solid-phase method but not with the PEG-IAT. In contrast, anti-E was commonly detected by PEG-IAT but not by the solid-phase method.

### IgM monoclonal gammopathies of clinical significance: diagnosis and management [^114gAbwp]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is a pre-malignant condition for Waldenström macroglobulinemia and other B-cell malignancies, defined by asymptomatic circulating IgM monoclonal protein below 30 g/L with a lymphoplasmacytic bone marrow infiltration of less than 10%. A significant proportion, however, develop unique immunological and biochemical manifestations related to the monoclonal protein itself in the absence of overt malignancy and are termed IgM-related disorders or, more recently, monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance. The indication for treatment in affected patients is dictated by the pathological characteristics of the circulating IgM rather than the tumor itself. The clinical workup and treatment options vary widely and differ from those for Waldenström macroglobulinemia. The aim of this review is to alert clinicians to IgM monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance and to provide practical guidance on when to screen for these phenotypes. We discuss clinical characteristics, the underlying clonal profile, diagnostic workup and treatment considerations for five important subtypes: cold agglutinin disease, type I and II cryoglobulinemia, IgM-associated peripheral neuropathy, Schnitzler syndrome and IgM-associated AL amyloidosis. The inhibition of the pathogenic effects of the IgM has led to great success in cold agglutinin disease and Schnitzler syndrome, whereas the other treatments are centered on eradicating the underlying clone. Treatment approaches in cryoglobulinemia and IgM-associated peripheral neuropathy are the least well developed. A multidisciplinary approach is required, particularly for IgM-related neuropathies and Schnitzler syndrome. Future work exploring novel, clone-directed agents and pathogenic IgM-directed therapies is welcomed.

HLA antibodies in transplant candidates — assay types and performance note that there are two basic assays for detecting HLA antibodies: cytotoxic and solid phase. Cytotoxic assays are both insensitive and non-specific with frequent false positive results due to irrelevant IgM or non-HLA antibodies, whereas solid phase assays are engineered to specifically detect HLA antibodies and are significantly more sensitive, although some non-specificity may occur with solid phase assays as well. Where resources permit the use of single antigen bead assays, full delineation of antibody specificities should be performed to permit the calculation of a cPRA and compilation of a list of antibody specificities for comparison to future potential donors.

### Clinical significance of serum levels of anti-nuclear matrix protein 2 antibodies in patients with dermatomyositis [^111BWebr]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Antinuclear matrix protein 2 (NXP-2) antibodies are dermatomyositis-specific antibodies that target NXP-2 involved in transcriptional regulation. However, their clinical significance and relationship with disease activity remain unclear. We performed a longitudinal examination on serum samples from three patients with dermatomyositis who tested positive for anti-NXP-2 antibodies. These serum samples were analyzed alongside clinical parameters, including disease activity, muscle enzyme levels, and treatment response. The levels of anti-NXP-2 antibodies and serum creatine kinase decreased with symptom improvement in all the cases. Anti-NXP-2 antibody levels showed a correlation with disease activity, suggesting their potential role as a marker of disease activity.

### Daratumumab (Darzalex) [^111b7GDG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Effects of Daratumumab on Laboratory Tests

Interference with Indirect Antiglobulin Tests (Indirect Coombs Test)

Daratumumab binds to CD38 on RBCs and interferes with compatibility testing, including antibody screening and cross matching. Daratumumab interference mitigation methods include treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) to disrupt daratumumab binding [see References (15)] or genotyping. Since the Kell blood group system is also sensitive to DTT treatment, supply K-negative units after ruling out or identifying alloantibodies using DTT-treated RBCs.

If an emergency transfusion is required, administer non-cross-matched ABO/RhD-compatible RBCs per local blood bank practices.

Interference with Serum Protein Electrophoresis and Immunofixation Tests

Daratumumab may be detected on serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for monitoring disease monoclonal immunoglobulins (M protein). False positive SPE and IFE assay results may occur for patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein impacting initial assessment of complete responses by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. In patients with persistent very good partial response, where daratumumab interference is suspected, consider using a FDA-approved daratumumab-specific IFE assay to distinguish daratumumab from any remaining endogenous M protein in the patient's serum, to facilitate determination of a complete response.

### Evaluating patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia in the transfusion service and immunohematology reference laboratory: pretransfusion testing challenges and best transfusion-management strategies [^1165xPYG]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Medium credibility.

The serologic evaluation of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) confirms the clinical diagnosis, helps distinguish the type of AIHA, and identifies whether any underlying alloantibodies are present that might complicate the selection of the safest blood for any needed transfusion. The spectrum of testing is generally dependent on the amount and class (immunoglobulin G or M) of autoantibody as well as the resources and methodologies where testing is performed. The approach may range from routine pretransfusion testing, including the direct antiglobulin test, to advanced techniques such as adsorptions, elution, and red cell genotyping. When transfusion is needed, the selection of the optimal unit of red blood cells is based on urgency and whether time allows for the completion of sophisticated serologic and molecular testing methods. From the start of when AIHA is suspected until the completion of testing, communication among the clinical team and medical laboratory scientists in the transfusion service and immunohematology reference laboratory is critical as testing can take several hours and the need for transfusion may be urgent. The frequent exchange of information including the patient's transfusion history and clinical status, the progress of testing, and any available results is invaluable for timely diagnosis, ongoing management of the patient, and the safety of transfusion if required before testing is complete.

Figure 3.
Plasma-derived VWF captured IgG in blood type O HCs. rVWF (VONVENDI) was compared with plasma-derived VWF (Humate-P) in the screening assay for their abilities to capture and bind IgG in the plasma of 51 and 41 HCs, respectively. Mann-Whitney tests were performed on the ODs between bound and detected IgG in blood group O individuals and non-O (A, B, and AB) individuals. There was no significant difference (NS) between O and non-O IgG levels when captured by rVWF but significantly increased IgG detection in type O vs non-O plasma applied to the plasma-derived VWF. ✱✱✱✱ p ≤ .0001.

The IgG- and IgM-positive samples identified in the initial screening assay were further investigated using a slightly modified ELISA that included titration curves of test plasma (Figure 4 A). The OD of each plasma dilution > 95th percentile cut point as determined by the same set of healthy controls indicated that those samples were confirmed positive for anti-VWF antibodies. This confirmatory process reassigned 6 of the 15 screened antibody-positive type 3 VWD samples into the antibody-negative group along with most healthy controls (Figure 1), resulting in a total of 9 of 49 patients with type 3 VWD (18%) with confirmed anti-VWF antibody (T3 VWD Ab +; Table 2).

### Decrease in serum anti-MAG autoantibodies is associated with therapy response in patients with anti-MAG neuropathy: retrospective study [^1169eh2Q]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

To obtain a more homogenous patient population, only patients with anti-MAG neuropathy and MGUS associated with elevated anti-MAG IgM were included in the analysis. Other pathologies associated with monoclonal anti-MAG IgM including WM were excluded from the analysis, unless indicated (supplemental data, eTable 2).

The systematic literature analysis showed that of the 50 studies (n = 410 participants), 40 studies (n = 303 participants) support the hypothesis that (1) clinical improvements are associated with a relative reduction in anti-MAG IgM antibodies, (2) nonresponders exhibit no, or only minimal change in anti-MAG IgM antibodies, and (3) acute deteriorating was associated with an increase in anti-MAG titers.

Of note, of the 10 studies that were not supportive (n = 119 participants), only 4 studies did not support the hypothesis at all (n = 26 participants). However, in 6 of these studies (n = 93 participants), at least some patients with anti-MAG IgM neuropathy (< 50%) showed a relationship between change in anti-MAG antibodies and clinical outcome (supplemental data, eTable 2).

To further test the hypothesis, the studies and the extracted data of each group (responder, nonresponder, and acute deteriorating) were analyzed for the relative change in anti-MAG IgM titers, paraprotein levels, or total IgM levels (Figure 2). Of importance, all studies and participants were included in the analysis regardless of whether the study was categorized as supportive or not supportive. In most studies the anti-MAG IgM titers were assessed but only a minority of studies measured paraprotein (commonly referred to as M-protein or monoclonal protein) or total IgM levels. Based on the systematic literature search, a strong association was observed between clinical improvements in the responder group (n = 208 participants) and a significant reduction in anti-MAG titers, paraprotein, and/or total IgM levels (p > 0.001) compared with the nonresponder group (n = 191 participants) or the acute deteriorating group (n = 11 participants). If the 2 follow-up studies are excluded, therefore reducing the bias of including the same patient twice, the total number of participants is 394 patients with anti-MAG, of which 197 patients (50.0%) are considered as responders and 185 (47.0%) as nonresponders to the treatment.

Results

Four hundred and one women were referred to our center following the finding of maternal antibodies against fetal red blood cell antigens. Sixty-four women were excluded from the study, 19 had been referred for preconceptional assessment, 38 were false-positive cases or had antibodies following the administration of anti-D prophylaxis, and 7 were twin pregnancies cases.

The presence of maternal antibodies was confirmed in 337 pregnancies. Thirty-nine women were followed up in more than one pregnancy (range: 2 to 4). In 259 (76.9%) pregnancies, clinically significant antibodies were found. The distribution of antibodies is shown in Table 1. Anti-D antibody was the most frequent clinically significant antibody. Within the non-anti-D isolated antibodies, the most frequent was anti-K followed by anti-E and anti-c (Table 2). Multiple clinically significant antibodies were found in 65 (19.3%) pregnancies.

Tests for these autoantibodies could therefore be used in principle in screening studies on unselected populations to identify individuals predisposed to the development of the disease at an early stage, and start treatment or adopt preventive measures where possible. This aspect has aroused particular interest, as multiplex investigation techniques are already available, and microarray methods are under development, which will probably allow tens or hundreds of autoantibodies to be measured simultaneously. However, as no antibody assay offers 100% specificity, and the results are strongly dependent on the assay method used to measure the autoantibodies, it is essential to use assay methods with high diagnostic specificity, to minimize false positives and obtain a high positive predictive value. This review examines the various autoantibodies for which a role in predicting the development of an autoimmune disease has been demonstrated in long-term prospective studies.

### Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies lack neutralising autoantibodies to type-I, II and III interferons [^114ttuy4]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we comprehensively investigated the presence of neutralising anti-IFN autoantibodies in patients with IIM, specifically those diagnosed with ASyS and DM using three different state-of-the-art autoantibody screening approaches. Our findings reveal a complete absence of neutralising autoantibodies against IFN-α subtypes in this Swedish cohort. This result is in stark contrast to SLE and certain other systemic autoimmune diseases, where autoantibodies targeting type-I IFNs are prevalent and can modulate disease activity. Some studies have shown that approximately 10%–15% of individuals with SLE harbour neutralising autoantibodies targeting IFN-α subtypes, which may interfere with the type-I IFN signalling cascade — an axis known to drive inflammation and contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE. Interestingly, the presence of these autoantibodies in SLE has been variably associated with less severe clinical manifestations or lower IFN gene signatures in some cohorts, although their overall functional relevance remains an area of ongoing research.

The absence of neutralising autoantibodies against type-I IFNs in patients with IIM is notable, as both ASyS and DM subgroups are conditions associated with an upregulated type-I IFN signature in the circulation and in tissues. This suggests that, unlike SLE, where endogenous IFN-neutralising mechanisms have been observed, patients with IIM may lack such immune-modulating factors. Although it is worth noting that SLE is more commonly diagnosed later than IIM, particularly due to its heterogeneous and often subtle early clinical features. Additionally, a few of the prospective studies report type-I IFN signatures are often elevated years before SLE diagnosis, even in asymptomatic individuals who later develop the disease. The implications of this difference remain to be fully elucidated, but it raises intriguing questions about the underlying mechanisms that drive type-I IFN activation in different autoimmune diseases.

### The role of complement activation in IgM M-protein-associated neuropathies [^111fxeqU]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Strategies that reduce anti-MAG titers are successful in a subgroup of patients. The anti-MAG titer before start of treatment with rituximab correlated with treatment response, i.e. responders had higher baseline anti-MAG titers, while patients with low baseline anti-MAG titers (even those with high anti-SGPG titers) did not respond to rituximab. This suggests that anti-MAG and not anti-SGPG antibodies determine treatment response. This is further illustrated by a recent meta-analysis that concluded that anti-MAG titers might predict response to treatment.

In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with rituximab, responding patients had both a higher anti-MAG titer and more sensory impairments, suggesting a correlation between anti-MAG titer and sensory deficits, while other studies failed to find a clear correlation between anti-MAG titer and disease severity. 3, The anti-MAG titer and/or the currently used clinical scales may not be sensitive enough to detect small changes and to analyze correlations between the titer and outcome. One other possible explanation is that anti-MAG titers do not properly reflect proinflammatory properties of antibodies, such as complement activation. In the light of recent developments in the treatment of polyneuropathies with complement inhibitors, the exploration of complement inhibitors as novel treatment options for IgM-associated polyneuropathies is warranted. Our objectives were, therefore, to study anti-MAG titers in relation to their complement-activating properties as assessed by 2 in vitro systems (one ELISA-based and the other cell-based) and clinical deficits in a large cohort of patients with IgM-associated polyneuropathy.

### Immunotherapy for IgM anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein paraprotein-associated peripheral neuropathies [^1158ym1n]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Serum monoclonal anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (anti-MAG) antibodies may be pathogenic in some people with immunoglobulin M (IgM) paraprotein and demyelinating neuropathy. Immunotherapies aimed at reducing the level of these antibodies might be expected to be beneficial. This is an update of a review first published in 2003 and previously updated in 2006 and 2012.

Objectives

To assess the effects of immunotherapy for IgM anti-MAG paraprotein-associated demyelinating peripheral neuropathy.

Search Methods

On 1 February 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also checked trials registers and bibliographies, and contacted authors and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs involving participants of any age treated with any type of immunotherapy for anti-MAG antibody-associated demyelinating peripheral neuropathy with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and of any severity. Our primary outcome measures were numbers of participants improved in disability assessed with either or both of the Neuropathy Impairment Scale (NIS) or the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at six months after randomisation. Secondary outcome measures were: mean improvement in disability, assessed with either the NIS or the mRS, 12 months after randomisation; change in impairment as measured by improvement in the 10-metre walk time, change in a validated linear disability measure such as the Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS) at six and 12 months after randomisation, change in subjective clinical scores and electrophysiological parameters at six and 12 months after randomisation; change in serum IgM paraprotein concentration or anti-MAG antibody titre at six months after randomisation; and adverse effects of treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified eight eligible trials (236 participants), which tested intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), interferon alfa-2a, plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide and steroids, and rituximab. Two trials of IVIg (22 and 11 participants, including 20 with antibodies against MAG), had comparable interventions and outcomes, but both were short-term trials. We also included two trials of rituximab with comparable interventions and outcomes. There were very few clinical or statistically significant benefits of the treatments used on the outcomes predefined for this review, but not all the predefined outcomes were used in every included trial and more responsive outcomes are being developed. A well-performed trial of IVIg, which was at low risk of bias, showed a statistical benefit in terms of improvement in mRS at two weeks and 10-metre walk time at four weeks, but these short-term outcomes are of questionable clinical significance. Cyclophosphamide failed to show any benefit in the single trial's primary outcome, and showed a barely significant benefit in the primary outcome specified here, but some toxic adverse events were identified. Two trials of rituximab (80 participants) have been published, one of which (26 participants) was at high risk of bias. In the meta-analysis, although the data are of low quality, rituximab is beneficial in improving disability scales (Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) improved at eight to 12 months (risk ratio (RR) 3.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30 to 9.45; 73 participants)) and significantly more participants improve in the global impression of change score (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.71; 70 participants). Other measures did not improve significantly, but wide CIs do not preclude some effect. Reported adverse effects of rituximab were few, and mostly minor. There were few serious adverse events in the other trials.

Authors' Conclusions

There is inadequate reliable evidence from trials of immunotherapies in anti-MAG paraproteinaemic neuropathy to form an evidence base supporting any particular immunotherapy treatment. IVIg has a statistically but probably not clinically significant benefit in the short term. The meta-analysis of two trials of rituximab provides, however, low-quality evidence of a benefit from this agent. The conclusions of this meta-analysis await confirmation, as one of the two included studies is of very low quality. We require large well-designed randomised trials of at least 12 months' duration to assess existing or novel therapies, preferably employing unified, consistent, well-designed, responsive, and valid outcome measures.

### Decrease in serum anti-MAG autoantibodies is associated with therapy response in patients with anti-MAG neuropathy: retrospective study [^112iGNpy]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The objective of the retrospective analysis was to test the hypothesis that changes in serum anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) autoantibodies are associated with clinical response to immunotherapy in patients with anti-MAG neuropathy.

Methods

As of January 29, 2020, we used anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein-related search strings in the Medline database to identify studies that provided information on anti-MAG immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies and clinical outcomes during immunotherapies. The relative change in anti-MAG IgM titers, paraprotein levels, or total IgM was determined before, during, or posttreatment, and the patients were assigned to "responder", "nonresponder"', or "acute deteriorating" category depending on their clinical response to treatment. The studies were qualified as "supportive" or "not supportive" depending on the percentage of patients exhibiting an association between relative change of anti-MAG antibody titers or levels and change in clinical outcomes.

Results

Fifty studies with 410 patients with anti-MAG neuropathy were included in the analysis. Forty studies with 303 patients supported the hypothesis that a "responder" patient had a relative reduction of anti-MAG antibody titers or levels that is associated with clinical improvements and "nonresponder" patients exhibited no significant change in anti-MAG IgM antibodies. Six studies with 93 patients partly supported, and 4 studies with 26 patients did not support the hypothesis.

Discussion

The retrospective analysis confirmed the hypothesis that a relative reduction in serum anti-MAG IgM antibodies is associated with a clinical response to immunotherapies; a sustained reduction of at least 50% compared with pretreatment titers or levels could be a valuable indicator for therapeutic response.

### High anti – A titres may not preclude ABO-incompatible renal transplantation: an autoantibody could be the culprit [^1158ZVoT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

ABO-incompatible live donor renal transplantation is a growing field. To avoid hyperacute rejection, pre-operative ABO antibody titres should be < 8. There are a number of therapeutic measures used to reduce these titres if they are high. This case report describes a patient initially found to have an extremely high anti-A IgG titre (512). The high titre results were concomitant with a positive atypical antibody screen, which showed no specificity on identification. A strategy to assess true titre levels and remove sub-clinical autoantibodies was devised, leading to successful transplantation.

### Antibodies in the diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of psychotic disorders [^113zybgL]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

Most autoimmune diseases develop over a long period of time, with a period of subclinical autoreactive tissue damage before the development of overt symptomatology. A paradigmatic example of the development of predictive antibody markers is that of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Based on seminal studies of first-degree relatives who were monitored for the development of T1D over 15 years, the risk of developing the illness is now understood to rise with the number of organ-specific autoantibodies. Subsequent studies have refined the selection of at-risk individuals by using genetic criteria (HLA typing) and have provided robust risk estimates based on the "burden" of islet cell–specific autoantibodies. For example, children who develop two or more such autoantibodies have a risk of developing T1D in childhood or adolescence of > 80%.

In SLE, there are raised levels of various autoantibodies, including ANA, anti-dsDNA, ENA, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-RNP, and anti-Sm. ANA is most commonly used as a "screening" test, wherein a positive result will prompt testing of the other disease-associated antibodies. Patients with particular antibodies have an increased risk of developing certain manifestations of SLE. However, 4%–8% of the healthy population (depending on the threshold used) are positive for ANA and rates are higher in those with multiple comorbidities, so it is not regarded as a specific test. Anti-dsDNA is more specific, but this is at the expense of sensitivity. Similar to T1D, autoantibodies have been shown to predate clinical manifestations in a large proportion of those who subsequently develop the disease with the lag time between seropositivity and diagnosis being as much as 9 years.

### The management of the patient with unexpected autoantibody positivity [^117WJzb7]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Different autoantibodies are often measured simultaneously; this typically occurs when using indirect immunofluorescence on tissue sections or multiplex detection systems and may generate clinically "unexpected" positivities (i.e., without any relation to the disease under investigation). Their number is expected to increase with the development of microarray systems in autoantibody assays. In general, when examining patients with such unexpected findings, it is necessary to take into account that: a) autoantibody positivities are much more frequent than autoimmune diseases; b) the positive predictive value of an autoantibody positivity depends upon the diagnostic accuracy of the test and disease prevalence; c) autoantibodies may be risk factors for autoimmune disease or may also have a pathogenetic role by themselves. In this article we will highlight the possible problems raised by some relatively common situations, related to anti-nuclear, anti-thyroid, anti-phospholipid and anti-tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies. The need for specific strategies is outlined.

### Response comparison of multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to the same anti-myeloma therapy: a retrospective cohort study [^112H7Cfb]. The Lancet: Haematology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple myeloma is consistently preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which is usually only treated by a form of anti-multiple myeloma therapy if it is causing substantial disease through deposition of secreted M proteins. However, studies comparing how MGUS and multiple myeloma plasma cell clones respond to these therapies are scarce. Biclonal gammopathy multiple myeloma is characterised by the coexistence of an active multiple myeloma clone and a benign MGUS clone, and thus provides a unique model to assess the responses of separate clones to the same anti-multiple myeloma therapy, in the same patient, at the same time. We aimed to identify how MGUS and multiple myeloma plasma cell clones responded to anti-multiple myeloma therapy in patients newly diagnosed with biclonal gammopathy multiple myeloma.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we identified patients with biclonal gammopathy multiple myeloma by central laboratory analysis of 6399 newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma enrolled in three UK clinical trials (Myeloma IX, Myeloma XI, and TEAMM) between July 7, 2004, and June 2, 2015. In addition to the inclusion criteria of these trials, our study necessitated at trial entry the presence of two distinct M proteins in immunofixation electrophoresis. The primary endpoint was difference in response achieved with anti-multiple myeloma therapy on MGUS (which we defined as M2) and multiple myeloma (M1) clones-overall, within patients, and between therapy types-with international therapy response criteria assessed with χ² analyses. We analysed by intention to treat.

Findings

44 patients with biclonal gammopathy multiple myeloma with IgG or IgA MGUS clones were subsequently identified from the three trials and then longitudinally monitored. 41 (93%) of M1 clones had a response to therapy (either complete response, very good partial response, partial response, or minor response) compared with only 28 (64%) of M2 clones (p = 0.0010). For the 20 patients who received intensive therapy, there was no difference between the proportion of responding clones in M1 (19 [95%]) and M2 (15 [75%], p = 0.13). However, for the 17 patients who received non-intensive therapy, 16 (94%) of M1 clones had a response compared with ten [59%] of M2 clones (p = 0.031). When examining clones within the same patient, 30 (68%) of 44 individual patients had different levels of responses within the M1 and M2 clones. One patient exhibited M2 progression to myeloma and subsequently died.

Interpretation

These results show that, in patients with biclonal gammopathy multiple myeloma, anti-multiple myeloma therapies exert a greater depth of response against multiple myeloma plasma cell clones than MGUS plasma cell clones. Although some MGUS clones exhibited a complete response, many did not respond, which suggests that the underlying features that render multiple myeloma plasma cells susceptible to therapy are present in only some MGUS plasma cell clones. To determine MGUS clone susceptibly to therapy, future studies might seek to identify, with biclonal gammopathy multiple myeloma as an investigative model, the genetic and epigenetic alterations that affect whether MGUS plasma cell clones are responsive to anti-multiple myeloma therapy.

### What about (MG) US? Towards tailored testing in monoclonal gammopathies [^111KSk1U]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Given the enormous expense required for sequencing technologies and bioinformatics, such comprehensive analyses are not yet ready for clinical-scale use. This is why, for the time being, clinical stratification models are important. These cover two areas of interest: first, the identification of populations who are at high risk of having MGUS or SMM and, second, the characterization of subjects with evolving SMM in whom the initiation of systemic therapy prior to the development of overt MM will be beneficial. While a first true population-based screening study is underway but still far from its readout, there is clear evidence to support targeted screening in known high-risk groups. The incidence of MGUS is as high as 25% in black people aged 50 years or older who have at least one family member with MM. This incidence was also found in people with a different ethnic background aged 50 and older if at least two family members were diagnosed with MM. Such a screening approach could result in placing subjects with high-risk SMM (still defined by clinical and laboratory parameters) on systemic therapy to prevent end-organ damage due to symptomatic MM. With many studies examining novel combinations of therapy still underway, there is some evidence that treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in high-risk MM prolongs progression-free and overall survival when compared to observation only.
