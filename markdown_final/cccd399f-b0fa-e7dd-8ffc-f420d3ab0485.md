## Question

Diltiazem iv

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about intravenous diltiazem use, including indications, dosing, efficacy, safety, special populations, and practical pearls. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the labeled indications and core pharmacology. Then, I should verify the standard dosing protocols and onset/offset kinetics. Next, I will review comparative efficacy versus metoprolol and other agents, followed by safety, contraindications, and monitoring. After that, I need to consider special populations such as heart failure, renal/hepatic disease, pregnancy, and the elderly. Finally, I will synthesize practical pearls, including drug interactions, transition strategies, and overdose management, and close with a concise clinical takeaway anchored to guidelines and key trials.

> Let me first confirm the labeled indications and mechanism so I don't miss anything foundational. Intravenous diltiazem is indicated for temporary control of rapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and for rapid conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, including AV nodal reentrant tachycardia and reciprocating tachycardias, with the explicit warning to avoid use in AF/Flutter with accessory bypass tracts such as WPW due to risk of accelerating conduction and hemodynamic collapse, which I should keep front and center [^117PqSUM] [^112y5Rib]. Mechanistically, diltiazem is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that slows AV nodal conduction and increases refractoriness, thereby reducing ventricular rate without meaningful conversion of AF to sinus rhythm in most cases, which aligns with clinical experience and labeling data [^116goSw5] [^113B1CAL].

> I should confirm the standard adult dosing protocol and not rely on memory. The recommended bolus is 0.25 mg/kg IV over 2 minutes, with a second 0.35 mg/kg bolus after 15 minutes if the response is inadequate, followed by a continuous infusion at 5–15 mg/h for up to 24 hours, with transition to oral extended-release diltiazem 120–360 mg daily for maintenance. In older adults, many protocols cap the initial bolus at 10–20 mg to mitigate hypotension risk, which is a practical modification I need to remember [^114sWzoD] [^116Xz9ex] [^117Mp7Cx]. Wait, let me verify onset and duration: response typically occurs within 3 minutes, maximal effect by 2–7 minutes, and the heart rate reduction can persist 1–3 hours after a bolus, while continuous infusion maintains effect and can leave residual slowing for 0.5–10 hours after discontinuation, which explains why some patients remain bradycardic even after stopping the drip [^113B1CAL] [^111QtxBS].

> Next, I should review comparative efficacy versus metoprolol, since clinicians often ask which IV agent is "better". Meta-analyses and multiple studies suggest IV diltiazem achieves rate control more rapidly and with greater magnitude than IV metoprolol, with shorter time to HR < 100 bpm and larger mean HR reduction, while overall adverse event rates are similar in pooled analyses, though hypotension patterns differ by study design and definitions [^115rUBz9] [^11737sxq]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; some retrospective ED cohorts show similar short-term rate control success between agents, so patient selection and hemodynamics matter, but the weight of evidence favors diltiazem for speed and magnitude of rate reduction in stable patients [^113ruAyP] [^117Nsyuh].

> I will now examine safety and contraindications, and I need to ensure I separate relative cautions from absolute contraindications. Absolute contraindications include sick sinus syndrome without a pacemaker, second- or third-degree AV block without pacing, severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock, hypersensitivity, and AF/Flutter with pre-excitation (WPW or short PR), where diltiazem can precipitate dangerous acceleration via the bypass tract; ventricular tachycardia should not be treated with diltiazem because it may worsen hemodynamics if the rhythm is misclassified [^117GJMKM] [^113w3mjh]. Relative cautions include decompensated systolic heart failure, hepatic impairment, and concomitant AV nodal blockers; hypotension is the most common adverse effect and occurred in about 3.2% of patients in trials requiring intervention, with bradycardia and injection-site reactions also reported, so continuous ECG and frequent BP monitoring are essential during IV therapy [^113CQyxM] [^113B1CAL] [^116uUmGs].

> Let me consider heart failure carefully, because this is where practice often diverges from tradition. Classic teaching advises avoiding nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in HFrEF due to negative inotropy; however, emerging ED data in HFrEF patients suggest IV diltiazem can be as safe and effective as metoprolol in the short term, with some studies showing no excess hypotension or bradycardia, while others signal more heart failure exacerbations, so I should individualize and monitor closely if I choose diltiazem in this setting [^1117qHaG] [^117JARSL] [^1169NLP5]. But wait, what if the patient is decompensated or in shock? In that scenario, guidelines still recommend avoiding diltiazem and favoring amiodarone or digoxin for rate control, so I should not overgeneralize the newer observational signals to unstable patients [^1145kaYf] [^117QxyEN].

> I should double-check renal and hepatic dosing adjustments, because I initially thought dose changes might be required in renal failure. Hold on, I should verify: the FDA labeling indicates no routine dose adjustment is required for intermittent hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or continuous renal replacement therapy, though caution is advised and renal function should be monitored with prolonged use; hepatic impairment warrants caution due to increased bioavailability and prolonged half-life, and dose titration should be conservative in cirrhosis [^116TCB78] [^11172QAH] [^112WV9xN] [^117Rda2W]. Pharmacokinetically, diltiazem is extensively hepatically metabolized with only 2–4% excreted unchanged, explaining why renal failure has limited impact on clearance, whereas hepatic dysfunction can meaningfully increase exposure [^111XmPC9].

> Pregnancy is another special population where I need to ensure dosing precision. The HRS expert consensus supports IV diltiazem use in pregnancy with the same bolus and infusion regimen, noting maternal hypotension and bradycardia risks and the potential for uterine relaxation; given category C risk, use should be individualized with maternal–fetal monitoring and shared decision-making, and I should avoid coadministration with other negative chronotropes when possible [^112nvHwg]. Let me reconsider the practical implication: in hemodynamically stable pregnant patients with AF/RVR or SVT, diltiazem remains a reasonable option when beta-blockers are unsuitable or ineffective, with close observation for hypotension and fetal heart rate effects [^112nvHwg].

> For elderly patients, I should confirm whether dose capping is guideline-based or institutional. While not a formal FDA label change, many ED protocols and prehospital guidelines recommend a maximum initial bolus of 10–20 mg in patients over 65 years to reduce hypotension risk, which is a pragmatic approach I should adopt unless the clinical context clearly supports weight-based dosing with close monitoring [^117Mp7Cx]. I need to ensure I document rationale if I exceed those caps, given the higher incidence of bradycardia and hypotension in older adults exposed to AV nodal blockers.

> Next, I should review drug interactions and transition planning, because these often cause real-world problems. Diltiazem is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and P-gp substrate, so coadministration with direct oral anticoagulants increases bleeding risk; if a CCB is necessary, consider dose reduction of the DOAC or use of a non–CYP3A4-metabolized statin when combined, and avoid coadministration with other AV nodal blockers when possible to mitigate bradycardia and heart block risk [^1137DV95] [^112qwcVG] [^111CCwEU]. For transition, oral therapy can often be started within 3 hours of IV bolus in stable patients, and immediate-release oral diltiazem after an IV bolus performs comparably to continuous infusion for short-term rate control in some ED cohorts, which can facilitate earlier discharge when appropriate [^114xQrPP] [^111nKZr6].

> I should confirm overdose management, even though it's rare. For diltiazem poisoning, supportive care is paramount: give IV calcium (1 g calcium chloride or 3 g calcium gluconate over 5 minutes, repeatable), atropine for bradycardia, and vasopressors such as norepinephrine or dopamine for refractory hypotension; hyperinsulinemic euglycemia is reasonable in severe cases with shock, and mechanical support may be needed in life-threatening toxicity, with the caveat that calcium's effect can be inconsistent and prolonged monitoring is required [^113z3VeR] [^116jRkt9]. Hold on, I should verify that dialysis is not effective; indeed, diltiazem is not dialyzable, so extracorporeal removal is not helpful in overdose [^113z3VeR].

> Let me synthesize practical pearls so nothing critical is missed. Use weight-based 0.25 mg/kg boluses with a 15-minute reassessment window, titrate infusion to effect, and transition early to oral ER when stable. Always screen for WPW, significant bradyarrhythmias, and decompensated HF before pushing diltiazem. Monitor ECG and BP continuously during IV therapy. And remember that diltiazem rarely converts AF to sinus rhythm, so persistent irregularity after rate control is expected and not a treatment failure [^114sWzoD] [^113B1CAL]. I should double-check that my documentation captures indication, dosing, response, and monitoring, especially when using off-label strategies or in special populations, to align with guideline-based care and safety practices [^117Mp7Cx].

> In summary, IV diltiazem is a first-line agent for rapid ventricular rate control in hemodynamically stable AF/Flutter and for conversion of PSVT, with faster onset and greater magnitude of rate reduction than metoprolol in most comparative studies, but with a meaningful risk of hypotension and bradycardia that mandates careful selection, dosing, and monitoring. Avoid in WPW, severe bradyarrhythmias, and decompensated HF, use cautiously in HFrEF and hepatic disease, and apply age-appropriate dose caps in the elderly to mitigate adverse events [^117PqSUM] [^115rUBz9] [^1145kaYf] [^112o8Bdt].

Intravenous diltiazem is a **first-line agent** for acute rate control in atrial fibrillation/flutter and for rapid conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, with onset within 2–3 minutes and peak effect by 2–7 minutes [^113B1CAL]. The standard bolus is **0.25 mg/kg IV over 2 minutes**, repeated once at 0.35 mg/kg if needed, followed by a 5–15 mg/h infusion for up to 24 hours [^114sWzoD] [^116Xz9ex]. It is **contraindicated in hypotension, cardiogenic shock, second- or third-degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome without a pacemaker, and WPW with AF/Flutter** [^117GJMKM] [^113w3mjh]. Common adverse effects are hypotension and bradycardia; monitor ECG and blood pressure continuously during administration [^116uUmGs] [^117PqSUM]. Diltiazem is superior to digoxin and comparable to amiodarone for rapid rate control, but may cause more hypotension than beta-blockers in some settings [^116bKBFd] [^1154hvrQ].

---

## Indications

IV diltiazem is indicated for:

- **Atrial fibrillation/flutter**: Temporary control of rapid ventricular rate [^117PqSUM] [^112y5Rib].
- **Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)**: Rapid conversion to sinus rhythm, including AV nodal reentrant tachycardia and reciprocating tachycardias [^117PqSUM] [^111QvpCv].

---

## Dosage and administration

| **Indication** | **Initial bolus dose** | **Second bolus dose** | **Infusion** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Atrial fibrillation/flutter | 0.25 mg/kg IV over 2 minutes (≈20 mg in average adult) | 0.35 mg/kg IV over 2 minutes after 15 minutes if needed | 5–15 mg/h IV for up to 24 hours [^114sWzoD] [^116Xz9ex] |
| PSVT | 0.25 mg/kg IV over 2 minutes | 0.35 mg/kg IV over 2 minutes after 15 minutes if needed | 5–15 mg/h IV for up to 24 hours [^114sWzoD] [^111Y5xTV] |

---

Maximum recommended infusion rate is **15 mg/h**, and total duration should not exceed 24 hours [^114sWzoD] [^116Xz9ex].

---

## Pharmacokinetics

- **Onset**: 2–3 minutes after bolus [^113B1CAL].
- **Peak effect**: 2–7 minutes [^113B1CAL].
- **Duration**: 1–3 hours after bolus; 0.5–10 hours after infusion (median 7 hours) [^113B1CAL] [^111QtxBS].
- **Half-life**: 3–5 hours (IV) [^116n7AYT].
- **Metabolism**: Hepatic (CYP3A4); ~2–4% renal excretion [^111XmPC9].

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Atrial fibrillation/flutter**: Superior to digoxin and comparable to amiodarone for rapid rate control; achieves > 20% HR reduction in 83–95% of patients [^116bKBFd] [^113B1CAL].
- **PSVT**: Converts 88% within 3 minutes in controlled trials [^113B1CAL] [^115jPeiT].
- **Vs metoprolol**: Faster rate control but more hypotension; similar overall efficacy [^115rUBz9] [^1154hvrQ].

---

## Safety and adverse effects

Common adverse effects include:

- **Hypotension**: Most frequent; often transient [^116uUmGs] [^113B1CAL].
- **Bradycardia**: Especially with high doses or concomitant AV blockers [^116uUmGs] [^112mpG8y].
- **Injection site reactions**: Burning, itching, flushing [^116uUmGs].
- **Rare**: Heart block, asystole, ventricular arrhythmias, hepatic injury [^114YaH5L] [^113CQyxM].

---

## Contraindications

Absolute contraindications include:

- **Severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock** [^117GJMKM] [^113ACCL3].
- **Second- or third-degree AV block without a pacemaker** [^117GJMKM] [^113w3mjh].
- **Sick sinus syndrome without a pacemaker** [^117GJMKM] [^113ACCL3].
- **WPW with AF/Flutter**: Risk of life-threatening acceleration [^117GJMKM] [^1168aaBq].
- **Ventricular tachycardia**: Risk of hemodynamic collapse [^117GJMKM].

---

## Precautions and monitoring

- **Continuous ECG and frequent BP monitoring** are required during IV administration [^117PqSUM].
- **Use with caution** in renal or hepatic impairment, elderly, or with other AV nodal blockers [^112mpG8y] [^114jkPmc].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. macrolides, azoles) increase diltiazem levels; avoid with beta-blockers when possible due to bradycardia risk [^112mpG8y] [^111CCwEU].

---

## Special populations

- **Elderly**: Start at lower doses; monitor closely for hypotension and bradycardia [^117Mp7Cx].
- **Renal impairment**: No adjustment required, but monitor closely [^116TCB78].
- **Hepatic impairment**: Use caution; consider dose reduction [^117Rda2W].
- **Pregnancy**: Category C; use only if benefits outweigh risks [^115k2eKF].

---

## Clinical guidelines

Both the ACC/AHA/HRS and ESC recommend IV diltiazem as a **first-line agent** for acute rate control in hemodynamically stable patients with AF/Flutter or PSVT, with attention to contraindications and monitoring [^1145kaYf] [^112zjBxN].

---

IV diltiazem is effective and rapid for acute rate control in AF/Flutter and PSVT, but requires **careful patient selection, dosing, and monitoring** to mitigate hypotension and bradycardia risks.

### Comparative safety and efficacy of a hybrid intravenous and oral diltiazem protocol for acute rate control in the emergency department [^112PvevF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Intravenous diltiazem has experienced numerous supply shortages over the past few years. The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of a traditional diltiazem intravenous bolus and continuous infusion protocol to a diltiazem intravenous bolus and oral maintenance protocol for acute rate control in the emergency department.

Methods

Patients who received intravenous diltiazem in the emergency department between January 1, 2018 and May 31, 2019 were screened. Patients were included if they received the diltiazem intravenous bolus and continuous infusion protocol (IV + infusion group) or the hybrid diltiazem intravenous bolus and oral maintenance protocol (IV + PO group). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with rate control, without need for additional rate control agents or additional boluses during the maintenance phase.

Results

A total of 106 patients were matched with 53 patients in each group. For the primary outcome of rate control at four hours, 62.3% of patients in the intravenous bolus + infusion group versus 75.5% of patients in the IV bolus + PO group (p = 0.142) achieved rate control. There was no difference in rates of hypotension or bradycardia between groups.

Conclusion

Results of this study demonstrated no difference in acute rate control when using a hybrid IV and oral diltiazem protocol, compared to a traditional IV bolus and infusion strategy. This information supports the further use of a hybrid diltiazem IV and oral protocol, which provides increased flexibility during shortages of either medication.

### Metoprolol vs diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: systematic review and meta-analysis of adverse events [^112GLsyE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous (IV) diltiazem and metoprolol are commonly used to achieve rate control for atrial fibrillation with RVR (Afib with RVR), and are both recommended as first-line by current guidelines. While prior studies investigated the efficacy of these medications, there is little evidence available regarding the risk of adverse events (AEs) with their use.

Methods

We identified randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies reporting rates of AEs following administration of IV diltiazem and metoprolol for Afib with RVR by searching PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Our primary outcome was the incidence of AEs and specifically hypotension and bradycardia, which were examined individually as secondary outcomes. We performed random-effects meta-analysis to identify rates of each AE. We used moderator analysis and meta-regressions to evaluate risk factors. We used the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess study quality.

Results

We reviewed 13 studies and included 1660 patients, 888 (53%) treated with metoprolol and 772 (47%) with diltiazem. Metoprolol was associated with a 26% lower risk of AE (total incidence 10%) compared to diltiazem (total incidence 19%), (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.98, p = 0.034) with a prediction interval of 0.50–1.10. Patients with higher initial heart rates faced higher rates of AEs (Correlation Coefficient 0.11, 95% CI 0.03–0.19, p = 0.006). There was no difference with respect to rates of bradycardia (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15–1.30, p = 0.14) or hypotension (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61–1.04, p = 0.10).

Conclusion

Afib with RVR treated with metoprolol had lower rates of AE (bradycardia and/or hypotension) compared to those treated with diltiazem. We found no difference in rates of hypotension or bradycardia when individually assessed. Existing data are limited by small sample sizes, variability in dosing, and limited representation of important patient subgroups.

### Hemodynamic comparison of intravenous push diltiazem versus metoprolol for atrial fibrillation rate control [^115j9vYP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Intravenous push (IVP) diltiazem and metoprolol are commonly used for management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED). This study's objective was to determine if there was a significant difference in blood pressure reduction between agents.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of adult patients initially treated with IVP diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED from 2008 to 2018. Primary endpoint was mean reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to nadir during the study period. Study period was defined as time from first dose of IVP intervention to 30 min after last dose of IVP intervention or first dose of maintenance therapy, whichever came first.

Results

A total of 63 diltiazem patients and 45 metoprolol patients met eligibility criteria. Baseline characteristics were similar except for initial ventricular rate (VR) and home beta-blocker use. Median dose of initial intervention was 10 [10–20] mg and 5 [5–5] mg for diltiazem and metoprolol respectively. Mean SBP reduction was 18 ± 22 mmHg for diltiazem compared to 14 ± 15 mmHg for metoprolol (p = .33). Clinically relevant hypotension was similar between groups 14% vs. 16% (p = .86). Rate control was achieved in 35 (56%) of the diltiazem group and 16 (36%) of the metoprolol group (p = .04).

Conclusion

IVP diltiazem and metoprolol caused similar SBP reduction and hypotension when used for initial management of AF with RVR in the ED. However, rate control was achieved more often with diltiazem.

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for rate control in atrial fibrillation [^113ruAyP]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, it remains unclear whether β-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred for the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients who presented to the emergency department between 2015 and 2019 with AF with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) and received IV metoprolol or diltiazem. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who achieved rate control (defined as heart rate < 100 beats per minute). Secondary outcomes included time to rate control, percentage of patients requiring additional agents for rate control, and incidence of cardioversion, bradycardia, and hypotension.

Results

A total of 200 patients were included in this study. Rate control was achieved in 35% and 41% of the metoprolol and diltiazem groups, respectively (P = 0.38). Mean time to rate control was not significantly different between the metoprolol and diltiazem groups (35 vs 21 minutes, P = 0.23). One patient developed hypotension, no patient developed bradycardia, and 4 patients required electric cardioversion. No adverse events were observed in patients with ejection fraction ≤ 40%.

Conclusion and Relevance

There was no difference in the achievement of rate control between IV metoprolol and diltiazem. This is the largest study to date comparing the two classes of agents for acute rate control in AF. No patient-specific factors were identified that would influence the preferential use of one medication over the other.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Diltiazem Hydrochloride Injection or Diltiazem Hydrochloride for Injection are indicated for the following:

Atrial Fibrillation or Atrial Flutter

Temporary control of rapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. It should not be used in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome or short PR syndrome.

In addition, Diltiazem Hydrochloride Injection is indicated for:

Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia

Rapid conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT) to sinus rhythm. This includes AV nodal reentrant tachycardias and reciprocating tachycardias associated with an extranodal accessory pathway such as the WPW syndrome or short PR syndrome. Unless otherwise contraindicated, appropriate vagal maneuvers should be attempted prior to administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

The use of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection should be undertaken with caution when the patient is compromised hemodynamically or is taking other drugs that decrease any or all of the following: peripheral resistance, myocardial filling, myocardial contractility, or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium.

For either indication and particularly when employing continuous intravenous infusion, the setting should include continuous monitoring of the ECG and frequent measurement of blood pressure. A defibrillator and emergency equipment should be readily available.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) are effective for rate control with specific use considerations. The nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists verapamil and diltiazem are commonly used for treatment of AF and are the only agents associated with improvement in quality of life and exercise tolerance; intravenous bolus is effective but usually requires continuous intravenous infusion, these agents should be used cautiously or avoided in HF due to systolic dysfunction, eight randomized studies found heart rate decreases with diltiazem, verapamil decreased heart rate both at rest by 8 to 23 beats per minute and during exercise by 20 to 34 beats per minute, and they may be preferred long term over beta blockers in patients with bronchospasm or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Patients were randomly assigned in 1:1:1 ratio to receive intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, or amiodarone for VR control.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary end point was sustained VR control (< 90 bpm) within 24 hours; the secondary end points included AF symptom improvement and length of hospitalization. At 24 hours, VR control was achieved in 119 of 150 patients (79%). The time to VR control was significantly shorter among patients in the diltiazem group (log-rank test, p < 0.0001) with the percentage of patients who achieved VR control being higher in the diltiazem group (90%) than the digoxin group (74%) and the amiodarone group (74%). The median time to VR control was significantly shorter in the diltiazem group (3 hours, 1–21 hours) compared with the digoxin (6 hours, 3–15 hours, p < 0.001) and amiodarone groups (7 hours, 1–18 hours, p = 0.003). Furthermore, patients in the diltiazem group persistently had the lowest mean VR after the first hour of drug administration compared with the other two groups (p < 0.05). The diltiazem group had the largest reduction in AF symptom frequency score and severity score (p < 0.0001). In addition, length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the diltiazem group (3.9 ± 1.6 days) compared with digoxin (4.7 ± 2.1 days, p = 0.023) and amiodarone groups (4.7 ± 2.2 days, p = 0.038).

Conclusions

As compared with digoxin and amiodarone, intravenous diltiazem was safe and effective in achieving VR control to improve symptoms and to reduce hospital stay in patients with acute AF.

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for rate control in noncardiac, nonthoracic postoperative atrial fibrillation [^112QN4a7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Little guidance exists on effective management of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) following noncardiac, nonthoracic (NCNT) surgery.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to identify whether a difference exists between intravenous (IV) metoprolol and diltiazem when used to achieve hemodynamically stable rate control in POAF following NCNT surgery.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study examined critically ill adult surgical patients experiencing POAF with rapid ventricular response. Inclusion in the metoprolol or diltiazem treatment group was determined by the initial rate control agent chosen by the prescriber. The primary end point was hemodynamically stable rate control, defined by heart rate (HR) < 110 beats/min and blood pressure > 90 mm Hg, maintained for 6 hours.

Main Results

Patients on metoprolol (n = 66) and diltiazem (n = 55) were similar in age, comorbidities, surgical procedure distribution, acuity of illness, and home rate and rhythm control medications continued during hospitalization; 76% of diltiazem-treated patients achieved hemodynamically stable rate control, compared with only 53% of those receiving metoprolol (P = 0.005). Safety end points were similar between groups, including the portion requiring a new vasopressor or fluid bolus for hemodynamic support.

Conclusions

In NCNT surgery, patients with POAF, IV diltiazem more effectively controlled HR and hemodynamics compared with metoprolol. Results warrant further research into optimal medical management of POAF in this population using these 2 agents.

### Intravenous diltiazem versus metoprolol for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: a meta-analysis [^115rUBz9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous diltiazem and metoprolol are both commonly used to treat atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED), but the advantages and disadvantages of these drugs cannot be verified. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous diltiazem versus metoprolol for AF with RVR.

Method

We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, China Biology Medicine disc (CBM) and the WeiPu (VIP). Meta-analysis was performed using weighted mean difference (WMD), relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4.1.

Results

Seventeen studies involving 1214 patients in nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and eight cohort studies were included in meta-analysis, including 643 patients in the intravenous diltiazem group and 571 patients group in the intravenous metoprolol. The results of the meta-analysis showed that compared with intravenous metoprolol, intravenous diltiazem was found higher efficacy (RR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.16, p < 0.00001), shorter average onset time (RR = -1.13; 95% CI = -1.97 to -0.28, p = 0.009), lower ventricular rate (RR = -9.48; 95% CI = -12.13 to -6.82, p < 0.00001), less impact on systolic blood pressure (WMD = 3.76; 95% CI: 0.20 to 7.33, P = 0.04), and no significant difference in adverse events (RR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.55 to 1.14, P = 0.22) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD = -1.20; 95% CI: -3.43 to 1.04, P = 0.29) was found between intravenous diltiazem and metoprolol.

Conclusion

Intravenous diltiazem has higher efficacy, shorter average onset time, lower ventricular rate, less impact on blood pressure, and with no increase in adverse events compared to intravenous metoprolol.

### Intravenous diltiazem infusions for rapid atrial fibrillation or flutter in the emergency department: a retrospective, exploratory analysis [^112ZnihR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency physicians commonly treat patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response, and intravenous (IV) diltiazem is the most commonly used medication for rate control of such patients. We sought to compare rate control success and safety outcomes for emergency department (ED) patients with AF or AFL who, after a diltiazem bolus, received a diltiazem drip compared to those who did not receive a drip.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study comparing outcomes of ED patients from a single hospital system with AF and AFL and a heart rate (HR) > 100 beats/min who received a diltiazem drip after an IV diltiazem bolus to those who received no drip. The primary outcome was a HR < 100 beats/min at the time of ED disposition. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and safety (hypotension, electrical cardioversion, vasopressor use, and death). We compared groups using propensity score matching.

Results

Between January 1, 2020, and November 8, 2022, there were 746 AF or AFL patients eligible for analysis. Of those, 382 (51.2%) received a diltiazem drip and 364 (48.8%) did not. In the unadjusted analysis, the last recorded ED HR was < 100 beats/min in 55.2% of patients in the drip group compared to 65.9% in the no-drip group (difference 10.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.7 to 17.7). After propensity matching, diltiazem drip use was associated with lower likelihood of rate control in the ED (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48–0.99) and 22.5h (95% CI 12.2–36.8) longer hospital stay.

Conclusions

For patients with AF or AFL, the use of a diltiazem drip after an IV diltiazem bolus was associated with less rate control in the ED.

Atrial fibrillation acute rate control — comparative trials report that "Intravenous diltiazem was more effective than intravenous digoxin in 2 small RCTs.6,7" In one emergency department trial, investigators "randomized 150 patients with AF without major comorbidities and a ventricular rate > 120 bpm in a 1:1:1 ratio to intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, and amiodarone.6" with "time to reduce the heart rate < 90 bpm" shorter with diltiazem. Another RCT of "30 patients" found diltiazem "significantly decreased heart rate within 5 minutes versus 3 hours with intravenous digoxin.7" Diltiazem also reduced rate "more rapidly than intravenous digoxin in a double-blinded RCT in 40 patients with rapid AF after CABG, with similar control at 12 to 24 hours". Additional evidence shows "In another RCT of 84 patients in rapid AF who presented to the emergency department, intravenous amiodarone resulted in faster control of the ventricular response compared with intravenous digoxin.8" and "Finally, 52 patients with rapid AF were randomized to receive either an intravenous combination of diltiazem and digoxin or intravenous diltiazem alone, with a more rapid and durable response to the combination.9"

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Direct Intravenous Single Injections (Bolus)

The initial dose of diltiazem hydrochloride injection should be 0.25 mg/kg actual body weight as a bolus administered over 2 minutes (20 mg is a reasonable dose for the average patient). If response is inadequate, a second dose may be administered after 15 minutes. The second bolus dose of diltiazem hydrochloride injection should be 0.35 mg/kg actual body weight administered over 2 minutes (25 mg is a reasonable dose for the average patient). Subsequent intravenous bolus doses should be individualized for each patient. Patients with low body weights should be dosed on a mg/kg basis. Some patients may respond to an initial dose of 0.15 mg/kg, although duration of action may be shorter. Experience with this dose is limited.

Continuous Intravenous Infusion

For continued reduction of the heart rate (up to 24 hours) in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, an intravenous infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection may be administered. (For reconstitution of diltiazem hydrochloride for injection, see instructions contained within packaging.) Immediately following bolus administration of 20 mg (0.25 mg/kg) or 25 mg (0.35 mg/kg) diltiazem hydrochloride injection and reduction of heart rate, begin an intravenous infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection. The recommended initial infusion rate of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection is 10 mg/h. Some patients may maintain response to an initial rate of 5 mg/h. The infusion rate may be increased in 5 mg/h increments up to 15 mg/h as needed, if further reduction in heart rate is required. The infusion may be maintained for up to 24 hours.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (Tiadylt er) [^113pacvj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism

Diltiazem is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but undergoes substantial hepatic first-pass effect. The absolute bioavailability of an oral dose of an immediate- release formulation (compared to intravenous administration) is approximately 40%. Only 2% to 4% of unchanged diltiazem appears in the urine. The plasma elimination half-life of diltiazem is approximately 3 to 4.5 hours. Drugs which induce or inhibit hepatic microsomal enzymes may alter diltiazem disposition. Therapeutic blood levels of diltiazem appear to be in the range of 40 ng/mL to 200 ng/mL. There is a departure from linearity when dose strengths are increased; the half-life is slightly increased with dose.

The two primary metabolites of diltiazem are desacetyldiltiazem and desmethyldiltiazem. The desacetyl metabolite is approximately 25% to 50% as potent a coronary vasodilator as diltiazem and is present in plasma at concentrations of 10% to 20% of parent diltiazem. However, recent studies employing sensitive and specific analytical methods have confirmed the existence of several sequential metabolic pathways of diltiazem. As many as nine diltiazem metabolites have been identified in the urine of humans. Total radioactivity measurements following single intravenous dose administration in healthy volunteers suggest the presence of other unidentified metabolites. These metabolites are more slowly excreted (with a half-life of total radioactivity of approximately 20 hours) and attain concentrations in excess of diltiazem.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117QxyEN]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation with heart failure — rate control pharmacotherapy: In RATE-AF, 160 patients (≥ 60 years) with persistent AF and HF (81% with LVEF ≥ 50%) were randomized to digoxin or bisoprolol; there was no significant difference in the primary QOL endpoint at 6 months, secondary outcomes (including natriuretic peptides) were lower with digoxin, resting heart rate did not differ at 12 months, and adverse effects were less common with digoxin. Post hoc analyses in HF on chronic digoxin associated serum digoxin levels ≥ 1 ng/mL with increased mortality and hospitalization, whereas levels < 0.8 ng/mL were associated with the lowest mortality rate. In DAAF, among 239 patients (12% with HF), intravenous digoxin significantly decreased heart rate at 2 hours versus placebo. In critically ill patients, a randomized trial of 60 patients (13 with HF) showed significant rate control with both intravenous diltiazem and amiodarone, with a higher frequency of hypotension requiring discontinuation with diltiazem; a retrospective intensive care unit series of 38 patients (9 with HF) found intravenous amiodarone lowered ventricular rate without BP decrease compared with intravenous diltiazem and digoxin. The text cautions that intravenous beta blockers may cause hypotension in hemodynamic instability, that intravenous amiodarone can also be associated with hypotension (especially with bolus), and that the possibility of conversion to sinus rhythm and thromboembolism should factor into risk–benefit decisions when choosing intravenous amiodarone for rate control.

### Acute rate control with metoprolol versus diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^1117qHaG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Compare heart rate control between parenteral metoprolol and diltiazem and identify safety outcomes in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective, single-center, cohort study included adult patients with HFrEF who received intravenous (IV) metoprolol or diltiazem for AFib RVR in the emergency department (ED). The primary outcome was rate control defined as HR < 100 bpm or a HR reduction ≥ 20% within 30 min of first dose administration. The secondary outcomes included rate control within 60 min and 120 min from first dose, need for repeat dosing, and disposition. Safety outcomes included hypotensive and bradycardic events.

Results

Out of 552 patients, 45 patients met the inclusion criteria with 15 in the metoprolol group and 30 in the diltiazem group. Using bootstrapping method, patients treated with metoprolol were equally able to reach the primary outcome as those treated with diltiazem (BCa 95% CI: 0.14, 4.31). Hypotensive and bradycardia events remained zero in both groups.

Conclusion

Our study provides further evidence that short term use of diltiazem is likely as safe and effective as metoprolol in the acute management of HFrEF patients with AFib RVR and provides support for the use of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs) in this patient population.

### Comparison of sustained rate control in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: metoprolol vs. diltiazem [^117Nsyuh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare sustained rate control with intravenous (IV) diltiazem vs. IV metoprolol in acute treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This retrospective chart review at a large, academic medical center identified patients with AF with RVR diagnosis who received IV diltiazem or IV metoprolol in the ED. The primary outcome was sustained rate control defined as heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute without need for rescue IV medication for 3 h following initial rate control attainment. Secondary outcomes included time to initial rate control, HR at initial control and 3 h, time to oral dose, admission rates, and safety outcomes.

Results

Between January 1, 2016 and November 1, 2018, 51 patients met inclusion criteria (diltiazem n = 32, metoprolol n = 19). No difference in sustained rate control was found (diltiazem 87.5% vs. metoprolol 78.9%, p = 0.45). Time to rate control was significantly shorter with diltiazem compared to metoprolol (15 min vs. 30 min, respectively, p = 0.04). Neither hypotension nor bradycardia were significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Choice of rate control agent for acute management of AF with RVR did not significantly influence sustained rate control success. Safety outcomes did not differ between treatment groups.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Intravenous diltiazem hydrochloride 20 mg prolongs AH conduction time and AV node functional and effective refractory periods by approximately 20%. PR in healthy volunteers and HR in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are dependent on plasma level of diltiazem. Based on this relationship, the mean plasma diltiazem concentration required to produce a 20%, 30% and 40% decrease in heart rate was determined to be 80 ng/mL, 130 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL, respectively.

In patients with cardiovascular disease, diltiazem hydrochloride administered intravenously in single bolus doses, followed in some cases by a continuous infusion, reduced blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, the rate-pressure product, and coronary vascular resistance and increased coronary blood flow. In a limited number of studies of patients with compromised myocardium (severe congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), administration of intravenous diltiazem produced no significant effect on contractility, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The mean ejection fraction and cardiac output/index remained unchanged or increased. Maximal hemodynamic effects usually occurred within 2 to 5 minutes of an injection. However, in rare instances, worsening of congestive heart failure has been reported in patients with preexisting impaired ventricular function.

AHA 2025 Adult Advanced Life Support — acute rate control strategy selection in atrial fibrillation/flutter: Nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists and β-adrenergic blockers are reported as effective for rate control, and systematic reviews show that IV diltiazem improves heart rate control when compared to IV metoprolol. Amiodarone is effective for rate control without preexcitation when there are contraindications to these agents, whereas digoxin is less commonly used in the acute setting because of the slow onset of effect. In an observational study, optimal amiodarone dosing for heart rate control was examined in 80 critically ill patients, most with cardiogenic shock or sepsis. In atrial fibrillation or flutter with concomitant preexcitation after AV nodal blocking agents, cardioversion is recommended as the most appropriate management. Because of negative inotropic effects, nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists may further decompensate patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and symptomatic heart failure, though patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may tolerate them better; β-blockers can be safe in cardiomyopathy but harmful in decompensated patients. Limited evidence suggests that intravenous diltiazem may cause increased risk of decompensation compared to intravenous β-adrenergic blockers, and multiple studies have demonstrated β-adrenergic blockers are safe for use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Study Objective

To evaluate the dose-dependent comparative safety and effectiveness between weight-based and alternative dosing strategies for diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response who received treatment with intravenous diltiazem. Groups were retrospectively categorized according to the initial dose: low (< 0.1875 mg/kg), weight-based (0.1875 to 0.3125 mg/kg), and high (> 0.3125 mg/kg). The primary outcome was rate control (heart rate < 100 beats/min) within 30 minutes of treatment.

Results

Of 345 records, 252 were included. Because of scarcity (N = 6), outcomes for the high-dose group were not analyzed. By 30 minutes, the weight-based dosing group had more often achieved rate control (weight-based 55%; low 27%; difference 29% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17% to 40%]). Regression analysis identified the weight-based dosing group (odds ratio 3.63, 95% CI 2.06 to 6.39) and initial heart rate of less than 145 beats/min (odds ratio 2.56, 95% CI 1.46 to 4.51) as variables associated with the primary outcome. The weight-based dosing group less often required rescue therapy (weight-based 6%; low 17%; difference -12% [95% CI -20% to -4%]) relative to the low-dose group. Mortality was higher in the low-dose group than in the weight-based dosing group (low 7%; weight-based 1%; difference 6% [95% CI 1% to 11%]).

Conclusion

This study shows dose-dependent hemodynamic effects with diltiazem in patients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Weight-based diltiazem (0.25 mg/kg) was associated with greater rate control with no evidence of increased adverse effects. There was no perceived advantage in using lower, alternative doses.

A study that compared patients with normal hepatic function to patients with cirrhosis who received immediate-release diltiazem found an increase in diltiazem elimination half-life and a 69% increase in bioavailability in the hepatically impaired patients. Patients with severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) who received immediate-release diltiazem had modestly increased diltiazem concentrations compared to patients with normal renal function.

The systemic clearance of diltiazem has been found to be decreased in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to healthy volunteers. In patients administered continuous infusions at 10 mg/h or 15 mg/h for 24 h, diltiazem systemic clearance averaged 42 L/h and 31 L/h, respectively. The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 3. 4 h.

### Adenosine versus fixed-dose intravenous bolus diltiazem on reversing supraventricular tachycardia in the emergency department: a multi-center cohort study [^117FTiPK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a common and therapeutically challenging cardiac dysrhythmia in the emergency department (ED). Adenosine and diltiazem are the most used pharmacological agents for SVT management, but few comparative studies exist.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of bolus intravenous (IV) adenosine versus diltiazem in the termination of spontaneous SVT.

Methods

This was a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study conducted in EDs in North Texas. Eligible subjects were adult patients presenting with stable SVT who received either a bolus of IV adenosine or diltiazem as the initial treatment. The primary outcome was the rate of successful conversion, which was defined as a sustained sinus rhythm within 30 min of the initial treatment. Secondary outcomes included time to conversion and response doses.

Results

A total of 344 cases were incorporated into the final analysis, 310 in the adenosine-first group and 34 in the diltiazem-first group. The rate of successful conversion trended higher for diltiazem; however, the difference was not significantly different (66.8% adenosine, 82.4% diltiazem, p = 0.08). The median time to conversion was significantly shorter for the adenosine group (3.0 min) to the diltiazem group (6.0 min, p = 0.02), with median response dosages of 12 mg and 15 mg, respectively. Of the cases that failed adenosine monotherapy, 18 (35%) were successfully rescued by diltiazem. Diltiazem also successfully controlled 77% of conversions to atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter without hypotensive events.

Conclusion

This study showed that diltiazem and adenosine had similar conversion rates. In addition, diltiazem effectively rescued cases not responsive to adenosine.

### Amiodarone versus diltiazem for rate control in critically ill patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias [^1137oYJU]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the rate-lowering effect of diltiazem and two amiodarone regimens in critically ill patients with recent-onset atrial tachyarrhythmias.

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled study.

Setting

Medical cardiologic intensive care unit in a university hospital.

Patients

Sixty critically ill patients (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] III score 70 ± 30, age 67 ± 10 yrs).

Interventions

Patients with atrial fibrillation (n = 57), atrial flutter (n = 2), or atrial tachycardia (n = 1, and a heart rate consistently > 120 beats/min over 30 mins were randomly assigned to one of three intravenous treatment regimens. Group 1 received diltiazem in a 25-mg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 20 mg/hr for 24 hrs, group 2 received amiodarone in a 300-mg bolus, and group 3 received amiodarone in a 300-mg bolus followed by 45 mg/hr for 24 hrs.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary study end point was a > 30% rate reduction within 4 hrs. The secondary study end point was a heart rate < 120 beats/min (a patient was considered to have uncontrolled tachycardia if heart rate was > 120 beats/min 4 hrs after study drug). The primary study end point was achieved in 14/20 (70%), 11/20 (55%), and 15/20 (75%) of patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (χ² = 1.95, p = .38). Uncontrolled tachycardia was more frequently observed in group 2 (0/20, 9/29 [55%], and 1/20 [5%] of patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively; χ² = 17, p = .00016). In patients achieving tachycardia control, diltiazem showed a significantly better rate reduction (p = .0001 group 1 vs. group 3, p = .0001 over time; p = .0001 group 1 vs. group 2, p = .001 over time) when compared with the amiodarone groups. Premature drug discontinuation due to hypotension was required significantly more often in group 1 (6/20 [30%], 0/20, and 1/20 [5%] for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively; χ² = 10, p = .01).

Conclusion

Sufficient rate control can be achieved in critically ill patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias using either diltiazem or amiodarone. Although diltiazem allowed for significantly better 24-hr heart rate control, this effect was offset by a significantly higher incidence of hypotension requiring discontinuation of the drug. Amiodarone may be an alternative in patients with severe hemodynamic compromise.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (DILTIAZEM HYDROCHLORIDE in SODIUM CHLORIDE) [^115jPeiT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In domestic controlled trials in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in reducing heart rate by at least 20% in 95% of patients. Diltiazem hydrochloride injection rarely converts atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. Following administration of one or two intravenous bolus doses of diltiazem injection, response usually occurs within 3 minutes and maximal heart rate reduction generally occurs in 2 to 7 minutes. Heart rate reduction may last from 1 to 3 hours. If hypotension occurs, it is generally short-lived, but may last from 1 to 3 hours.

A 24-hour continuous infusion of diltiazem injection in the treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter maintained at least a 20% heart rate reduction during the infusion in 83% of patients. Upon discontinuation of infusion, heart rate reduction may last from 0.5 hours to more than 10 hours (median duration 7 hours). Hypotension, if it occurs, may be similarly persistent.

In the controlled clinical trials, 3.2% of patients required some form of intervention (typically, use of intravenous fluids or the Trendelenburg position) for blood pressure support following diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

In domestic controlled trials, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in converting PSVT to normal sinus rhythm in 88% of patients within 3 minutes of the first or second bolus dose.

Symptoms associated with the arrhythmia were improved in conjunction with decreased heart rate or conversion to normal sinus rhythm following administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

In controlled clinical trials, therapy with antiarrhythmic agents to maintain reduced heart rate in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter or for prophylaxis of PSVT was generally started within 3 hours after bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride. These antiarrhythmic agents were intravenous or oral digoxin, Class 1 antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide), calcium channel blockers, and oral beta-blockers.

### Impact of intravenous calcium with diltiazem for atrial fibrillation / flutter in the emergency department [^116bHtap]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of early intravenous (IV) calcium on systolic blood pressure (SBP) when administered with IV diltiazem in subjects with atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the Emergency Department (ED).

Methods

This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study that evaluated adults admitted to the ED with documented AF or AFL, heart rate (HR) > 120 bpm, SBP 90 to 140 mmHg, and received treatment with IV diltiazem for rate control. The primary outcome was the change in SBP 60 min (± 30 min) after initial IV diltiazem administration. Secondary outcomes included time to initial rate control (HR < 100 bpm), time to sustained rate control (HR < 100 bpm for 3 h), change in HR, rates of hypotension, bradycardia, hypercalcemia, and line extravasation within 24 h of initial diltiazem administration.

Results

There were 198 subjects in the diltiazem monotherapy group and 56 subjects in the diltiazem with calcium group meeting the inclusion criteria. The primary outcome, median change in SBP 60 min after initial IV diltiazem administration, was similar between groups (-2 mmHg vs -1.5 mmHg; p = 0.642), but this difference was not statistically significant. All secondary outcomes were found to be similar between groups. Although not statistically significant, hypotension occurred more often in the diltiazem with calcium group (20.2% vs 32.1%; p = 0.060) while bradycardia occurred more often in the diltiazem monotherapy group (4.5% vs 0%; p = 0.213). In terms of achieving rate control, the administration of calcium with diltiazem did not significantly change the time to initial rate control (1.4 h vs 1.8 h; p = 0.141) or time to sustained rate control (7.9 h vs 7.7 h; p = 0.570) compared to diltiazem alone.

Conclusions

In the setting of AF/AFL with RVR, administration of IV calcium with IV diltiazem did not show a significant impact on clinical or safety outcomes compared to IV diltiazem monotherapy.

These metabolites are also observed following 24-hour constant rate intravenous infusion. The systemic clearance of diltiazem has been found to be decreased in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to healthy volunteers. In patients administered continuous infusions at 10 mg/h or 15 mg/h for 24 h, diltiazem systemic clearance averaged 42 L/h and 31 L/h, respectively. The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 3. 4 h. Total radioactivity measurement following short IV administration in healthy volunteers suggests the presence of other unidentified metabolites which attain higher concentrations than those of diltiazem and are more slowly eliminated; half-life of total radioactivity is about 20 h compared to 2 to 5 h for diltiazem. After constant rate intravenous infusion to healthy male volunteers, diltiazem exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics over an infusion range of 4. 8 to
13. 2 mg/h for 24 h.

Over this infusion range, as the dose is increased, systemic clearance decreases from 64 to 48 L/h while the plasma elimination half-life increases from 4. 1 to

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (Cardizem) [^113z3VeR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of intravenous calcium administration to reverse the pharmacological effects of diltiazem overdose has been inconsistent. In a few reported cases, overdose with calcium channel blockers associated with hypotension and bradycardia that was initially refractory to atropine became more responsive to atropine after the patients received intravenous calcium. In some cases intravenous calcium has been administered (1 g calcium chloride or 3 g calcium gluconate) over 5 minutes and repeated every 10 to 20 minutes as necessary. Calcium gluconate has also been administered as a continuous infusion at a rate of 2 g per hour for 10 hours. Infusions of calcium for 24 hours or more may be required. Patients should be monitored for signs of hypercalcemia.

In the event of overdose or exaggerated response, appropriate supportive measures should be employed in addition to gastrointestinal decontamination. Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis. Limited data suggest that plasmapheresis or charcoal hemoperfusion may hasten diltiazem elimination following overdose. Based on the known pharmacological effects of diltiazem and/or reported clinical experiences, the following measures may be considered:

Bradycardia: Administer atropine (0.60 to 1.0 mg). If there is no response to vagal blockade, administer isoproterenol cautiously.

High-Degree AV Block: Treat as for bradycardia above. Fixed high-degree AV block should be treated with cardiac pacing.

Cardiac Failure: Administer inotropic agents (isoproterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine) and diuretics.

Hypotension: Vasopressors (e.g., dopamine or norepinephrine).

Actual treatment and dosage should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Injectable forms of diltiazem are contraindicated in:

Patients with sick sinus syndrome except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.

Patients with second- or third-degree AV block except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.

Patients with severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock.

Patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug.

Intravenous diltiazem and intravenous beta-blockers should not be administered together or in close proximity (within a few hours).

Patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in WPW syndrome or short PR syndrome.

As with other agents which slow AV nodal conduction and do not prolong the refractoriness of the accessory pathway (e.g., verapamil, digoxin), in rare instances patients in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract may experience a potentially life-threatening increase in heart rate accompanied by hypotension when treated with injectable forms of diltiazem. As such, the initial use of injectable forms of diltiazem should be, if possible, in a setting where monitoring and resuscitation capabilities, including DC cardioversion/defibrillation, are present (see OVERDOSAGE). Once familiarity of the patient's response is established, use in an office setting may be acceptable.

Patients with ventricular tachycardia. Administration of other calcium channel blockers to patients with wide complex tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0.12 seconds) has resulted in hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation. It is important that an accurate pretreatment diagnosis distinguish wide complex QRS tachycardia of supraventricular origin from that of ventricular origin prior to administration of injectable forms of diltiazem.

### Safety of diltiazem for acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction in the emergency department [^116zQBRj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diltiazem is an effective rate control agent for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (AF RVR). However, its negative inotropic effects may increase the risk for worsening heart failure in patients with a reduced ejection fraction (EF).

Objectives

This observational study aims to describe the incidence of worsening heart failure in patients who receive intravenous diltiazem for acute atrial fibrillation management.

Methods

Adult patients that received diltiazem in the emergency department (ED) for AF RVR (heart rate ≥ 100 beats/min) from 2021 to 2022 and had a prior documented EF were included. The primary outcome is worsening heart failure within 24 h of diltiazem administration. Secondary outcomes include return ED visits and death within 7 days. EF percentage was compared across outcomes using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Outcomes were compared by reduced EF (< 50%) and preserved EF (≥ 50%). Continuous data were summarized with medians and interquartile ranges, and categorical features were summarized with frequency counts and percentages. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for numeric outcomes and chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact tests for categorical outcomes, with a p-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant.

Results

There were 674 patients with AF RVR that received diltiazem, and 386 patients met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Baseline demographics included a median age of 72 (64–81) years, with 14.5% of patients having a prior diagnosis of congestive heart failure. EF < 50% was identified in 13.7% of patients (n = 53), of which approximately 30% of these patients safely discharged home after receiving i.v. diltiazem. The primary outcome of worsening heart failure occurred in 7/41 (17%) and 10/207 (4.8%) patients with reduced and preserved ejection fractions, respectively, who were admitted to the hospital (p = 0.005).

Conclusion

The development of worsening heart failure is multifactorial and may include the use of diltiazem in critically ill patients requiring hospital admission.

### Evaluating the concomitant use of diltiazem or verapamil with direct oral anticoagulants: a meta-analysis [^1137DV95]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diltiazem and verapamil are combined p-glycoprotein and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors which significantly increase the concentrations of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and may increase the risks of bleeding. Multiple real-world studies compared the concomitant therapy of diltiazem/verapamil and DOACs versus the DOAC monotherapy groups, but their main findings were contradictory.

Objective

To evaluate the risks of bleeding and stroke between the concomitant therapy of diltiazem/verapamil and DOACs and DOAC monotherapy.

Methods

A meta-analysis was performed to compare the concomitant therapy of diltiazem/verapamil and DOACs versus DOACs. Database searches through November 16, 2024 were performed using MEDLINE and Google Scholar. The primary outcome was major bleeding. The secondary outcomes included stroke or systemic embolism and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Results

A total of 6 studies were included in this meta-analysis. It showed that the concomitant therapy of DOAC and diltiazem/verapamil was significantly associated with increased risks of major bleeding (odds ratio [OR] = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.24, 1.54; P < 0.01; I² = 0%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (OR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.37; P = 0.01; I² = 0%) compared with the DOAC monotherapy group. The concomitant therapy group was also significantly associated with the lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism compared with the DOAC monotherapy group (OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.73, 0.93; I² = 0%).

Conclusion and Relevance

This meta-analysis found that the concomitant therapy of DOACs with diltiazem/verapamil increases the risks of bleeding outcomes compared with the DOAC monotherapy group.

Transition to Further Antiarrhythmic Therapy.

Transition to other antiarrhythmic agents following administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection is generally safe. However, reference should be made to the respective agent manufacturer's package insert for information relative to dosage and administration.

In controlled clinical trials, therapy with antiarrhythmic agents to maintain reduced heart rate in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter or for prophylaxis of PSVT was generally started within 3 hours after bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection. These antiarrhythmic agents were intravenous or oral digoxin, Class 1 antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide), calcium channel blockers, and oral beta-blockers.

Experience in the use of antiarrhythmic agents following maintenance infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection is limited. Patients should be dosed on an individual basis and reference should be made to the respective manufacturer's package insert for information relative to dosage and administration.

### Evaluation of metoprolol versus diltiazem for rate control of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department [^1154hvrQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of the metoprolol and diltiazem administration in the Emergency Department (ED) for rate control of supraventricular tachycardia.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who presented to the ED with ventricular rates ≥ 120 beats per minute (bpm) and who received bolus doses of either intravenous metoprolol or intravenous diltiazem. The primary outcome was achievement of rate control, defined as heart rate < 110 bpm, at two hours after administration of the last bolus dose of metoprolol or diltiazem. Safety outcomes included occurrence of hypotension, defined as systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure < 60 mmHg, and bradycardia, defined as heart rate < 60 bpm.

Results

There were 166 patients receiving metoprolol and 183 patients receiving diltiazem included in the study. The primary outcome, rate control at two hours after the last bolus dose of metoprolol or diltiazem was similar between the two groups (45.8% vs 42.6%, p = 0.590, respectively). The percentage of patients achieving rate control was also similar (47.0% vs 41.6%, p = 0.333) at one hour. At 0.5 h HR had a significantly greater numerical (diltiazem: 29.3 ± 23.1 bpm vs metoprolol: 21.8 ± 18.9 bpm, p = 0.012) and percent decrease (21.1% vs 15.94%, p = 0.014) in the diltiazem group compared to metoprolol. There was no significant difference in occurrence of bradycardia in the two groups (diltiazem: 3.83% vs metoprolol: 1.2%, p = 0.179). More patients in the diltiazem group compared to the metoprolol group experienced hypotension (39.3% vs 23.5%, p = 0.002). The difference in systolic hypotension events was not significantly different (9.29% vs 5.42%, p = 0.221), while the difference in diastolic hypotension events was significantly different (37.7% vs 22.3%, p = 0.002).

Conclusion

There was no difference in acute rate control effectiveness two hours after the last bolus dose of diltiazem and metoprolol for supraventricular tachycardias. There was a significantly higher occurrence of hypotension in the diltiazem group which was driven by higher rates of diastolic blood pressures less than 60 mmHg.

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons practice guideline on the prophylaxis and management of atrial fibrillation associated with general thoracic surgery: executive summary [^115hawH6]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

General thoracic surgery (GTS) postoperative atrial fibrillation — calcium-channel blocker prophylaxis (diltiazem): Class IIa recommendation: Diltiazem prophylaxis is reasonable in most patients undergoing major pulmonary resection who are not taking a β-blocker preoperatively, though hypotension may develop and dose reduction or other pressure-elevating therapies may be required (Level of evidence B). Several randomized trials show the incidence of atrial fibrillation is reduced by approximately one half: 10.6% versus 21.5% (relative risk 0.50; 95% confidence interval: 0.34 to 0.73), and because diltiazem has a far lower rate of hypotension than verapamil, diltiazem is the recommended calcium-blocking agent. Although the only placebo-controlled diltiazem study used an IV load and 24-hour infusion followed by oral therapy, it may be reasonable to administer prophylactic diltiazem orally alone; oral diltiazem begun in the recovery room is reasonable after lung resection at 30 to 60 mg every 6 hours, and orders should include "hold parameters".

### Evaluation of the blood pressure effects of diltiazem versus metoprolol in the acute treatment of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate [^112Ws4s2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the difference in blood pressure effects of diltiazem intravenous push (IVP) and metoprolol IVP in the acute management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (AF with RVR).

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study evaluating patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) between January 2012 and September 2018 in AF with RVR and received either diltiazem IVP or metoprolol IVP as the first agent for rate control. The primary objective was the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) within one hour of initial medication administration. Secondary outcomes included repeat doses within one hour, rate control to < 110 beats per minute, and SBP < 90 mmHg or decrease by > 40% within three hours. Subgroup analysis of patients with a baseline SBP < 110 mmHg was conducted.

Results

Of the 160 patients included, 80 received diltiazem and 80 metoprolol. The primary outcome of median change in SBP at one hour was a difference of -9 [-21 to 6] mmHg in the diltiazem group versus a difference of -4 [-18 to 9] mmHg in the metoprolol group (p = 0.102). Subgroup analysis (n = 28) of patients with a baseline SBP < 110 mmHg demonstrated an increase of 7 [-0.25 to 19] mmHg in the diltiazem group versus increase of 7 [0 to 13] in the metoprolol group (p = 0.910).

Conclusion

No significant difference was observed in the blood pressure effects of diltiazem IVP versus metoprolol IVP in the acute management of AF with RVR.

### Metoprolol vs. diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^117JARSL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of metoprolol versus diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective cohort study of patients with HFrEF in AF with RVR receiving either intravenous push (IVP) doses of metoprolol or diltiazem was conducted between January 2012 and September 2016. The primary outcome was successful rate control within 30 min of medication administration, defined as a heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute or a HR reduction ≥ 20%. Secondary outcomes included rate control at 60 min, maximum median change in HR, and incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion to normal sinus rhythm within 30 min. Signs of worsening heart failure were also evaluated.

Results

Of the 48 patients included, 14 received metoprolol and 34 received diltiazem. The primary outcome, successful rate control within 30 min, occurred in 62% of the metoprolol group and 50% of the diltiazem group (p = 0.49). There was no difference in HR control at predefined time points or incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion. Although baseline HR varied between groups, maximum median change in HR did not differ. Signs of worsening heart failure were similar between groups.

Conclusions

For the acute management of AF with RVR in patients with HFrEF, IVP diltiazem achieved similar rate control with no increase in adverse events when compared to IVP metoprolol.

### Critical care management of verapamil and diltiazem overdose with a focus on vasopressors: a 25-year experience at a single center [^116jRkt9]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Verapamil or diltiazem overdose can cause severe morbidity and death, and there exist limited human data describing management and outcome of a large number of such patients. This article describes the management and outcome of patients with nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker overdose, with an emphasis on vasopressor dosing, at a single center.

Methods

This study is a retrospective chart review of patients older than 14 years and admitted to the inpatient toxicology service of a single tertiary care medical center for treatment of verapamil or diltiazem overdose from 1987 through 2012, and who had the presence of either drug confirmed by urine drug screening. Patients were identified by review of patient encounter logs. Data abstracted from medical records included demographics, laboratory results, drugs used to support blood pressure, complications, and outcomes. A second group included patients with a reported calcium channel blocker ingestion but for whom results of the urine drug testing were no longer available. In an effort to assess selection bias, this group was included to determine whether patients who were excluded from the primary group only because of unavailability of urine drug screen results had different outcomes.

Results

During the study period, 48 patients met inclusion criteria. The median age was 45 years, with a range of 15 to 76 years, and 52% were male patients. Verapamil accounted for 24 of 48 (50%) ingestions. Vasopressors were administered to 33 of 48 (69%) patients. Maximal vasopressor infusion doses were epinephrine 150 μg/minute, dopamine 100 μg/kg per minute, dobutamine 245 μg/kg per minute, isoproterenol 60 μg/minute, phenylephrine 250 μg/minute, and norepinephrine 100 μg/minute. The use of multiple vasopressors was common. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemia was used in 3 patients who also received multiple vasopressors. Eight probable or possible ischemic complications were noted in 5 of 48 (10%) patients. Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 3 of 48 (6%) patients; a brain magnetic resonance imaging in 1 patient suggested mild ischemia, without clinical evidence of infarction; 1 patient had ischemic bowel; and 3 patients developed renal failure from acute tubular necrosis, which resolved in each case. Six of the 8 ischemic complications were evident before use of vasopressor therapy. Three patients sustained inhospital cardiac arrest before admission and were successfully resuscitated. Each of these arrests occurred before instituting vasopressor infusions. One patient experienced a late cardiac arrest from primary respiratory arrest from administration of sedatives, and multiple organ system failure followed resuscitation, with death occurring during manipulation of a pulmonary artery catheter. The remaining 47 patients recovered. There were 12 patients in the group of additional poisoned patients for whom results of urine drug screening were unavailable. Four patients were treated with vasopressors, 2 experienced acute tubular necrosis that was present before vasopressor use, and all recovered.

Conclusion

In our series of patients admitted with verapamil or diltiazem overdose, hypotension was common and managed with the use of multiple vasopressors and without hyperinsulinemic euglycemia in all but 3 cases. Despite high doses of vasopressors, ischemic complications were the exception and were usually present before use of vasopressors. Death occurred in a single patient whose death was not attributed directly to calcium-channel blocker toxicity. Vasopressor use after verapamil or diltiazem overdose was associated with good clinical outcomes without permanent sequelae.

### Evaluation of diltiazem dosing strategies in the management of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department [^111nKZr6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the incidence of treatment failure between oral (PO) immediate release (IR) tablet and continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) diltiazem following an initial loading dose in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Methods

This single center, retrospective cohort study evaluated patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 in AF with RVR who received oral or continuous diltiazem after an initial intravenous loading dose. The primary objective of this study is to identify the percentage of patients with treatment failure four hours after initiation of diltiazem IR PO tablet or continuous IV infusion. Secondary endpoints included hospital length of stay (LOS), ED disposition, and clinically significant hypotension.

Results

Of the 171 patients included, 85 received PO IR diltiazem and 86 received CIVI diltiazem. There was no significant difference in the composite outcome of treatment failure between the PO and CIVI groups (60% vs 59%, p = 0.93). Patients who received PO diltiazem were more frequently discharged from the ED (31.8% vs 4.7%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in hospital LOS (6.6 vs 6.5 days, p = 0.06) or clinically significant hypotension (11.7% vs 8.1% p = 0.428).

Conclusion

Initiating immediate-release oral diltiazem after an initial IV bolus does not result in more treatment failures than initiating a continuous infusion.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117CX4k7]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Recommendation-specific supportive evidence — randomized trials of acute rate control report the following quantitative results: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of continuous intravenous diltiazem infusion for 24-hour heart rate control during AF and AFL, seventeen of the 23 patients (74%) receiving diltiazem infusion and none of the 21 with placebo infusion maintained a therapeutic response for 24 hours. In another randomized clinical trial of intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, or amiodarone for ventricular rate control, at 24 hours, rate control was achieved in 119 of 150 patients (79%), and the percentage who achieved rate control was higher in the diltiazem group (90%) than the digoxin group (74%) and the amiodarone group (74%). In a randomized, parallel, open-label study of esmolol versus verapamil in acute AF or AFL, fifty percent of esmolol-treated patients with new onset of arrhythmias converted to sinus rhythm, whereas only 12% of those who received verapamil converted, with mild hypotension observed in both treatment groups.

### Diltiazem hci [^113B1CAL]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In domestic controlled trials in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in reducing heart rate by at least 20% in 95% of patients. Diltiazem hydrochloride injection rarely converts atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. Following administration of one or two intravenous bolus doses of diltiazem hydrochloride injection, response usually occurs within 3 minutes and maximal heart rate reduction generally occurs in 2 to 7 minutes. Heart rate reduction may last from 1 to 3 hours. If hypotension occurs, it is generally short-lived, but may last from 1 to 3 hours.

A 24-hour continuous infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection in the treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter maintained at least a 20% heart rate reduction during the infusion in 83% of patients. Upon discontinuation of infusion, heart rate reduction may last from 0.5 hours to more than 10 hours (median duration 7 hours). Hypotension, if it occurs, may be similarly persistent.

In the controlled clinical trials, 3.2% of patients required some form of intervention (typically, use of intravenous fluids or the Trendelenburg position) for blood pressure support following diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

In domestic controlled trials, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in converting PSVT to normal sinus rhythm in 88% of patients within 3 minutes of the first or second bolus dose.

Symptoms associated with the arrhythmia were improved in conjunction with decreased heart rate or conversion to normal sinus rhythm following administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

### Diltiazem to treat sinus tachycardia in critically ill patients: a four-year experience [^111iGB37]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether an intravenous infusion of the calcium channel blocker diltiazem was effective and safe in treating sinus tachycardia in critically ill adult patients with contraindications to beta-blockers or in whom beta-blockers were ineffective.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

University medical center.

Patients

The records of 171 surgical intensive care unit patients with sinus tachycardia treated with intravenous diltiazem were evaluated.

Interventions

In all patients with sinus tachycardia (heart rate > 100 beats/min), heart rate control with intravenous diltiazem was attempted after adequate intravascular volume expansion, pain, and anxiety control. In all patients, beta-blockade either was contraindicated or (in 7%) had failed. Intravenous diltiazem was administered as a slow 10-mg bolus dose (0.1–0.2 mg/kg ideal body weight), and then an infusion was started at 5 or 10 mg/hr and increased up to 30 mg/hr, as needed, to decrease heart rate to < 100 beats/min. Variables retrospectively collected included demographic data, preinfusion blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and preinfusion pressure-rate quotients (pressure-rate quotient = mean arterial pressure / heart rate). Intravenous bolus dose, when given, and diltiazem infusion rate and time necessary to achieve the target heart rate also were recorded. The lowest heart rate recorded within 24 hrs from the initiation of the infusion and the time necessary to achieve the lowest heart rate after beginning the infusion were recorded.

Measurements and Results

Of 171 patients studied, 97 (56%) were classified as responders. Multiple linear regression suggested that response could be predicted by age, pressure-rate quotients, baseline mean arterial pressure, and central nervous system failure. In the responders, a heart rate < 100 beats/min was achieved in an average of 2 hrs, at a mean diltiazem infusion of 13.3 mg/hr. The lowest rate reached by the responders in a 24-hr period averaged 86 beats/min and was achieved in 4.8 hrs with a mean infusion rate of 14.8 mg/hr. Both target and lowest rate values were statistically different from baseline heart rate.

Conclusion

Diltiazem was effective in achieving short-term control of heart rate in 56% of the patients, virtually without adverse effects, where beta-blockade was contraindicated or ineffective.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation in congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in the emergency department [^1169NLP5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute heart rate control for atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the emergency department (ED) is often achieved utilizing intravenous (IV) non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) or beta blockers (BB). For patients with concomitant heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the American Heart Association and other clinical groups note that CCB should be avoided due to their potential negative inotropic effects. However, minimal evidence exists to guide this current recommendation. The primary objective of this study was to compare the incidence of adverse effects in the HFrEF patient population whose AF with RVR was treated with IV diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED.

Methods

This single center, retrospective review included patients ≥ 18 years old with HFrEF who presented in AF with RVR and received IV diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED. The primary outcome was adverse effects of therapy defined as: 1) hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg requiring fluid bolus or vasopressors) or bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats/min) within 60 min of medication administration 2) worsening heart failure symptoms defined as increased oxygen requirements within four hours or inotropic support within 48 h. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of rate control failure, patient disposition, ED length of stay, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality.

Results

One hundred and twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria, with 57 receiving diltiazem and 68 receiving metoprolol. Overall adverse effects for diltiazem and metoprolol were similar (32% vs. 21%, P = 0.217). However, there was a significantly higher incidence of worsening heart failure symptoms within the diltiazem group (33% vs 15%, P = 0.019). Rate control failure at 60 min did not differ significantly between diltiazem and metoprolol (51% vs 62%, P = 0.277).

Conclusions

In HFrEF patients with AF, there was no difference in total adverse events in patients treated with IV diltiazem compared to metoprolol. However, the diltiazem group had a higher incidence of worsening CHF symptoms defined as increased oxygen requirement within four hours or initiation of inotropic support within 48 h.

3 | RESULTS

3.1 | Demographics and clinical characteristics

Between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022, a total of 29 patients underwent IV sotalol initiation and 20 patients underwent oral sotalol initiation. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics for both groups are reported in Table 1. The average age of the IV sotalol initiation group was 66.0 years and 27.6% were female. The primary indication for IV loading was 75.9% atrial arrhythmias and 24.1% ventricular arrhythmias. Average CrCl was 90.6 ml/min. LVEF ranged from 31% to 69% and average LVEF was 52.8%. For the oral sotalol initiation group, average age was 60.4 years and 65.0% were female. Primary indication for oral loading was 55.0% atrial arrhythmias and 45.0% ventricular arrhythmias. Average CrCl was 99.5 ml/min. LVEF ranged from 26% to 75% and average LVEF was 54.8%.

Almost all patients undergoing IV and oral sotalol initiation were on AV nodal blocking agents (96.6% and 95.0%, respectively) before presentation. The distribution of specific classes of agents is listed in Table 1. The total daily metoprolol milligram equivalent dose averaged 80 mg in the IV sotalol group and 76 mg in the oral sotalol group. The total daily diltiazem milligram equivalent dose averaged 135 mg in the IV sotalol group and 240 mg in the oral sotalol group. Only 6 of 29 patients (20.7%) in the IV sotalol group and 7 of 20 patients (35.0%) in the oral sotalol had these agents held or reduced immediately before sotalol initiation.

### What is the best agent for rate control of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response? [^11737sxq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common dysrhythmia associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although many patients have stable AF, some patients can present with a rapid ventricular response (RVR). In these patients, it is important to lower their heart rate. However, there are several options available for rate control in the emergency department setting.

Clinical Question

What is the most effective agent for rate control for the patient with AF in RVR?

Evidence Review

Studies retrieved included two prospective, randomized, double-blind studies and six retrospective cohort studies. These studies provide estimates of the efficacy and safety of calcium channel blockers and β-blockers for rate control in those with AF with RVR.

Conclusion

Based upon the available literature, diltiazem likely achieves rate control faster than metoprolol, though both agents seem safe and effective. Clinicians must consider the individual patient, clinical situation, and comorbidities when selecting a medication for rate control.

Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) — initial medical management is achieved with anti-impulse therapy using a combination of intravenous beta blockers and vasodilators to reduce both heart rate and blood pressure (BP) to decrease aortic wall stress, with small studies emphasizing reduction of heart rate to 60 to 80 bpm and systolic BP (SBP) to < 120 mm Hg. Intravenous beta blockers have been the mainstay of acute medical treatment, with reports emphasizing the importance of continuing this therapy at the time of hospital discharge to improve clinical outcomes; caution should be used in patients with contraindications to beta blockers (eg, acute AR, heart block, or bradycardia), and for intolerance to beta blockers, intravenous non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ie, verapamil or diltiazem) are typically used for initial treatment. Intravenous vasodilators are useful adjunctive therapy for intravenous beta blockers but should be avoided as initial treatment (before starting beta blockers or calcium channel blockers), given the potential for compensatory tachycardia. Pain related to AAS can trigger a rise in heart rate and BP, so treating pain can help control the patient's BP and heart rate; intravenous opiates are particularly efficacious, whereas intravenous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ketorolac may not be suitable because of the risk of inducing hypertension as well as adverse renal effects.

### The use of diltiazem for treating rapid atrial fibrillation in the out-of-hospital setting [^111VTWx5]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We sought to evaluate the use of intravenous diltiazem for treatment of rapid atrial fibrillation or flutter (RAF) in the out-of-hospital setting.

Methods

This study is a retrospective review of data with historical control subjects. Data were drawn from out-of-hospital patients reported to a statewide paramedic system who presented with atrial fibrillation or flutter and a ventricular response rate (VRR) of 150 beats/min or greater. The intervention (diltiazem) group included patients who received diltiazem during a 9-month period in 1999. The control group included patients from 1998 who did not receive diltiazem. Patients who were intubated or underwent cardioversion were omitted. Therapeutic response was defined as the occurrence of change to sinus rhythm, reduction of VRR to 100 beats/min or less, or reduction of baseline VRR by 20% or greater. Data were analyzed by using the chi(2) test, the Student's t test, and odds ratios (ORs). A Bonferroni adjusted P value of.005 was used to define statistical significance.

Results

Forty-three patients receiving diltiazem and 27 control subjects were included in the study. The mean total diltiazem dose was 19.8 mg (95% confidence interval 17.8 to 21.8). The diltiazem and control groups did not significantly differ with respect to age; sex; history of atrial fibrillation; prior use of digitalis, beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers; concurrent out-of-hospital therapies; or baseline VRR or systolic blood pressure (P = 0.09 to 1.00). The difference in VRR reduction between the diltiazem and control groups was 38 beats/min (95% confidence interval 24 to 52); this difference was statistically significant (P < .001). The mean percentage reduction of VRR in the diltiazem group was -33.1%. The difference in systolic blood pressure change between the diltiazem and control groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.17). The diltiazem group had a higher prevalence of achieving VRR reduction to 100 beats/min or less than did the control group (OR 22.6; P < .001), of achieving a VRR reduction of 20% or greater (OR 19.3; P < .001), and of achieving overall therapeutic response (OR 19.3; P < .001). Few changed to sinus rhythm in either group (estimated OR 6.3; P = 0.15). No patients in the diltiazem group required treatment for hypotension, endotracheal intubation, resuscitation from cardiac arrest, or emergency treatment of unstable dysrhythmias.

Conclusion

The effects of diltiazem on RAF can be appreciated within the constraints of the out-of-hospital environment. Diltiazem should be considered as a viable field therapy for rate control of RAF.

### Low-dose diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^1119RNHb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Diltiazem is one of the most commonly used medications to control the rapid ventricular response in atrial fibrillation (AF). The recommended starting dose is an intravenous bolus of 0.25 mg/kg over 2 minutes. To avoid hypotension, we have empirically used a lower dose of diltiazem. We compared the efficacy and safety of different doses of diltiazem in rapid AF.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was undertaken in patients who presented to the emergency department with rapid AF. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to diltiazem dosage: low dose (≤ 0.2 mg/kg), standard dose (> 0.2 and ≤ 0.3 mg/kg), and high dose (> 0.3 mg/kg). We compared the rates of therapeutic response (adequate rate control) and complications (such as hypotension). Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the effect of diltiazem dose on the occurrence of complications.

Results

A total of 180 patients were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in the rates of therapeutic response for the low-, standard-, and high-dose groups (70.5%, 77.1%, and 77.8%; P = 0.605). The rates of hypotension in the low-, standard-, and high-dose groups were 18%, 34.9%, and 41.7%, respectively. After adjusting confounding variables, the rate of hypotension was significantly lower in the low-dose group in comparison with the standard-dose group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.94).

Conclusions

Low-dose diltiazem might be as effective as the standard dose in controlling rapid AF and reduce the risk of hypotension.

### Achieving ventricular rate control in patients taking chronic β-blocker therapy [^113qz7fv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The objective of this study is to evaluate the difference in response to ventricular rate control with intravenous (IV) metoprolol compared to IV diltiazem in patients taking chronic beta-blocker therapy who present to the emergency department (ED) in atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR).

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of adult patients taking chronic oral metoprolol. Chronic metoprolol therapy was defined as patients prescribed and taking oral metoprolol within 5days of study inclusion. Rate control was defined as either a decrease in ventricular rate < 100bpm or < 120bpm if the decrease was at least 20% from the presenting heart rate.

Results

A total of 332 patients were included, with 16 patients in the IV diltiazem group and 316 patients in the IV metoprolol group. In the diltiazem arm, 68.8% of patients achieved successful rate control compared to 42.4% of patients in the metoprolol group (p = 0.067). Treatment with IV metoprolol resulted in more hospital admissions (58% vs. 6.25% with diltiazem, p < 0.001). Treatment with diltiazem was associated with a greater incidence of bradycardia compared to IV metoprolol (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.002).

Conclusions

The use of IV diltiazem was associated with a higher rate of successful response to rate control compared to IV metoprolol in patients in AF with RVR on chronic beta-blocker therapy, however the difference between groups was not statistically significant.

### The effect of serum calcium level on the success of diltiazem treatment: a retrospective cohort study [^112gzFeV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diltiazem is an antiarrhythmic drug widely used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). It reveals its effect by blocking L-type calcium channels. Thus, it inhibits the extracellular calcium influx into the cytosol. The relationship between serum calcium level and the efficacy of intravenous (IV) diltiazem used in the treatment of AFib with RVR has not been investigated in vivo. The aim of this study is to investigate the mentioned relationship.

Methods

This study was planned as a single-center retrospective study. The data of 349 patients who presented to the emergency department with AFib with RVR and treated with diltiazem were retrospectively analyzed. A patient was considered to have responded to diltiazem treatment if the existing heart rhythm returned to sinus rhythm, or the heart rate decreased below 100 beats/min, or the heart rate decreased > 20% provided that it was below 120 beats/min. The ionized calcium levels were recorded. The relationship between serum calcium level and the success of diltiazem treatment was examined.

Results

Fifty five percent of the patients were female. The median age was 75 years. The rate of response to diltiazem treatment was 67.3%. The median of ionized calcium levels in the group which responded to diltiazem treatment (n = 235) was 1.14 mmol/L (IQR: 0.12), and the group which did not respond to diltiazem treatment (n = 114) was 1.11 mmol/L (IQR: 0.12) (p = 0.322). The patients were divided into three groups as low, normal, and high calcium levels according to the calcium reference levels determined by the hospital laboratory. The rate of response to diltiazem treatment was 61.4% in patients with low ionized calcium levels, 76.1% in patients with normal ionized calcium levels, and 40.0% in patients with high ionized calcium levels. The rate of response to diltiazem treatment was higher in patients with normal ionized calcium levels compared to patients with low or high ionized calcium levels (p = 0.004, p = 0.003).

Conclusion

The success rate of diltiazem used in the treatment of AFib with RVR was highest in physiological calcium levels. The current study may provide the clinician with awareness about the consideration of serum ionized calcium levels when choosing drugs in patients with AFib with RVR.
