## Question

Low ferritin with normal iron levels

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage low ferritin with normal serum iron and hemoglobin, and what steps to take next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what low ferritin truly signifies in the absence of anemia. Then, I should verify how to interpret "normal" serum iron in this context. Next, I will review the diagnostic thresholds and the role of transferrin saturation and inflammation. After that, I need to consider the clinical significance of nonanemic iron deficiency and when to treat. Finally, I will outline a practical workup for underlying causes and a management plan, including when to use oral versus intravenous iron and how to monitor response.

> Let me first confirm the meaning of low ferritin with normal hemoglobin. Low ferritin is the most specific marker of depleted iron stores, and in the absence of inflammation, ferritin less than about 30 ng/mL indicates absolute iron deficiency even when hemoglobin is normal, because anemia is a late manifestation of iron deficiency and may not appear until stores are severely depleted [^111vsMJh] [^1121jFZx] [^1157g8j4].

> Wait, let me verify how to interpret "normal" serum iron here. Serum iron fluctuates with diurnal variation and is influenced by inflammation, so a normal serum iron does not exclude iron deficiency. It can be normal or even high in acute-phase responses despite low stores, which is why transferrin saturation and the inflammatory context are more informative than serum iron alone [^111vsMJh] [^114JLXDd] [^114JCsrn].

> I should confirm the diagnostic thresholds. In noninflamed adults, ferritin less than 30 ng/mL is highly specific for absolute iron deficiency, and a ferritin threshold of 45 ng/mL improves sensitivity for iron deficiency in patients with anemia. In inflammatory states, ferritin up to 100 ng/mL may still be consistent with iron deficiency, so I need to check CRP and interpret ferritin in that context [^116PBzzy] [^112knLuE] [^112L9fB4] [^114stzej].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical impact. Nonanemic iron deficiency is common and can cause fatigue, restless legs, impaired cognition, and reduced exercise capacity. Treating it improves symptoms and may prevent progression to anemia, so I should ask about these symptoms and consider treatment even if hemoglobin is normal [^111vsMJh] [^11189XPC].

> Next, I should review the likely causes and plan a targeted workup. I need to check for occult gastrointestinal blood loss, screen for celiac disease with tTG-IgA and total IgA, assess menstrual blood loss in women, and consider malabsorption or dietary insufficiency. In men and postmenopausal women with confirmed iron deficiency, bidirectional endoscopy is generally indicated to exclude malignancy, whereas in premenopausal women without alarming features, targeted evaluation is reasonable [^111vsMJh] [^115bHVQo] [^117GJGKa].

> I will now examine management options. For most patients without inflammation, oral iron is first-line. Ferrous sulfate 325 mg every other day improves absorption and tolerability compared with daily dosing, and I should continue for about 3 months after normalization of ferritin to replete stores, with hemoglobin checks at 2 to 4 weeks to confirm a reticulocyte response and rising hemoglobin if anemia was present or develops [^111vsMJh] [^115WmkBo].

> But wait, what if there is inflammation, malabsorption, or intolerance. In chronic inflammatory conditions such as CKD, heart failure, or IBD, or when oral iron is not tolerated or not absorbed, intravenous iron is preferred because it bypasses hepcidin-mediated blockade and can improve symptoms and functional outcomes; I should confirm iron deficiency with ferritin and TSAT in this context and use IV iron when indicated [^111vsMJh] [^1133mjD8] [^111CX2fR].

> I should double-check how to monitor response and avoid overtreatment. I will track hemoglobin, ferritin, and TSAT periodically; a hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within about 2 weeks strongly supports iron deficiency when initial studies were equivocal, and I should aim to restore ferritin to at least 50 ng/mL while avoiding sustained ferritin above roughly 200 ng/mL in the absence of inflammation to minimize oxidative risk, adjusting therapy accordingly [^115bHVQo] [^115PFf6Y].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure nothing is missed. Low ferritin with normal serum iron and hemoglobin indicates early absolute iron deficiency. Confirm with ferritin thresholds tailored to inflammatory status, assess for causes including GI blood loss and celiac disease, treat symptomatic patients or those at risk of progression, prefer oral iron in noninflamed patients and IV iron when inflammation or malabsorption is present, and monitor response with hemoglobin and iron indices to guide duration and safety [^111vsMJh] [^116PBzzy] [^112knLuE].

Low ferritin with normal iron and hemoglobin indicates **early iron deficiency** (iron deficiency without anemia) [^111vsMJh], where stores are depleted but hemoglobin remains normal because erythropoiesis is not yet impaired [^1121jFZx]. Ferritin is the most specific marker of iron stores [^114FbWUC]; a level **< 30 ng/mL** in the absence of inflammation strongly suggests iron deficiency [^116CTNtA]. Evaluate for causes such as occult gastrointestinal bleeding, malabsorption (celiac, bariatric), heavy menstruation, or inadequate intake [^111vsMJh], and consider treatment with oral iron if symptomatic or at risk [^111vsMJh]; monitor for progression to anemia and address the underlying cause [^114CUyEC].

---

## Pathophysiology of low ferritin with normal iron and hemoglobin

Iron deficiency progresses through **three stages**: stage 1 — iron depletion with reduced ferritin but normal iron and hemoglobin; stage 2 — iron-deficient erythropoiesis with low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, and normal hemoglobin; stage 3 — iron-deficiency anemia with low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, and low hemoglobin [^notfound]. Low ferritin with normal iron and hemoglobin corresponds to **stage 1**, reflecting depleted stores without impaired red cell production [^116vAmof].

---

## Clinical significance and symptoms

Although hemoglobin is normal, low ferritin can cause **significant symptoms and functional impairment** [^111vsMJh]:

- **Fatigue**: Common even without anemia [^notfound].
- **Cognitive effects**: Reduced concentration and memory [^notfound].
- **Exercise intolerance**: Decreased performance [^111vsMJh].
- **Restless legs**: Frequent in iron deficiency [^111vsMJh].
- **Hair loss**: Reported in nonanemic iron deficiency [^1117kdeH].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings

The diagnosis relies on **ferritin as the most specific marker** of iron stores [^114FbWUC]. In the absence of inflammation, ferritin **< 30 ng/mL** is highly specific for iron deficiency [^116CTNtA] [^114FbWUC]. Transferrin saturation **< 20%** indicates insufficient iron supply for erythropoiesis [^117DEawE]. Hemoglobin remains normal until iron deficiency becomes more severe [^1121jFZx].

---

## Common causes of low ferritin with normal iron and hemoglobin

Several factors can cause **iron deficiency without anemia**:

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Dietary | - Inadequate intake <br/> - Restrictive diets [^111vsMJh] |
| Gastrointestinal | - Occult bleeding (polyps, ulcers, malignancy) <br/> - Malabsorption (celiac, IBD, bariatric surgery) [^115WmkBo] |
| Gynecological | - Heavy menstrual bleeding <br/> - Pregnancy (increased demand) [^111vsMJh] |
| Chronic blood loss | - NSAID use <br/> - Hookworm infestation [^111vsMJh] |
| Physiological | - Growth spurts <br/> - Regular blood donation [^116vAmof] |

---

## Clinical implications and risks

Untreated low ferritin can lead to:

- **Progression to anemia**: Over time, hemoglobin will fall [^111vsMJh].
- **Impaired quality of life**: Fatigue and cognitive effects persist [^111vsMJh].
- **Worsening chronic disease**: Particularly in CKD, HF, and IBD [^111BGSMm].
- **Pregnancy complications**: Increased risk of adverse outcomes [^115LH3LE].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on correcting **iron deficiency** and addressing the cause:

- **Oral iron**: First-line therapy; ferrous sulfate 325 mg every other day improves absorption and tolerability [^111vsMJh] [^115WmkBo].
- **Intravenous iron**: For intolerance, malabsorption, or ongoing blood loss [^111vsMJh].
- **Address underlying causes**: Treat bleeding, malabsorption, or dietary insufficiency [^111vsMJh].
- **Monitor**: Recheck ferritin and hemoglobin to ensure repletion and detect progression [^115bHVQo] [^115WmkBo].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to ensure **iron repletion** and prevent recurrence. Recheck ferritin and hemoglobin in 4–8 weeks after starting therapy, then at 3–6 month intervals once repleted. Continue to identify and manage the underlying cause to prevent recurrence.

---

Low ferritin with normal iron and hemoglobin reflects **early iron deficiency** without anemia. It is clinically significant and warrants evaluation for causes and treatment to prevent progression and improve symptoms [^111vsMJh].

Definitions

3. We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

4. We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

5. We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia

The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO defined lower limits.

There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines in the UK for suspected lower GI cancer suggest that IDA with an Hb concentration < 110 g/L in men or < 100 g/L in non-menstruating women warrants fast-track referral. These cut-off values will however miss some cases of colorectal cancer, especially in men. It is therefore advised that investigation should be considered at any level of anaemia in the presence of iron deficiency, though the case is stronger in those with more severe degrees of anaemia, as they are more likely to have serious underlying GI pathology.

### Should serum transferrin saturation Be included as a therapeutic target in addition to serum ferritin in treating HFE-hemochromatosis? [^113Gvcb6]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In HFE-hemochromatosis, transferrin saturation (TSAT) indirectly reflects plasma non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which drives iron overload and tissue damage. TSAT above ~75% suggests harmful NTBI levels. Despite its clinical relevance, NTBI remains understudied due to the limitations of current assays. High TSAT levels persist during maintenance therapy, yet some guidelines omit TSAT monitoring, though it correlates with symptoms like fatigue and joint pain. Monitoring TSAT may improve outcomes. Randomized trials comparing ferritin-only versus ferritin-plus-TSAT-guided treatment are needed. Consideration should be given to approaches that minimize plasma NTBI in managing and monitoring patients with hemochromatosis. Until reliable NTBI testing has been established, TSAT should be included in the management of HFE-hemochromatosis.

### New concepts in the diagnosis and management approach to iron deficiency in candidates for metabolic surgery: should we change our practice? [^112bNqPw]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The near universal presence of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation among patients with severe obesity disrupts iron homeostasis and underlies the association between obesity and iron deficiency. Immune activation and inflammation result in a reduction in circulating iron and diminished iron bioavailability for erythropoiesis. Inflammation also alters blood levels of commonly measured markers of iron nutrition status, which makes the diagnosis of iron deficiency difficult and has led to new recommendations regarding laboratory markers for the diagnosis. Recent evidence using these newly recommended laboratory markers, which include levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin saturation, suggests that the actual prevalence of iron deficiency among candidates for metabolic surgery may be double or triple the prevalence identified by low levels of ferritin alone. Thus large numbers of surgical candidates have iron deficiency that has been heretofore largely unrecognized and inadequately treated. The assessment of iron status using the currently recommended markers in the presence of chronic inflammatory diseases and repletion of depleted stores for surgical candidates with deficiency during the preoperative period present an important opportunity for mitigating this condition in postoperative patients.

### Sex, lies, and iron deficiency: a call to change ferritin reference ranges [^115PFf6Y]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is a very common and treatable disorder. Of all the tests available to diagnose iron deficiency, the serum ferritin is the most able to discriminate iron deficiency from other disorders. However, the reference range for ferritin in many laboratories will lead to underdiagnosis of iron deficiency in women. Studies have shown that 30%-50% of healthy women will have no marrow iron stores, so basing ferritin cutoffs on the lowest 2.5% of sampled ferritins is not appropriate. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest the body physiologic ferritin "cutoff" is 50ng/mL. Work is needed to establish more realistic ferritin ranges to avoid underdiagnosing a readily treatable disorder.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to iron studies, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining other blood tests (such as transferrin saturation) if a false-normal ferritin is suspected.

### Avoid using hemoglobin to evaluate patients for iron… [^11238wtk]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron depletion is a progressive process with anemia as the final phase. Thus, screening for iron deficiency using hemoglobin will only identify the most severe cases. Moreover, hemoglobin is not specific for iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide. Prevalence of iron deficiency in U. S. women ages 12 to 49 years rose from 11% in 2003 to 14. 8% in
2010. Pregnant women and young children are also high-risk groups and must be evaluated. Iron deficiency in U. S. toddlers, without anemia, is estimated at 6. 6% to
15. 2%. Serum ferritin is a measure of iron stores and is the most sensitive biomarker to test for early stages of iron deficiency as well as iron deficiency anemia. Sensitivity of ferritin test is 89% for diagnosis of iron depletion compared with hemoglobin, which is only 26%.

Moreover, a ferritin cut off of ≤ 30 ng/mL provides 92% sensitivity and 98% specificity for iron deficiency anemia and is the best screening test for this disorder. Evaluating patients for iron deficiency with ferritin will identify early stage iron deficiency and will potentially result in iron therapy, preventing iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia has been long associated with psychomotor and cognitive abnormalities but even iron deficiency without anemia has been related to negative neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. Ferritin is an acute phase reactant, and occasionally in inflammatory conditions, ferritin levels may be normal or elevated even in the presence of iron deficiency.

Additional laboratory tests accompanying clinical correlation are also helpful to determine iron deficiency.

Interpretation of Laboratory Studies

To assess PCPs' choices for additional laboratory tests to be performed for evaluation of IDA, respondents were presented with a hypothetical scenario of a 65-year-old man reporting generalized fatigue who had a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0) and mean corpuscular volume of 72.3 fL (to convert to μm³, divide by 1.0). Measurement of ferritin level, the most specific marker of iron deficiency, was the most common laboratory test recommended by respondents (302 of 325 [92.9%]), followed by total iron-binding capacity and transferrin saturation (278 of 325 [85.5%]).

To assess PCPs' interpretation of iron laboratory studies, respondents were presented with a series of laboratory values and asked to determine whether the anemia resulted from iron deficiency or an alternate cause. For scenarios in which ferritin level and transferrin saturation were concordantly low or normal, respondents correctly identified the cause with more than 93% accuracy: 321 of 325 respondents (98.8%) correctly attributed anemia to iron deficiency in the presence of a low transferrin saturation (6%) and a low ferritin level (11 ng/mL), and 303 of 325 (93.2%) correctly attributed anemia to an alternate cause in the presence of a normal transferrin saturation (30%) and a normal ferritin level (150 ng/mL) (Figure 2). However, in scenarios of discordant ferritin and transferrin saturation values, diagnostic accuracy decreased. For example, in a scenario with a normal transferrin saturation (25%) but low ferritin level (6 ng/mL), 44 of 325 respondents (13.5%) misidentified the cause as something other than iron deficiency even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a ferritin level less than 15 ng/mL is 51.9. In a scenario with a low transferrin saturation (2%) but borderline low ferritin level (40 ng/mL), 86 of 325 respondents (26.5%) did not consider IDA as the cause even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a transferrin saturation less than 5% is 10.5. In that scenario, 239 of 325 respondents (73.5%) correctly identified the scenario as IDA. There were no statistically significant differences in correct interpretation of these scenarios by academic affiliation status, gender, stage in clinical practice, or practice of ordering ferritin level measurement for anemia evaluation.

### Molecular pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease [^116ir8de]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Most patients suffering from chronic infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, and some malignancies develop a mild to moderate anemia designated anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation. Patients with this anemia have low serum iron, low to normal transferrin, and high to normal serum ferritin concentration. The anemia is caused by increased inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, inducing increased production of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin by hepatocytes. Hepcidin blocks the release of iron from macrophages, hepatocytes, and enterocytes, causing the characteristic hypoferremia associated with this anemia and iron-deprivation of the developing erythrocytes.

### Assessing iron status: beyond serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [^116DvtSE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of multiple comorbidities among anemic patients with chronic kidney disease has made the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation more challenging in diagnosing iron deficiency. Because serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and because the inflammatory state may inhibit the mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial stores, the scenario of patients with serum ferritin > 800 ng/ml, suggesting iron overload, and transferrin saturation < 20%, suggesting iron deficiency, has become more common. This article revisits the basis for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations regarding the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in guiding iron therapy, then explores some of the newer alternative markers for iron status that may be useful when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are insufficient. These newer tests include reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, and soluble transferrin receptor, all of which have shown some promise in limited studies. Finally, the role of hepcidin, a hepatic polypeptide, in the pathophysiology of iron mobilization is reviewed briefly.

### Hemochromatosis classification: update and recommendations by the BIOIRON society [^112KTP8q]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

The current clinical scenario

Unlike in the past, fully expressed and potentially lethal HC (with liver cirrhosis, diabetes, endocrine dysfunction, and heart failure) is seen rarely in current clinical practice. This can be ascribed to increased awareness of the disease and, mostly, to the routine assessment of iron biomarkers, particularly serum ferritin. Unfortunately, this is counterbalanced by an increased diagnostic challenge for nonexperts in the iron field, primarily due to the lack of specificity of ferritin.

Ferritin is an essentially intracellular protein that serves to store iron safely. It is also present at very low concentrations (micrograms per liter) in serum, likely through secretion by macrophages. Normal values usually range from 30 to 200 µg/L or 300 µg/L in females and males, respectively. The function of secreted extracellular ferritin remains largely unknown. Several common conditions lead to increased serum ferritin levels, including virtually all inflammatory disorders, hepatic cytolysis (eg, during acute or chronic liver disease), or metabolic syndrome. This translates into a huge number of consultations, overuse of the "first-level" genetic test looking for the presence of the common variants in the HFE gene, and even misdiagnosis due to incorrect interpretation of the results.

The glycoprotein transferrin is the extracellular carrier of iron that is detectable at high concentrations in blood (grams per liter; the third most abundant protein after albumin). Transferrin saturation (TSAT) is calculated as the ratio between serum iron and transferrin (multiplied by the correction factor 1.42) or, less reliably, between serum iron and total iron-binding capacity and expressed as a percentage. TSAT is much less requested in clinical practice but is much more informative about a possible diagnosis of HC. Normal TSAT varies between 20% and 45%. It has been estimated that hyperferritinemia with normal TSAT is associated with increased iron stores in less than 10% of cases. Importantly, TSAT elevation is the hallmark of HC. In HC patients, high TSAT reflects the increased pool of circulating iron due to insufficient hepcidin production and typically precedes the rise of serum ferritin by several years.TSAT tends to remain elevated even in subjects effectively iron-depleted by phlebotomies. Occasional reports of normal TSAT in p. Cys282Tyr homozygotes with hyperferritinemia should always prompt the search for additional cofactors that raise ferritin, such as metabolic syndrome or alcohol intake.

### Ferritin outperforms other biomarkers in predicting bone marrow iron stores in patients with hematologic disorders [^114FbWUC]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, we show in the largest data set to date that ferritin is the best predictor for bone marrow iron stores in a real-life patient population. We studied the most common laboratory variables used for detecting IDA, that is, ferritin, TSAT, sTfR, transferrin, hemoglobin, and MCV, and compared those with bone marrow iron staining in > 6600 patients with hematologic disorders. In ROC analysis, ferritin had the highest AUC in all patient groups, which is congruent with previous studies. Previously, lower cutoffs of 12 to 15 μg/L have been used, but in patients with anemia, the 30 μg/L cutoff has been shown to have higher sensitivity but retain excellent specificity for iron deficiency. Our study has similar excellent specificities with the ferritin cutoff of 30 μg/L as previous studies, but the sensitivities in our study were significantly lower. A possible reason for this difference is that hematologic cancers and myeloproliferative disorders and their treatments can affect the diagnostic performance of ferritin. Nevertheless, we show that, even in this patient population, commonly used decision-making thresholds for ferritin in diagnosing iron deficiency are specific. Thus, a low ferritin predicts reliably reduced iron stores, regardless of the patient's diagnoses and older age. However, the clinician cannot rule out iron deficiency with reasonable certainty if ferritin levels are normal.

### The origin of ferritin reference intervals: a systematic review [^116CTNtA]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is a highly prevalent condition, which contributes to unnecessary morbidity, mortality, and health inequity. A serum ferritin concentration of less than 30 μg/L has a high specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency in adults, but the laboratory reported lower limit of normal (LLN) is typically lower. These LLNs might not be rooted in rigorous scientific evidence and might be contributing to structural underdiagnosis of iron deficiency. A systematic review was done per systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines with the use of medical literature databases from inception of each database to Nov 30, 2021, to identify studies that determined ferritin reference intervals in healthy adults and grey literature search for the five most common ferritin assays (registration number CRD42022268844). The objectives were to systematically summarise the ferritin reference intervals and to do a methodological quality assessment of the included studies. 2306 studies were screened and 61 full texts were included. 37 studies were eligible for analysis of the ferritin LLN in the general population. The population the sample was comprised of was a total of 21 882 females and 23 650 males participants. The ferritin LLN was a median of 8 μg/L (IQR 5–15) and mean of 9 μg/L (SD 11) in females and a median of 25 μg/L (IQR 16–44) and mean of 25 μg/L (SD 29) in males. 30 (49%) of 61 studies did not explicitly screen for patients at risk of iron deficiency, and 32 (52%) did not refer to a reference interval establishment guideline (eg, guideline recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute). The five most used commercial ferritin laboratory assays reported reference intervals with a median LLN of 11 (IQR 9–12) and mean of 9 μg/L (SD 4) for females and median of 22 (IQR 22–24) and mean of 23 μg/L (SD 4) for males. In the literature, serum ferritin reference intervals in healthy adults consistently report a LLN of less than 30 μg/L. Data driving these ferritin reference intervals are at high risk of bias, given no exclusion of individuals at risk for iron deficiency in the presumed normal population sample and no adherence to reference interval establishment standards. We suggest the use of evidence-based laboratory clinical decision limits to diagnose iron deficiency.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116PBzzy]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

### A comprehensive vision for intravenous iron therapy [^1133mjD8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Commonly used iron indices, such as serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT), have limited utility in patients with chronic kidney disease. Both dialysis and nondialysis patients may have normal to high serum ferritin levels and little or no iron available for erythropoiesis. Inflammation can result in increased serum ferritin level and low TSAT and restrict the ability to mobilize iron stores. Management of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease requires recognizing that not only decreased erythropoietin production, but also decreased iron availability, can lead to anemia. The Dialysis Patients' Response to IV Iron with Elevated Ferritin (DRIVE) trial showed the efficacy of intravenous (IV) iron in anemic hemodialysis patients with serum ferritin levels of 500 to 1,200 ng/mL and TSAT of 25% or less receiving adequate erythropoiesis-stimulating agent doses. Withholding iron from these patients resulted in worsening iron-restricted erythropoiesis. To improve anemia management in patients receiving hemodialysis and being treated with ESAs, clinicians should consider the benefits of IV iron.

### Iron deficiency anemia: guidelines from the American… [^115WmkBo]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In anemia, iron deficiency is best diagnosed using a ferritin threshold of less than 45 ng per mL.
- Patients with IDA should receive noninvasive testing for H. pylori and celiac disease.
- Bidirectional endoscopy is recommended in all adults with IDA. Diagnosing Iron Deficiency The AGA defines anemia as a hemoglobin level of less than 13 g per dL in men and less than 12 g per dL in patients who are not pregnant. Serum ferritin testing is commonly used to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with anemia. Based on a systematic review, the AGA recommends using a ferritin threshold value of less than 45 ng per mL for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. This threshold has 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for iron deficiency. Without anemia, the ferritin threshold for iron deficiency is uncertain.

Ferritin testing is less accurate in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, and additional tests including serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, and C-reactive protein can help diagnose iron deficiency. Celiac disease is another common cause of iron deficiency. The AGA suggests serologic testing for celiac disease in patients with iron deficiency, especially those with a family history of the disease, a personal history of autoimmune diseases, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Small bowel biopsy during endoscopy is recommended only if celiac serology is positive. Iron Supplementation Oral iron supplementation should be provided for most patients with iron deficiency. Oral iron formulations appear to be similarly effective and tolerated. Although 150 mg or more of daily elemental iron was previously recommended, studies show improved absorption and tolerability with lower dosing or every-other-day dosing.

The hemoglobin level should increase after one month of oral iron supplementation. Lack of hemoglobin change may be because of low adherence, malabsorption, or blood loss. Intravenous iron may be appropriate with malabsorption, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease, or ongoing blood loss. Editor's Note: Dr. Sonoda is the resident representative for AFP. These guidelines from the AGA add specific recommendations for the workup of IDA. The recommendation to diagnose iron deficiency with a ferritin cutoff of 45 ng per mL is consistent with a previous.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^113Sa7RP]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How is the choice of guideline-recommended cutoffs for ferritin associated with the incidence of iron deficiency diagnoses in primary care?

Findings

In this cohort study of 255 351 adult primary care patients, ferritin cutoffs of 15, 30, and 45 ng/mL were associated with incidences of iron deficiency diagnoses of 10.9, 29.9, and 48.3 cases per 1000 patient-years, respectively.

Meaning

The results of this study provide useful components for the evaluation of ferritin testing in high-resource primary care settings and call for harmonization of guidelines for iron deficiency.

Diagnosis of iron deficiency without anemia

Iron deficiency with relevant clinical symptoms can be present even before anemia develops as a long-term consequence. In such cases, early changes in the CBC, for example an increased RDW or an MCH close to the lower limit of normal, can represent early manifestations of iron deficiency. As described above, the reticulocyte count can be decreased even before erythrocyte indices are affected. Iron storage indices can also be interpreted in a similar way as in the diagnosis of IDA: in patients with IBD and no clinical, endoscopic or biochemical sign of active disease, a ferritin level below 15–30 μg/liter is diagnostic for iron deficiency. In the case of active disease, a ferritin level up to 100 μg/liter can still be consistent with iron deficiency. A TfS below 20% reflects a reduced availability of iron for erythropoiesis, either due to total iron deficiency or due to functional iron deficiency (e.g. in chronic inflammation or following treatment with erythropoietin). It was suggested that a TfS below 20% with a ferritin below 100 μg/liter defines total iron deficiency. A TfS below 20% and a ferritin above 100 μg/liter were defined as functional iron deficiency. In otherwise unclear cases, sTfR can also be useful.

### Cost-effectiveness of ferritin screening thresholds for iron deficiency in reproductive-age women [^115YZ59q]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the United States, the burden of ID is exacerbated by underdiagnosis and undertreatment due, in part, to inappropriately low reference intervals for serum ferritin — a biomarker of total body iron stores used to diagnose ID. These intervals, which place the lower limit of normal ferritin at 15 μg/L or less (in many cases, in the single‐digits), are built upon biased historic patient samples and flawed assumptions of a Gaussian distribution of disease that do not reflect the true prevalence of ID in the general population. This includes the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which recommend a ferritin threshold of 15 μg/L for ID diagnosis based upon expert opinion. Several prospective and cross‐sectional studies have clearly established that the true physiologic threshold for ID lies between serum ferritin values of 25–30 μg/L, or even as high as 50 μg/L. Clinically, the discrepancy between laboratory and WHO thresholds versus physiologically based ferritin cut‐offs leads to systematic underrecognition of ID and perpetuation of its untreated sequelae. In fact, recent work has shown that the numbers needed to screen (NNTS) for ID without anemia are 7 and 3, and for ID with anemia are 16 and 36 at ferritin values of < 15 and < 25 μg/L, respectively. Currently, no guidelines exist in the United States for the regular screening of ID in reproductive‐age women or standardization of ferritin reference ranges in accordance with best available evidence. We sought to fill this gap by conducting, to our knowledge, the first cost‐effectiveness analysis of screening ferritin thresholds for the treatment of ID in this patient population.

Lack of a Clinical Rationale for Distinguishing Between Absolute and Functional Iron Deficiency in HF

In the absence of a reliable threshold for serum hepcidin, the identification of functional iron deficiency in patients with HF is challenging. Increased levels of hepcidin prevent the egress of iron from maturing erythroblasts, thus preserving erythropoiesis. As a result, in contrast to patients with an absolute iron deficiency, patients typically have hypoferremia (ie, serum iron levels < 12–13 μg/L or a transferrin saturation [TSAT] < 20%), but with mild anemia or no anemia at all. Furthermore, because of the presence of a systemic inflammatory state in functional iron deficiency, the synthesis and secretion of ferritin by macrophages is enhanced. As a result, serum ferritin levels exceed those seen in absolute iron deficiency (< 15–20 μg/L), but in most patients with functional iron deficiency, serum ferritin levels remain in the normal range for healthy people (20–300 μg/L). Therefore, there exists no threshold value for serum ferritin level that identifies patients with a functional iron-deficiency state, and for many patients, the only clinically apparent indicator of the existence of functional iron deficiency is a meaningful therapeutic response to IV iron therapy.

The available evidence, taken together, suggests that patients with HF can experience either absolute or functional iron deficiency, and that the mechanisms for both likely coexist in the majority of iron-deficient patients.– Gastrointestinal iron loss or malabsorption may be compounded by hepcidin-mediated trapping of iron in reticuloendothelial stores. Serum hepcidin levels may decrease with the progression of HF and may be particularly suppressed in patients with acutely decompensated HF; on the contrary, worsening of kidney function over time may cause increases in serum hepcidin, and liver congestion has been hypothesized to promote hepcidin synthesis and prevent hepatocytes from releasing iron. Neurohormonal activation in HF may adversely influence the uptake of iron by cardiomyocytes. These highly dynamic changes suggest that the relative contributions of depleted iron stores and defective iron mobilization to the development of hypoferremia may fluctuate over time. Varying combinations of absolute and functional iron deficiency also appear to be a common occurrence in patients with chronic kidney or inflammatory bowel disease. –

In patients with inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, other laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein, transferrin saturation, or soluble transferrin receptor may be needed in conjunction with ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency anemia.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113PRqko]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis — serum ferritin interpretation and predictive thresholds include the following: in a study of individuals < 35 years of age, serum ferritin in the normal range in combination with a TS < 45% had a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload; in a California primary care population, a serum ferritin > 250 μg/L in men and > 200 μg/L in women was positive in 77% and 56% of C282Y homozygotes; and in the HEIRS screening study of 99,711 North American participants, serum ferritin levels were elevated (> 300 μg/L in men, > 200 μg/L in women) in 57% of female and 88% of male C282Y homozygotes. Ferritin can be elevated in the absence of increased iron stores, and in the general population, iron overload is not the most common cause of an elevated ferritin level; in most circumstances, serum ferritin provides additional confirmation of the significance of an elevated TS in C282Y homozygotes, and an elevated ferritin with a normal TS may occur particularly in non–HFE-related iron overload or in a C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^115LH3LE]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half the cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major and global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0–5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia — notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to the search for and treatment of the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but the most recent intravenous iron formulations, which have been available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively. Hepcidin has a key role in iron homoeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia, and outstanding research questions for treatment.

### Reticulocyte hemoglobin content: a new frontier in iron deficiency diagnostics for major surgical patients [^117Uffh4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies assessed the efficiency of Ret-He in diagnosing ID. The suggested cutoff values for Ret-He range from 25.7 pg with an AUC of 0.931 (71.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity), 28.5 pg with an AUC of 0.902 (68% sensitivity and 90% specificity), 32.4 pg with an AUC of 0.753 (72.5% sensitivity and 70% specificity), to 35.5 pg with an AUC of 0.881 (100% sensitivity and 55.6% specificity). This variability is likely due to the use of different ferritin thresholds to diagnose ID. A higher ferritin cutoff might lead to capturing more mild cases of ID, which can cause the Ret-He cutoff to shift to maintain a balance between correctly identifying iron deficiency (sensitivity) and avoiding false positives (specificity).

Three hundred seventy patients had anemia but no ID according to the definition we used in this study. Of these, 131 patients had Ret-He levels below 33.5 pg. The combination of low transferrin saturation, high ferritin, normal transferrin receptor levels, and elevated CRP in these patients suggests anemia of chronic disease rather than classic IDA. Anemia of chronic disease is common in conditions characterized by chronic inflammation, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, or malignancies, where iron metabolism is disrupted due to the inflammatory response. In these cases, iron becomes sequestered in storage sites, leading to reduced availability for red blood cell production, despite overall iron stores being sufficient or even elevated. The normal MCV and MCH further support the diagnosis of anemia of chronic disease. Additionally, there may be some degree of functional ID, where iron is present but not readily available for use by the bone marrow. This may explain the low Ret-He and transferrin saturation, despite adequate or elevated ferritin levels.

### Anemia of inflammation [^117Bn4Sx]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI, also called anemia of chronic disease) is a common, typically normocytic, normochromic anemia that is caused by an underlying inflammatory disease. It is diagnosed when serum iron concentrations are low despite adequate iron stores, as evidenced by serum ferritin that is not low. In the setting of inflammation, it may be difficult to differentiate AI from iron deficiency anemia, and the 2 conditions may coexist. Treatment should focus on the underlying disease. Recent advances in molecular understanding of AI are stimulating the development of new pathophysiologically targeted experimental therapies.

### Best but not perfect: indirect measure of low iron stores [^1145jGej]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The other biomarkers studied by the authors demonstrated inferior diagnostic performance compared to ferritin except for transferrin in females. Multivariate logistic regression models including these biomarkers did not improve the prediction of low or absent bone marrow iron stores over ferritin alone.

The clinical implications of the current study are important. The high specificity of ferritin at the 30 μg/L cutoff suggests that it can be a reliable marker for ruling in low or absent iron stores in patients with a high pretest probability of the condition. However, the low sensitivity indicates that clinicians should be cautious in ruling out low or absent iron stores based solely on ferritin levels, particularly in patients with conditions that can elevate ferritin, such as inflammation or liver disease. In such cases, additional diagnostic tests or clinical judgment may be necessary to accurately diagnose low or absent iron stores. We cannot emphasize too strongly that bone marrow aspirate with iron staining is often necessary, as the finding of absent iron necessitates an evaluation that may uncover a gastrointestinal or genitourinary malignance at an early, curable stage.

The reliability of the bone marrow iron determination depends on the adequacy of the specimen including the presence of spicules in the aspirate, and it would have been good to have specific comments about these factors in this study. In addition, it would have been good to provide their analysis based on the classical definition of iron deficiency, which is absence of stainable iron in an adequate bone marrow aspirate. The retrospective design and single institution character of the study are offset by the very impressive sample size.

In conclusion, this study reinforces the importance of ferritin as the primary biomarker for diagnosing iron deficiency, while also highlighting its limitations in terms of sensitivity. Clinicians should consider these findings when interpreting laboratory measures of iron status, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions. Importantly, the presence of a normal or elevated serum ferritin does not negate the potential need for a bone marrow aspirate to assess potential metabolic or malignant conditions that may present with iron deficiency.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^1117kdeH]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency is a common condition and a leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide, mainly due to subsequent anemia. A depletion of iron stores that does not yet result in anemia, simply referred to as nonanemic iron deficiency, has recently gained attention as a distinct clinical entity. Associated with various symptoms, including fatigue, restless legs syndrome, and hair loss, nonanemic iron deficiency has been estimated to be more common than anemic iron deficiency.

Measurement of (serum) ferritin is considered the mainstay of iron deficiency diagnosis, and ferritin is a commonly requested laboratory test in various high-resource primary care settings. In particular, a Swiss study revealed that 27% of the population received serum ferritin testing in 2018, and ferritin ranked among the most frequently ordered laboratory tests in Swiss primary care between 2009 and 2018. At the same time, iron deficiency guidelines are conflicting as to which populations benefit most from ferritin testing. For example, the US Preventive Services Task Force specifically mentions children and pregnant womenbut makes no recommendation for the general population. A prominent Swiss primary care guideline discourages iron deficiency screening in the general population, with exceptions for conditions that require special consideration due to increased risk, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or when evidence suggests a benefit from replete iron stores, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Practical recommendations on the screening and diagnosis of iron deficiency in patients with heart failure

The current 2016 ESC HF guidelines 1 recommend that evaluation of iron status should be considered in the diagnostic work‐up of all newly diagnosed HF patients (class of recommendation I, level of evidence C). A practical recommendation of the working group is that iron status should also be evaluated in patients with existing CHF, particularly if they are symptomatic despite receiving optimal background HF medications. In addition, as part of routine follow‐up, consideration should be given to the re‐evaluation of iron status 1–2 times per year, as well as after hospitalization for HF.

Ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) are widely available blood markers for evaluating iron status. Their use for the diagnosis of iron deficiency is recommended by the 2016 ESC HF guidelines. 1 Ferritin is an intracellular iron‐storage protein secreted by iron‐storing tissues (e.g. liver and reticuloendothelial system). Serum ferritin concentrations are a surrogate marker of stored iron quantity. 9 TSAT (defined as % of transferrin that has iron bound to it) is used as a marker of the availability of circulating iron to supply metabolizing cells. 9 TSAT value is calculated by dividing the serum iron concentration by the total iron‐binding capacity (TIBC):

The 2016 ESC HF guidelines recommend treating iron deficiency based on a serum ferritin level < 100 µg/L, or 100–299 µg/L when TSAT < 20%. Two different cut‐offs are used because ferritin levels may become elevated in the presence of inflammation and may, therefore, appear to be within the normal range (100–300 µg/L). As ferritin, an acute‐phase protein, is elevated as a result of inflammation, TSAT levels < 20% indicate that insufficient circulating iron is available to supply metabolizing cells (functional iron deficiency). 9 Therefore, in accordance with the 2016 ESC HF guidelines, it is important to ensure that both ferritin and TSAT testing is performed simultaneously and evaluated together when assessing iron status (Figure 1). Lower ferritin cut‐offs (e.g. < 30 µg/L) may be used to confirm the presence of iron deficiency in other disease settings and are often displayed on laboratory test results as the lower limit of normal. However, the thresholds defined above are recommended to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with CHF.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — iron studies for diagnostic evaluation: Transferrin saturation (TS) is the preferred initial screening test, and fasting is not required to accurately determine TS. A TS of greater than 45% identifies 97.9%–100% of C282Y homozygotes, although a small proportion of patients with HH such as young individuals at an earlier stage may have TS of < 45%. Serum ferritin (SF) is an excellent predictor of advanced fibrosis; in C282Y homozygotes, a SF of > 1,000 ng/mL, in combination with elevated aminotransferase levels and/or low platelet count, predicts cirrhosis in more than 80% of patients. A normal SF, defined as less than 200 ng/mL in premenopausal women or 300 ng/mL in men and postmenopausal women, in combination with a TS of < 45%, has a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload. A unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) below 26 μmol/L has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 50% for detecting C282Y homozygosity.

### Guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of functional iron deficiency [^116RmEyQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation for functional iron deficiency, BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend to measure serum ferritin levels in the assessment and management of patients with all forms of iron-restricted erythropoiesis, including functional iron deficiency. View values < 12 mcg/L indicative for absent iron stores.
Do not exclude the possibility of functional iron deficiency in case of values as high as 1,200 mcg/L in patients with CKD, and recognize that some such patients may respond to IV iron therapy. View a serum ferritin concentration of < 100 mcg/L in non-dialysis patients or < 200 mcg/L in chronic hemodialysis patients as predictive of iron deficiency and potentially good response to IV iron therapy.
Do not use values above the suggested cut-offs to guide iron therapy. Use serum ferritin values > 1,200 mcg/L to ascertain obtaining evaluation for potential iron overload.

### Importance of ferritin for optimizing anemia therapy in chronic kidney disease [^113SAR2s]. American Journal of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of serum ferritin in monitoring the iron status of patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) has become suspected. In this review, we reassess the interpretation of high serum ferritin values in such patients, with the goal of treating their anemia in a safe way. From the observations that (1) H-ferritin gene transcription is predominantly active in inflammatory conditions, whereas L-ferritin is induced only after exposure to very high iron concentrations and is preferentially secreted to plasma from hepatocytes; (2) the expression of both types of ferritin proteins are exclusively dependent on intracellular free iron, which is often sequestered by LPS or cytokines in several cell types, and (3) splenic iron is depleted and serum ferritin does not increase in the combined conditions of both inflammation and iron deficiency, it is deduced that elevated serum ferritin levels are caused by the accumulation of intracellular iron, especially reticuloendothelial cells or macrophages, hepatocytes, and other cells, while cytokines or inflammation might modulate the relative ratio of ferritin to body iron storage. Therefore, high levels of serum ferritin in patients on MHD can be used to indicate iron deposition in most cells, including vascular and immunocompetent cells, and is still a reliable indicator of the need to withhold iron administration.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115iRmFf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

ID anemia in IBD patients

Low serum ferritin levels (< 30 µg/L), high transferrin levels and a decreased MCV index are routinely used to screen for ID. In IBD-patients, these parameters may not always allow for reliable conclusions, because of overlapping causes of anemia and multiple confounding factors (see above). In particular, active inflammation can result in falsely normal or elevated ferritin levels as part of an acute-phase reaction. Under chronic inflammatory conditions, other parameters of low iron stores are also less interpretable, as a result of changes such as increased platelet counts or low transferrin levels. In these cases, it is important to consider that serum ferritin levels up to 100 µg/L do not adequately exclude ID. Therefore, the concentration of sTfR may indicate the status of iron supply more precisely, since this parameter is not influenced by chronic inflammation. Recently, the ratio of sTfR to the logarithm of serum ferritin (sTfR/log ferritin index) has been reported as providing more accuracy in differentiating ID anemia from ACD. For example, a prospective multicenter observational trial in a cohort of 145 non-IBD patients with anemia demonstrated the utility of the sTfR/log ferritin index. Skikne et al demonstrated that subjects with ID anemia or ACD + ID anemia had significantly higher sTfR and sTfR/log ferritin index values than subjects with ACD. ROC curves produced cutoffs of 21 nmol/L for sTfR and 14 (using nmol/L) for the sTfR/log ferritin index. The sTfR/log ferritin index was superior to sTfR.

ACD in IBD patients

Functional ID is a state in which there is insufficient iron incorporation during erythropoiesis, despite normal total body iron stores, and it is a major component of ACD. Therefore, besides "true" ID anemia, functional ID should be considered if serum ferritin is > 100 µg/L and TfS below 20%. Again, sTfR/log ferritin may help discriminate absolute from functional ID anemia. In patients with evidence of inflammation and intermediate serum ferritin levels (< 100 µg/L but > 30 µg/L), a value of sTfR/log ferritin > 2 may indicate a combined anemic status, whereas a ratio < 2 is consistent with normal total body iron stores.

### Critical re-evaluation of the identification of iron deficiency States and effective iron repletion strategies in patients with chronic heart failure [^111Ws2Lt]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

According to current guidelines, iron deficiency is defined by a serum ferritin level < 100ng/ml or a transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20% if the serum ferritin level is 100–299μg/L. These criteria were developed to encourage the use of intravenous iron as an adjunct to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the treatment of renal anaemia. However, in patients with heart failure, these criteria are not supported by any pathophysiological or clinical evidence that they identify an absolute or functional iron deficiency state. A low baseline TSAT-but not serum ferritin level-appears to be a reliable indicator of the effect of intravenous iron to reduce major heart failure events. In randomized controlled trials, intravenous iron decreased the risk of cardiovascular death or total heart failure hospitalization in patients with a TSAT < 20% (risk ratio 0.67 [0.49–0.92]) but not in patients with a TSAT ≥ 20% (risk ratio 0.99 [0.74–1.30]), with the magnitude of the risk reduction being proportional to the severity of hypoferraemia. Patients who were enrolled in clinical trials solely because they had a serum ferritin level < 100μg/L showed no significant benefit on heart failure outcomes, and it is noteworthy that serum ferritin levels of 20–300μg/L lie entirely within the range of normal values for healthy adults. Current guidelines reflect the eligibility criteria of clinical trials, which inadvertently adopted unvalidated criteria to define iron deficiency. Reliance on these guidelines would lead to the treatment of many patients who are not iron deficient (serum ferritin level < 100μg/L but normal TSAT) and ignores the possibility of iron deficiency in patients with a low TSAT but with serum ferritin level of > 300μg/L. Importantly, analyses of benefit based on trial eligibility-driven guidelines substantially underestimate the magnitude of heart-failure-event risk reduction with intravenous iron in patients who are truly iron deficient. Based on all available data, we recommend a new mechanism-based and trial-tested approach that reflects the totality of evidence more faithfully than the historical process adopted by clinical investigators and by the guidelines. Until additional evidence is forthcoming, an iron deficiency state in patients with heart failure should be defined by a TSAT < 20% (as long as the serum ferritin level is < 400μg/L), and furthermore, the use of a serum ferritin level < 100μg/L alone as a diagnostic criterion should be discarded.

### Intravenous iron for heart failure, iron deficiency definitions, and clinical response: the IRONMAN trial [^117HouZm]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) who are thought to have iron deficiency, intravenous (i.v.) administration of iron increases haemoglobin, improves symptoms, reduces hospitalizations for heart failure, and might also reduce cardiovascular mortality. However, uncertainty exists about which blood markers best reflect iron deficiency and the response to i.v. iron. Administration of i.v. iron to patients who are not iron deficient may not be effective, which will dilute the benefit observed in clinical trials leading to underestimation of benefit and, potentially, a neutral outcome.

Unfortunately, there is no generally agreed definition of iron deficiency. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as a serum ferritin < 15 µg/L or, in the presence of inflammatory disease, < 70 µg/L. Although many patients with heart failure do have activation of inflammatory pathways, this is usually low-grade. Many clinical laboratories define a low serum ferritin as ≤ 30 µg/L. There is greater consensus for transferrin saturation (TSAT), with values < 20% generally accepted as evidence of iron deficiency. Serum concentrations of iron, or soluble transferrin receptors, might be better markers of iron deficiency, but neither has been measured routinely in substantial randomized trials of i.v. iron.

Most trials of i.v. iron for heart failure have adopted criteria for iron deficiency similar to those for the FAIR-HF trial, namely a serum ferritin < 100 µg/L regardless of TSAT or 100–299 µg/L if TSAT is < 20%. The basis for this definition is unclear. For patients with heart failure, a low serum ferritin appears inferior to a low TSAT as a marker of low iron stores or defective iron utilization in bone marrow. Also, for patients with chronic cardiovascular disease, a serum ferritin ≤ 30 µg/L is associated with a good prognosis, but a low TSAT with worse outcomes. The reasons for this paradox are uncertain. Low serum ferritin might reflect better cell health and membrane integrity, due to an absence of inflammation or other stressors, preventing leakage of ferritin rather than indicating iron deficiency, whereas a low TSAT may indicate low iron availability, regardless of whether this is due to absolute iron deficiency or sequestration in the reticulo-endothelial system.

### Best but not perfect: indirect measure of low iron stores [^115WFgXM]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Although making the correct diagnosis of iron deficiency is critical for patient care, the use of indirect markers obtained through routine phlebotomy presents a challenge. Low serum iron, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and MCV are characteristic of iron deficiency but can also result from inflammation. In addition, hemoglobin and MCV may be low due to genetic causes and, in the case of hemoglobin, to diurnal variation rather than iron deficiency. Transferrin concentrations tend to increase with iron deficiency and decrease with inflammation, whereas transferrin receptor levels rise with both iron deficiency and inflammation. Serum ferritin is an attractive marker because a very low level (< 10 μg/L) is diagnostic of iron deficiency as documented by absent stainable iron in a bone marrow aspirate. However, serum ferritin can be normal or even elevated when iron deficiency is documented by absent bone marrow stainable iron. A recent Cochrane review of 512 adults presenting for medical care at various institutions found that a serum ferritin < 30 μg/L had 98% specificity and 79% sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency as documented by absent bone marrow iron.

Lahtiharju et al make a remarkable contribution by evaluating the relationship of indirect measures of iron status to bone marrow iron stain in 6610 patients and providing evidence that ferritin is the most reliable single biomarker for predicting reduced iron stores. This finding is consistent with studies dated decades ago that established ferritin as a key standalone indicator of iron status. This study also underscores the limitations of ferritin, particularly its low sensitivity. Using a ferritin cutoff of 30 μg/L, the specificity rates were impressively high at 97% for females and 99% for males, but the sensitivity rates were only 54% and 35%, respectively. This indicates that while a ferritin of 30 μg/L or lower is highly specific for low or absent bone marrow iron, it is not sensitive enough to detect all cases of low iron stores, especially in patients with comorbid conditions that can increase ferritin levels. It is important to recognize that in this study, there were females with serum ferritin > 1750 μg/L and males with serum ferritin > 4967 μg/L who had low or absent bone marrow iron stores.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^1128644A]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

1.9 Expert recommendation

There is little focus in the guidelines on how iron deficiency in the absence of anemia should be diagnosed in relation to the underlying chronic disease. Thus, it is of little surprise that physicians may not prioritize iron deficiency treatment. We wish to propose, based on the literature available, the following consensus laboratory test cut‐off values in patients with CHF, CKD or IBD:

Serum ferritin < 100 µg L⁻¹ or TSAT < 20%

If serum ferritin is between 100 and 300 µg L⁻¹, a TSAT test will be required to confirm iron deficiency

Furthermore, we also propose the following algorithms for the diagnostic workup of iron deficiency in patients with CHF, CKD, and IBD (Figures 2, 3, 4). In all conditions, initial workup should incorporate assessment of serum ferritin and TSAT, as well as Hb levels, in order to distinguish between those with normal hematological parameters, those with some form of iron deficiency (iron deficiency: normal Hb and low iron; or iron deficiency anemia: low Hb and low iron), and those with some other form of anemia (where iron levels are normal but Hb is low). In CKD, we must also consider whether the patient is receiving dialysis (Figure 3 A, B). Finally, in IBD, we must further consider whether the underlying condition is in remission or active. For IBD, we therefore also recommend measuring CRP levels or stool markers such as calprotectin or lactoferrin at the time of iron markers and hematological workup, in order to appropriately manage iron deficiency in relation to these results. We recommend a CRP threshold of 5 mg L⁻¹ to determine the IBD disease activity. Although laboratory markers are usually sufficient with clinical disease activity markers, other indicators of intestinal inflammation, such as transabdominal ultrasound or endoscopy, may also be used to supplement these assessments.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^117M8gX9]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The optimal ferritin cutoffs for the diagnosis of iron deficiency, especially nonanemic iron deficiency, are controversial. Different guidelines suggest widely varying cutoffs ranging from 12 to 15 ng/mL through 25 to 30 ng/mL to 45 to 50 ng/mL in the general population (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). The choice of the ferritin cutoff may have important implications. On the one hand, choosing too low a cutoff could result in withholding therapy from patients affected by the negative health consequences of iron deficiency. On the other hand, choosing too high a cutoff could lead to overtreatment of patients who do not benefit from iron therapy, with potential harm from adverse effects (especially with oral preparations) and an unjustified waste of health care resources.

Although previous studies have estimated incidences of anemic iron deficiency in primary care, they have not evaluated the choice of different ferritin cutoffs, and the incidence of nonanemic iron deficiency has not been investigated. However, appropriate data would be essential for a comprehensive evaluation of ferritin testing in primary care. Furthermore, little is known about the factors associated with ferritin testing. Our study aims to fill these gaps by estimating how the incidence of diagnoses of nonanemic and anemic iron deficiency depends on the choice of ferritin cutoff and by examining the determinants of ferritin testing in Swiss primary care.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^11189XPC]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in chronic conditions

Until very recently, iron deficiency (ID) was considered only in the context of iron‐deficiency anemia. It is only in the last 10–15 years that ID has been considered as an autonomous pathological entity in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs. Therefore, early ID detection and treatment became important goals, as iron is essential for the functioning of all organs. The fact that the biological definition of ID is debated and inconsistently defined by authors in different studies has probably contributed to preventing the recognition of ID as an independent condition. An international multidisciplinary group of experts recently proposed a more comprehensive definition of ID: "Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia". This definition is important because it indicates that ID may have specific symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment, even in the absence of anemia. Furthermore, as detailed in the next section, ID is associated with poor prognosis in many diseases, thus highlighting the importance of its diagnosis.

Depending on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, two types of ID can be distinguished, with identical clinical symptoms: absolute ID, which is the consequence of a quantitative decrease in iron stores, and functional ID, which is due to the sequestration of iron in otherwise quantitatively normal or abundant stores. These two types of ID are not mutually exclusive and are often associated. Understanding their underlying mechanisms is essential for the development of rational diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.

In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects stored iron, and transferrin saturation (TSAT), which is indicative of transported iron. TSAT is always present; thus, the decrease of TSAT is an essential diagnostic criterion of absolute or functional ID. Since the reliability of serum ferritin measurement may be compromised in patients with chronic diseases or any inflammatory condition, there is a large consensus in guidelines to determine both serum ferritin and TSAT in the first line. There is still no consensus on the thresholds, but recent recommendations of international guidelines have shown agreement for defining ID by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or TSAT < 20%.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### Guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia [^117GJGKa]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) occurs in 2–5% of adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world and is a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss from colonic cancer or gastric cancer, and malabsorption in coeliac disease are the most important causes that need to be sought. DEFINING IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA: The lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test should be used to define anaemia (B). Any level of anaemia should be investigated in the presence of iron deficiency (B). The lower the haemoglobin the more likely there is to be serious underlying pathology and the more urgent is the need for investigation (B). Red cell indices provide a sensitive indication of iron deficiency in the absence of chronic disease or haemoglobinopathy (A). Haemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended when microcytosis and hypochromia are present in patients of appropriate ethnic background to prevent unnecessary GI investigation (C). Serum ferritin is the most powerful test for iron deficiency (A).

Investigations

Upper and lower GI investigations should be considered in all postmenopausal female and all male patients where IDA has been confirmed unless there is a history of significant overt non-GI blood loss (A). All patients should be screened for coeliac disease (B). If oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is performed as the initial GI investigation, only the presence of advanced gastric cancer or coeliac disease should deter lower GI investigation (B). In patients aged > 50 or with marked anaemia or a significant family history of colorectal carcinoma, lower GI investigation should still be considered even if coeliac disease is found (B). Colonoscopy has advantages over CT colography for investigation of the lower GI tract in IDA, but either is acceptable (B). Either is preferable to barium enema, which is useful if they are not available. Further direct visualisation of the small bowel is not necessary unless there are symptoms suggestive of small bowel disease, or if the haemoglobin cannot be restored or maintained with iron therapy (B). In patients with recurrent IDA and normal OGD and colonoscopy results, Helicobacter pylori should be eradicated if present. (C). Faecal occult blood testing is of no benefit in the investigation of IDA (B). All premenopausal women with IDA should be screened for coeliac disease, but other upper and lower GI investigation should be reserved for those aged 50 years or older, those with symptoms suggesting gastrointestinal disease, and those with a strong family history of colorectal cancer (B). Upper and lower GI investigation of IDA in post-gastrectomy patients is recommended in those over 50 years of age (B). In patients with iron deficiency without anaemia, endoscopic investigation rarely detects malignancy. Such investigation should be considered in patients aged > 50 after discussing the risk and potential benefit with them (C). Only postmenopausal women and men aged > 50 years should have GI investigation of iron deficiency without anaemia (C). Rectal examination is seldom contributory, and, in the absence of symptoms such as rectal bleeding and tenesmus, may be postponed until colonoscopy. Urine testing for blood is important in the examination of patients with IDA (B).

Management

All patients should have iron supplementation both to correct anaemia and replenish body stores (B). Parenteral iron can be used when oral preparations are not tolerated (C). Blood transfusions should be reserved for patients with or at risk of cardiovascular instability due to the degree of their anaemia (C).

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L⁻¹ or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87? Moreover, no standard CRP cut‐off values are provided; although a CRP level of 5 mg L⁻¹ is the most common threshold, 64 this is not recognized in most guidelines 68

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^112c7tiS]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

To evaluate gastrointestinal bleeding, we usually refer for colonoscopy and/or EGD. We frequently recommend FOBT, recognizing that FOBT alone is insufficient for excluding gastrointestinal bleeding, with a sensitivity of 58% at detecting the source of IDA.FOBT is more appropriate for colorectal cancer screening in asymptomatic people without anemia. We refer for endoscopic evaluation irrespective of FOBT when IDA is suspected unless another etiology for IDA is established. In frail older adults, the decision to perform an endoscopy is often case-by-case with consideration for the person's life expectancy. It should be a shared decision with the patient and caregiver; a positive FOBT suggests a higher yield from endoscopy.

Patients with IDA may present with microcytic or normocytic hypochromic RBCs. Nearly 70% of older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) with IDA present with normal MCV. Laboratory evaluation includes obtaining a CBC, reticulocyte count, serum iron level, TIBC (represents the ability to bind iron to transferrin), TSAT (ratio of serum iron to TIBC), and ferritin (reflects iron stores). Individuals with iron deficiency typically have low serum iron, low TSAT, low ferritin, and high TIBC. Timing and fasted state should be considered when iron studies are collected. A TSAT of < 20% suggests that the iron supply is not adequate for RBC production and a very low TSAT of < 15% is consistent with iron deficiency. Compared with lower ferritin cutoffs, a ferritin level of < 50 ng/mL is suspicious for iron deficiency in older adults because this is a more reliable predicter of iron deficiency in older populations. Intermediate ferritin levels (the range from 30 to 100 ng/mL) pose difficulties, particularly in older adults with chronic diseases. Ferritin levels increase with age and patients with conditions such as chronic heart failure or inflammatory disorders may experience absolute iron deficiency even at ferritin levels of up to 100 μg/L and as high as 300 μg/L if the TSAT is < 20%.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm3 (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### Significance of low ferritin without anaemia in screen-detected, adult coeliac disease patients [^116vAmof]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Reduced iron stores without anaemia — characterised by low ferritin and normal haemoglobin levels — are known to be common in growing children, menstruating and pregnant women and regular blood donors. However, the exact definition of low ferritin and its clinical significance without anaemia has been under intense debate. Recently, it has been suggested that this entity may be associated with unspecific symptoms such as fatigue and poorer quality of life. However, many of these studies have been conducted in selected — by definition symptomatic — patient groups, for example, in those with restless leg syndrome, chronic heart failure, fibromyalgia syndrome or hypothyroidism, and population‐based studies are rare. More data about the significance of ferritin levels in other chronic conditions and in apparently asymptomatic individuals are needed.

Coeliac disease is a chronic, immune‐mediated condition where dietary gluten induces small‐bowel mucosal damage and systemic consequences in genetically susceptible individuals. Patients may suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms but also from extraintestinal manifestations, including iron deficiency and anaemia. Some patients are asymptomatic and present only with laboratory abnormalities. Anaemia in coeliac disease seems to be associated with more severe clinical features compared to nonanaemic patients or those presenting with diarrhoea, but the prevalence and significance of iron deficiency without anaemia have rarely been studied. Usually, initiation of a strict gluten‐free diet (GFD) results in improved haemoglobin levels parallel with alleviation of small‐bowel mucosal damage, but the response of ferritin levels to the dietary treatment, particularly in patients with initially normal haemoglobin, is less clear.

In this prospective study, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of low ferritin without anaemia defined by different thresholds in adult screen‐detected coeliac disease patients. Additionally, we studied possible associations between ferritin levels and comprehensive clinical, histopathological and laboratory characteristics as well as the changes in ferritin levels on a GFD.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111LvPzd]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

When adequate iron status is achieved, CKD patients on ESA therapy should be given maintenance iron treatment.
Several studies have reported that the dose of ESA required to achieve and maintain a given Hb level is inversely related to iron stores. Iron deficiency (absolute or functional) was the main cause of ESA resistance in the UK but this has now been solved by parenteral iron replacement strategies. The evidence behind the statement that TSAT generally should be maintained at greater than 20% stems from a single RCT comparing higher to lower TSAT targets; patients randomized to a target TSAT of 30% to 50% demonstrated a 40% reduction in ESA dose compared with those assigned to a target of 20% to 30%.
In a randomised controlled study involving 157 haemodialysis patients comparing iron management based on serum ferritin and transferrin saturation versus CHr, CHr was a markedly more stable analyte than serum ferritin or transferrin saturation. Iron management based on CHr resulted in similar haematocrit and epoetin dosing while significantly reducing IV iron exposure.
In another study involving 164 chronic haemodialysis patients, low CHr (< 26 pg) was suggestive of functional iron deficiency. When a subgroup of patients were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of IV iron dextran (1000 mg), A CHr < 26 pg at baseline predicted iron deficiency with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 80%. The serum ferritin, transferrin saturation and percentage of hypochromic red blood cells were all less accurate. The time to correction of iron deficiency at the level of the reticulocyte was found to be within 48 h as measured by correction of the mean CHr to > 26 pg, and by the shift of the vast majority of the reticulocyte population to CHr > 26 pg within this time span.
In a study comparing TSAT versus CHr as a guide of parenteral iron therapy in 197 Japanese peritoneal dialysis patients, although CHr reflected the iron status more sensitively, TSAT was a better clinical marker for iron supplementation therapy. A cross-sectional study of 72 haemodialysis patients was performed. Mean haemoglobin was 9.6 +/− 0.16 g/dl. Mean haemoglobin content of reticulocytes (CHr) was normally distributed and correlated with MCV, MCH and red cell ferritin. A low CHr identified patients with iron deficiency with normal serum ferritin or transferrin saturation.
Tessitore et al. compared the diagnostic efficiency of different iron markers in chronic haemodialysis patients. Although percentage hypochromia > 6% was the best marker to identify responsiveness to intravenous iron; CHr was 78% efficient at cut-off ≤ 29 pg.
TSAT and serum ferritin were evaluated in 47 chronic haemodialysis patients with baseline serum ferritin levels < 600 ng/ml. Patients were treated with IV dextran (1000 mg over ten haemodialysis treatments). Patients were classified as having iron deficiency if haematocrit value increased by 5% or if their erythropoietin dose decreased by 10% by 2 months. Receiver operator curves demonstrated that none of the iron indices had a high level of utility (both sensitivity and specificity > 80%). As such it was concluded that both tests should be interpreted in the context of the patient's underlying EPO responsiveness. In patients who are responsive to EPO, a transferrin saturation value < 18% or serum ferritin level < 100 ng/ml should be used to indicate inadequate iron. When EPO resistance is present, transferrin saturation of < 27% or serum ferritin < 300 microgram/L should be used to guide iron management.
NICE evaluation of iron therapy in CKD patients suggests that for haemodialysis patients, %HRC > 6 dominated all other iron evaluation strategies (it led both to more QALYs and lower cost). For the other patients, TSAT less than 20% alone or serum ferritin less than 100 micrograms/L alone were the least cost effective strategy, but %HRC was the most cost-effective.
NICE guidelines on anaemia management in CKD patients suggest to:

- Use percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC; > 6%), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h. Since a fresh blood sample is needed, this test may be difficult to use routinely in clinical practice.
- If using percentage of hypochromic red blood cells is not possible, use reticulocyte Hb content (CHr; < 29 pg) or equivalent tests – for example, reticulocyte Hb equivalent.
- If these tests are not available or the person has thalassaemia or thalassaemia trait, use a combination of transferrin saturation (less than 20%) and serum ferritin measurement (less than 100 microgram/L).

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^1121jFZx]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Assessment and diagnosis

The WHO defines anaemia as blood Hb level below 130 g/L in men and 120 g/L in women. In isolated iron deficiency, serum ferritin (the storage molecule for iron) should be less than 30 ug/L. However, ferritin is an acute phase protein and can be increased in the presence of inflammation. Thus, if there is evidence of concomitant inflammation, such as elevated C reactive protein, ferritin less than 100 ug/L is indicative of IDA. Transferrin, the iron transporter, is generally elevated; however, it is a negative acute phase protein and, therefore, can be normal or reduced in chronic inflammatory states. Serum iron and transferrin saturations (TSAT) will be reduced with TSAT less than 20% required for the diagnosis of IDA. See table 1 for the breakdown of diagnostic criteria for IDA. It is crucial to note that iron deficiency should not be excluded in the presence of a normal Hb as a significant amount of iron must be lost before the Hb levels begin to decline. Thus, a low mean corpuscular Hb with a normal Hb or an increase in red cell distribution width signifies mild iron deficiency without anaemia.

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria for iron deficiency anaemia

Management

Patients with IDA should be treated with the aim of replenishing iron stores and returning the Hb to a normal level. This has been shown to improve QoL, morbidity, prognosis in chronic disease and outcomes in pregnancy. Iron replenishment can occur via three routes: oral iron, parenteral oral and transfusion of packed red cells. Each route has its benefits and limitations, which will be discussed below in greater detail.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^111iDNqp]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Current recommendations for treatment

Recommendations for iron supplementation vary according to the guidelines. The NCCN guidelines are mainly for anemic patients receiving ESA, not with ID alone. Intravenous or oral iron is recommended for absolute ID (serum ferritin < 30 ng/ml and TSAT < 20%); failure to correct anemia within 4 weeks should lead to consideration of functional ID. Intravenous iron is recommended in functional ID (serum ferritin 30–500 µg/L and TSAT < 20%) in patients on ESA therapy.

According to ESMO guidelines, ID should be corrected as soon as serum ferritin levels are < 100 µg/L and TSAT is < 20% regardless of anemia. Oral iron treatment can only be considered in patients with absolute ID with ferritin < 30 µg/L and in the absence of an inflammatory state (C‐reactive protein [CRP] < 5 mg/L).

Knowledge gaps

ID remains insufficiently diagnosed in cancer patients and guidelines recommendations are insufficiently applied. Iron therapy is generally considered only a supportive care treatment, combined with ESA in advanced cancer disease. There is a lack of data on ID with or without anemia in the early phases of cancer in patients with adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment. The insufficient use of iron therapy by oncologists may be related to previous concerns and uncertainties regarding iron administration in this setting. Although iron therapy is recommended in patients controlled with antitumor treatment, iron is also considered as a promising target in cancer progression because it facilitates cell proliferation and growth. In addition, blood transfusion has been associated with an increased risk of cancer development. Long‐term studies on the efficacy and safety of iron therapy could help convince oncologists to systematically diagnose and treat ID, especially during the early phase of the cancer disease, thus avoiding the need for ESA or transfusions when anemia is established and more problematic to treat.

Iron deficiency

Automated cell counters provide measurements of the changes in red cells that accompany iron deficiency including reduced mean cell Hb (MCH) — hypochromia; and reduced mean cell volume (MCV) — microcytosis.MCH is probably a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less dependent on storage and the counting machine used, and a reduction is seen in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID). MCH may also be more sensitive for iron deficiency than MCV. Both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity for iron deficiency in the presence of chronic disease, thalassaemia or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited, as microcytosis and hypochromia also occur in many haemoglobinopathies (such as thalassaemia, when the MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anaemia), in sideroblastic anaemia and in some cases of anaemia of chronic disease. To prevent unnecessary GI investigation, Hb electrophoresis is recommended in those with microcytosis and normal iron studies, particularly if there is an appropriate ethnic background.

The serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte Hb (Retic-Hb) and raised percentage hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation. An SF level of < 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores, while SF levels of less than 30 µg/L are generally indicative of low body iron stores. The lower limit of normal for most laboratories, therefore, lies in the range 15–30 µg/L.

As SF is an acute phase protein, however, apparently normal levels may occur with iron deficiency in the context of an inflammatory disease process. An SF cut-off of 45 µg/L has been suggested as providing the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for iron deficiency in practice. An SF value above 150 µg/L is unlikely to occur with absolute iron deficiency, even in the presence of inflammation.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Cardiac risk biomarkers in β-thalassemia major — serum ferritin trends indicate that long-term elevations predict cardiac mortality, but single measurements may mislead; a ferritin level > 2500 μg/L indicates raised risk, risk is increased even down to 1000 μg/L, and a low ferritin does not guarantee freedom from heart failure (HF); inflammation, infection or vitamin C deficiency can alter ferritin, so individual serum ferritin may not reflect total body iron load or cardiac risk.

### Serum or plasma ferritin concentration as an index of iron deficiency and overload [^1157g8j4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Reference standard indices of iron deficiency and iron overload are generally invasive, expensive, and can be unpleasant or occasionally risky. Ferritin is an iron storage protein and its concentration in the plasma or serum reflects iron stores; low ferritin indicates iron deficiency, while elevated ferritin reflects risk of iron overload. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase protein and its levels are elevated in inflammation and infection. The use of ferritin as a diagnostic test of iron deficiency and overload is a common clinical practice.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin concentrations (serum or plasma) for detecting iron deficiency and risk of iron overload in primary and secondary iron-loading syndromes.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases (10 June 2020): DARE (Cochrane Library) Issue 2 of 4 2015, HTA (Cochrane Library) Issue 4 of 4 2016, CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) Issue 6 of 12 2020, MEDLINE (OVID) 1946 to 9 June 2020, Embase (OVID) 1947 to week 23 2020, CINAHL (Ebsco) 1982 to June 2020, Web of Science (ISI) SCI, SSCI, CPCI-exp & CPCI-SSH to June 2020, POPLINE 16/8/18, Open Grey (10/6/20), TRoPHI (10/6/20), Bibliomap (10/6/20), IBECS (10/6/20), SCIELO (10/6/20), Global Index Medicus (10/6/20) AIM, IMSEAR, WPRIM, IMEMR, LILACS (10/6/20), PAHO (10/6/20), WHOLIS 10/6/20, IndMED (16/8/18) and Native Health Research Database (10/6/20). We also searched two trials registers and contacted relevant organisations for unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all study designs seeking to evaluate serum or plasma ferritin concentrations measured by any current or previously available quantitative assay as an index of iron status in individuals of any age, sex, clinical and physiological status from any country.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We designed the data extraction form to record results for ferritin concentration as the index test, and bone marrow iron content for iron deficiency and liver iron content for iron overload as the reference standards. Two other authors further extracted and validated the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative cases, and extracted or derived the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for each threshold presented for iron deficiency and iron overload in included studies. We assessed risk of bias and applicability using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool. We used GRADE assessment to enable the quality of evidence and hence strength of evidence for our conclusions.

Main Results

Our search was conducted initially in 2014 and updated in 2017, 2018 and 2020 (10 June). We identified 21,217 records and screened 14,244 records after duplicates were removed. We assessed 316 records in full text. We excluded 190 studies (193 records) with reasons and included 108 studies (111 records) in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. There were 11 studies (12 records) that we screened from the last search update and appeared eligible for a future analysis. We decided to enter these as awaiting classification. We stratified the analysis first by participant clinical status: apparently healthy and non-healthy populations. We then stratified by age and pregnancy status as: infants and children, adolescents, pregnant women, and adults. Iron deficiency We included 72 studies (75 records) involving 6059 participants. Apparently healthy populations Five studies screened for iron deficiency in people without apparent illness. In the general adult population, three studies reported sensitivities of 63% to 100% at the optimum cutoff for ferritin, with corresponding specificities of 92% to 98%, but the ferritin cutoffs varied between studies. One study in healthy children reported a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 77%. One study in pregnant women reported a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 100%. Overall confidence in these estimates was very low because of potential bias, indirectness, and sparse and heterogenous evidence. No studies screened for iron overload in apparently healthy people. People presenting for medical care There were 63 studies among adults presenting for medical care (5042 participants). For a sample of 1000 subjects with a 35% prevalence of iron deficiency (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 85% specificity, there would be 315 iron-deficient subjects correctly classified as having iron deficiency and 35 iron-deficient subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron deficiency, leading to a 90% sensitivity. Thresholds proposed by the authors of the included studies ranged between 12 to 200 µg/L. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 50. Among non-healthy adults using a fixed threshold of 30 μg/L (nine studies, 512 participants, low-certainty evidence), the pooled estimate for sensitivity was 79% with a 95% confidence interval of (58%, 91%) and specificity of 98%, with a 95% confidence interval of (91%, 100%). The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 140, a relatively highly informative test. Iron overload We included 36 studies (36 records) involving 1927 participants. All studies concerned non-healthy populations. There were no studies targeting either infants, children, or pregnant women. Among all populations (one threshold for males and females; 36 studies, 1927 participants, very low-certainty evidence): for a sample of 1000 subjects with a 42% prevalence of iron overload (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 65% specificity, there would be 332 iron-overloaded subjects correctly classified as having iron overload and 85 iron-overloaded subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron overload, leading to a 80% sensitivity. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 8.

Authors' Conclusions

At a threshold of 30 micrograms/L, there is low-certainty evidence that blood ferritin concentration is reasonably sensitive and a very specific test for iron deficiency in people presenting for medical care. There is very low certainty that high concentrations of ferritin provide a sensitive test for iron overload in people where this condition is suspected. There is insufficient evidence to know whether ferritin concentration performs similarly when screening asymptomatic people for iron deficiency or overload.

### Association between hemoglobin levels and efficacy of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose in patients with acute heart failure and iron deficiency: an AFFIRM-AHF subgroup analysis [^116RARG8]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Two different definitions of "low hemoglobin level" (< 12 g/dL as prespecified in the AFFIRM-AHF protocol and < 12 g/dL for women and < 13 g/dL for men as per the WHO definition of anemia) were evaluated in this study, and these definitions altered the characteristics of the patients included within the subgroups. Despite these differences in definition, the same conclusion that the effect of FCM versus placebo in terms of primary and secondary outcomes was irrespective of hemoglobin level was reached. Furthermore, with both definitions, patients with low hemoglobin levels were, on average, older, had lower eGFR, and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, previous documented HF, serum ferritin < 100 μg/L, and TSAT < 20% than patients with normal hemoglobin levels. These data suggest that patients with iron deficiency and low hemoglobin levels are more likely to have a higher baseline risk of cardiovascular events than those with iron deficiency and normal hemoglobin levels. Indeed, the annualized event rates in the placebo arm of patients with low hemoglobin levels were nominally higher for primary and secondary outcomes than those in the placebo arm of patients with normal hemoglobin levels. The proportion of patients with iron deficiency defined as serum ferritin < 100 μg/L (compared with 100–299 μg/L and TSAT < 20%) was also higher in those with low versus normal hemoglobin levels, with a higher exposure of patients with low hemoglobin levels to the study drug. The connection between type of iron deficiency (low ferritin concentration versus higher ferritin concentration but low TSAT) and response to FCM merits further investigation.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^111BGSMm]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cancers, and bowel inflammatory diseases). Indeed, high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines increase hepcidin concentrations that lead to the sequestration of iron in cells of the reticuloendothelial system (functional iron deficiency). Iron parameters are often assessed only in the context of anemia, but iron deficiency, even without anemia, is present in about half of patients with inflammatory conditions. Iron deficiency worsens underlying chronic diseases and is an independent factor of morbidity and mortality. In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects iron storage, and transferrin saturation, which reflects the transport of iron. Serum ferritin is increased in an inflammatory context, and there is still no consensus on the threshold to be used in chronic inflammatory conditions. Nevertheless, recent recommendations of international guidelines agreed to define iron deficiency by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or transferrin saturation < 20%. Iron parameters remain, however, insufficiently assessed in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Indeed, clinical symptoms of iron deficiency, such as fatigue, are not specific and often confused with those of the primary disease. Iron repletion, preferably by the intravenous route to bypass tissue sequestration, improves clinical signs and quality of life. Because of the negative impact of iron deficiency on chronic inflammatory diseases and the efficacy of intravenous iron repletion, screening of iron parameters should be part of the routine examination of all patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^1178YkwN]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Monitoring

Iron overload is a potential risk of IV iron therapy. Our experience suggests that IV iron therapy in IRIDA elevates ferritin levels without significantly affecting TSAT, indicating that iron is primarily stored in the reticuloendothelial system. An increase in TSAT suggests iron redistribution from the reticuloendothelial system to the circulation, signalling that the ferritin set point — the level at which iron becomes available for erythropoiesis and other (parenchymal) tissues — has been reached. While this iron redistribution improves iron availability and haemoglobin levels, it may also result in a decreased erythropoietic iron demand, potentially leading to toxic parenchymal iron overload, necessitating reduced treatment frequency.

Unlike inappropriately low‐hepcidin disorders such as HFE‐hereditary hemochromatosis, where iron accumulates in parenchymal tissues with a higher toxicity risk, IRIDA primarily results in iron overload in the reticuloendothelial macrophages. Although the long‐term effects of such iron accumulation remain unclear, patients with (loss‐of‐function) ferroportin disease, who have similar biochemical profiles, typically do not experience severe complications despite excessive high ferritin levels. Additionally, evidence from CKD patients suggests that excess reticuloendothelial iron, during at least a few years, is well tolerated.

Given the unknown long‐term risks, we recommend checking ferritin, TSAT and haemoglobin before each administration. If TSAT levels rise but the patient remains symptomatic with low haemoglobin requiring therapy, we advise reducing IV iron administration frequency. As IRIDA patients typically cannot achieve TSAT within the reference range due to hepcidin dysregulation, we recommend maintaining TSAT around 15%. In our experience, this percentage allows for sufficient iron availability for erythropoiesis without causing unnecessary excessive iron loading in the reticuloendothelial system. Importantly, the goal is not to normalize haemoglobin, as we cannot exclude that prolonged iron loading in the reticuloendothelial system may pose long‐term risks. Ferritin levels should be kept as low as possible while ensuring acceptable haemoglobin and quality of life.

### Investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin [^116kXCsb]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin level is one of the most commonly requested investigations in both primary and secondary care. Whilst low serum ferritin levels invariably indicate reduced iron stores, raised serum ferritin levels can be due to multiple different aetiologies, including iron overload, inflammation, liver or renal disease, malignancy, and the recently described metabolic syndrome. A key test in the further investigation of an unexpected raised serum ferritin is the serum transferrin saturation. This guideline reviews the investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin level. The investigation and management of genetic haemochromatosis is not dealt with however and is the subject of a separate guideline.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia, more specifically with respect to MRI, MHF-CG 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a noninvasive estimation of iron concentration in the liver by MRI in the context of a clinical trial, given the initial evidence that serum levels of ferritin might be associated with iron accumulation in tissue in patients with stable metabolic hyperferritinemia. Consider obtaining it in patients with high serum levels of ferritin (grade 2, but in particular, grade 3) and/or additional clinical risk factors for iron overload. Prefer iron concentration in tissues over serum ferritin levels, when available, for grading metabolic hyperferritinemia.

### Early detection of type 1 haemochromatosis: a case of normal ferritin levels with elevated transferrin saturation [^115oKwcQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Haemochromatosis is marked by excessive iron accumulation leading to damage to various organs. Although haemochromatosis dates to 1865, diagnosing the condition remains challenging due to its non-specific symptoms and due to its quiescent course, it often leads to significant delay in recognition. A woman in her 50s who presented with arthralgia was found to have raised transferrin saturation with normal ferritin. She underwent human homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE) genetic screening test which showed H63D type 1 haemochromatosis. This report aims to draw attention to the pitfalls in diagnosing haemochromatosis as normal ferritin does not exclude hereditary haemochromatosis.

### Minor hemoglobins other than A2 in iron deficiency [^1141Jrfk]. Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine any difference in levels of minor hemoglobins, other than hemoglobin A2 (HbA2), in patients with iron deficiency.

Methods

We divided ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-anticoagulated blood specimens from 188 patients into 2 groups, of which 94 displayed a normal or high ferritin level and the remaining 94 had a low ferritin level. We correlated the red cell indices, hemoglobin levels, and ferritin levels with the percentage of various minor hemoglobins. The Student's t-test was used to assess the statistical significance of the difference between the mean concentrations of minor hemoglobins in the 2 groups.

Results

Only hemoglobin HbA1a had a positive correlation (0.33 in iron-deficient and 0.35 in iron-replete specimens) with serum ferritin concentration. Among the minor hemoglobins, HbA1a (P = 0.008) and HbA2 (P < .001) were significantly different between the 2 groups.

Conclusion

HbA1a may be low in iron deficiency, independent of HbA2. This information may be used to predict coexistent iron deficiency in β-thalassemia traits, in which concomitant infection or inflammation leads to normal ferritin levels.

Diagnostic work-up of iron deficiency in IBD

Anemia is defined by the WHO as a decline in blood hemoglobin to a concentration of < 12 g/dL (120 g/L) in women and < 13 g/dL (130 g/L) in men, parameters which are equally applicable to patients with IBD. When anemia is assessed on the basis of hemoglobin levels, the influence of a range of other factors must, however, be taken into account: pregnancy, altitude, cigarette smoking, and possibly ethnicity. The WHO has therefore additionally issued respective international minimum levels for hemoglobin and hematocrit (Table 2).

Table 2
Minimum hemoglobin and hematocrit levels used to define anemia in people living at sea level

The standard parameters of iron deficiency, low MCV and low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) are generally reliable. However, iron deficiency as the cause of anemia cannot be ruled out on the grounds of a normal MCV, since up to 40% of "pure" IDA cases are normocytic (e.g. in IBD patients treated with azathioprine or 6-MP). Conversely, low MCV does not necessarily indicate ID, as the presence of ACD can cause it to be normal or low. A substantially more accurate IDA diagnosis can be attained by the additional determination of iron metabolism parameters. In principle, all components of the body's iron metabolism can be conveniently monitored using routine laboratory methods:

Iron stores: serum ferritin
Iron transport: transferrin saturation
Iron utilization: erythropoiesis: i.e. proportion of hypochromic erythrocytes or reticulocytes

Serum iron concentrations are governed by a circadian rhythm and can be low even in cases of anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Its role in the work-up of iron deficiency therefore, obsolete.

### Iron deficiency and heart failure: diagnostic dilemmas and therapeutic perspectives [^114JLXDd]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Circulating iron bound to transferrin (TIBC, total iron binding capacity — by transferrin) reflects the amount of iron available for metabolizing target cells. Importantly, neither serum iron nor serum transferrin alone should be used as biomarkers of iron status. Instead, transferrin saturation (Tsat), the per cent of transferrin that has iron bound to it (ratio of serum iron and TIBC × 100), is recommended. Reduced Tsat (< 20%) is considered a surrogate of insufficient iron available for metabolizing cells. With malnutrition accompanying chronic diseases, liver synthesis and blood transferrin levels may be low, which can artificially increase Tsat disproportionate to the iron content.

When serum ferritin is between 100 and 300 µg/L (which is frequent in patients with chronic diseases with pro-inflammatory activation), the diagnosis of ID is more complex. Such values are usually associated with normal/slightly increased intracellular iron stores and the diagnosis of absolute ID cannot be made. If there is restricted iron delivery to target cells (reduced Tsat < 20%), functional ID can be diagnosed.

### A diagnostic approach to hyperferritinemia with a non-elevated transferrin saturation [^114SLmej]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting the serum ferritin elevation in relationship to other clinical parameters including the patient history, transferrin saturation, serum concentrations of alanine, and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST), testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration. We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^112Vtput]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Anaemia and iron dysregulation: untapped therapeutic targets in chronic lung disease? [^112v6N8a]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

The clinical relevance of anaemia, inflammation and dysregulated iron metabolism

Many chronic diseases have been shown to impact haematopoiesis and this is especially relevant in chronic lung disease. Polycythaemia has traditionally been considered an indication for venesection in COPD given the potential risks of hypercoagulability; however, this erythropoietic response is driven by tissue hypoxia and following the institution of LTOT as a standard of care, polycythaemia is now three times less prevalent than anaemia. In cystic fibrosis (CF), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and COPD, a significant number of subjects have anaemia and or iron deficiency (circa 20%–40%), although this area is poorly studied and the incidence may be significantly underestimated, since establishing iron deficiency is complicated because of the effects of inflammation on serum iron, transferrin and ferritin. Contextually, a role for functional iron deficiency may be equally relevant as may be disease-specific considerations including propensity to infection. Although not currently part of routine clinical assessment, serum transferrin receptor levels appear to be unaffected by inflammation and may more accurately reflect iron status in chronic lung disease; circulating levels in the normal range reflect erythropoietic activity and levels are disproportionately elevated in iron deficiency.

In a series that considered this complexity, anaemia of chronic disease or 'anaemia of inflammation', was observed in 10% of patients with stable COPD. Congruent with the pathophysiological relevance of inflammation, the prevalence of anaemia in COPD has been observed to be up to 44% among patients admitted with acute exacerbationand the presence of anaemia in this scenario is independently associated with mortality. In fact, anaemia and/or iron deficiency have been consistently shown to have a strong correlation with morbidityand mortality across several lung diseases, the reported prevalence has been widely variable due to the different characteristics of study populations and the lack of a consensus definition of anaemia in the context of chronic lung disease. While most authors use the WHO definition (< 13 g/dL for males and 12 g/dL females), some use the same Hb level for both men and women (since most women are postmenopausal in these populations), while others have used haematocrit as the identifying factor. Although the prevalence also varies across the various respiratory populations, the impact of anaemia in the setting of impaired physiology and symptomatic limitation is expected to be common to a range of respiratory diseases.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

Diagnostic tools in ID

It is important to differentiate which mechanism is the most important in the particular patient to guide treatment, as FID, AID, and iron sequestration can be present in cancer patients.

Serum ferritin is commonly assessed as the reflection of the iron stores status, while transferrin saturation < 20%, percentage of hypochromic red cells > 5%, and Hb content of reticulocytes (CHr) < 26 pg reflect the availability of iron in the body. Furthermore, serum ferritin is an acute-phase protein and can be elevated in inflammatory states (e.g. cancer) and liver injury. Hence, normal or elevated ferritin levels in patients with a chronic disease such as cancer do not necessarily indicate sufficient iron stores.

Soluble transferrin receptor levels, suggested to differentiate patients needing therapy with iron, ESA or the combination, rather reflects the erythropoietic activity than the iron status and cannot be assessed as iron status parameter when erythropoiesis is stimulated, as with ESA.

Recently, a diagnostic plot was suggested for the differentiation between the different mechanisms to guide therapy, based on iron stores (reflected as the ratio of soluble transferrin receptor to log ferritin) and iron demand (reflected as the Hb content of the reticulocytes) (Fig. 3). As the ratio of soluble transferring receptor to log ferritin and CHr are not routinely measured, the plot is difficult to use in a day-to-day clinical practice. In routine clinical practice, serum ferritin levels below 100 ng/mL probably indicate insufficient iron stores in patients with cancer, and the combination of low TSAT (< 20%) and normal or even elevated serum ferritin may indicate FID.

### Redefining iron deficiency in patients with chronic heart failure [^112u7dCm]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

A serum ferritin level < 15 to 20 μg/L historically identified patients who had absent bone marrow iron stores, but serum ferritin levels are distorted by the systemic inflammatory states seen in patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure. As a result, nearly 25 years ago, the diagnostic ferritin threshold was increased 5- to 20-fold in patients with chronic kidney disease (ie, iron deficiency was identified if the serum ferritin level was < 100 μg/L, regardless of transferrin saturation [TSAT], or 100 to 299 μg/L if TSAT was < 20%). This guidance was motivated not by the findings of studies of total body or tissue iron depletion, but by a desire to encourage the use of iron supplements to potentiate the response to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in patients with renal anemia. However, in patients with heart failure, this definition does not reliably identify patients with an absolute or functional iron-deficiency state, and it includes individuals with TSATs (≥ 20%) and serum ferritin levels in the normal range (20–100 mg/L) who are not iron deficient, have an excellent prognosis, and do not respond favorably to iron therapy. Furthermore, serum ferritin levels may be distorted by the use of both neprilysin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, both of which may act to mobilize endogenous iron stores. The most evidence-based and trial-tested definition of iron deficiency is the presence of hypoferremia, as reflected by as a TSAT < 20%. These hypoferremic patients are generally iron deficient on bone marrow examination, and after intravenous iron therapy, they exhibit an improvement in exercise tolerance and functional capacity (when meaningfully impaired) and show the most marked reduction (ie, 20%–30%) in the risk of cardiovascular death or total heart failure hospitalizations. Therefore, we propose that the current ferritin-driven definition of iron deficiency in heart failure should be abandoned and that a definition based on hypoferremia (TSAT < 20%) should be adopted.

### Should patients with anemia and low normal or normal serum ferritin undergo colonoscopy? [^114JTM3s]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with unexplained iron deficiency anemia have a greater prevalence of colonic neoplasia, and should be evaluated for a colonoscopy. The approach to patients with anemia without iron deficiency remains unclear.

Objective

To compare the prevalence of colonic neoplasia in anemic patients with normal ferritin (> 50 ng/mL), to those with ferritin ≤ 50 ng/mL, and nonanemic individuals.

Methods

Patients referred for colonoscopy for anemia evaluation were stratified into 3 groups: ferritin ≤ 50 ng/mL, 51–100 ng/mL, and > 100 ng/mL. We compared these groups to each other, and to asymptomatic nonanemic individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy. The prevalence of advanced colonic neoplasia was determined for each group using existing records.

Results

During the study period, 414 patients who underwent colonoscopy for anemia evaluation and 323 nonanemic individuals who underwent colonoscopy for cancer screening met inclusion criteria. Study subjects were mostly men. The prevalence of advanced colonic neoplasia in subjects with ferritin 51–100 ng/mL was 7.2% (95% CI 2.4–17.9%), similar to 7.9% (95% CI 5.1–11.9%) in those with ferritin ≤ 50 ng/mL. The incidence of advanced colonic neoplasia in subjects with ferritin > 100 ng/mL was 1.7% (95% CI 0.1–6.6%), similar to 1.2% (95% CI 0.4–3.3%) in the asymptomatic nonanemic group. After adjusting for age, patients with ferritin ≤ 50 ng/mL and 51–100 ng/mL were almost 5 times more likely to harbor advanced colonic neoplasia than the other groups. The addition of other laboratory parameters did not improve the predictive value of ferritin.

Conclusion

A ferritin cutoff of 100 ng/mL can be used to determine the need for colonoscopy in men with anemia.

### An exploratory analysis of routine ferritin measurement upon admission and the prognostic implications of low-grade ferritinemia during inflammation [^113j4wkN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum ferritin is usually measured in the presence of anemia or in suspected iron overload syndromes. Ferritin is also an acute-phase protein that is elevated during systemic inflammation. However, the prognostic value of routinely measuring ferritin upon admission to a medical facility is not clear. Therefore, we examined the association between ferritin concentrations measured at the time of hospital admission with 30-day and long-term mortality.

Methods

We obtained routine ferritin measurements taken within 24 hours of admission in 2859 patients hospitalized in an internal medicine department. Multiple clinical and laboratory parameters were used to assess the association between ferritin and overall mortality during a median follow-up of 15 months (interquartile range [IQR] 8–22).

Results

Ferritin levels were associated with increased 30-day mortality rates (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–1.06) for each 100 ng/mL increase. Patients with intermediate (78–220 ng/mL) and high (> 221 ng/mL) ferritin concentrations (2nd and 3rd tertiles) had higher 30-day mortality rates even after adjustment for age, sex, and existing comorbidities (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.70–2.5). Long-term overall mortality rates demonstrated a similar pattern across ferritin tertiles (hazard ratio [HR] 1.54, 95% CI 1.39–1.71).

Conclusions

Routine admission ferritin concentrations are linearly and independently correlated with excess mortality risk in hospitalized patients, even those with apparently "normal" ferritin concentrations (< 300 mg/mL). Thus, low-grade ferritinemia might not be an innocent finding in the context of the inflammatory response. Its potential biological and therapeutic implications warrant future research.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using a transferrin saturation < 20% and a normal or elevated ferritin level to define functional iron deficiency in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD or maintained on peritoneal dialysis and in those receiving hemodialysis. Recognize that normal or high serum ferritin values do not exclude iron deficiency, as it could be due to other causes such as infection or inflammation.

Consensus Statements: Diagnosis

All patients with anemia should be evaluated for the cause of anemia — wherever possible, early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful.
It is important to identify iron deficiency, including in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease).
Patients with IDA should be evaluated for the cause of the iron deficiency, whereas patients with anemia and normal iron studies should be evaluated for coexisting causes of anemia (ie, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, and nutrition deficiency).
Evaluation for iron deficiency should include iron studies (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin); if available, reticulocyte Hb content and/or serum hepcidin should be considered in inflammatory states.
The most important criteria for defining absolute iron deficiency were ferritin < 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT < 20%; ferritin < 100 ng/mL may define iron deficiency in inflammatory states. If available, either a reticulocyte Hb < 29 pg or a serum hepcidin level < 20 µg/L also suggest the presence of iron deficiency in inflammatory states.

Supporting Evidence: Diagnosis

In a study of 3342 patients undergoing major elective surgery, the overall prevalence of anemia was 36%. Of the patients with anemia, 62% had absolute iron deficiency and another 5% had low iron stores. Therefore, all patients with anemia should be screened for iron deficiency. In some circumstances (eg, planned surgery associated with large blood loss), it may also be appropriate to evaluate nonanemic surgical patients for iron deficiency. Patients with anemia who are not iron deficient should be evaluated for other causes of anemia (eg, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, nutritional deficiencies). Determination of whether anemia is microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (in patients with reticulocyte production index < 2) may help identify likely causes. Wherever possible, evaluations should be performed early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful. In patients undergoing urgent/emergency procedures, blood samples for evaluation and classification of anemia should be drawn preoperatively, with the aim of testing promptly (preoperatively if possible).

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

DIAGNOSIS OF IRON DEFICIENCY

Serum ferritin is widely recognized as the most specific and cost‐effective biomarker for evaluating iron stores in the body. Establishing standardized ferritin thresholds that align with physiological norms is essential for accurately diagnosing low iron stores. However, current guidelines differ, which may lead to the potential underdiagnosis or overdiagnosis of ID.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines ferritin thresholds as < 12 μg/L for children and < 15 μg/L for women, but these values were based on expert opinion rather than physiological data, and the method used to determine cut‐offs was not detailed. A study analysing data from The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) identified a serum ferritin threshold of 25 μg/L for non‐pregnant women aged 15–49 years. This threshold was derived using restricted cubic spline models that assessed the physiological relationship between serum ferritin and both haemoglobin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations in healthy individuals. Data from 62 anaemic individuals with either bone marrow‐confirmed ID (n = 54) or a documented response to iron therapy (n = 8) showed that ferritin < 12 μg/L yielded a sensitivity of only 25% for the diagnosis of ID. In contrast, increasing the threshold to < 30 μg/L significantly improved sensitivity to 92%. The soluble transferrin receptor showed a sensitivity of 92%, outperforming ferritin at the < 12 μg/L threshold and matching the performance of ferritin at the < 30 μg/L threshold. Increasingly, experts recommend a ferritin cut‐off of 30 μg/L for healthy males and females over 15 years.,

Although ferritin is the most reliable marker of iron stores, it can be elevated during inflammation, potentially masking ID. Therefore, measuring C‐reactive protein (CRP) or α1‐acid glycoprotein alongside ferritin helps distinguish true ID from inflammation‐related conditions in relevant cases. Additionally, transferrin saturation and soluble transferrin receptor levels can provide further insights, particularly in cases where ferritin levels may be unreliable due to inflammatory conditions,(Table 1).

### Serum ferritin as an indicator of iron status: what do we need to know? [^111C8V5M]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Determination of iron status in pregnancy and in young children is essential for both clinical and public health practice. Clinical diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) through sampling of bone marrow to identify the absence of body iron stores is impractical in most cases. Serum ferritin (SF) concentrations are the most commonly deployed indicator for determining ID, and low SF concentrations reflect a state of iron depletion. However, there is considerable variation in SF cutoffs recommended by different expert groups to diagnose ID. Moreover, the cutoffs used in different clinical laboratories are heterogeneous. There are few studies of diagnostic test accuracy to establish the sensitivity and specificity of SF compared with key gold standards (such as absent bone marrow iron stores, increased intestinal iron absorption, and hemoglobin response to SF) among noninflamed, outpatient populations. The limited data available suggest the commonly recommended SF cutoff of < 15 μg/L is a specific but not sensitive cutoff, although evidence is limited. Data from women during pregnancy or from young children are especially uncommon. Most data are from studies conducted > 30 y ago, do not reflect ethnic or geographic diversity, and were performed in an era for which laboratory methods no longer reflect present practice. Future studies to define the appropriate SF cutoffs are urgently needed and would also provide an opportunity to compare this indicator with other established and emerging iron indexes. In addition, future work would benefit from a focus on elucidating cutoffs and indexes relevant to iron adequacy.

### Unexplained isolated hyperferritinemia without iron overload [^113NsueP]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Although hyperferritinemia may be reflective of elevated total body iron stores, there are conditions in which ferritin levels are disproportionately elevated relative to iron status. Autosomal dominant forms of hyperferritinemia due to mutations in the L-ferritin IRE or in A helix of L-ferritin gene have been described, however cases of isolated hyperferritinemia still remain unsolved. We describe 12 Italian subjects with unexplained isolated hyperferritinemia (UIH). Four probands have affected siblings, but no affected parents or offspring. Sequencing analyses did not identify casual mutations in ferritin gene or IRE regions. These patients had normal levels of intracellular ferritin protein and mRNA in peripheral blood cells excluding pathological ferritin production at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In contrast with individuals with benign hyperferritinemia caused by mutations affecting the ferritin A helix, low rather than high glycosylation of serum ferritin was observed in our UIH subjects compared with controls. These findings suggest that subjects with UIH have a previously undescribed form of hyperferritinemia possibly attributable to increased cellular ferritin secretion and/or decreased serum ferritin clearance. The cause remains to be defined and we can only speculate the existence of mutations in gene/s not directly implicated in iron metabolism that could affect ferritin turnover including ferritin secretion.

1 Introduction

Iron deficiency is estimated to affect two billion people and is the leading cause of anemia worldwide. The serum or plasma ferritin concentration (referred to hereafter as ferritin) is the most widely used indicator to detect iron deficiency and a low ferritin indicates depleted iron stores. However, the threshold ferritin that defines iron deficiency remains unclearand diagnostic ferritin cutoffs from expert groups vary widely. WHO proposes that iron deficiency is present in adults when ferritin is < 15 µg/L 2. This threshold was derived from studies examining the highest ferritin among adults with iron-deficiency anemia who showed a therapeutic response to iron or who had absent bone marrow iron. Considering this definition, it is not unexpected that a ferritin < 15 µg/L is a specific but insensitive threshold for iron deficiency, which precedes iron-deficiency anemia. To increase the sensitivity of ferritin to detect iron deficiency, other experts recommend using higher cut-offs to avoid false-negative tests that would leave iron deficiency untreated. However, there is little evidence available to justify higher ferritin thresholds. Moreover, many studies that compared ferritin to absent bone marrow iron were done in hospitalized patients and were likely biased by inflammation, that increases ferritin independent of iron stores.

A largely unexplored reference method for defining iron deficiency is based on the fact that low iron stores trigger an increase in dietary iron absorption. In otherwise healthy individuals, low hepatic iron stores attenuate the bone morphogenetic protein–SMAD (BMP-SMAD) pathway, which reduces hepatic hepcidin synthesis, and low circulating hepcidin increases dietary iron absorption. Importantly, dietary iron absorption is already increased when a reduction in liver iron stores has not yet reduced serum iron or transferrin saturation. Iron absorption measured via erythrocyte iron incorporation of isotopic tracers has long been regarded as the most sensitive indirect measure of body iron stores.

A recent WHO review emphasized the need for additional research to establish a ferritin cutoff for iron deficiency. Using standardized methods, our laboratory has performed multiple stable iron isotope studies in healthy young women with varying iron status to measure iron absorption from meals extrinsically-labeled with ferrous sulfate. Pooling these data, our study aim was to define the ferritin concentration in young women at which the body senses iron depletion and begins to upregulate iron absorption from the diet; this approach could provide a functionally-defined threshold of incipient iron deficiency. At the same time, we hypothesized that this threshold ferritin value would correspond to the hepcidin threshold at which iron absorption begins to increase.

### Iron deficiency in adults: a review [^111vsMJh]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Absolute iron deficiency, defined as low iron stores with or without anemia, affects approximately 2 billion people worldwide and 14% of adults in the US. Iron-deficiency anemia, defined as low hemoglobin due to low iron stores, affects approximately 1.2 billion people worldwide, including 10 million in the US.

Observations

Absolute iron deficiency progresses from low iron stores to iron-deficiency anemia. Individuals with nonanemic iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anemia may be asymptomatic or experience fatigue, irritability, depression, difficulty concentrating, restless legs syndrome (32%-40%), pica (40%-50%), dyspnea, lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, and worsening heart failure (HF). Symptom prevalences vary depending on age, comorbidities (eg, chronic kidney disease [CKD], HF), and severity and rate of development of iron deficiency. The most common causes of iron deficiency are bleeding (menstrual, gastrointestinal), impaired iron absorption (atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, bariatric surgical procedures), inadequate dietary iron intake, and pregnancy. In high-income countries, approximately 38% of nonpregnant, reproductive-age women have iron deficiency without anemia and about 13% have iron-deficiency anemia. During the third trimester of pregnancy, iron deficiency affects up to 84% of pregnant women, based on data from high-income countries. Additional risk factors include use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD [13%-90%]), and other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as CKD (24%-85%), HF (37%-61%), and cancer (18%-82%). Testing for iron deficiency is indicated for patients with anemia and/or symptoms of iron deficiency (fatigue, pica, or restless legs syndrome) and should be considered for those with risk factors such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pregnancy, or IBD. Iron deficiency is diagnosed by low serum ferritin (typically < 30 ng/mL) in individuals without inflammatory conditions or by transferrin saturation (iron/total iron binding capacity×100) less than 20%. Causes of iron deficiency should be identified and treated. Oral iron (ferrous sulfate 325 mg/d or on alternate days) is typically first-line therapy. Intravenous iron is indicated for patients with oral iron intolerance, poor absorption (celiac disease, post-bariatric surgical procedure), chronic inflammatory conditions (CKD, HF, IBD, cancer), ongoing blood loss, and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia are common conditions that may cause symptoms such as fatigue, exercise intolerance, and difficulty concentrating. Ferritin and/or transferrin saturation are required for diagnosis and screening. Oral iron is first-line therapy for most patients. Intravenous iron is used for individuals who do not tolerate or have impaired absorption of oral iron, those with ongoing blood loss, certain chronic inflammatory conditions (IBD, CKD, HF, cancer), and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW DEFINITION OF IRON-DEFICIENT HF

Given the link between serum iron level ≤ 13 μmol/L and TSAT < 20% with bone marrow stores, it is noteworthy that both thresholds have been shown to have prognostic significance in patients with HF (ie, they each predict the occurrence of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalizations).– In contrast, patients with a serum ferritin level < 100 ng/mL but normal serum iron levels and TSAT are deemed iron deficient by the guidelines, but have a favorable prognosis, presumably because serum ferritin levels of 20 to 100 mg/L lie in the normal range for healthy, iron-replete people. Patients with high serum ferritin levels (≥ 300 μg/L) but low serum iron concentrations (≤ 13 μmol/L), low TSAT (< 20%), or anemia — features commonly seen in functional iron deficiency — are at particularly high risk of adverse HF outcomes,– but they are not considered iron deficient by the guideline definition. Higher serum ferritin levels identify patients at higher risk, because they are indicators of the coexisting inflammatory state that reflects prognostically relevant comorbidities.–

Confounding Effects of Foundational Drugs for HF

To complicate matters further, many of the foundational drugs used for the treatment of HF and a reduced ejection fraction may influence hemoglobin, while simultaneously distorting the levels of iron biomarkers that are used to identify an iron-deficiency state. In randomized controlled trials, treatment of patients with HF with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor has been accompanied by modest decreases in hemoglobin, and carvedilol (a nonselective β-blocker) is more likely to cause small decreases in hemoglobin than metoprolol tartrate (a selective β-blocker). In both instances, the effects on red blood cell counts were seen early in treatment and were sustained for the duration of therapy. These findings are likely the result of the withdrawal of a direct stimulatory effect of angiotensin II and β2 adrenergic receptors on the proliferation of erythroid precursors. The action of neurohormonal blockade to lower hemoglobin can be accompanied by direct or reactive changes in iron biomarkers; α 1 -adrenergic blockade can directly decrease hepcidin synthesis, and angiotensin receptor blockade may increase serum ferritin levels.
