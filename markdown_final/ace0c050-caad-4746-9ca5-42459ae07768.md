## Question

Where is factor VIII produced

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking where coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) is produced, by which organs and cell types. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organ-level sources of FVIII, especially the liver versus extrahepatic contributions. Then, I should verify the specific hepatic cell type responsible for FVIII synthesis. Next, I will examine the extrahepatic endothelial subsets that produce FVIII and clarify which vascular beds do not contribute. After that, I need to check the cellular mechanisms of FVIII biosynthesis, storage, and regulated release. Finally, I will synthesize these findings into a concise endothelial-centric production map and confirm clinical coherence with current FVIII biology.

> Let me first confirm the organ-level picture before going granular. The liver has long been identified as the major source of circulating FVIII, and transcriptomic profiling shows abundant F8 mRNA in liver, with meaningful extrahepatic expression notably in lymph nodes, indicating that the circulating pool derives from both hepatic and extrahepatic sites, likely of endothelial origin [^112KkbTX] [^114zoSJC].

> Wait, let me verify the exact hepatic cell type, because older assumptions often default to hepatocytes. Initially, I might be tempted to say hepatocytes are the primary producers; hold on, that's outdated and not supported by direct measurements. Human studies demonstrate that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), not hepatocytes, contain measurable FVIII activity, with FVIII:C detectable in purified LSECs and undetectable in hepatocytes, decisively shifting hepatic production to the sinusoidal endothelium rather than parenchyma [^116MDpRh] [^112KkbTX].

> I should confirm whether extrahepatic sources are just minor or truly significant. Multiple lines of evidence indicate substantial extrahepatic FVIII production sufficient to support hemostasis, with lymph nodes exhibiting abundant F8 mRNA and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) identified as a major extrahepatic source; murine models corroborate an endothelial (not hepatocyte) origin across tissues, strengthening the cross-species generalizability of this endothelial-centric model [^112KkbTX] [^117HydSA].

> Next, I will examine which extrahepatic endothelial subsets contribute. Let me consider the lung first; human lung perfusion studies show progressive accumulation of FVIII in the perfusate, and cultured human lung microvascular endothelial cells synthesize FVIII, directly identifying lung endothelium as a production site. I should double-check other vascular beds: microvascular endothelial cells from heart, intestine, and skin constitutively secrete FVIII and release it upon stimulation, while fenestrated endothelial beds and certain high endothelial venules also show F8 expression, consistent with a distributed endothelial network of synthesis [^117M4391] [^112qdyyw] [^112KkbTX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all endothelium being equal. I need to ensure we specify non-producers to define specificity. Capillary endothelial cells in most beds do not express F8, fibroblastic reticular cells and hematopoietic cells are not sources, and large-vessel endothelium from the aorta, umbilical artery, and umbilical vein does not constitutively secrete FVIII nor release it with agonists, likely due to lack of synthesis, which helps delimit the true producing compartments [^112KkbTX] [^112qdyyw].

> I will now examine the cell biology of production and release to ensure mechanistic plausibility. FVIII follows the canonical secretory pathway from ER to Golgi to plasma membrane requiring COPII trafficking and the cargo receptors LMAN1 and MCFD2, with endothelial storage and co-sorting with von Willebrand factor into Weibel-Palade bodies enabling regulated release upon stimulation; additionally, hepatic endothelial secretion is subject to regulation by CD36, aligning genetic and cell-biological control with observed plasma variability [^114zoSJC] [^114KcYHg] [^112qdyyw].

> Let me reconsider the overall map and confirm consistency with contemporary clinical biology. The totality of data supports an endothelial-centric network for FVIII production: LSECs dominate hepatic output, LECs are a major extrahepatic source, and selected microvascular and fenestrated endothelial beds (lung, heart, intestine, skin, renal glomeruli, and some high endothelial venules) contribute variably, which coheres with modern summaries of FVIII biology and helps explain physiologic and stress-induced fluctuations in plasma FVIII [^112KkbTX] [^112rBz4U].

> Final answer, but wait, I should double-check the negative statement about hepatocytes one more time to avoid overstatement; the human primary cell data are clear and reproducible, so I am confident proceeding. Factor VIII is produced primarily by endothelial cells, with liver sinusoidal endothelial cells as the predominant hepatic source and lymphatic endothelial cells as a major extrahepatic source, alongside contributions from lung, heart, intestinal, and skin microvascular endothelium and other fenestrated endothelial populations; hepatocytes do not produce FVIII based on direct human cell measurements, and many large-vessel endothelial beds and non-endothelial stromal or hematopoietic cells lack FVIII synthesis [^116MDpRh] [^112KkbTX] [^117M4391] [^112qdyyw].

Factor VIII is produced primarily by **liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs)** [^116MDpRh], not hepatocytes [^117HydSA]. Extrahepatic endothelial cells — notably in the lung [^117M4391], lymph nodes [^112KkbTX], and other vascular beds — also contribute to circulating **FVIII** [^112qdyyw]. FVIII is synthesized in these endothelial cells, secreted into plasma, and stabilized by binding von Willebrand factor [^114RSfTg]; its deficiency or dysfunction causes hemophilia A [^116VNNsP].

## Primary site of factor VIII production

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) — not hepatocytes — are the principal hepatic site of **FVIII synthesis** [^116MDpRh]. Evidence from purified cell studies shows **FVIII activity in LSECs** [^116MDpRh] but not in hepatocytes, confirming LSECs as the primary hepatic source [^112KkbTX].

---

## Extrahepatic sources of factor VIII

- **Lung endothelial cells**: Human lung microvascular endothelial cells synthesize and secrete FVIII, indicating the lung as a significant extrahepatic source [^117M4391].
- **Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs)**: LECs in lymph nodes and other tissues express F8 mRNA and secrete active FVIII, contributing to the plasma pool [^112KkbTX].
- **Other vascular beds**: Endothelial cells from heart, intestine, and skin also produce and release FVIII, especially under stress or stimulation [^112qdyyw].

---

## Cellular and molecular mechanisms of factor VIII synthesis

- **Gene expression**: The F8 gene is transcribed in endothelial cells, producing FVIII mRNA and protein [^112KkbTX].
- **Protein synthesis and secretion**: FVIII is synthesized in the ER, trafficked through the Golgi, and secreted into plasma, where it binds VWF [^114jkg95] for stabilization [^114RSfTg].
- **Regulation**: FVIII secretion is regulated by intracellular trafficking proteins (e.g. COPII, LMAN1) [^117HydSA] and external stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide [^114zoSJC].

---

## Clinical significance of factor VIII production sites

- **Hemophilia A**: Deficiency or dysfunction of FVIII causes hemophilia A [^116VNNsP], an X-linked bleeding disorder managed with replacement therapy or gene therapy [^112rBz4U].
- **Acquired hemophilia A**: Autoimmune inhibitors against FVIII can cause severe bleeding, requiring immunosuppression and bypassing agents [^114goGvY] [^113iZGqS].
- **Therapeutic implications**: Understanding FVIII production informs gene therapy [^112rBz4U] and recombinant FVIII development, aiming for sustained expression and reduced immunogenicity [^114wDSgq].

---

Factor VIII is **produced primarily by LSECs** [^116MDpRh], with **extrahepatic endothelial cells** (lung [^117M4391], lymphatic [^112KkbTX], and other vascular beds) also contributing to the circulating pool; this endothelial synthesis underpins normal hemostasis and guides therapies for hemophilia A [^114jg3Wf].

### The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex: basic and clinical issues [^114RSfTg]. Haematologica (2003). Low credibility.

Factor VIII (FVIII) and von Willebrand factor (VWF) are two distinct but related glycoproteins that circulate in plasma as a tightly bound complex (FVIII/VWF). Their deficiencies or structural defects are responsible for the most common inherited bleeding disorders, namely hemophilia A (HA) and von Willebrand's disease (VWD). VWF has a dual role in hemostasis: first, it promotes platelet adhesion to thrombogenic surfaces as well as platelet-to-platelet cohesion during thrombus formation; second, it is the carrier for FVIII in plasma. FVIII acts as a co-factor to accelerate the activation of factor X by activated factor IX in the coagulation cascade.

After many years of investigations, the molecular mechanisms of FVIII/VWF interactions are now well known, and recent biochemical investigations have confirmed that VWF is a key partner for FVIII, playing significant roles in FVIII function, its production, stabilization, conformation, and immunogenicity. FVIII and VWF are both present in most plasma-derived FVIII/VWF concentrates used in clinical practice. FVIII/VWF concentrates can be classified into three main categories according to the degree of their purification. Intermediate-high purity plasma-derived concentrates containing FVIII/VWF, currently in use since 1987, carry a low risk of transmitting blood-borne infections. The safety of concentrates depends on the interaction of two factors: the decrease of viral plasma load and the increase of viral inactivation. These FVIII/VWF concentrates are currently used in type 3 VWD and in type 1 or 2 VWD patients.

### Haemophilia [^116VNNsP]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2021). Low credibility.

Haemophilia A and B are rare congenital, recessive X-linked disorders caused by a lack or deficiency of clotting factor VIII (FVIII) or IX (FIX), respectively. The severity of the disease depends on the reduction of levels of FVIII or FIX, which are determined by the type of the causative mutation in the genes encoding the factors (F8 and F9, respectively). The hallmark clinical characteristic, especially in untreated severe forms, is bleeding (spontaneous or after trauma) into major joints such as ankles, knees, and elbows, which can result in the development of arthropathy. Intracranial bleeds and bleeds into internal organs may be life-threatening.

The median life expectancy was approximately 30 years until the 1960s. However, improved understanding of the disorder and development of efficacious therapy based on prophylactic replacement of the missing factor has caused a paradigm shift. Today individuals with haemophilia can look forward to a virtually normal life expectancy and quality of life. Nevertheless, the potential development of inhibitory antibodies to infused factor is still a major hurdle to overcome in a substantial proportion of patients. Finally, gene therapy for both types of haemophilia has progressed remarkably and could soon become a reality.

### Patterns of expression of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor by endothelial cell subsets in vivo [^112KkbTX]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Circulating factor VIII (FVIII) is derived from the liver and from extrahepatic sources, probably of endothelial origin, but the vascular sites of FVIII production remain unclear. Among organs profiled, only the liver and lymph nodes (LNs) show abundant expression of F8 messenger RNA (mRNA). Transcriptomic profiling of subsets of stromal cells, including endothelial cells (ECs) from mouse LNs and other tissues, showed that F8 mRNA is expressed by lymphatic ECs (LECs) but not by capillary ECs (capECs), fibroblastic reticular cells, or hematopoietic cells.

Among blood ECs profiled, F8 expression was seen only in fenestrated ECs (liver sinusoidal and renal glomerular ECs) and some high endothelial venules. In contrast, von Willebrand factor mRNA was expressed in capECs but not in LECs; it was coexpressed with F8 mRNA in postcapillary high endothelial venules. Purified LECs and liver sinusoidal ECs, but not capECs from LNs, secrete active FVIII in culture. Human and mouse lymph contained substantial FVIII activity.

Our results revealed localized vascular expression of FVIII and von Willebrand factor and identified LECs as a major cellular source of FVIII in extrahepatic tissues.

### Fviii production by human lung microvascular endothelial cells [^117M4391]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

While extrahepatic factor VIII (FVIII) synthesis suffices for hemostasis, the extrahepatic production sites are not well defined. We therefore investigated the ability of the human lungs to produce FVIII. Lungs from heart-beating donors who were declined for transplantation were perfused and ventilated in an isolated reperfusion model for 2 hours. A progressive accumulation of FVIII and von Willebrand factor (VWF) was recorded in the perfusion medium in 3 of 4 experiments. By contrast, factor V, fibrinogen, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels remained constant during the perfusion period, indicating that the accumulation of FVIII and VWF was not due to diffusion from the intercellular medium into the vascular system. Purified human lung microvascular endothelial cells produced FVIII during at least 2 passages in vitro. Altogether, these data identify the lung endothelial cells as a FVIII production site in humans.

### Human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells but not hepatocytes contain factor VIII [^116MDpRh]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

Although the liver is the major site of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) synthesis, the type of cells producing FVIII within the liver is still unclear.
- **Objectives**: To measure FVIII in extracts of primary liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatocytes, thereby preventing potential bias resulting from the modifications of the cell phenotype that can take place during in vitro culture.
- **Methods**: LSECs were purified by flow cytometry cell sorting on the basis of their coexpression of Tie2 and CD32b. The purity of the cells was controlled by RNA sequencing. FVIII activity (FVIII:C) in extracts of purified cells was measured with a sensitive FVIII chromogenic assay, in which the specificity of the reaction is controlled by neutralization of FVIII activity with specific inhibitor antibodies.
- **Results**: The FVIII:C concentration in purified LSECs ranged from 0.3 to 2.8 nU per cell. In contrast, FVIII:C was undetectable in hepatocytes. The intracellular FVIII:C concentrations are therefore at least 10–100-fold higher in LSECs than in hepatocytes.
- **Conclusions**: Our data demonstrate that LSECs, but not hepatocytes, contain measurable amounts of FVIII:C, and suggest that the former are the main cells producing FVIII in the human liver.

### Advances in the understanding of acquired haemophilia A: Implications for clinical practice [^114goGvY]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Acquired haemophilia A is an autoimmune disease caused by an inhibitory antibody to factor VIII. Patients with an acquired factor VIII inhibitor are at risk of life- and limb-threatening bleeding until the inhibitor has been eradicated. Management relies on rapid and accurate diagnosis, control of bleeding episodes, investigation for a precipitating cause, and eradication of the inhibitor by immunosuppression.

Patients should always be managed jointly with a specialist centre, even if they present without overt bleeding. Despite extensive literature, few controlled data are available, and management guidelines are predominantly based on case reports, retrospective cohorts, and expert opinion. This paper reviews the literature on incidence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, haemostatic therapy, and inhibitor eradication strategies. Potential future developments are discussed.

### In-depth structure-function profiling of the complex formation between clotting factor VIII and heme [^1168pXE9]. Thrombosis Research (2024). High credibility.

Blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease, and other clinical conditions are often accompanied by intravascular hemolytic events along with the development of severe coagulopathies. Hemolysis, in turn, leads to the accumulation of Fe(II/III)-protoporphyrin IX (heme) in the intravascular compartment, which can trigger a variety of proinflammatory and prothrombotic reactions. As such, heme binding to the blood coagulation proteins factor VIII (FVIII), fibrinogen, and activated protein C with functional consequences has been demonstrated earlier.
- **Methods**: We herein present an in-depth characterization of the FVIII-heme interaction at the molecular level and its (patho-)physiological relevance through the application of biochemical, biophysical, structural biology, bioinformatic, and diagnostic tools.
- **Results**: FVIII has a great heme-binding capacity with seven heme molecules associating with the protein. The respective binding sites were identified by investigating heme binding to FVIII-derived peptides in combination with molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies of the complex as well as cryo-electron microscopy, revealing three high-affinity and four moderate heme-binding motifs (HBMs). Furthermore, the relevance of the FVIII-heme complex formation was characterized in physiologically relevant assay systems, revealing a ~50% inhibition of the FVIII cofactor activity even in the protein-rich environment of blood plasma.
- **Conclusion**: Our study provides novel molecular insights into the FVIII-heme interaction and its physiological relevance.

### Molecular coevolution of coagulation factor VIII and von Willebrand factor [^114RK3dK]. Blood Advances (2021). Low credibility.

Ancestral sequence reconstruction provides a unique platform for investigating the molecular evolution of single gene products and has recently shown success in engineering advanced biological therapeutics. At the time of writing, the coevolution of proteins within complexes and protein-protein interactions is mostly investigated in silico via proteomics and/or within single-celled systems. Ancestral sequence reconstruction is used here to investigate the molecular evolution of two proteins linked not only by stabilizing association in circulation but also by their independent roles within the primary and secondary hemostatic systems of mammals. Using sequence analysis and biochemical characterization of recombinant ancestral von Willebrand factor (VWF) and coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), we investigated the evolution of the essential macromolecular FVIII/VWF complex. Our data support the hypothesis that these coagulation proteins coevolved throughout mammalian diversification, maintaining strong binding affinities while modulating independent and distinct hemostatic activities in diverse lineages.

### Somatic mosaicism in hemophilia A: a fairly common event [^113jBouV]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2001). Low credibility.

Mutations in the large gene of clotting factor VIII (FVIII) are the most common events leading to severe human bleeding disorder. The high proportion of de novo mutations observed in this gene raises the possibility that a significant proportion of such mutations does not derive from a single germ cell but instead should be attributed to a germline or somatic mosaic originating from a mutation during early embryogenesis. The present study explores this hypothesis by using allele-specific PCR to analyze 61 families that included members who had sporadic severe hemophilia A and known FVIII gene defects. The presence of somatic mosaicisms of varying degrees (0.2%-25%) could be shown in 8 (13%) of the 61 families and has been confirmed by a mutation-enrichment procedure. All mosaics were found in families with point mutations (8 [25%] of 32 families). In the subgroup of 8 families with CpG transitions, the percentage with mosaicism increased to 50% (4 of 8 families). In contrast, no mosaics were observed in 13 families with small deletions/insertions or in 16 families with intron 22 inversions. Our data suggest that mosaicism may represent a fairly common event in hemophilia A. As a consequence, risk assessment in genetic counseling should include consideration of the possibility of somatic mosaicism in families with apparently de novo mutations, especially families with the subtype of point mutations.

### An engineered interdomain disulfide bond stabilizes human blood coagulation factor VIIIa [^117JaaVW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

The blood coagulation disorder, hemophilia A, is caused by a deficiency of coagulation factor (F)VIII. Hemophilia A is now treated by infusions of pure FVIII, but the activity of FVIII is limited because it is unstable following activation by thrombin. This instability of activated FVIII results from the dissociation of the A2 subunit. To achieve increased stability in FVIIIa, a disulfide bond between the A2 domain and the A3 domain, preventing A2 subunit dissociation, has been engineered.

Structural analysis of the FVIII A domain homology model allowed us to identify residues 664 and 1826 as a potential disulfide bond pair. An FVIII mutant containing Cys664 and Cys1826 was produced and purified (C664-C1826 FVIII). Immunoblotting showed that a disulfide bond did form to link covalently the A2 and the A3 domains. Following activation of the recombinant C664-C1826 FVIII by thrombin, the mutant FVIIIa had increased stability and retained more than 90% of its clotting activity at a time at which wild-type FVIIIa lost more than 90% of its activity. This remarkably stable C664-C1826 FVIIIa provides a unique approach for studies of the cofactor activity of FVIIIa and also for new, improved therapy for hemophilia A.

### Cd36 regulates factor VIII secretion from liver endothelial cells [^114zoSJC]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) is essential for hemostasis, and elevated FVIII is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The liver is a major source of FVIII, and a subset of liver endothelial cells (ECs), marked by CD32+, produce high levels of FVIII.

FVIII is secreted by vesicle trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi and finally to the plasma membrane in a pathway that includes the proteins COPII, lectin mannose binding 1 (LMAN1), and the ER cargo receptor complex MCFD2. Lipopolysaccharide stimulates EC release of FVIII, but little is known about other agonists that induce FVIII release from ECs.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of FVIII have identified candidate genes that regulate FVIII levels in humans. A GWAS and whole-exome sequencing association study found 13 loci associated with plasma FVIII activity, of which one locus includes the CD36 gene. The lead genetic variant of CD36 associated with FVIII, designated rs3211938, is a loss-of-function variant. The minor allele frequency of this variant is 8% in individuals of African ancestry and is not detected in individuals of European ancestry. These data identify CD36 as a candidate protein that regulates FVIII levels in humans.

### Minimum factor VIII levels to prevent joint bleeding in mild hemophilia A [^1118xoS2]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

- **The bleeding phenotype**: The bleeding phenotype of patients with mild hemophilia A is heterogeneous according to the mean lifelong FVIII level.
- **Trough FVIII levels**: We identified the trough FVIII levels needed to prevent lifelong joint bleeds and at each quartile of age.

### Characterization of interaction between blood coagulation factor VIII and LRP1 suggests dynamic binding by alternating complex contacts [^116y2kyT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Blood coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) is a large heterodimeric protein (~300 kDa) consisting of a heavy chain (HCh, A1‐A2‐B domains) and a light chain (LCh, A3‐C1‐C2 domains). It circulates in complex with von Willebrand factor (VWF), which stabilizes FVIII in plasma. At coagulation sites, FVIII is site‐specifically cleaved by thrombin into activated FVIII (FVIIIa), which serves as a cofactor to activated factor IX in reactions of blood clotting. Congenital FVIII deficiency results in life‐threatening bleeding (hemophilia A) treated by infusions of therapeutic FVIII. To reduce infusion frequency, extended plasma half‐life FVIII variants are being generated, and optimal designs require understanding FVIII catabolic mechanisms.

### Structure-function relationships in factor IX and factor IXa [^111Vux5A]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Factor IX (FIX) consists of an N-terminal gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain followed by two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and the C-terminal serine protease domain. During physiologic coagulation, one of the activators of FIX is the FVIIa/tissue factor (TF) complex. In this reaction, the Gla and EGF1 domains of FIX are thought to interact with TF. The FIXa that is generated then combines with FVIIIa on the platelet surface to activate FX in the coagulation cascade. In this assembly, the protease domain and possibly the EGF2 domain of FIXa are thought to provide the primary specificity in binding to FVIIIa. Disruption of the interaction of FIX/FX with TF and of the FIXa:FVIIIa interface may provide a pharmacologic target as an alternative strategy for the development of antithrombotic agents.

### Pathogenic immune response to therapeutic factor VIII: Exacerbated response or failed induction of tolerance [^114xWgiK]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Hemophilia A is a rare X-linked hemorrhagic disorder resulting from insufficient levels of pro-coagulant factor VIII (FVIII). Patients with hemophilia A constitute a heterogeneous group of individuals. The disorder is classified into three severities based on the levels of circulating endogenous FVIII, reflecting the diversity of mutations in the gene encoding FVIII. Patients with a severe form of the disease have undetectable FVIII activity in plasma, whereas patients with mild and moderate hemophilia A have more than 1% of normal FVIII activity levels. Severe hemophilia A patients are further differentiated by the presence or absence of a non-functional FVIII protein (FVIII:Ag). For example, patients with the V634M missense mutation have normal levels of FVIII:Ag, though the protein is non-functional, while those with large deletions/intron inversions lack circulating protein. This variation in protein expression leads to diverse immune system education against endogenous FVIII among patients.

At the time of writing, preventing or treating bleeds in hemophilia A patients primarily depends on the intravenous administration of therapeutic FVIII, which is purified from healthy blood donors' plasma pools or produced using recombinant technology. Differences exist between plasma-derived and recombinant FVIII products, and among recombinant products themselves, in terms of structure, glycosylation pattern, and ability to bind von Willebrand factor.

### Biochemical, molecular and clinical aspects of coagulation factor VII and its role in hemostasis and thrombosis [^117Epen7]. Haematologica (2021). High credibility.

Blood coagulation is initiated by the formation of a complex between tissue factor (TF), a single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein, and activated factor VII (FVIIa), a serine protease highly dependent on TF for its procoagulant activity. The absence of either of these components is incompatible with life. However, small amounts of these proteins, interacting in the FVIIa-TF complex, are sufficient to initiate a number of reactions on membrane surfaces. The FVIIa-TF complex might also possess non-hemostatic signaling properties.

Detailed knowledge of the physiological and biochemical properties of FVIIa has enabled its pharmacological application as recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa), marking a significant advancement in the management of bleeding disorders. Genetic and clinical studies have defined the heterogeneous molecular basis of FVII deficiency and could lay the foundations for gene therapy.

Extensive plasma studies and genetic investigations have defined the importance of F7 gene variation in determining the large FVII variance in plasma concentration, with implications in predisposition to thrombosis in both individuals and the population as a whole.

A comprehensive review on FVII is complex due to the wealth of information available in the field of hemostasis and thrombosis. The main aim of this review is to provide an integrated and balanced perspective of the biological and clinical information currently available. Specifically, it examines the relationship between reduced levels of FVII and bleeding tendency, as well as high levels of FVII and the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Factor VIII as a potential player in cancer pathophysiology [^113T2uRe]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Factor VIII (FVIII) has been identified as an independent vascular thromboembolism (VTE) risk factor in cancer. However, the basis of this increase is unknown. The direct expression and secretion of FVIII by cancer cells were investigated. It was observed that FVIII is synthesized and secreted in a bioactive form directly by cancer cells in a pattern that reflects the origin and is independent of the expression of other coagulation factors. Evidence is provided of a possible independent role for FVIII in cancer-related pathophysiology.

### Factor VIIa binding and internalization in hepatocytes [^113u5TwG]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

The liver is believed to be the primary clearance organ for coagulation proteases, including factor VIIa (FVIIa). However, the clearance mechanisms for FVIIa in the liver are currently unknown. To investigate this, we explored the binding and internalization of FVIIa in liver cells using a human hepatoma cell line (HEPG2), as well as primary rat and human hepatocytes as cell models.

Using 125I-FVIIa, we determined that binding to HEPG2 cells occurred in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Anti-tissue factor antibodies reduced the binding by approximately 25%, whereas a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled FVIIa had no effect. HEPG2 cells internalized FVIIa at a rate of 10 fmol per 10⁵ cells per hour.

In contrast to HEPG2 cells, FVIIa binding to primary rat hepatocytes was completely independent of the tissue factor, and an excess of unlabeled FVIIa partially reduced the binding of 125I-FVIIa to rat hepatocytes. Furthermore, compared with HEPG2 cells, three- to fourfold more FVIIa bound to rat primary hepatocytes, and the bound FVIIa was internalized at a faster rate. Similar FVIIa binding and internalization profiles were observed in primary human hepatocytes.

Plasma inhibitors had no effect on FVIIa binding and internalization in hepatocytes. However, annexin V, which binds to phosphatidylserine, blocked both binding and internalization. Consistent with this, binding of the gla-domain-deleted FVIIa to hepatocytes was significantly diminished. In summary, the data presented reveal differences between HEPG2 cells and primary liver cells in FVIIa binding and internalization, suggesting rapid membrane turnover.

### Factor viii/v C-domain swaps reveal discrete C-domain roles in factor viii function and intracellular trafficking [^114KcYHg]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Factor VIII (FVIII) serves as a co-factor for activated factor IX (FIXa) in the factor X (FX) activating complex. It consists of 2332 amino acids with a distinct domain structure: A1-a1-A2-a2-B-a3-A3-C1-C2. Intracellular processing of the B-domain yields a heterodimeric FVIII protein with a 90–220 kDa heavy chain (A1-a1-A2-a2) non-covalently associated with a 80 kDa light chain (a3-A3-C1-C2). FVIII circulates in complex with the multimeric glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (VWF) that protects FVIII from premature clearance and proteolytic degradation. Complex assembly occurs over an extended surface on FVIII, spanning the entire light chain. The sulfated tyrosine on position 1680 is essential for binding to VWF, and mutation of this tyrosine results in impaired complex formation with VWF.

Recently, it has been shown that FVIII is expressed in endothelial cells. Previous work showed that FVIII overexpressed in endothelial cells co-sorts with VWF to the secretory organelles designated Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB). The precise interaction mediating sorting to WPB has not been clarified, although it has been generally assumed that VWF plays a key role as a sorting chaperone. In contrast to this view, we have shown that FVIII sorting to WPB does not require the high-affinity interaction via the sulfated tyrosine on position 1680 in the a3-domain. Moreover, endothelial cells with mutations in the FVIII C1- and C2-domains leading to impaired extracellular VWF/FVIII complex assembly show apparently normal expression of FVIII and storage in WPB.

### Biochemical, molecular and clinical aspects of coagulation factor VII and its role in hemostasis and thrombosis [^111x3Ema]. Haematologica (2021). Low credibility.

The crystal structure of the complex between the active-site-inhibited FVIIa and the cleaved, soluble extracellular domain of tissue factor (sTF) revealed the details of the contoured embrace of FVIIa and sTF domains and the extensive intermolecular contacts. Neutron and X-ray scattering experiments suggested that FVIIa in solution has an elongated domain structure with significant flexibility, allowing rapid interaction with sTF over a large surface area to form the high-affinity complex (dissociation constant, KD 2−5 nM).

The FVIIa-TF complex is highly dependent on specific lipids for physiological activity. Activated phospholipid membranes host both TF, an integral membrane protein, and FVIIa, which binds membranes through its GLA domain. The externalization of phosphatidylserine to the outer membrane leaflet and allosteric TF disulphide bond exchanges (decryption on membranes) make TF the FVIIa-activating cofactor. The FVIIa-TF complex formation shapes the FVIIa catalytic site by allosteric interactions and increases its activity up to 10⁶-fold. In fact, circulating FVIIa constitutes the active portion of the total FVII mass only after high-affinity binding with TF. These FVIIa-TF complex-specific molecular events that provide FVIIa with its physiological activity are believed to represent the true initiation of the extrinsic pathway.

### Solution structure of the major factor VIII binding region on von Willebrand factor [^114jkg95]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Although much of the function of von Willebrand factor (VWF) has been revealed, detailed insight into the molecular structure that enables VWF to orchestrate hemostatic processes, particularly factor VIII (FVIII) binding and stabilization in plasma, is lacking. Here, we present the high-resolution solution structure and structural dynamics of the D' region of VWF, which constitutes the major FVIII binding site.

D' consists of two domains: trypsin-inhibitor-like (TIL') and E'. The TIL' domain lacks extensive secondary structure, is strikingly dynamic, and harbors a cluster of pathological mutations leading to decreased FVIII binding affinity (type 2N von Willebrand disease [VWD]). This indicates that the backbone malleability of TIL' is important for its biological activity. The principal FVIII binding site is localized to a flexible, positively charged region on TIL', which is supported by the rigid scaffold of the TIL' and E' domain β sheets. Furthermore, surface-charge mapping of the TIL'E' structure reveals a potential mechanism for the electrostatically guided, high-affinity VWF⋅FVIII interaction.

Our findings provide novel insights into VWF⋅FVIII complex formation, leading to a greater understanding of the molecular basis of the bleeding diathesis type 2N VWD.

### Fviii inhibitors display FV-neutralizing activity in the prothrombin time assay [^112YZHP1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Coagulation factors VIII (FVIII) and V (FV) share significant similarity with regard to structure and function. They are both large, Ca 2+‐dependent plasma glycoproteins secreted as single inactive polypeptide chains that function as nonenzymic cofactors for serine proteases. FV and FVIII are proteolytically cleaved into heavy and light chains that are noncovalently associated by a Ca 2+ ion.

Hemophilia A (HA) is a rare bleeding disorder that can be congenital or acquired. HA patients lack functional FVIII and are given exogenous FVIII products to restore hemostasis. A complication of congenital hemophilia is the alloimmune response to FVIII biotherapeutics and the development and circulation of FVIII‐neutralizing antibodies that preclude these "inhibitor" patients from further treatment with FVIII. Because of the structural similarity between FVIII and FV, we hypothesized that there may exist some cross-reactivity between the FVIII-neutralizing antibodies in HA inhibitor patients and FV.

A recombinant anti-FVIII antibody panel, described previously, was used to test the novel research hypothesis that FVIII-neutralizing antibodies can cross-react with and neutralize FV owing to the high degree of homology that exists between these two proteins.

### Rational design of small molecules targeting the C2 domain of coagulation factor VIII [^116enqZD]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

The C domains of coagulation factors V (FV) and VIII (FVIII) are structurally conserved domains and share a common and essential function in membrane binding. In vivo regulation of thrombin formation strongly depends on the expression and regulation of the cofactor activities of FVIII and FV. With this study, we explored the possibility of inhibiting thrombin formation in full blood with small drug-like molecules. Such compounds may serve as lead molecules for the development of a new type of orally available coagulation inhibitors that act by blocking the interaction between the C domains of FVIII and the membrane surface.

We identified nine novel molecules capable of inhibiting the binding of the FVIII C2 domain to a model membrane by applying a combined ligand-based and target structure-based virtual screening approach. This approach took into account the knowledge of a set of previously identified low-molecular-weight FVIII binders that were, however, not active in full blood. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of our newly identified compounds varied from 2.1 to 19.9 µM. Of these, seven out of nine molecules did not appreciably inhibit FV membrane binding and were thus specific for FVIII. The most active bioactive compound showed activity in both plasma and in full blood.

### Hemophilia therapy: The future has begun [^116kTF1e]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

Among the more than 6,000 human diseases caused by single gene defects, the plasma deficiencies of coagulation proteins are of great importance to the hematologist, as they entail a lifelong bleeding tendency with significant morbidity and mortality if not adequately managed. Inherited coagulation deficiencies are considered rare diseases according to the definitions adopted in the United States (fewer than 200,000 cases nationwide) and Europe (fewer than 5 cases per 10,000 persons in the general population). The hemophilias are clinically relevant rare diseases: hemophilia A (HA), which results from the deficiency or dysfunction of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), and hemophilia B (HB) of factor IX (FIX). Both are due to mutations in genes located on chromosome X and thus largely affect males, with bleeding symptoms roughly proportional to the degree of factor deficiency in plasma. The main sites of spontaneous bleeding are joints and muscles, which, if inadequately treated, cause chronic damage to the musculoskeletal system resulting in severe handicaps and disability. Furthermore, trauma and surgical interventions are accompanied by uncontrolled bleeding.

A recent report on the worldwide distribution shows that the hemophilias are more frequent than previously estimated: 17.1 cases per 100,000 males with HA for all degrees of FVIII deficiency, 3.8 cases per 100,000 of HB, with a prevalence of 6 per 100,000 for HA and 1.1 per 100,000 for HB of cases with complete plasma factor deficiency and thus a more severe clinical phenotype.

### SPL drug information for factor VIIa (recombinant) [^113pcrw3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of factor VIIa (recombinant) IV for the treatment of bleeding episodes in adults with hemophilia A (with factor VIII inhibitors) is as follows:

- **Loading dose**: 15 mcg/kg IV every 2 hours, adjusted based on bleeding severity, until hemostasis is achieved or the treatment is deemed inadequate.
- **Subsequent dose**: 90 mcg/kg IV every 3 to 6 hours post-hemostatic for severe bleeding.

### Roctavian [^114wDSgq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients on tapering factor VIII concentrates/hemostatic agents and, as necessary, on whether and how to continue or restart their use, and on actions in case of invasive procedures, surgery, trauma, or bleeds. Advise patients that not all patients may respond to Roctavian and that currently it is not possible to predict who will respond and how long the treatment response will continue. Counsel patients, as necessary, on when they may need to reinstate prophylactic use of factor VIII concentrates/hemostatic agents.
- **Corticosteroid regimen and alternate immunosuppression**: Inform patients undergoing corticosteroid treatment to adhere to the regimen and about potential adverse reactions and necessary precautions. Advise patients that treatment with immunosuppressive agents other than corticosteroids may be required in case of intolerance, or adverse event from, or failure of corticosteroid therapy.
- **Hepatic health**: Advise patients on how to maintain or improve hepatic health. Advise patients that they should abstain from consuming alcohol for at least one year after treatment and determine how much alcohol may be acceptable for them in the longer term. Advise patients not to use any medications, herbal products, or supplements without first confirming with a health professional. [Content truncated.]

### Chromogenic factor VIII activity assay [^115MywmF]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Factor VIII (FVIII) may be measured by three different methodologies in the clinical laboratory: one-stage clotting assay, two-stage clotting assay, and chromogenic assay. These assays differ in ease of use, variety of reagents available, sensitivity to mild hemophilia A, and interference from lupus anticoagulants. This review will outline the methodology for each of the FVIII activity assays, with a discussion of assay interferences and variability. In some cases, chromogenic FVIII activity assays may be preferable to clot-based assays, and these clinical situations will be reviewed as well.

### Altuviio [^114McNsT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

For intravenous use after reconstitution only, Altuviio dosage and administration is crucial. Each Altuviio vial label states the Factor VIII potency in international units (IU). One IU corresponds to the Factor VIII activity contained in one milliliter of normal human plasma, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) international standard for Factor VIII concentrate. Potency assignment for Altuviio is determined using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one-stage clotting assay. It is recommended to use a validated one-stage clotting assay to measure Altuviio Factor VIII activity in plasma. The Altuviio Factor VIII activity level is overestimated by the chromogenic assay and a specific ellagic acid-based aPTT reagent in one-stage clotting assay by approximately 2.5-fold [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

For the dose of 50 IU/kg, the expected in vivo peak increase in Factor VIII level expressed as IU/dL (or % of normal) is estimated using the following formula:

Estimated Increment of Factor VIII (IU/dL or % of normal) = 50 IU/kg × 2 (IU/dL per IU/kg).

To achieve a specific target Factor VIII activity level, use the following formula:

Dosage (IU) = Body Weight (kg) × Desired Factor VIII Increase (IU/dL or % normal) × 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dL).
- **Routine prophylaxis**: The recommended dosing for routine prophylaxis for adults and children is 50 IU/kg of Altuviio, administered once weekly.
- **On-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes**: Altuviio dosing for the on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes is provided in Table 1.

### T cell recognition of the A2 domain of coagulation factor VIII in hemophilia patients and healthy subjects [^112tg5xb]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2004). Low credibility.

Hemophilia A patients treated with coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), and also some healthy subjects, may develop anti-FVIII antibodies (Ab), whose synthesis is driven by FVIII-specific CD4+ T cells. Some Ab block the procoagulant function of FVIII (inhibitors). Many inhibitors recognize epitopes on the FVIII A2 domain. Here, we have sought to identify A2 epitopes recognized by CD4+ T cells. We tested the proliferative response of CD4+ blood lymphocytes (BL) from hemophilia patients and healthy subjects to overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the A2 domain sequence. Many A2 peptides induced proliferative responses of CD4+ BL from one or more subjects. The peptide-induced responses were strongest in hemophilia patients with inhibitors and weakest in healthy subjects. A2 peptides comprising residues 371–400, 621–650, and 671–690 elicited frequent and strong responses in hemophilia A patients, especially in those with inhibitors. Healthy subjects recognized frequently only the sequence 371–400. A three-dimensional model of the A2 domain suggests that these CD4+ epitope sequences have structural features typical of 'universal' CD4+ T epitopes.

### Cellular stress and coagulation factor production: when more is not necessarily better [^115ebr8e]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Low credibility.

Remarkably, it has been 40 years since the isolation of the two genes involved in hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB), which encode clotting factor (F) VIII (FVIII) and FIX, respectively. Over the years, these advances led to the development of purified recombinant protein factors that are free of contaminating viruses from human pooled plasma for hemophilia treatments, reducing the morbidity and mortality previously associated with human plasma-derived clotting factors. These discoveries also paved the way for modified factors that have increased plasma half-lives.

Importantly, more recent advances have led to the development and Food and Drug Administration approval of a hepatocyte-targeted, adeno-associated viral vector-mediated gene transfer approach for HA and HB. However, major concerns regarding the durability and safety of HA gene therapy remain to be resolved. Compared with FIX, FVIII is a much larger protein that is prone to misfolding and aggregation in the endoplasmic reticulum and is poorly secreted by mammalian cells. Due to the constraint of the packaging capacity of the adeno-associated viral vector, B-domain deleted FVIII rather than the full-length protein is used for HA gene therapy. Like full-length FVIII, B-domain deleted FVIII misfolds and is inefficiently secreted. Its expression in hepatocytes activates the cellular unfolded protein response, which is deleterious for hepatocyte function and survival and has the potential to drive hepatocellular carcinoma.

This review focuses on our understanding of factors limiting FVIII secretion and the potential implications for gene therapy.

### Novel factor VIII variants with a modified furin cleavage site improve the efficacy of gene therapy for hemophilia A [^112BX65r]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

The major hurdle for gene-based therapeutics for hemophilia is the challenge of expressing therapeutic levels of clotting factor at a clinically relevant safe vector dose. Progress in the development of gene therapy for hemophilia A has been considerably slower than for hemophilia B because of the challenges of expressing FVIII. Even modest increases in expression may be critical for ensuring that gene therapy for hemophilia is ultimately realized. The development of FVIII variants with enhanced function in the setting of gene-based therapeutics is an important strategy for reducing the vector dose.

Other variants of FVIII that confer increased expression have been described; however, they rely on inserting a non-native amino acid sequence into the B-domain or replacing up to 10% of the human amino acid sequence with a porcine FVIII sequence. In contrast, the furin variants described here result in improved FVIII expression with a minimal modification (one to four amino acid deletion) that results in a new B-domain deleted form.

### Emerging genetic and pharmacologic therapies for controlling hemostasis: beyond recombinant clotting factors [^117HTgdd]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

For more than three decades, the scientific community has pursued gene correction of hemophilia, with the goal that an individual with congenitally deficient factor VIII or factor IX might synthesize adequate endogenous clotting factor to be relieved of burdensome repeated clotting factor infusions, as well as the emotional weight of continuous hemorrhage risk. Recent reports of successful factor IX gene therapy and partial correction of the bleeding phenotype have raised the bar for success for a robust crop of new clinical gene therapy efforts for both hemophilia A and B.

At the same time that gene therapy is gaining momentum, suggesting the possibility of relief from regular intravenous coagulation protein replacement, a number of innovative technologies that enhance hemostatic potential independently of replacement factor administration are demonstrating success in human clinical application. Human clinical trial progress is reviewed regarding a recombinant bispecific IgG antibody to factors IXa and X that mimics factor VIII cofactor activity, as well as monoclonal antibody and short interfering RNA strategies that demonstrate hemostatic efficacy via opposing inhibitors of coagulation. These strategies, associated with prolonged hemostatic potential following subcutaneous (ACE910, ALN-AT3, Concizumab) or single administration (e.g. gene therapy), make it possible to imagine a day when recombinant clotting factor administration, rather than being a daily preoccupation, is relegated to an adjunctive role in supporting more novel standard of care therapies.

### Factor VIII/V C-domain swaps reveal discrete C-domain roles in factor VIII function and intracellular trafficking [^112PAeox]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Factor VIII C-domains are believed to have specific functions in cofactor activity and in interactions with von Willebrand factor. We have previously shown that factor VIII is co-targeted with von Willebrand factor to the Weibel-Palade bodies in blood outgrowth endothelial cells, even when factor VIII carries mutations in the light chain that are associated with defective von Willebrand factor binding.

In this study, we addressed the contribution of individual factor VIII C-domains in intracellular targeting, von Willebrand factor binding, and cofactor activity by factor VIII/V C-domain swapping. Blood outgrowth endothelial cells were transduced with lentivirus encoding factor V, factor VIII, or YFP-tagged C-domain chimeras, and examined by confocal microscopy. The same chimeras were produced in HEK293 cells for in vitro characterization and chemical footprinting by mass spectrometry.

In contrast to factor VIII, factor V did not target the Weibel-Palade bodies. The chimeras showed reduced Weibel-Palade body targeting, suggesting that this requires the factor VIII C1-C2 region. The factor VIII/V-C1 chimera did not bind von Willebrand factor and had reduced affinity for activated factor IX, whereas the factor VIII/V-C2 chimera showed a minor reduction in von Willebrand factor binding and normal interaction with activated factor IX. This suggests that mainly the C1-domain carries factor VIII-specific features in assembly with von Willebrand factor and activated factor IX.

Footprinting analysis of the chimeras revealed increased exposure of lysine residues in the A1/C2- and C1/C domains.

### Consequences for the APTT due to direct action of factor XIa on factor X, resulting in bypassing factors VIII-IX [^114jimwW]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

It has recently been reported that factor XIa can activate factor X directly, bypassing factors VIII-IX. We evaluated the consequences for factor analysis with the one-stage APTT.
- **Methods**: APTT was performed with the Actin FS reagent using ellagic acid as the standard. Silica, high lipid (PTT-A), or low lipid (PTT-LA) were also tested. Factor-depleted and deficient plasmas were obtained from commercial sources.
- **Results**: The APTT clotting times in factor XII, XI, high molecular weight kininogen, factor X, and factor V deficient plasmas were all significantly longer (> 100s) than the clotting times of factor VIII- and IX-depleted or deficient plasmas (< 100s). That the shorter times for factor VIII and IX deficient plasmas were due to contact activation was supported by biphasic inhibition of the clotting times with the addition of corn trypsin inhibitor and Trasylol. The role of factor XI and the bypassing of factor VIII/IX was shown by the use of quenching antibodies towards factor XI and VIII. Enriching factor VIII or IX depleted plasma with purified factor XI and adding factor XIa showed a strong dependence on factor XI level. Calibration curves for factor analysis were steeper for factors FXII, HMWK, FX, and FV, compared to those of both factors VIII and IX. Curves for VIII/IX were found steeper by the use of APTT-A/silica-based, 50% diluted substrate plasma, and low factor XI in the substrate plasma.
- **Conclusions**: In factors VIII and IX deficient plasmas, the APTT shows activity which can be attributed to contact activation of factor X by factor XIa.

### Murine coagulation factor VIII is synthesized in endothelial cells [^117HydSA]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

The primary cellular source of factor VIII (FVIII) biosynthesis is controversial, with contradictory evidence supporting an endothelial or hepatocyte origin. LMAN1 is a cargo receptor in the early secretory pathway that is responsible for the efficient secretion of factor V (FV) and FVIII to the plasma. Lman1 mutations result in a combined deficiency of FV and FVIII, with levels of both factors reduced to approximately 10% to 15% of normal in human patients.

We generated Lman1 conditional knockout mice to characterize the FVIII secretion profiles of endothelial cells and hepatocytes. We demonstrate that endothelial cells are the primary biosynthetic source of murine FVIII and that hepatocytes make no significant contribution to the plasma FVIII pool. Utilizing RiboTag mice and polyribosome immunoprecipitation, we performed endothelial cell-specific messenger RNA isolation and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses to confirm that endothelial cells highly express F8 and to explore the heterogeneity of F8 expression in different vascular beds. We demonstrate that endothelial cells from multiple, but not all, tissues contribute to the plasma FVIII pool in the mouse.

### Pathogenic immune response to therapeutic factor VIII: exacerbated response or failed induction of tolerance [^114HELdV]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Therapeutic factor VIII is highly immunogenic. Despite intensive research in the last decades, the reasons why 5–30% of patients with hemophilia A (of all severities) develop inhibitory anti-factor VIII antibodies (inhibitors) following replacement therapy remain an enigma. Under physiological conditions, endogenous factor VIII is recognized by the immune system. Likewise, numerous observations indicate that, in hemophilia A patients without inhibitors, exogenous therapeutic factor VIII is immunologically assessed and tolerated.

A large part of the research on the immunogenicity of therapeutic factor VIII is attempting to identify the 'danger signals' that act as adjuvants to the deleterious anti-factor VIII immune responses. However, several inflammatory assaults concomitant to factor VIII administration, initially hypothesized as potential sources of danger signals (e.g. bleeding, infection, and vaccination), have been disproved to be such signals. Conversely, recent evidence suggests that cells from inhibitor-negative patients are able to activate anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic mechanisms required to suppress deleterious immune responses, while cells from inhibitor-positive patients are not.

Based on the available observations, we propose a model in which all hemophilia A patients develop anti-factor VIII immune responses during replacement therapy irrespective of associated danger signals. We further postulate that the onset of clinically relevant factor VIII inhibitors results from an inability to develop counteractive tolerogenic responses to exogenous factor.

### How we treat a hemophilia A patient with a factor VIII inhibitor [^113iZGqS]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

The most significant complication of treatment in patients with hemophilia A is the development of alloantibodies that inhibit factor VIII activity. In the presence of inhibitory antibodies, replacement of the missing clotting factor by infusion of factor VIII becomes less effective. Once replacement therapy is ineffective, acute management of bleeding requires agents that bypass factor VIII activity. Long-term management consists of eradicating the inhibitor through immune tolerance.

Despite success in the treatment of acute bleeding and inhibitor eradication, there remains an inability to predict or prevent inhibitor formation. Ideally, prediction and ultimately prevention will come with an improved understanding of how patient-specific and treatment-related factors work together to influence anti-factor VIII antibody production.

### Rational design of a fully active, long-acting PEGylated factor VIII for hemophilia A treatment [^114HJq4y]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

A long-acting factor VIII (FVIII) as a replacement therapy for hemophilia A would significantly improve treatment options for patients with this condition. To develop an FVIII with an extended circulating half-life, but without a reduction in activity, we engineered 23 FVIII variants with introduced surface-exposed cysteines to which a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer was specifically conjugated. Screening of variant expression levels, PEGylation yield, and functional assay identified several conjugates retaining full in vitro coagulation activity and von Willebrand factor (VWF) binding. PEGylated FVIII variants exhibited improved pharmacokinetics in hemophilic mice and rabbits.

In addition, pharmacokinetic studies in VWF knockout mice indicated that larger molecular weight PEG may substitute for VWF in protecting PEGylated FVIII from clearance in vivo. In bleeding models of hemophilic mice, PEGylated FVIII not only exhibited prolonged efficacy consistent with the improved pharmacokinetics but also showed efficacy in stopping acute bleeds comparable with that of unmodified rFVIII. In summary, site-specifically PEGylated FVIII has the potential to be a long-acting prophylactic treatment while being fully efficacious for on-demand treatment for patients with hemophilia A.

### Factor XI deficiency: Resolving the enigma [^114pboxn]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

The management of factor XI deficiency is complex due to three primary reasons. Firstly, the role of factor XI in the coagulation pathway is not clearly understood. Secondly, although the bleeding tendency is mild, it remains unpredictable and does not clearly relate to factor XI levels. Thirdly, although treatment products are available, they all carry some potentially serious side effects. These factors contribute to the variable management of patients with this coagulation factor deficiency. However, recent research is helping to clarify some of these areas.

### Novel factor VIII variants with a modified furin cleavage site improve the efficacy of gene therapy for hemophilia A [^115bz2kn]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Deficiencies in factor VIII (FVIII) cause hemophilia A (HA), an X‐linked bleeding disorder. Treatment for hemophilia involves protein replacement therapy, administered either prophylactically or in response to bleeding. Gene‐based approaches resulting in continuous FVIII expression offer several advantages, notably the prevention of bleeding episodes, which could reduce the disease's morbidity.

Gene therapy using adeno‐associated viral (AAV) vector‐mediated delivery of factor IX (FIX) for hemophilia B has shown promising results with sustained FIX expression. However, studies indicate the vector dose may be a limitation due to an anti‐AAV immune response. Thus, the safety of AAV‐mediated clinical studies for HA will also depend on minimizing the AAV vector dose.

Early studies of AAV‐canine FVIII delivery in HA dogs suggest the vector dose required to achieve therapeutic levels of FVIII may exceed that used for AAV‐FIX. FVIII gene transfer has been challenging due to the relatively inefficient expression of the FVIII protein. Success in HA gene therapy is anticipated with combined improvements in the transgene and vector leading to enhanced expression. Identifying novel FVIII variants with increased secretion and/or procoagulant activity may provide a strategy for reducing the vector dose in AAV delivery of FVIII.
- **FVIII function**: FVIII acts as a cofactor for FIX that activates FX in the intrinsic pathway.

### Hemostasis and endothelial functionality: The double face of coagulation factors [^112gykro]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor

Factor VIII (FVIII) and its partner, von Willebrand factor (vWF), engage in a tightly coordinated interplay within the coagulation cascade, forming a complex pivotal for hemostasis. vWF acts as a carrier protein for FVIII, safeguarding it from premature degradation in the bloodstream. Upon vascular injury, vWF adheres to exposed collagen at the injury site, facilitating platelet adhesion and aggregation. This localization of vWF-bound FVIII primes the coagulation process, enabling FVIII to interact with activated platelets and initiate the coagulation cascade, increasing the catalytic activity of factor IX (FIX) and, thus, activating factor X (FX).

Given the primary production of FVIII by endothelial cells (EC), recent studies have been investigating the link between FVIII and EC functionality. Specifically, FVIII has been shown to induce transcriptional and functional changes in EC leading to a decrease during in vitro adherence and increased permeability, with paxillin being the main mediator of these changes. An altered and uncontrolled joint vascular remodeling has also been shown in FVIII-deficient mice after the induction of hemarthrosis, suggesting a non-physiological angiogenic mechanism that could contribute to prolonged and repetitive bleedings.

Indeed, hemophilia A (HA) patients show reduced flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and hyperemic velocity time integral (VTI) compared to healthy controls, pointing to alterations of both macrovascular and microvascular endothelial functions, for which no clear culprit has yet been identified.

### Extrahepatic synthesis of factor VII in human atherosclerotic vessels [^116nyG1d]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2003). Low credibility.

Coagulation is initiated by the interaction of tissue factor (TF) with plasma coagulation factors VII (FVII) and X (FX). TF is highly expressed in atherosclerotic lesions, but little is known about the synthesis of FX or FVII outside of the liver. Previous studies suggested that macrophages synthesize FVII. We therefore hypothesized that macrophages within atherosclerotic lesions may produce FVII, leading to partial activation of the coagulation cascade.
- **Methods and results**: Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against FVII, FX, and TF on normal and atherosclerotic vessels. In atherosclerotic lesions, FVII immunostaining was colocalized with TF in macrophages and spindle-shaped smooth muscle cells. FVII mRNA was also detected in these cells using in situ hybridization, suggesting the local synthesis of FVII in atherosclerosis. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of FVII mRNA in normal and atherosclerotic vessels as well as smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes in vitro.
- **Conclusions**: The localization of FVII synthesis outside the liver may be indicative of other cellular functions for this coagulation protein. The observed coexpression of TF and FVII may contribute to autocrine signaling via thrombin-independent mechanisms and may represent a novel mechanism contributing to growth in the setting of vascular disease.

### Biochemical and functional characterization of a recombinant monomeric factor VIII-Fc fusion protein [^112wkv63]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Hemophilia A is an X-chromosome-linked bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency of functional clotting factor VIII. Individuals with hemophilia A experience prolonged bleeding after trauma and spontaneous bleeds into the soft tissue and joints, leading to joint damage and severe disability. Hemophilia A is treated with replacement therapy using either plasma-derived FVIII or recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) products. The prophylaxis standard of care involves repeated treatments with the replacement factor, typically three times per week or every other day, to maintain FVIII levels at ≥ 1%. A long-lasting FVIII molecule that can maintain prophylaxis with reduced frequency of injections, and potentially reduce the number of infusions needed to control a bleed on demand, may be useful to improve treatment outcomes.

FVIII is synthesized as an approximately 300-kDa (2332 amino acids) single-chain (SC) protein that consists of the structural domains A1–A2–B–A3–C1–C2, including a large B domain with no known function or homology to other proteins. The B domain is normally processed intracellularly at various positions to generate a heavy chain (HC) (A1–A2–B) varying from 90 to 200 kDa in size and an 80-kDa light chain (LC) (A3–C1–C2) that remain associated via metal ion-mediated, non-covalent interactions. Deletion of a large portion of the B domain from Ser743 to Gln1638 has no effect on the functional activity of FVIII but decreases the size of the protein significantly (38% reduction) to a 90-kDa HC and an 80-kDa LC, and increases FVIII expression.

### Treatment of rare factor deficiencies in 2016 [^114BgTL6]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Rare bleeding disorders (RBDs) are a heterogeneous group of coagulation disorders characterized by deficiencies in fibrinogen, prothrombin, factors V, VII, X, XI, or XIII (FV, FVII, FX, FXI, or FXIII, respectively), and the combined factor V + VIII and vitamin K-dependent proteins, representing roughly 5% of all bleeding disorders. They are usually transmitted as autosomal recessive disorders, and the prevalence of the severe forms can range from 1 case in 500,000 for FVII up to 1 in 2–3 million for FXIII in the general population. Patients affected with RBDs may present a wide range of clinical symptoms, varying from mucocutaneous bleeding, common to all types of RBDs, to the most life-threatening symptoms such as central nervous system and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Treatment of these disorders is mainly based on the replacement of the deficient factor using specific plasma-derived or recombinant products. In countries where these facilities are not available, bleedings can be managed using cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), or virus-inactivated plasma. Minor bleedings can be managed using antifibrinolytic agents. Recently, two novel drugs, recombinant FXIIIA and a plasma-derived FX, have been added to the list of available specific hemostatic factors. Only prothrombin and FV deficiencies still remain without a specific product. Novel non-replacement therapies, such as monoclonal antibody anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor, RNA interference, and a bispecific antibody that is an FVIIIa mimetic, enhance thrombin generation through different mechanisms.

### Specific and global coagulation assays in the diagnosis of discrepant mild hemophilia A [^115D8d4R]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

The activity of the factor VIII coagulation protein can be measured by three methods: a one- or two-stage clotting assay and a chromogenic assay. The factor VIII activity of most individuals with mild hemophilia A is the same regardless of which method is employed. However, approximately 30% of patients show marked discrepancies in factor VIII activity when measured with different methods. The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence of assay discrepancy in our center, assess the impact of alternative reagents on factor VIII activity assays, and determine the usefulness of global assays of hemostasis in mild hemophilia A.

Factor VIII activity was measured in 84 individuals with mild hemophilia A using different reagents. Assay discrepancy was defined as a two-fold or greater difference between the results of the one-stage and two-stage clotting assays. Rotational thromboelastometry and calibrated automated thrombography were performed. Assay discrepancy was observed in 31% of individuals; 12% had lower activity in the two-stage assay, and 19% had lower activity in the one-stage assay. The phenotype could not always be predicted from the individual's genotype. Chromogenic assays were shown to be a suitable alternative to the two-stage clotting assay. Thromboelastometry was found to have poor sensitivity in hemophilia. Calibrated automated thrombography supported the results obtained by the two-stage and chromogenic assays. International guidelines do not define the type of assay to be used in the diagnosis of mild hemophilia A, and some patients could…

### How we choose factor VIII to treat hemophilia [^115F7pHe]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

In high-income countries, the large availability of coagulation factors for replacement therapy of patients with hemophilia A has raised the life expectancy of these lifelong bleeders to that of males from the general population. The practicing clinician is offered a multitude of choices among several commercial brands of factor VIII extracted from human plasma or engineered from mammalian cell cultures by means of recombinant DNA technology. This article aims to offer our opinions on how to choose among the different products, which we consider interchangeable regarding their clinical efficacy in the control of bleeding and safety from pathogen transmission.

- **Price and risk of inhibitory alloantibodies**: The main determinants of our choices are price and the risk of occurrence of factor VIII inhibitory alloantibodies.

- **Categories of patients**: With this as background, we present the rationale underlying the choices for different categories of patients with severe hemophilia A: previously untreated patients, multiply treated patients, and patients undergoing immune tolerance induction with large doses of factor VIII to eradicate inhibitors.

Mention is also made of the possible strategies that should be implemented to make available coagulation factors for replacement therapy in developing countries.

### Presentation and management of a stage Ia lung cancer patient with a paraneoplastic factor VIII inhibitor [^116W1fuz]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Acquired inhibitors to clotting factors most commonly involve factor VIII and are associated with autoimmune disease. Factor VIII inhibitors can cause severe spontaneous and iatrogenic bleeding that is difficult to manage. They are rarely associated with solid tumors, and only three cases of adenocarcinoma of the lung have been reported. This report describes the multidisciplinary management of a factor VIII inhibitor-producing stage Ia lung adenocarcinoma, which ultimately resulted in complete resectability.

### Activation of human endothelial cells from specific vascular beds induces the release of a FVIII storage pool [^112qdyyw]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Although the liver is known to be the main site of factor VIII (FVIII) production, other organs are probably also important for the regulation of FVIII secretion. However, the study of the regulation of extrahepatic FVIII production has been hampered by the lack of definitive identification of human tissues able to secrete FVIII. Recent studies have shown that lung endothelial cells can synthesize FVIII. We therefore studied the production of FVIII by endothelial cells purified from other vascular beds.

Because physiologic stress results in a rapid elevation of FVIII, we also investigated whether endothelial cells can store FVIII and secrete it after treatment with agonists. Microvascular endothelial cells from lung, heart, intestine, and skin, as well as endothelial cells from the pulmonary artery, constitutively secreted FVIII and released it after treatment with phorbol-myristate acetate and epinephrine. By contrast, endothelial cells from the aorta, umbilical artery, and umbilical vein did not constitutively secrete FVIII or release it after treatment with agonists, probably because of a lack of FVIII synthesis. Extrahepatic endothelial cells from certain vascular beds, therefore, appear to be an important FVIII production and storage site with the potential to regulate FVIII secretion in chronic and acute conditions.

### Recessively inherited coagulation disorders [^111TFg53]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Deficiencies of coagulation factors other than factor VIII and factor IX that cause bleeding disorders are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. These are rare, with prevalences in the general population varying between 1 in 500,000 and 1 in 2 million for the homozygous forms. As a consequence of the rarity of these deficiencies, the type and severity of bleeding symptoms, the underlying molecular defects, and the actual management of bleeding episodes are not as well established as for hemophilia A and B.

We investigated more than 1,000 patients with recessively inherited coagulation disorders from Italy and Iran, a country with a high rate of recessive diseases due to the custom of consanguineous marriages. Based upon this experience, this article reviews the genetic basis, prevalent clinical manifestations, and management of these disorders. The steps and actions necessary to improve the condition of these often neglected patients are outlined.

### Structural basis for inhibition of coagulation factor VIII reveals a shared antigenic hotspot on the C1 domain [^114hfjNV]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). High credibility.

Hemophilia A arises from dysfunctional or deficient coagulation factor (F)VIII, leading to inefficient fibrin clot formation and uncontrolled bleeding events. The development of antibody inhibitors is a clinical complication in hemophilia A patients receiving FVIII replacement therapy. LE2E9 is an anti-C1 domain inhibitor previously isolated from a mild/moderate hemophilia A patient and disrupts FVIII interactions with von Willebrand factor and FIXa, though the intermolecular contacts that underpin LE2E9-mediated FVIII neutralization are undefined.
- **Objectives**: To determine the structure of the complex between FVIII and LE2E9 and characterize its mechanism of inhibition.
- **Methods**: FVIII was bound to the antigen binding fragment (Fab) of NB2E9, a recombinant construct of LE2E9, and its structure was determined by cryogenic electron microscopy.
- **Results**: This report communicates the 3.46 Å structure of FVIII bound to NB2E9, with its epitope comprising FVIII residues S2040 to Y2043, K2065 to W2070, and R2150 to H2155. Structural analysis reveals that the LE2E9 epitope overlaps with portions of the epitope for 2A9, a murine-derived inhibitor, suggesting that these residues represent a shared antigenic region on the C1 domain between FVIII-/- mice and hemophilia A patients. Furthermore, the FVIII:NB2E9 structure elucidates the orientation of the LE2E9 glycan, illustrating how the glycan sterically blocks interactions between the FVIII C1 domain and the von Willebrand factor D' domain. A putative model of the FVIIIa:FIXa complex suggests potential clashing.

### New insight into how tissue factor allosterically regulates factor VIIa [^112194nR]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Factor VIIa (FVIIa) is the coagulation protease responsible for initiating a cascade of proteolytic events that lead to thrombin generation, resulting in fibrin deposition and platelet activation. Consequently, it has garnered interest as a target for clinical anticoagulant therapy. Given the critical importance of maintaining a balance between thrombosis and hemostasis, and FVIIa's position at the beginning of the coagulation process, FVIIa is subject to a variety of biological and biochemical control mechanisms, including allosteric influences exerted by cofactors, substrates, and inhibitors.

Essential for the proteolytic activity of FVIIa is its cofactor, tissue factor (TF). Major progress in elucidating the key influence of TF was made when the TF.FVIIa structure was determined in 1996; however, a molecular explanation of an important aspect of TF's influence — its effect on the active site — was not available until the recent determination of an FVII zymogen structure. In this review, we discuss the significance of unprecedented differences between these two structures in understanding the regulation of this important enzyme.

### Megakaryocytes endocytose and subsequently modify human factor V in vivo to form the entire pool of a unique platelet-derived cofactor [^116qirb5]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Factor Va (FVa), derived from plasma or released from stimulated platelets, is the essential cofactor in thrombin production catalyzed by the prothrombinase complex. Plasma-derived factor V (FV) is synthesized in the liver. The source(s) of the platelet-derived cofactor remains in question. We identified a patient homozygous for the FV(Leiden) mutation, who received a liver transplant from a homozygous wild-type FV donor. Eighteen days post-transplant, phenotypic analysis of the patient's platelet-derived FV indicated that the platelets were acquiring wild-type FV, consistent with the temporal differentiation of megakaryocytes and subsequent platelet production. Nine months post-transplant, the platelet-derived FV pool consisted entirely of wild-type FV. Consequently, megakaryocyte endocytosis of plasma-derived FV must account for the entire platelet-derived pool because blood-borne platelets cannot bind or endocytose FV.

Subsequent to this endocytic process, the patient's platelet-derived FV was cleaved to a partially active cofactor and rendered resistant to phosphorylation catalyzed by a platelet-associated kinase, and hence less susceptible to activated protein C-catalyzed inactivation. These data provide the first in vivo demonstration of an endocytosed plasma protein undergoing intracellular modifications that alter its function. This process results in the sequestration of active FVa within the platelet compartment, poised for immediate action subsequent to release from platelets at a site of injury.

### Factor VIII as a potential player in cancer pathophysiology [^112MGqNA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

In examining the potential causes of elevated circulating FVIII levels in cancer patients, it should be considered not only the sites of FVIII production, both physiological and cancer-related, but also that a body's response to cancer shares many wound healing and inflammatory proteins. In a physiological state, hepatocytes have long been considered the principal producers of FVIII. However, it is now largely accepted that the main production comes from the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, with FVIII also produced by organ-specific endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and megakaryocytes. In exclusively damaged endothelial cells in vitro, exogenous VEGF has been demonstrated to increase FVIII directly, whereas tumor-associated macrophages, attracted by chemokines to solid tumors, are well recognized for producing angiogenic and growth-promoting factors. Although endothelial cell damage and inflammatory cell populations, such as tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, may contribute to the elevated FVIII levels seen in cancer patients, the contribution of the tumor cells themselves remains unknown, with no direct evidence of FVIII synthesis at the time of writing.

Based on these observations, the goal of this investigation was to examine the expression and synthesis of FVIII in cancer, using bladder cancer as the model system. Herein, we demonstrate that FVIII expression is higher in bladder cancer with respect to normal bladder tissue, and it is synthesized and secreted by bladder cancer cells. Further, we demonstrate that this can be extended to cancers of differing origin.

### Pitfalls in the diagnosis of hemophilia severity: What to do [^116E7vmw]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Measurements of factor VIII coagulation activity (FVIII:C) may vary and result in misclassification of hemophilia A, leading to delays in the initiation of prophylactic treatment. We describe two young brothers who were diagnosed as moderate hemophilia patients and therefore were not prophylactically treated with factor VIII concentrate, despite frequent bleeding events.

These findings emphasize the importance of:

- **Multiple measurements**: Obtaining FVIII:C measurements by certified laboratories.
- **Adjustment of treatment**: Modifying treatment when test results do not correspond to clinical symptoms.
- **Relevance of additional DNA mutation analysis**: Conducting DNA mutation analysis in patients with hemophilia A.
- **Treatment in centers with expertise**: Ensuring treatment takes place in specialized centers.

### Structural insights into blood coagulation factor VIII: Procoagulant complexes, membrane binding, and antibody inhibition [^116Q49RE]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Advances in structural studies of blood coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) have provided unique insight into FVIII biochemistry. Atomic detail models of the B domain-deleted FVIII structure, both alone and in complex with its circulatory partner, von Willebrand factor (VWF), offer a structure-based rationale for hemophilia A-associated mutations that impair FVIII stability and increase FVIII clearance rates. This review discusses the findings from these studies and their implications for designing a recombinant FVIII with an improved circulatory half-life. Furthermore, recent structural studies of FVIII bound to inhibitory antibodies have enhanced our understanding of FVIII binding to activated platelet membranes and the formation of the intrinsic tenase complex. The integration of bioengineering and structural efforts to understand FVIII biochemistry will advance therapeutics for treating hemophilia A, whether through FVIII replacement therapies, immune tolerance induction, or gene therapy approaches.

### The tertiary structure and domain organization of coagulation factor VIII [^115gN4rr]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Factor VIII (fVIII) is a serum protein in the coagulation cascade that nucleates the assembly of a membrane-bound protease complex on the surface of activated platelets at the site of a vascular injury. Hemophilia A is caused by a variety of mutations in the factor VIII gene and typically requires replacement therapy with purified protein. We have determined the structure of a fully active, recombinant form of factor VIII (r-fVIII), which consists of a heterodimer of peptides containing the A1-A2 and A3-C1-C2 domains, respectively. The structure permits unambiguous modeling of the relative orientations of the five domains of r-fVIII.

Comparison of the structures of fVIII, fV, and ceruloplasmin indicates that the location of bound metal ions and glycosylation, both of which are critical for domain stabilization and association, overlap at some positions but have diverged at others.

### Regulation of coagulation factors during liver regeneration in mice: mechanism of factor VIII elevation in plasma [^115Uh3Cz]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

The profiles of coagulation factor production during the liver regeneration process remain to be fully elucidated. The present study aimed to perform a comprehensive analysis of whether hepatic gene expression was differentially regulated in relation to the secretion of biologically active coagulation factors, using a mouse model of liver regeneration.
- **Materials and methods**: Liver regeneration was induced by performing a 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PHx). Plasma samples were assessed for coagulation factor activities (fibrinogen, prothrombin, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII), and the liver mRNA levels of coagulation, anti-coagulation, and fibrinolytic factors were quantified by real-time RT-PCR during the phase of liver regeneration.
- **Results**: At the peak of liver regeneration, the expression levels for all of the genes analyzed were found to be reduced in a time-dependent manner. Consistent with the gene expression levels, plasma activities of all coagulation factors, except for FVIII, declined temporally during the same timeframe. FVIII paradoxically demonstrated a significant increase (P < 0.05) in plasma activities concomitant with the decrease of liver mRNA expression levels. We found that the increase in plasma FVIII activities might be associated with (1) a delay in the inactivation of plasma FVIII caused by increased VWF in plasma and decreased FVIII clearance in the liver, (2) the rapid release of FVIII from the storage sites, and (3) the alteration of intracellular trafficking pathways of FVIII.
- **Conclusions**: The present study demonstrated that the…

### Factor vii deficiency: A cause of (or risk factor for) bleeding [^1173ZVq4]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Low credibility.

Among the rare bleeding disorders, factor VII deficiency is the most common. However, correlating this deficiency with the bleeding phenotype is challenging. Lou and colleagues investigate a large cohort of unrelated factor VII deficient patients, providing further insight into the link between genotype and phenotype in this disorder.

### Correction of bleeding in experimental severe hemophilia A by systemic delivery of factor VIII-encoding mRNA [^112hkvhM]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

Transfection with factor VIII-encoding mRNA leads to factor VIII production in vitro, and we validated the capacity of mRNA transcribed in vitro using the FVIII HSQ and CoFVIII HSQ-encoding cDNA as templates to promote FVIII production. As the codon-optimization is for Homo sapiens, mRNA encoding FVIII HSQ or CoFVIII HSQ formulated in TransIT® was used to transfect human HEK293 cells (Figure 1B).

As a negative control, HEK293 cells were transfected with luciferase-encoding mRNA. Transfection with the two FVIII-encoding mRNA led to the in vitro production of similar amounts of FVIII (FVIII:Ag: 0.28 ± 0.03 IU/mL vs. 0.36 ± 0.04 IU/mL for FVIII HSQ and CoFVIII HSQ, respectively) and similar activities (FVIII:C: 0.20 ± 0.01 IU/mL vs. 0.24 ± 0.02 IU/mL, respectively). Accordingly, the specific activity of FVIII produced using both mRNA did not differ (0.72 ± 0.06 and 0.68 ± 0.08, respectively), suggesting that codon optimization has no beneficial effect on the production of FVIII when cells are transfected with mRNA, in our experimental system.

### Haemophilias A and B [^114jg3Wf]. Lancet (2003). Low credibility.

The haemophilias are inherited disorders in which one of the coagulation factors is deficient. Although deficiencies of factor VIII (haemophilia A) and factor IX (haemophilia B) are well recognized, von Willebrand's disease is much more common. Rare defects can occur in any of the coagulation factors.

In the past, men with haemophilia were likely to die in their youth. With advances in diagnosis, and especially with the development of safe and effective treatment, affected individuals can now look forward to a normal life expectancy. Complications of the disorder, particularly the development of antibodies that make treatment ineffective, and of treatment, such as transfusion-transmitted infections, have severely impacted these patients.

The future holds the realistic possibility of gene therapy. However, we must not forget that haemophilia is a worldwide disorder that requires significant economic resources not available for the majority.

Regarding the medical management of traumatic hemorrhage, particularly the use of recombinant factor VIIa, the ABC-T 2023 guidelines recommend considering the administration of recombinant activated coagulation factor VII (off-label) only if major bleeding and traumatic coagulopathy persist despite all other attempts to control bleeding, systemic homeostasis, and the best-practice use of conventional hemostatic measures.

### Cardiac surgery in patients with hemophilia: is it safe [^114B5Cd8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Hemophilia comprises a group of inherited bleeding disorders caused by low concentrations of specific coagulation factors. Hemophilia A and B are hereditary X-linked bleeding disorders caused by a deficiency or absence of coagulation factors VIII or IX, respectively. Factor XI deficiency, originally called hemophilia C, is less common and occurs primarily among Ashkenazi Jews. In contrast to hemophilia A and B, there is no relationship between the risk of bleeding and the extent of factor XI deficiency.

Recently, there have been remarkable strides in the diagnosis and treatment of hemophilia patients, especially regarding the development of safer and newer generations of factor concentrates. As a result, the life expectancy of these patients has increased, bringing it in line with that of the general population. However, with this increase in life expectancy, more hemophilia patients are confronted with age-related co-morbidities, including ischemic heart disease and degenerative valves, which necessitate surgical intervention. The deficiency of coagulation factors in hemophilia patients may provide a protective effect from thrombus formation but does not influence the mechanism of atherosclerotic development. This explains why hemophilia patients are not protected against arterial cardiovascular disease. In a recent study, Miesbach et al. found that approximately 30% of patients over the age of sixty with moderate or severe hemophilia were diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases.

Cardiac surgery is associated with coagulation abnormalities.

### Coagulation factor VIII: Biological basis of emerging hemophilia A therapies [^112rBz4U]. Blood (2024). High credibility.

Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) is essential for hemostasis. After activation, it combines with activated FIX (FIXa) on anionic membranes to form the intrinsic Xase enzyme complex, responsible for activating FX in the rate-limiting step of sustained coagulation. Hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B arise from inherited deficiencies in the activity of FVIII and FIX, respectively.

The treatment of HA over the last decade has benefited from an improved understanding of FVIII biology. This includes its secretion pathway, its interaction with von Willebrand factor in circulation, the biochemical nature of its FIXa cofactor activity, the regulation of activated FVIII by inactivation pathways, and its surprising immunogenicity.

These insights have facilitated biotechnology innovations, with first-in-class examples of several new therapeutic modalities recently receiving regulatory approval for HA. These include FVIII-mimetic bispecific antibodies and recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector-based gene therapy. Biological insights into FVIII also guide the development and use of gain-of-function FVIII variants aimed at addressing the limitations of first-generation rAAV vectors for HA.

Several gain-of-function FVIII variants, designed to have improved secretion, are currently incorporated into second-generation rAAV vectors and have recently entered clinical trials. Continued mutually reinforcing advancements in the understanding of FVIII biology and treatments for HA are necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of hemophilia therapy: normalizing hemostasis and optimizing well-being with minimal intervention.
