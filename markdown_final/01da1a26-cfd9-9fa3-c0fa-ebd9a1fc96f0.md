## Question

A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 12-hour history of melena and dizziness. He has a history of hypertension and takes amlodipine. On examination, he is pale, blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 98 bpm, and he is alert. Laboratory results show hemoglobin of 7.2 g/dL, platelets 220,000/μL, and normal coagulation studies. The gastroenterology team is consulted for management of his upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

According to current ACG guidelines, what is the recommended threshold for red blood cell transfusion in this patient, and should he be transfused at this time?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended red blood cell transfusion threshold for a 58-year-old man with melena, hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, and stable vitals, and whether he should be transfused now. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is hemodynamically stable upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Then, I should verify the ACG guideline recommendation for transfusion threshold in UGIB. Next, I will consider exceptions such as massive hemorrhage, hemodynamic instability, and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. After that, I should review the evidence base supporting restrictive transfusion. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and note practical next steps in management, including endoscopy timing and PPI therapy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and stability. This is acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding presenting with melena, hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, and pulse 98 bpm; he is alert and not in shock, so he is hemodynamically stable at presentation, which matters for applying restrictive transfusion thresholds [^1139Yjvs].

> I need to check the ACG guideline recommendation. The ACG UGIB guideline explicitly recommends a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy with a transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL for patients with UGIB, noting that this threshold is supported by randomized data and meta-analyses showing reduced rebleeding and mortality with restrictive strategies [^1139Yjvs] [^112qEc3x].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify whether any exceptions apply. The ACG guideline allows that a threshold of 8 g/dL may be reasonable in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, but it distinguishes this from acute coronary syndrome, where a higher threshold may be considered based on limited evidence; here, the patient has hypertension on amlodipine without known CAD or ACS, so the default restrictive threshold still applies [^1139Yjvs]. I should also confirm that he is not exsanguinating; the guideline notes that patients with hypotension or ongoing massive hemorrhage may require transfusion before hemoglobin reaches 7 g/dL, but his vitals are stable, so that exception does not apply here [^1139Yjvs].

> Next, I should review the evidence supporting restrictive transfusion. The pivotal RCT by Villanueva et al showed that a restrictive strategy (transfuse < 7 g/dL) reduced 6-week mortality and rebleeding compared with a liberal strategy (< 9 g/dL), and a meta-analysis of UGIB trials confirmed lower mortality and rebleeding with restrictive transfusion; these findings underpin the ACG's conditional recommendation for a 7 g/dL threshold [^116rRgF6] [^111i1iyG].

> Let me synthesize the decision. With hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL and stable hemodynamics, and no evidence of CAD or ACS, he is above the ACG-recommended restrictive threshold of 7 g/dL; therefore, transfusion is not indicated at this time. I should continue close monitoring of vitals, serial hemoglobin, and symptoms, and transfuse if hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dL or if he becomes hemodynamically unstable or develops ischemic symptoms [^1139Yjvs] [^112qEc3x].

> I should double-check practical next steps in management. Early risk stratification with a validated score such as Glasgow-Blatchford is appropriate, and upper endoscopy should be arranged within 24 hours; pre-endoscopic erythromycin can be considered to improve visualization, and high-dose PPI should be initiated while awaiting endoscopy, with endoscopic hemostasis for high-risk stigmata and PPI continuation afterward per guideline-directed care [^112qEc3x] [^112WxE8t].

> Final recommendation: Do not transfuse now. Maintain a restrictive strategy and transfuse only if hemoglobin falls below 7 g/dL or if hemodynamic instability, ongoing bleeding, or ischemic symptoms develop, recognizing that a threshold of 8 g/dL may be considered if significant cardiovascular disease is present, which is not the case here [^1139Yjvs] [^112qEc3x].

---

Per ACG guidelines, **transfuse if hemoglobin is < 7 g/dL** in stable UGIB patients [^1139Yjvs] [^112qEc3x]. For those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, **consider 8 g/dL** [^1139Yjvs] [^113nUZwa]. This patient is hemodynamically stable with hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, so **no transfusion is indicated now**. Monitor closely and transfuse only if hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dL or if hemodynamic instability develops [^1139Yjvs].

## ACG guideline recommendations on RBC transfusion in UGIB

The ACG recommends a **restrictive transfusion strategy** for UGIB, with a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dL for most hemodynamically stable patients [^1139Yjvs] [^112qEc3x]. This threshold is supported by randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses showing reduced rebleeding and mortality with restrictive transfusion [^116rRgF6] [^111i1iyG].

---

### Specific ACG recommendations

- **Restrictive transfusion threshold**: Hemoglobin < 7 g/dL for most hemodynamically stable patients with UGIB [^1139Yjvs] [^112qEc3x].
- **Higher threshold for cardiovascular disease**: Consider 8 g/dL in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (e.g. coronary artery disease, heart failure) [^1139Yjvs] [^113nUZwa].
- **Exsanguinating hemorrhage**: Transfuse regardless of hemoglobin if hypotension or ongoing massive bleeding is present [^1139Yjvs] [^112E1wD7].

---

## Evidence supporting restrictive transfusion strategy

Multiple high-quality studies support a **restrictive transfusion strategy** in UGIB:

| **Study** | **Design** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Villanueva et al. (2013) | RCT (n = 921) | - Restrictive strategy (Hb < 7 g/dL) reduced 6-week mortality (5.2% vs 9.2%) and rebleeding (10.1% vs 16.0%) compared to liberal strategy (Hb < 9 g/dL) [^116rRgF6] [^111i1iyG] |
| Jairath et al. (2013) | Cluster RCT (n = 936) | - No significant mortality difference between restrictive (Hb < 8 g/dL) and liberal (Hb < 10 g/dL) strategies <br/> - Lower transfusion rates and costs with restrictive strategy [^111i1iyG] |
| Meta-analyses | Multiple RCTs (n = 1,965) | - Restrictive strategy reduced mortality and rebleeding without increasing adverse events [^111i1iyG] |

---

## Clinical application to the presented case

The patient is a 58-year-old man with melena, hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, stable vitals (BP 110/70 mmHg, HR 98 bpm), and no known cardiovascular disease. According to ACG guidelines, **no transfusion is indicated** because hemoglobin is above 7 g/dL and he is hemodynamically stable [^1139Yjvs] [^112qEc3x]. Continue close monitoring of hemoglobin and hemodynamics, and transfuse only if hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dL or if instability develops [^1139Yjvs].

---

## Clinical implications of restrictive transfusion strategy

Adopting a restrictive transfusion strategy in UGIB offers several **clinical benefits**:

- **Reduced rebleeding**: Lower transfusion volumes and slower correction of anemia reduce portal pressure and rebleeding risk [^116rRgF6] [^111i1iyG].
- **Improved survival**: Lower mortality observed in restrictive strategy groups [^116rRgF6] [^111i1iyG].
- **Fewer transfusion-related complications**: Reduced risk of transfusion reactions, infections, and circulatory overload [^113nUZwa] [^113wikiD].

---

## Exceptions and special considerations

While restrictive transfusion is broadly applicable, **exceptions include**:

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Transfuse regardless of hemoglobin if hypotension or ongoing massive bleeding is present [^1139Yjvs] [^112E1wD7].
- **Pre-existing cardiovascular disease**: Consider a higher threshold (8 g/dL) in patients with coronary artery disease or heart failure [^1139Yjvs] [^113nUZwa].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Clinical judgment should guide decisions in elderly patients or those with significant comorbidities [^114G4DLD].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Restrictive transfusion threshold**: Hemoglobin < 7 g/dL for most stable UGIB patients [^1139Yjvs] [^112qEc3x].
- **Higher threshold for cardiovascular disease**: Consider 8 g/dL in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease [^1139Yjvs] [^113nUZwa].
- **Hemodynamic instability**: Transfuse regardless of hemoglobin if hypotension or ongoing massive bleeding is present [^1139Yjvs] [^112E1wD7].

---

The ACG recommends a **restrictive transfusion strategy** with a threshold of 7 g/dL for stable UGIB patients, with a higher threshold of 8 g/dL for those with cardiovascular disease. Given this patient's stability and hemoglobin of 7.2 g/dL, **no transfusion is indicated** at this time.

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^1139Yjvs]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Red blood cell transfusion in upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) — we suggest a restrictive policy of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion with a threshold for transfusion at a hemoglobin of 7 g/dL for patients with UGIB (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). A threshold of 7 g/dL was chosen because the randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrating benefit of restrictive transfusion in UGIB used 7 g/dL, and a meta-analysis found no significant mortality difference between trials using a restrictive threshold of 8–9 g/dL (RR = 1.05, 0.78–1.40) and those using 7 g/dL (RR = 0.94, 0.74–1.19). Given the exclusion of exsanguinating UGIB from these RCTs, the panel agreed it is reasonable to transfuse in hypotensive patients before hemoglobin reaches 7 g/dL. A threshold of 8 g/dL is reasonable in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease; this population must be differentiated from those who present with acute coronary syndrome, in whom a threshold higher than 7 g/dL may be considered, based on very limited evidence. Conclusion notes that a restrictive RBC transfusion policy with a threshold of 7 g/dL seems to reduce further bleeding and death.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^114DvcgU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) management algorithm — risk stratification and interventions: High-risk patients are managed with resuscitation using intravenous fluids and, if indicated, blood product transfusion, with consideration for intensive care unit management, exclusion of an upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) source, and there is no role for unprepped colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy. If the patient remains hemodynamically unstable and intolerant to colonoscopy preparation, proceed to radiographic intervention (angiography; consider preceding computed tomographic angiography for localization), consult surgery, and perform elective colonoscopy after bleeding resolves. If the patient hemodynamically stabilizes and no UGIB is found per esophagogastroduodenoscopy/nasogastric tube, perform colonoscopy < 24 h from presentation after hemodynamic resuscitation and administer 4–6 l of polyethylene glycol solution over 3–4 h until rectal effluent is clear of blood and stool. In low-risk patients, resuscitate if needed with intravenous fluids and blood product transfusion and manage on the regular hospital floor; if the patient remains hemodynamically stable, perform colonoscopy at the next available time after 4–6 l of polyethylene glycol solution until rectal effluent is clear of blood and stool. Apply endoscopic hemostasis for high-risk stigmata with modality based on bleeding source, location, and endoscopist experience, and consider repeat colonoscopy with endoscopic hemostasis for evidence of recurrent bleeding. Packed red blood cell transfusion is to maintain Hgb ≥ 7 g/dl, with a threshold of 9 g/dl considered in patients with significant comorbid conditions or expected delay in intervention.

### Delphi consensus statement for the management of delayed post-polypectomy bleeding [^116jdiiA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Statement 7
In hemodynamically stable patients with significant cardiovascular comorbidity, red blood cell transfusion is recommended for hemoglobin levels ≤ 8–9 g/dL with a post-transfusion target of 9–10 g/dL. In hemodynamically stable patients without cardiovascular comorbidity, the hemoglobin threshold for blood transfusion should be ≤ 7 g/dL, with a target range of 7–9 g/dL.
Strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. (Strongly agree: 69.2%; agree: 30.8%)
Statement 8
SEED recommends following severe bleeding protocols for blood transfusion in hemodynamically unstable patients, rather than relying solely on hemoglobin levels.
Good Practice Statement. (Strongly agree: 60.7%; agree: 39.3%)

No specific recommendations regarding transfusion for DPPB have been identified. A post hoc study in patients with LGIBconcluded that, although there were no statistically significant differences between restrictive strategies (Hb threshold < 7 mg/dL) and liberal strategies (transfusion threshold < 9 mg/dL), a trend toward reduced rebleeding and severe events was observed with restrictive strategies. The recommendation for restrictive transfusion strategies is primarily extrapolated from evidence in upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with significant cardiovascular comorbidity or advanced age may benefit from a less restrictive transfusion threshold. Given the lack of specific studies on DPPB, our recommendations are in line with current guidelines on LGIB.

For patients with hemorrhagic shock, a different approach is warranted, involving volume resuscitation and blood component transfusion according to severe bleeding protocols. Platelet transfusion and fibrinogen replacement should be guided by laboratory parameters. –

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^1141VzhG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Transfusion and coagulopathy evidence — restrictive red blood cell (RBC) strategies in upper gastrointestinal bleeding are cited, with a transfusion threshold of hemoglobin < 7 g/dl improving survival (95% vs. 91%) and decreasing rebleeding (10% vs. 16%) when compared with a threshold of 9 g/dl. Traditionally, massive transfusion has been defined as more than 10 units of packed RBCs within a 24-h period, but recent trauma literature defines this threshold as 3 or more units within 1 h. International normalized ratio (INR) has prognostic associations: an INR > 1.5 has been a predictor of mortality but not rebleeding, with adjusted odds ratios for mortality reported as 1.96 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13–3.41) and 5.63 (95% CI, 3.09–10.27); a retrospective study of 98 patients with GI bleeding suggested that patients with an INR > 4 had outcomes comparable to those with an INR in the 3–3.9 range, though they were not compared with patients with normal coagulation parameters.

### First-line treatment for hypertension… [^114uHcvd]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario A 53-year-old, otherwise healthy woman presents with persistent hypertension despite lifestyle changes. She saw an advertisement on television about a new hypertension medication and asks about it for treatment. Clinical Question What class of medications is the best first-line treatment for hypertension. Evidence-Based Answer In comparing the effects of thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers with placebo, thiazide diuretics lowered mortality and morbidity from stroke, heart attack, and heart failure more than beta blockers. 1 ACE inhibitors and CCBs reduced mortality and morbidity as much as thiazide diuretics, but the evidence is less robust.

Because the use of thiazide diuretics is supported by a strong body of evidence and no other class of antihypertensive medications has been shown to be better at improving outcomes, they are the first-line drugs for most patients with hypertension. Current evidence does not support using beta blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension. Cochrane Abstract Background: Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug is the best first-line option. This review answers that question. Objectives: To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers.

Data Collection and Analysis: The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular events, decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials. Beta blockers reduced stroke and cardiovascular events, but not CHD or mortality. Practice Pointers The choice of hypertension medication should be informed by evidence about its effectiveness in reducing adverse health outcomes, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and mortality. In this Cochrane review, the authors quantified the effectiveness of four classes of antihypertensive medications versus placebo in reducing mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular events. 1 If taken for five years, thiazide diuretics were highly effective in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. In patients with moderate to severe hypertension, thiazide diuretics were effective in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. However, only low-dose thiazide diuretics were effective; high-dose thiazide diuretics were no different than placebo in risk of mortality and cardiovascular events.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^112K37Q7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) — initial assessment and stabilization: A focused history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained at the time of patient presentation to assess the severity of bleeding and its possible location and etiology, and initial patient assessment and hemodynamic resuscitation should be performed simultaneously. Patients with hemodynamic instability and/or suspected ongoing bleeding should receive intravenous fluid resuscitation with the goal of optimization of blood pressure and heart rate before endoscopic evaluation/ intervention. Hematochezia associated with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an UGIB source, and an upper endoscopy should be performed if the suspicion is high to exclude a proximal source of bleeding. Endoscopic hemostasis can be considered safe and effective in patients who have an INR of 2.5 or less. Platelets should be administered in the setting of severe LGIB to maintain a platelet count of > 30 × 10⁹/L, and a higher threshold of > 50 × 10⁹/L can be considered if endoscopic procedures are required, and there is no benefit to routine platelet transfusion for patients on antiplatelets.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^1169oCmw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Management of coagulation defects — recommendations for acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding state that endoscopic hemostasis may be considered in patients with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5–2.5 before or concomitant with the administration of reversal agents, and reversal agents should be considered before endoscopy in patients with an INR ≥ 2.5 (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). Platelet transfusion should be considered to maintain a platelet count of 50 × 10⁹/l in patients with severe bleeding and those requiring endoscopic hemostasis (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence), and platelet and plasma transfusions should be considered in patients who receive massive red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). In patients on anticoagulant agents, a multidisciplinary approach should be used when deciding whether to discontinue medications or use reversal agents to balance the risk of ongoing bleeding with the risk of thromboembolic events (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

Blood product transfusion

Packed red cells

Restrictive transfusion of packed red cells in the context of non-life-threatening UGIB has become the standard of care and is recommended by all major guidelines. A meta-analysis involving 12 587 patients, across 31 randomised controlled trials, who required a transfusion due to a range of causes, including acute blood loss, compared outcomes based on restrictive or liberal transfusion. A restrictive transfusion threshold, most commonly a haemoglobin concentration of 7–8 g/dL, did not alter mortality at 30 days (risk ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.16). Restrictive transfusion was not associated with increased adverse events in people with cardiovascular disease, but data were insufficient to be able to comment on those presenting with acute coronary syndrome. Owing to the heterogenous reasons for transfusion, the populations in this study might not be directly comparable to those with UGIB.

Within the setting of UGIB, a single centre randomised controlled trial from Spain assigned 921 patients to a restrictive (haemoglobin concentrations of < 70 g/L) versus a liberal (< 90 g/L) transfusion strategy. People receiving a restrictive strategy had a significantly lower risk of death at six weeks (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 0.92) after adjusting for baseline risk factors. A subsequent, large, UK, cluster randomised controlled trial reported no difference in clinical outcomes when comparing transfusions thresholds of less than 8 g/dL with less than 10 g/dL in patients presenting with UGIB. A meta-analysis of restrictive versus liberal packed red cells transfusion in UGIB including 1965 patients from five randomised controlled trials showed that restrictive transfusion was associated with lower mortality (relative risk 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 0.97; P = 0.03) and reduced rebleeding (0.58, 0.40 to 0.84; P = 0.004).

Importantly, patients with exsanguinating bleeding were excluded from most transfusion trials. Owing to intravascular volume depletion, haemoglobin concentrations can be artificially high in this group. Although not advising target orientated resuscitation, the British Society of Gastroenterology variceal guidelines suggest that a venous saturation of more than 70% is an easily measurable level within the resuscitation setting and a useful guide for clinicians.

### Diagnosis and management of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^1165fCHX]. Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

1: ESGE recommends that the initial assessment of patients presenting with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding should include: a history of co-morbidities and medications that promote bleeding; hemodynamic parameters; physical examination (including digital rectal examination); and laboratory markers. A risk score can be used to aid, but should not replace, clinician judgment. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that, in patients presenting with a self-limited bleed and no adverse clinical features, an Oakland score of ≤ 8 points can be used to guide the clinician decision to discharge the patient for outpatient investigation. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding and no history of cardiovascular disease, a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 7g/dL prompting red blood cell transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin concentration of 7-9g/dL is desirable. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 4: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding and a history of acute or chronic cardiovascular disease, a more liberal red blood cell transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 8g/dL prompting red blood cell transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin concentration of ≥ 10g/dL is desirable.

Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 7: ESGE recommends withholding vitamin K antagonists in patients with major lower gastrointestinal bleeding and correcting their coagulopathy according to the severity of bleeding and their thrombotic risk. In patients with hemodynamic instability, we recommend administering intravenous vitamin K and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or fresh frozen plasma if PCC is not available. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends temporarily withholding direct oral anticoagulants at presentation in patients with major lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 9: ESGE does not recommend withholding aspirin in patients taking low dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention. If withheld, low dose aspirin should be resumed, preferably within 5 days or even earlier if hemostasis is achieved or there is no further evidence of bleeding. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 10: ESGE does not recommend routinely discontinuing dual antiplatelet therapy (low dose aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist) before cardiology consultation. Continuation of the aspirin is recommended, whereas the P2Y12 receptor antagonist can be continued or temporarily interrupted according to the severity of bleeding and the ischemic risk. If interrupted, the P2Y12 receptor antagonist should be restarted within 5 days, if still indicated. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.

### Impact of blood transfusion on mortality and rebleeding in gastrointestinal bleeding: an 8-year cohort from a tertiary care center [^114fkegr]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a common medical emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Blood transfusion (BT) is an essential cornerstone in the management of GIB, and is administered to around 30–60% of patients with GIB. The impact of BT on clinical outcomes in GIB is controversial. Several observational studies have suggested that BT may be associated with an increased risk of mortality and rebleeding, particularly in patients with portal hypertension. Although these studies were limited by the fact that transfused patients are generally sicker than non-transfused ones, 2 recent studies that used propensity matching to compare transfused and non-transfused patients suggested that BT does indeed increase the risk of mortality and rebleeding. Furthermore, in a prospective study of patients presenting with GIB, BT was found to be an independent predictor of 1-year mortality.

The American College of Gastroenterology, European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, and British Society of Gastroenterology recommend a restrictive BT strategy for all patients with GIB, except those with hemodynamic instability or cardiovascular disease. Those recommendations were conditional to strong and were based on low-to-moderate quality evidence. This stems from a few randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, and meta-analyses suggesting that a restrictive BT strategy may be associated with better short-term survival and rebleeding risk compared to a liberal strategy. It was not clear, however, if this applies to patients with non-variceal upper GIB (UGIB), those with hemodynamic instability, severe GIB, lower GIB (LGIB), or cardiovascular disease. In addition, the definition of restrictive and liberal strategies was not uniform. Interestingly, a post hoc analysis by Nightingale et al proposed that the optimal BT threshold for reducing mortality in GIB may be higher than the one currently recommended by guidelines, and that mortality is related to the number of blood units transfused and the lowest hemoglobin (Hb) level patients reach.

Current guidelines have another limitation, as few studies examined the effects of antithrombotics (AT) on outcomes in transfused patients with GIB, and none have evaluated the long-term risk of rebleeding and mortality in relation to transfusion strategy. Consequently, the optimal transfusion strategy, including threshold and target Hb levels, remains uncertain. This study sought to address this gap by examining the association between BT thresholds and mortality and rebleeding rates in patients with all-cause overt GIB, while also considering the influence of AT medication.

### Initial assessment and resuscitation in nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^1124BXKA]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding remains an important cause of hospital admission with an associated mortality of 2–14%. Initial patient evaluation includes rapid hemodynamic assessment, large-bore intravenous catheter insertion and volume resuscitation. A hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL is recommended, and packed red blood cell transfusion may be necessary to restore intravascular volume and improve tissue perfusion. Patients should be risk stratified into low- and high-risk categories, using validated prognostic scoring systems such as the Glasgow-Blatchford, AIMS65 or Rockall scores. Effective early management of acute, nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is critical for improving patient outcomes.

We recommend that red blood cell (RBC) transfusion should follow a restrictive protocol (trigger: Hb < 70 g/L; target: 70–100 g/L). A higher trigger should be considered in patients with ischaemic heart disease or haemodynamic instability

Level of evidence: High

Level of recommendation: Strong

Agreement: 100%

Bundle recommendation: Transfuse if Hb < 70 g/L with a target of 70–100 g/L (100% agreement)

Five RCTs have assessed the use of different transfusion thresholds; these were summarised in a systematic review (n = 1965). Ninety-three per cent of patients were derived from two RCTs which included both variceal and non-variceal AUGIB. Only one RCT included participants regardless of age, comorbidity or history of ischaemic heart disease. The study by Villanueva et al (n = 889) was a single-centre Spanish RCT that compared a threshold of 70 g/L with 90 g/L. All participants received endoscopy within 6 hours. The study by Jairath et al was a multicentre UK cluster randomised RCT that compared a threshold of 80 g/L with 100 g/L. In the meta-analysis, a restrictive transfusion strategy was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality at 30 days (26 fewer deaths per 1000; 95% CI 2 to 42); rebleeding (57 fewer rebleeding episodes per 1000; 95% CI 21 to 81), transfusion requirement (mean difference −1.73 RBC units; 95% CI −2.36 to −1.11); number of people who required a transfusion (276 fewer per 1000; 95% CI 164 to 361) and LOS (mean difference −1.9 days; 95% CI 3.34 to 0.46). No difference was found between the variceal and non-variceal subgroups. No RCTs included participants with exsanguinating haemorrhage, where haemoglobin may not be an accurate measure of blood loss. In such cases, patients should be managed in line with major haemorrhage guidelines. Rates of RBC transfusion should be guided by the speed of blood loss and the level of haemodynamic compromise.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116hKrRt]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding in critically ill adults — In critically ill patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding, we recommend a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy over a permissive RBC transfusion strategy (Strong Recommendation, Moderate Certainty of Evidence). In aggregate, the restrictive transfusion strategy reduced short-term mortality (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48–0.97) without affecting hospital LOS (MD, −0.69 days; 95% CI, −1.98 to +0.60 days). Pooled outcomes from gastrointestinal bleeding show 30-d mortality 0.68 (0.48–0.97) with 27 fewer per 1,000 (43 fewer-2 fewer), acute transfusion reactions 0.35 (0.20–0.61) with 37 fewer per 1,000 (45 fewer-22 fewer), adverse transfusion effects 0.73 (0.58–0.91) with 54 fewer per 1,000 (83 fewer-18 fewer), and need for surgery in upper gastrointestinal bleeding 0.67 (0.16–2.91) with 13 fewer per 1,000 (33 fewer-74 more). This recommendation aligned with those of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, the American College of Gastroenterology, and the American Gastroenterological Association.

### Determinants of empiric transfusion in gastrointestinal bleeding in the emergency department [^116SzVuU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Current guidelines for the management of GI bleeding (GIB) recommend restrictive transfusion triggers unless patients have shock or specific comorbidities. However, these studies may not be applicable to Emergency Department (ED) patients. Factors determining transfusion decisions in the ED are poorly understood. We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes between ED patients with GI bleeding transfused at lower or higher empiric hemoglobin levels.

Methods

Single center, retrospective analysis of hospital records from a large tertiary care center of ED patients diagnosed with GIB who underwent red blood cell transfusion in the ED. A pre-transfusion hemoglobin cutoff of 7 g/dl was used to divide patients into restrictive and empirically transfused groups. Demographics, mortality, hospital length-of-stay, and mortality risk estimates were compared between groups.

Results

175 patients met inclusion criteria, with 120 restrictive patients (68.5%) and 55 liberal patients (31.4%). The sample was 49.7% male, with mean age 67.2 years, similar between groups. Patients in the empiric transfusion group had more acute emergency severity index scores (2.09 vs. 2.3). No difference was found between groups in triage vital signs, pre-endoscopy Rockall scores or mortality estimates, or length of stay. Most common reasons for empiric transfusion from chart review were hypotension and witnessed large hemorrhage.

Conclusions

Patients that were empirically transfused had similar presentations to patients meeting restrictive guidelines, based on review of triage data. Transfusions above restrictive thresholds occurred frequently in our population. Additional studies are required to clarify appropriate criteria to guide transfusions for GIB in the ED.

Results

The hemoglobin thresholds prompting RBC transfusion varied across studies, with a restrictive threshold generally defined as a hemoglobin level of 7 to 8 g/dL and a permissive threshold typically ranging from a hemoglobin level of 8.5 to 10 g/dL (Table 1). Hemodynamic instability typically has been defined as hypotension (mean arterial pressure, < 65 mm Hg, or systolic BP, < 100 mm Hg), tissue hypoperfusion caused by acute bleeding, or both.

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^112qEc3x]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) management summarizes key acute care recommendations as follows: We suggest risk assessment in the emergency department to identify very-low-risk patients (e.g. Glasgow-Blatchford score = 0–1) who may be discharged with outpatient follow-up. For patients hospitalized with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, we suggest red blood cell transfusion at a threshold of 7 g/dL. Erythromycin infusion is suggested before endoscopy, and endoscopy is suggested within 24 hours after presentation. Endoscopic therapy is recommended for ulcers with active spurting or oozing and for nonbleeding visible vessels, and endoscopic therapy with bipolar electrocoagulation, heater probe, and absolute ethanol injection is recommended; low- to very-low-quality evidence also supports clips, argon plasma coagulation, and soft monopolar electrocoagulation. Hemostatic powder spray TC-325 is suggested for actively bleeding ulcers and over-the-scope clips for recurrent ulcer bleeding after previous successful hemostasis. After endoscopic hemostasis, high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy is recommended continuously or intermittently for 3 days, followed by twice-daily oral proton pump inhibitor for the first 2 weeks of therapy after endoscopy. Repeat endoscopy is suggested for recurrent bleeding, and if endoscopic therapy fails, transcatheter embolization is suggested.

### Red blood cell transfusion in the emergency department [^111cANxS]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is the primary management of anemia, which affects 90% of critically ill patients. Anemia has been associated with a poor prognosis in various settings, including critical illness. Recent literature has shown a hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL to be safe. This review examines several aspects of transfusion.

Objective

We sought to provide emergency physicians with an updated review of indications for RBC transfusion in the emergency department.

Discussion

The standard hemoglobin transfusion threshold was 10 g/dL. However, the body shows physiologic compensatory adaptations to chronic anemia. Transfusion reactions and infections are rare but can have significant morbidity and mortality. Products stored for < 21 days have the lowest risk of reaction and infection. A restrictive threshold of 7 g/dL is recommended in the new American Association of Blood Banks guidelines and multiple meta-analyses and supported in gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, critical illness, and trauma. Patients with active ischemia in acute coronary syndrome and neurologic injury require additional study. The physician must consider the patient's hemodynamic status, comorbidities, risks and benefits of transfusion, and clinical setting in determining the need for transfusion.

Conclusions

RBC transfusion is not without risks, including transfusion reaction, infection, and potentially increased mortality. The age of transfusion products likely has no effect on products before 21 days of storage. A hemoglobin level of 7 g/dL is safe in the setting of critical illness, sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and trauma. The clinician must evaluate and transfuse based on the clinical setting and patient hemodynamic status rather than using a specific threshold.

### Restrictive and liberal red cell transfusion strategies in adult patients: reconciling clinical data with best practice [^113wikiD]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Red blood cell transfusion strategies: premise and data

The series of recommendations by the AABB regarding the RBC transfusion threshold have their principal origin in the large published clinical trials (seven trials each being Level 1, > 400 patients) that have demonstrated the relative safety of a restrictive transfusion strategy (Hb transfusion threshold < 7 g/dl) in specific clinical settings in adult cohorts. The large RCTs have evaluated Hb-based RBC transfusion thresholds in several study populations, including patients in mixed medical/surgical ICUs, patients undergoing cardiac and orthopedic surgery, patients with sepsis, and patients experiencing upper gastrointestinal bleeding (Table 1). These hypothesis-driven trials have proposed that restrictive RBC transfusion strategies are as safe as, or perhaps more safe than, liberal transfusion practices. To evaluate the primary hypotheses proposed in these trials, explicit potential adverse effects of RBC transfusion were also evaluated, aiming to demonstrate that guideline compliance would lead to a reduction in a number of transfusion-related adverse effects, of which the most commonly cited include hospital-acquired infection, transfusion reaction (severe and mild incompatibility), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion-related acute lung injury, and immunomodulation, all of which could lead to an increase in patient morbidity and mortality.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^1116a8o1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Considerations

All patients should be assessed for evidence of hemodynamic compromise and low hemoglobin levels. The decision to transfuse should take into account the hemoglobin level, but practitioners should keep in mind that transfusion may carry the risks of complications. This decision should be weighed carefully for each individual patient. As common sense dictates, hypovolemic patients with acute massive blood loss who may only show a spuriously small drop in hemoglobin on presentation should be managed proactively according to the hemoglobin levels that are anticipated to show following volume resuscitation. Similarly, a higher target level of hemoglobin should be pursued in patients who have low tolerance to anemia because of comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, cardiac or renal failure. More research is necessary before sound recommendations can be made about the hemoglobin threshold for transfusion and the target hemoglobin levels.

Risk stratification, management of co-morbidities, and time to endoscopy

Many patients who experience upper GI bleeding have other medical co-morbidities which can affect their outcomes. Anticoagulation, in particular, is a treatment for many medical conditions, and recent guidelines recommend reversal of coagulopathy when it is identified. They make note, however, that reversal should not delay endoscopy.

There exists general consensus that patients presenting with upper GI bleeding should be considered for risk-stratification using an evidence-based scoring system such as the Rockall score or the Blatchford score. The two scores differ in their clinical predictions. The complete (post-endoscopy) Rockall score predicts the occurrence of rebleeding and mortality, and those patients who are at low risk for rebleeding and death can be safely discharged after endoscopy. The Blatchford score can be completed prior to endoscopy and predicts the need for intervention. There are no guidelines that recommend one particular risk-assessment score, though the NICE guidelines recommend performing the Blatchford score at first assessment and the complete Rockall score after endoscopy. NICE performed a rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis on the prognostic accuracy of these scoring systems. Both of them have higher sensitivity than specificity and therefore are mainly useful for ruling out high risk patients. The Blatchford score is extremely sensitive (99–100%), but the quality of evidence for this result is "low" according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE); the Rockall is slightly less sensitive (98%), but the quality of evidence for this is somehow better ("moderate" according to GRADE).

### Red blood cell transfusion: 2023 AABB international guidelines [^114G4DLD]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Red blood cell transfusion — practice considerations beyond hemoglobin: Good transfusion practice should rely not only on hemoglobin concentration thresholds but also incorporation of patients' symptoms, signs, comorbid conditions, risk of bleeding, values, and preferences, and given that RCTs demonstrated no effect on mortality, the storage age of transfused RBCs need not be considered in transfusion decisions.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^114UcZ9r]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) guideline update — these revised guidelines implement the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology to propose recommendations for risk stratification tools, thresholds for red blood cell transfusion, reversal agents for patients on anticoagulants, diagnostic testing including colonoscopy and computed tomography angiography (CTA), endoscopic therapeutic options, and management of antithrombotic medications after hospital discharge; important changes include recommendations for the use of risk stratification tools to identify patients with LGIB at low risk of a hospital-based intervention, the role for reversal agents in patients with life-threatening LGIB on vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants, the increasing role for CTA in patients with severe LGIB, and management of patients who have a positive CTA. The authors state, "We recommend that most patients requiring inpatient colonoscopy undergo a nonurgent colonoscopy because performing an urgent colonoscopy within 24 hours of presentation has not been shown to improve important clinical outcomes such as rebleeding", and they provide updated recommendations regarding resumption of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications after cessation of LGIB.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is a common reason for hospitalization in the United States and is associated with significant utilization of hospital resources, as well as considerable morbidity and mortality. These revised guidelines implement the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology to propose recommendations for the use of risk stratification tools, thresholds for red blood cell transfusion, reversal agents for patients on anticoagulants, diagnostic testing including colonoscopy and computed tomography angiography (CTA), endoscopic therapeutic options, and management of antithrombotic medications after hospital discharge. Important changes since the previous iteration of this guideline include recommendations for the use of risk stratification tools to identify patients with LGIB at low risk of a hospital-based intervention, the role for reversal agents in patients with life-threatening LGIB on vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants, the increasing role for CTA in patients with severe LGIB, and the management of patients who have a positive CTA. We recommend that most patients requiring inpatient colonoscopy undergo a nonurgent colonoscopy because performing an urgent colonoscopy within 24 hours of presentation has not been shown to improve important clinical outcomes such as rebleeding. Finally, we provide updated recommendations regarding resumption of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications after cessation of LGIB.

Severe hematochezia — suggested management begins with intravenous fluid (IVF) resuscitation, packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion to threshold > 7g/dL (or higher if shock or cardiovascular ischemia), and exclusion of an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) source if appropriate. With ongoing significant bleeding, CT angiography is listed; under "Extravasation", Prompt transcatheter angiography with embolization if extravasation seen, and under "No Extravasation", Consider urgent colonoscopy (large volume purge prep with 4–6L PEG over 3–4 hours) with intervention for specialized centers with expertise in endoscopic hemostasis. If there is milder lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) or bleeding has subsided, the pathway lists Nonurgent colonoscopy (with split-dose PEG) vs. observation if bleeding subsides and patient has had recent colonoscopy. Risk factors of UGI bleeding include history of peptic ulcer bleeding, portal hypertension, BUN/Cr > 30, aspirin/NSAID use, and positive nasogastric lavage. Predictors of a positive CT angiography include performance of a CTA within 4 hours of hematochezia, recent bowel resection or intervention, transfusion of > 3 units of PRBC, use of antiplatelets or DOACS, tachycardia, or hypotension; for centers without interventional radiology availability, would consider performing a prompt colonoscopy after resuscitation.

Implementation — For patients reluctant to accept transfusions based on personal values or religious beliefs, "a thorough discussion with the patient or surrogate should occur before deciding to transfuse". When an RBC transfusion is chosen, "the optimal implementation strategy encompasses a restrictive approach and transfusing one RBC unit at a time". This "threshold and single-unit recommendation does not apply to patients actively bleeding at a rate exceeding the ability to transfuse single units or await hemoglobin test results safely", but "can be applied to patients whose acute bleeding has subsided", and "this approach should be suspended and then reapplied after bleeding is controlled (Fig 1)".

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) initial assessment and risk stratification — hemodynamic status should be assessed immediately upon presentation and resuscitative measures begun as needed (Strong recommendation). Blood transfusions should target hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dl, with higher hemoglobins targeted in patients with clinical evidence of intravascular volume depletion or comorbidities, such as coronary artery disease (Conditional recommendation). Risk assessment should be performed to stratify patients into higher and lower risk categories and may assist in initial decisions such as timing of endoscopy, time of discharge, and level of care (Conditional recommendation). Discharge from the emergency department without inpatient endoscopy may be considered in patients with urea nitrogen < 18.2 mg/dl; hemoglobin ≥ 13.0 g/dl for men (12.0 g/dl for women), systolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg; pulse < 100 beats/min; and absence of melena, syncope, cardiac failure, and liver disease, as they have < 1% chance of requiring intervention (Conditional recommendation).

(Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 96 patients with LGIB, there was no significant difference between tranexamic acid and placebo in hemoglobin reduction, transfusion rates and volumes, intervention rates, or length of stay, and in a large international randomized placebo-controlled trial that included over 12,000 patients with stable gastrointestinal bleeding, tranexamic acid was not associated with a reduction in death from bleeding, all-cause bleeding, or mortality and had higher venous thromboembolic events and seizures than placebo; overall, tranexamic acid does not have a benefit in LGIB and may be associated with an increased risk of harm.

Research Priorities

Although the use of restrictive RBC transfusion strategies alone may not need much further inquiry, using individual patient data meta-analysis may help to identify more specific subgroup effects, particularly in patients with various forms of cardiovascular diseases, ranging from acute ischemia to chronic heart diseases. Research on measures of oxygen use or biomarkers of oxygen delivery in tissue beds and overall may allow more targeted approaches to RBC transfusions.

Question 2: Should critically ill patients who have acute gastrointestinal bleeding be treated with a restrictive or permissive RBC transfusion strategy?

### Clinical practice guidelines from the AABB: red blood cell transfusion thresholds and storage [^113nUZwa]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

More than 100 million units of blood are collected worldwide each year, yet the indication for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and the optimal length of RBC storage prior to transfusion are uncertain.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the target hemoglobin level for RBC transfusion among hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable and the length of time RBCs should be stored prior to transfusion.

Evidence Review

Reference librarians conducted a literature search for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion (1950-May 2016) and RBC storage duration (1948-May 2016) without language restrictions. The results were summarized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. For RBC transfusion thresholds, 31 RCTs included 12 587 participants and compared restrictive thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7–8 g/dL) with liberal thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 9–10 g/dL). The summary estimates across trials demonstrated that restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds were not associated with higher rates of adverse clinical outcomes, including 30-day mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, rebleeding, pneumonia, or thromboembolism. For RBC storage duration, 13 RCTs included 5515 participants randomly allocated to receive fresher blood or standard-issue blood. These RCTs demonstrated that fresher blood did not improve clinical outcomes.

Findings

It is good practice to consider the hemoglobin level, the overall clinical context, patient preferences, and alternative therapies when making transfusion decisions regarding an individual patient. Recommendation 1: a restrictive RBC transfusion threshold in which the transfusion is not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7 g/dL is recommended for hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, including critically ill patients, rather than when the hemoglobin level is 10 g/dL (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). A restrictive RBC transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL is recommended for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, cardiac surgery, and those with preexisting cardiovascular disease (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). The restrictive transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL is likely comparable with 8 g/dL, but RCT evidence is not available for all patient categories. These recommendations do not apply to patients with acute coronary syndrome, severe thrombocytopenia (patients treated for hematological or oncological reasons who are at risk of bleeding), and chronic transfusion-dependent anemia (not recommended due to insufficient evidence). Recommendation 2: patients, including neonates, should receive RBC units selected at any point within their licensed dating period (standard issue) rather than limiting patients to transfusion of only fresh (storage length: < 10 days) RBC units (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).

Conclusions and Relevance

Research in RBC transfusion medicine has significantly advanced the science in recent years and provides high-quality evidence to inform guidelines. A restrictive transfusion threshold is safe in most clinical settings and the current blood banking practices of using standard-issue blood should be continued.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^1136V8tX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Small bowel bleeding — diagnostic angiography is most useful with active, brisk bleeding and specific clinical predictors. Conventional angiography is used, especially in hemodynamic instability, but requires higher bleeding rates (0.5–1.0 ml/min) and carries complications that can occur in up to 10%. Across GI studies, yields range 20–77% with a mean near 50%. Predictors of positive angiography include hemodynamic instability and transfusion requirement of ≥ 5 U, with positive yield increasing to 87% in more massive GI bleeding; yields are highest when the patient is actively bleeding with minimal delay from presentation. Patients with a negative tagged RBC scan or negative computed tomography (CT) angiogram are unlikely to have a positive conventional angiogram, whereas a positive CT angiogram, non-diverticular etiologies, and lower hemoglobin increase the likelihood of a subsequent positive conventional angiogram.

Justification

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a life-threatening condition that often necessitates ICU care, including the critical decision of when to transfuse RBCs. We identified three relevant RCTs that included patients with acute upper GIB and an observational study of patients with acute lower GIB (evidence profile 2, supplementary material).,

Villanueva et alrandomized 921 patients with acute upper GIB and early access to endoscopy to either a restrictive or permissive RBC transfusion strategy. The restrictive approach led to lower rates of rebleeding, fewer adverse events, and lower 6-week all-cause mortality. An open-label, cluster RCT with 936 patients reported no significant mortality difference between both RBC transfusion strategies, but noted lower transfusion rates and decreased health care costs with the restrictive approach. A smaller single-center open-label RCT showed that a restrictive approach was noninferior to a permissive strategy. In aggregate, the restrictive transfusion strategy reduced short-term mortality (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48–0.97) without affecting hospital LOS (MD, –0.69 days; 95% CI, –1.98 to +0.60 days).

The restrictive approach proved superior to the permissive strategy with lower risk of acute transfusion reactions and serious adverse transfusion effects. However, no significant differences were found in the risk of infections, need for surgery in upper GIB (Table 3), or organ-specific or system-specific adverse events, including cardiac, renal, pulmonary, and thromboembolic (evidence profile 2, supplementary material). The data on lower GIB was limited to a retrospective study, which did not show differences in mortality or need for surgery between a restrictive and a permissive approach.

Table 3
Pooled Analysis Comparing Restrictive vs Permissive Strategies in Gastrointestinal Bleeding

Given the lower risk of mortality and adverse reactions, the adoption of a restrictive transfusion strategy emerged as the preferred recommendation. The restrictive strategy was superior in patients with and without portal hypertension-related GIB. Notably, portal pressure gradients increased in patients treated with a permissive strategy within the first 5 days of bleeding onset.

What Others Are Saying

This recommendation aligned with those of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, the American College of Gastroenterology, and the American Gastroenterological Association.

GUIDELINE STATEMENTS

Management of antithrombotic agents in the setting of acute GI bleeding

The first 10 guideline statements address the management of antithrombotic agents in the setting of acute GI bleeding. Acute GI bleeding is defined as patients hospitalized or under observation with acute overt GI bleeding (upper and/or lower) manifesting as melena, hematochezia, or hematemesis. Life-threatening hemorrhage is defined as major clinically overt or apparent bleeding, resulting in hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring pressors or surgery; or associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of > 5 g/dL, or requiring transfusion of ≥ 5 units of packed red blood cells, or causing death.

VKA reversal.

For patients on warfarin who are hospitalized or under observation with acute GI bleeding, we suggest against fresh frozen plasma (FFP) administration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

### Liberal versus restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy in sepsis or septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^111bucuX]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs investigating the effect of liberal versus restrictive RBC transfusion strategies on mortality in sepsis or septic shock patients. Although this meta-analysis included only three RCTs, the results suggested that the liberal strategy of RBC transfusion (with a hemoglobin threshold of 9 or 10 g/dL) failed to show any improvement in short-term (28- or 30-day) mortality in sepsis or septic shock patients, compared to the restrictive strategy (with a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dL).

Several studies have been conducted to determine the optimal blood transfusion threshold that would be the most beneficial to patient outcomes. Hebert et al. conducted an RCT involving critically ill patients to compare the 30-day mortality rate between the liberal transfusion group (with a hemoglobin threshold of 10 g/dL) and restrictive transfusion group (with a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dL) (TRICC trial). They found no significant difference in outcome between the two strategies and, thus, recommended the use of the restrictive transfusion strategy in critically ill patients. However, the subgroup analysis of this study also raised the possibility that the suggested blood transfusion threshold could differ due to different diseases and patient populations. In fact, the very recent 2018 Frankfurt Consensus Conference on patient blood management strongly recommended the use of the restrictive RBC transfusion threshold in critically ill but clinically stable intensive care patients and in patients undergoing cardiac surgery; however, use of the restrictive RBC transfusion threshold was not clearly recommended in patients with hip fracture and cardiovascular diseases or other risk factors as well as in hemodynamically stable patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding (conditional recommendation). Apparently, recent clinical trials investigating the hemoglobin threshold for transfusion have been more focused on narrow and specific populations.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^115sThND]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Statement 5.3.2

An upper and lower GI endoscopy should be the initial diagnostic procedure for nearly all stable patients presenting with acute gastro-intestinal bleeding (QoE C).

Statement 5.3.3

Computed tomography angiography should be performed in patients with ongoing bleeding who are hemodynamically stable after resuscitation (QoE C).

Statement 5.3.4

Surgical treatment is recommended in patients with life-threatening bleeding and persistent hemodynamic instability and in patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis non-responders to medical treatment presenting with massive colorectal hemorrhage (QoE B).

Statement 5.3.5

Significant recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding could be an indication for urgent surgery (QoE C).

Recommendations

We recommend performing immediate surgery in unstable patients presenting with hemorrhagic shock, and non responders to resuscitation. An intraoperative ileoscopy, if available, could be useful in localizing the bleeding source in patients with Crohn's disease. In patients presenting with acute severe ulcerative colitis and refractory hemorrhage, non-responders to medical treatment, the surgical treatment of choice is a subtotal colectomy with ileostomy, if skills are present (strong recommendation based on low-level evidence 1C).

We suggest evaluating hemodynamically stable IBD patients presenting a gastrointestinal bleeding at first with a sigmoidoscopy and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (weak recommendation based on low-level evidence 2C).

Summary of evidence and discussion

Gastrointestinal bleeding is a common complication in patients with UC or CD and is caused by inflammation/ulceration of the bowel. Usually, the bleeding resolves with medical treatment and rarely it requires an immediate surgical procedure.

Medical treatment includes patients with hemodynamic instability and/or suspected ongoing bleeding receiving intravenous fluid/blood product resuscitation with the goal of normalization of blood pressure and heart rate prior to endoscopic evaluation/intervention. Packed red blood cells should be transfused to maintain the hemoglobin above 7g/dL. A threshold of 9g/dL should be considered in patients with massive bleeding, significant comorbidities (especially cardiovascular ischemia) or possible delay in receiving therapeutic interventions.

Massive, life-threatening lower gastrointestinal bleeding is uncommon in patients with IBD and occurs in less than 6% of cases. Because of the low incidence of severe hemorrhage in IBD, a limited number of studies are available to guide management.

### Platelet transfusion threshold in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review [^1144cfKJ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There exists uncertainty as to the optimal platelet values when managing patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. GOALS AND STUDY: A systematic review was carried out to determine the optimal approach when managing patients with thrombocytopenia in the setting of nonvariceal upper GI bleeding.

Results

Eighteen of 803 potential articles were selected and reviewed, including 4 randomized controlled trials and 6 cohort studies. The only empirical clinical data available pertained to the management of hematology or oncology patients. There was no high-level evidence that determined the proper threshold of platelet transfusion specifically in GI bleeding. We were, therefore, limited to include principally consensus opinions, recommendations, and guidelines for platelet transfusion trigger as they apply to the treatment (including prophylaxis) of bleeding in general, with a paucity of data addressing major bleeding, let alone bleeding from a gastroenterologic origin. Randomized clinical trials were individually underpowered in allowing definitive conclusions, even though resulting recommendations were supported by similarly underpowered retrospective and prospective observational studies.

Conclusions

There exist a paucity of data to recommend optimal therapeutic platelet count targets in patients with active GI bleeding. Based principally on expert opinion recommendations, we propose a count of 50×10/L. Some professional associations have suggested in very specific clinical settings (postcardiopulmonary bypass surgery or central nervous system trauma) a higher value of up to 100×10/L. Properly designed randomized trials are required to more precisely address this important clinical question.

### Blood transfusion for upper gastrointestinal bleeding: is less more again? [^113DVewj]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The hemoglobin threshold for transfusion of red blood cells in patients with acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is controversial. We compared the efficacy and safety of a restrictive transfusion strategy with those of a liberal transfusion strategy.

Objective

The objective was to prove that the restrictive threshold for red blood cell transfusion in patients with acute upper GI bleeding (UGIB) was safer and more effective than a liberal transfusion strategy.

Results

In total, 225 patients assigned to the restrictive strategy (51%) and 65 assigned to the liberal strategy (15%) did not receive transfusions (P < 0.001). The probability of survival at 6 weeks was higher in the restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group (95% versus 91%; hazard ratio (HR) for death with restrictive strategy, 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.92; P = 0.02). Further bleeding occurred in 10% of the patients in the restrictive-strategy group and in 16% of the patients in the liberal-strategy group (P = 0.01), and adverse events occurred in 40% and 48%, respectively (P = 0.02). The probability of survival was slightly higher with the restrictive strategy than with the liberal strategy in the subgroup of patients who had bleeding associated with a peptic ulcer (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.25) and was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class A or B disease (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.85) but not in those with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class C disease (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.37). Within the first 5 days, the portal-pressure gradient increased significantly in patients assigned to the liberal strategy (P = 0.03) but not in those assigned to the restrictive strategy.

Conclusions

Compared with a liberal transfusion strategy, a restrictive strategy significantly improved outcomes in patients with acute UGIB.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^111B2wFG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) — initial assessment and risk stratification — Hemodynamic status should be assessed immediately upon presentation and resuscitative measures begun as needed (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Randomized trials indicate that transfusions should be given to maintain hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dl, with higher hemoglobin targets potentially needed in patients with other illnesses such as coronary artery disease and in those with intravascular volume depletion. Risk assessment should be performed to stratify patients into higher and lower risk categories, and may assist in management decisions such as timing of endoscopy, time of discharge, and level of care (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). Discharge from the emergency department without inpatient endoscopy may be considered in very low-risk patients, including those meeting Blatchford score 0 criteria — urea nitrogen ≤ 18.2 mg/dl; hemoglobin ≥ 13.0 g/dl for men (12.0 g/dl for women); systolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg; pulse < 100 beats/min; and absence of melena, syncope, cardiac failure, and liver disease — who have < 1% chance of requiring intervention; instruments used include the pre-endoscopic Rockall score (range, 0–7) and the Blatchford score (range, 0–23).

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^114CnZMR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

This guideline provides recommendations for the management of patients with acute overt lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Hemodynamic status should be initially assessed with intravascular volume resuscitation started as needed. Risk stratification based on clinical parameters should be performed to help distinguish patients at high- and low-risk of adverse outcomes. Hematochezia associated with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding source and thus warrants an upper endoscopy. In the majority of patients, colonoscopy should be the initial diagnostic procedure and should be performed within 24h of patient presentation after adequate colon preparation. Endoscopic hemostasis therapy should be provided to patients with high-risk endoscopic stigmata of bleeding including active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel, or adherent clot. The endoscopic hemostasis modality used (mechanical, thermal, injection, or combination) is most often guided by the etiology of bleeding, access to the bleeding site, and endoscopist experience with the various hemostasis modalities. Repeat colonoscopy, with endoscopic hemostasis performed if indicated, should be considered for patients with evidence of recurrent bleeding. Radiographic interventions (tagged red blood cell scintigraphy, computed tomographic angiography, and angiography) should be considered in high-risk patients with ongoing bleeding who do not respond adequately to resuscitation and who are unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation and colonoscopy. Strategies to prevent recurrent bleeding should be considered. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use should be avoided in patients with a history of acute lower GI bleeding, particularly if secondary to diverticulosis or angioectasia. Patients with established high-risk cardiovascular disease should not stop aspirin therapy (secondary prophylaxis) in the setting of lower GI bleeding. The exact timing depends on the severity of bleeding, perceived adequacy of hemostasis, and the risk of a thromboembolic event. Surgery for the prevention of recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding should be individualized, and the source of bleeding should be carefully localized before resection.

Pre-endoscopic approach and management

Resuscitation

All management guidelines recommend prompt assessment of hemodynamic status and resuscitation if required. Generally, the guidelines agree that red blood cell transfusions should be administered to patients whose hemoglobin levels drop to 70 g/L or less. In 2010, Heamshaw et al published a prospective cohort study assessing outcomes in patients who received blood transfusions within 12 h of presentation. They found that, regardless of the initial hemoglobin level (greater than or less than 80 g/L), the rates of rebleeding were higher in those who received early transfusion. The odds ratio (OR) for rebleeding was 2.26, adjusted for Rockall score and initial hemoglobin level. Mortality at 30 days was greater in those receiving transfusion, but not significantly so when adjusted for initial hemoglobin level and Rockall score. Previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) had shown comparable results, but these were performed over a decade ago when appropriate endoscopic hemostasis was not offered in all high-risk patients.

However, a more recent RCT on this topic was published by Villanueva et al who randomized 921 patients (bleeding peptic ulcer 48%, variceal bleeding 24%) with upper GI bleeding to either a restrictive (transfuse at a hemoglobin level of 70 g/L) or liberal (transfuse at a hemoglobin level of 90 g/L) transfusion strategy. The patients were treated according to current standards of care with regards to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment and endoscopic hemostasis. Patients treated with the restrictive strategy had significantly lower mortality at 45 days [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.92], less rebleeding, and experienced fewer overall adverse events. These findings attracted high publicity but should be interpreted with caution because of high risk of performance bias (due to lack of blinding) and limited generalizability (many potentially eligible patients were either not screened or excluded for reasons such as "massive" bleeding or severe comorbidity). Furthermore, the subgroup analyses on peptic ulcer bleeding versus variceal bleeding, albeit important, were underpowered; therefore, no conclusion could be drawn specifically for patients with peptic ulcer bleeding.

### Red blood cell transfusion: 2023 AABB international guidelines [^111TuXVE]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

AABB red blood cell (RBC) transfusion guideline — adult good practice and recommendations: For hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, the international panel recommends a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy in which the transfusion is considered when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL (Strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Remark: in accordance with the restrictive strategy threshold used in most of the trials for subgroups of patients, clinicians may choose a threshold of 7.5 g/dL for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and 8 g/dL for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery or those with preexisting cardiovascular disease. For hospitalized adult patients, the panel suggests a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy in which transfusion is considered when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL in those with hematologic and oncologic disorders (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence). Good practice considerations state clinicians should consider not only the hemoglobin concentration but also symptoms, signs, other laboratory data, patients' values and preferences, and the overall clinical context, and that clinicians should consider alternatives to transfusion, including medical treatment of anemia and blood conservation strategies; the guideline also notes this practice guideline will not apply to all individual RBC transfusion decisions.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) — initial assessment and risk stratification: A focused history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained at the time of presentation to assess bleeding severity, location, and etiology; hematochezia with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) source and an upper endoscopy should be performed; a nasogastric aspirate/lavage may be used to assess a possible upper GI source if suspicion of UGIB is moderate; and risk assessment and stratification should be performed to distinguish high- vs low-risk patients and assist triage including timing of colonoscopy and level of care. Initial testing should include a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, coagulation studies, and a type and cross match, and the physical examination should include the measurement of vital signs, including orthostasis.

### Transfusion strategies for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^116rRgF6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

The hemoglobin threshold for transfusion of red cells in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding is controversial. We compared the efficacy and safety of a restrictive transfusion strategy with those of a liberal transfusion strategy.

Methods

We enrolled 921 patients with severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and randomly assigned 461 of them to a restrictive strategy (transfusion when the hemoglobin level fell below 7 g per deciliter) and 460 to a liberal strategy (transfusion when the hemoglobin fell below 9 g per deciliter). Randomization was stratified according to the presence or absence of liver cirrhosis.

Results

A total of 225 patients assigned to the restrictive strategy (51%), as compared with 61 assigned to the liberal strategy (14%), did not receive transfusions (P < 0.001). The probability of survival at 6 weeks was higher in the restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group (95% vs. 91%; hazard ratio for death with restrictive strategy, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33 to 0.92; P = 0.02). Further bleeding occurred in 10% of the patients in the restrictive-strategy group as compared with 16% of the patients in the liberal-strategy group (P = 0.01), and adverse events occurred in 40% as compared with 48% (P = 0.02). The probability of survival was slightly higher with the restrictive strategy than with the liberal strategy in the subgroup of patients who had bleeding associated with a peptic ulcer (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.26 to 1.25) and was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class A or B disease (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.85), but not in those with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class C disease (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.37). Within the first 5 days, the portal-pressure gradient increased significantly in patients assigned to the liberal strategy (P = 0.03) but not in those assigned to the restrictive strategy.

Conclusions

As compared with a liberal transfusion strategy, a restrictive strategy significantly improved outcomes in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. (Funded by Fundació Investigació Sant Pau; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00414713.).

### Red cell transfusion for the management of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage [^1115yYxX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage affects 50 to 150 per 100,000 adults per year, with a high mortality. Red blood cell transfusions are frequently given, but their impact on rebleeding rates and mortality is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in adults with upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage.

Search Strategy

For this update, we re-ran the initial search strategies from the last issue/month searched until March 2010. We previously searched the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Group Trials Register to February 2008, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to February 2008), EMBASE (1974 to February 2008), the Systematic Review Initiative database of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), haematology and gastroenterology conference proceedings, and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised studies comparing RBC transfusion and standard care with other intravenous fluid and standard care regimens in haemodynamically stable and haemodynamically unstable adults with upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

Three trials involving 126 patients were included, with complete data available for 93 patients. The participants were heterogeneous, none of the three studies examined exactly the same interventions or measured the same outcomes. Only two trials reported mortality data and the summary relative risk for mortality of the intervention was 5.4 (95% CI 0.27 to 107.09). One trial reported increased coagulation times in the transfused group, and reported these patients to have increased rates of rebleeding. None of the studies reported adverse events directly related to RBC transfusion. Methodological deficiencies, including allocation concealment, generation of random sequences and blinding, simply compound the uncertainty surrounding analysis. None of the studies were appropriately powered and in the largest study fewer than half the participants were included in the final analysis. One RCT of restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion aims to recruit 860 patients but has yet to be completed.

Authors' Conclusions

There were more deaths and more rebleeding in the transfusion arms of the combined studies, but the small numbers of participants and large volume of missing data limit the significance of the findings. The studies in this review do not provide useful data regarding outcomes following red blood cell transfusion for acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. They appear to exclude large survival benefit. Large, well-concealed RCTs of sufficient power are urgently needed.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^115Yk9sz]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute LGIB — risk factors and monitoring: Risk factors identified for poor outcome in LGIB include hemodynamic instability at presentation (tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope), ongoing bleeding (gross blood on initial digital rectal examination and recurrent hematochezia), comorbid illnesses, age > 60 years, a history of diverticulosis or angiectasia, an elevated creatinine, and anemia (initial hematocrit ≤ 35%). In general, the likelihood of an adverse outcome increases with the number of risk factors present, and monitoring in an intensive care setting should be considered in patients with high-risk features.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^114Jke1d]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

(Accept — agreement: 100%, level of evidence: moderate)

It would seem uncontroversial to replace blood loss in UGIB by transfusion of red blood cell and plasma to restore and preserve tissue perfusion and blood pressure. The earliest study that suggested that blood transfusion might be harmful to patients with gastrointestinal haemorrhage was published over 30 years ago. A small group of patients with severe UGIB were randomised to receiving either a blood transfusion in cases of a haemoglobin < 8 g/dL or shock, or transfusion of at least two units of blood regardless of haemoglobin level and haemodynamics. Early blood transfusion appeared to lead to more recurrent bleeding in these patients, and the authors suggested that this was due to reversal of hypercoagulable response to haemorrhage thereby encouraging rebleeding and hence the need for surgery.

Almost three decades later, a study from Spain randomised 921 patients with severe acute UGIB to a restrictive blood transfusion strategy (transfuse only when haemoglobin level < 7 g/dL) or a liberal transfusion strategy (transfuse only when haemoglobin < 9 g/dL). Significant differences were demonstrated in the overall survival, further bleeding and adverse events between the two groups in favour of restrictive transfusion. The major difference, however, was seen in the group of patients with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class A or B diseases.

A more recent study from the UK (TRIGGER Study) took a cluster randomised feasibility trial approach in six hospitals. A slightly different definition of restrictive transfusion strategy (when haemoglobin < 8 g/dL) versus liberal transfusion strategy (when haemoglobin < 10 g/dL) was adopted. Comparison of centres using different transfusion strategies showed that there was no significant difference in clinical outcome, including mortality, thromboembolic events, surgical or radiological intervention, therapeutic intervention, length of hospital stay and serious adverse events.

### Diagnosis and management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^112WxE8t]. Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

This Guideline is an official statement of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). It addresses the diagnosis and management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (NVUGIH). Main Recommendations MR1. ESGE recommends immediate assessment of hemodynamic status in patients who present with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH), with prompt intravascular volume replacement initially using crystalloid fluids if hemodynamic instability exists (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR2. ESGE recommends a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy that aims for a target hemoglobin between 7g/dL and 9g/dL. A higher target hemoglobin should be considered in patients with significant co-morbidity (e.g., ischemic cardiovascular disease) (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR3. ESGE recommends the use of the Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) for pre-endoscopy risk stratification. Outpatients determined to be at very low risk, based upon a GBS score of 0–1, do not require early endoscopy nor hospital admission. Discharged patients should be informed of the risk of recurrent bleeding and be advised to maintain contact with the discharging hospital (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR4. ESGE recommends initiating high dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI), intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion (80mg then 8mg/hour), in patients presenting with acute UGIH awaiting upper endoscopy. However, PPI infusion should not delay the performance of early endoscopy (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR5. ESGE does not recommend the routine use of nasogastric or orogastric aspiration/lavage in patients presenting with acute UGIH (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR6. ESGE recommends intravenous erythromycin (single dose, 250mg given 30–120 minutes prior to upper gastrointestinal [GI] endoscopy) in patients with clinically severe or ongoing active UGIH. In selected patients, pre-endoscopic infusion of erythromycin significantly improves endoscopic visualization, reduces the need for second-look endoscopy, decreases the number of units of blood transfused, and reduces duration of hospital stay (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR7. Following hemodynamic resuscitation, ESGE recommends early (≤ 24 hours) upper GI endoscopy. Very early (< 12 hours) upper GI endoscopy may be considered in patients with high risk clinical features, namely: hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension) that persists despite ongoing attempts at volume resuscitation; in-hospital bloody emesis/nasogastric aspirate; or contraindication to the interruption of anticoagulation (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR8. ESGE recommends that peptic ulcers with spurting or oozing bleeding (Forrest classification Ia and Ib, respectively) or with a nonbleeding visible vessel (Forrest classification IIa) receive endoscopic hemostasis because these lesions are at high risk for persistent bleeding or rebleeding (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR9. ESGE recommends that peptic ulcers with an adherent clot (Forrest classification IIb) be considered for endoscopic clot removal. Once the clot is removed, any identified underlying active bleeding (Forrest classification Ia or Ib) or nonbleeding visible vessel (Forrest classification IIa) should receive endoscopic hemostasis (weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR10. In patients with peptic ulcers having a flat pigmented spot (Forrest classification IIc) or clean base (Forrest classification III), ESGE does not recommend endoscopic hemostasis as these stigmata present a low risk of recurrent bleeding. In selected clinical settings, these patients may be discharged to home on standard PPI therapy, e.g., oral PPI once-daily (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR11. ESGE recommends that epinephrine injection therapy not be used as endoscopic monotherapy. If used, it should be combined with a second endoscopic hemostasis modality (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR12. ESGE recommends PPI therapy for patients who receive endoscopic hemostasis and for patients with adherent clot not receiving endoscopic hemostasis. PPI therapy should be high dose and administered as an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion (80mg then 8mg/hour) for 72 hours post endoscopy (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR13. ESGE does not recommend routine second-look endoscopy as part of the management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (NVUGIH). However, in patients with clinical evidence of rebleeding following successful initial endoscopic hemostasis, ESGE recommends repeat upper endoscopy with hemostasis if indicated. In the case of failure of this second attempt at hemostasis, transcatheter angiographic embolization (TAE) or surgery should be considered (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR14. In patients with NVUGIH secondary to peptic ulcer, ESGE recommends investigating for the presence of Helicobacter pylori in the acute setting with initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy when H. pylori is detected. Re-testing for H. pylori should be performed in those patients with a negative test in the acute setting. Documentation of successful H. pylori eradication is recommended (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR15. In patients receiving low dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis who develop peptic ulcer bleeding, ESGE recommends aspirin be resumed immediately following index endoscopy if the risk of rebleeding is low (e.g. FIIc, FIII). In patients with high risk peptic ulcer (FIa, FIb, FIIa, FIIb), early reintroduction of aspirin by day 3 after index endoscopy is recommended, provided that adequate hemostasis has been established (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).

### Red blood cell transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB* [^115UHgXN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Description

Although approximately 85 million units of red blood cells (RBCs) are transfused annually worldwide, transfusion practices vary widely. The AABB (formerly, the American Association of Blood Banks) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations about hemoglobin concentration thresholds and other clinical variables that trigger RBC transfusions in hemodynamically stable adults and children.

Methods

These guidelines are based on a systematic review of randomized clinical trials evaluating transfusion thresholds. We performed a literature search from 1950 to February 2011 with no language restrictions. We examined the proportion of patients who received any RBC transfusion and the number of RBC units transfused to describe the effect of restrictive transfusion strategies on RBC use. To determine the clinical consequences of restrictive transfusion strategies, we examined overall mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, cardiac events, pulmonary edema, stroke, thromboembolism, renal failure, infection, hemorrhage, mental confusion, functional recovery, and length of hospital stay. RECOMMENDATION 1: The AABB recommends adhering to a restrictive transfusion strategy (7 to 8 g/dL) in hospitalized, stable patients (Grade: strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: The AABB suggests adhering to a restrictive strategy in hospitalized patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and considering transfusion for patients with symptoms or a hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL or less (Grade: weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 3: The AABB cannot recommend for or against a liberal or restrictive transfusion threshold for hospitalized, hemodynamically stable patients with the acute coronary syndrome (Grade: uncertain recommendation; very low-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 4: The AABB suggests that transfusion decisions be influenced by symptoms as well as hemoglobin concentration (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^111MgxEP]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in critically ill adults — scope, methods, and key conclusions: A panel of experts developed six Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome questions and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach with a modified Delphi technique, examining subgroups including gastrointestinal bleeding, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), cardiac surgery, isolated troponin elevation, and septic shock. The initial search identified a total of 3,082 studies, 38 articles were reviewed, and 23 studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 22 randomized controlled trials and one cohort study; the panel formulated two strong and four conditional recommendations, and the overall quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. In most critically ill patients, a restrictive strategy was preferable to a permissive approach because it does not increase the risk of death or complications but does decrease RBC use significantly; subpopulation data also supported a restrictive approach, except in patients with ACS, for whom favoring a restrictive approach could increase adverse outcomes.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115p12k6]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Blood products frequently are administered to critically ill patients. Considering recent trials and practice variability, a comprehensive review of current evidence was deemed essential to offer pertinent guidance to critical care practitioners. This American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guidelines panel examined the literature on RBC transfusions among critically ill patients overall and specific subgroups, including patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), cardiac surgery, isolated troponin elevation, and septic shock, to provide evidence-based recommendations.

Study Design and Methods

A panel of experts developed six Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome questions addressing RBC transfusions in critically ill patients and performed a comprehensive evidence review. The panel applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach to assess the certainty of evidence and to formulate and grade recommendations. A modified Delphi technique was used to reach consensus on the recommendations.

Results

The initial search identified a total of 3,082 studies, and after the initial screening, 38 articles were reviewed. Among them, 23 studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 22 randomized controlled trials and one cohort study. Based on the analysis of these studies, the panel formulated two strong and four conditional recommendations. The overall quality of evidence for recommendations ranged from very low to moderate.

Conclusions

In most critically ill patients, a restrictive strategy was preferable to a permissive approach because it does not increase the risk of death or complications, but does decrease RBC use significantly. Data from critically ill subpopulations also supported a restrictive approach, except in patients with ACS, for whom favoring a restrictive approach could increase adverse outcomes.

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^115a4gj3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding — trial outcomes prioritization: The critical outcome was further bleeding, which includes persistent and recurrent bleeding. Further bleeding was recommended as the primary endpoint for RCTs of UGIB management by an International Consensus Panel because prevention of further bleeding is the primary clinical goal for patients with UGIB. Mortality was defined as an important outcome but not critical for decision making because death is uncommon in patients with UGIB (~2% in the United States), and sample sizes for most RCTs are not based on assessment of mortality.
