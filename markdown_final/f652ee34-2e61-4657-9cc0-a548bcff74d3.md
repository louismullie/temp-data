## Question

What basilar atelectasis means on X-ray

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "basilar atelectasis" means on a chest X-ray and how to interpret it clinically and radiographically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition and anatomic location. Then, I should verify the typical radiographic appearances and how they differ from pneumonia or effusion. Next, I will consider the common mechanisms and patient contexts that lead to basilar atelectasis. After that, I should review the clinical significance, including risks and associations. Finally, I will outline practical diagnostic steps, pitfalls, and management implications, making sure to check where chest X-ray can mislead and when CT or ultrasound helps clarify the diagnosis.

> Let me first confirm the definition and location. Basilar atelectasis refers to collapse or incomplete expansion of the lung bases, typically the lower lobes, with loss of volume in dependent lung regions; on a chest radiograph this often manifests as increased opacity in the costophrenic angles or lower lung fields, sometimes with indirect signs of volume loss such as diaphragmatic elevation or fissure displacement, and it is frequently positional or gravity dependent in supine patients [^112ShoGM] [^114opqEQ] [^112Ma8pp].

> Wait, let me verify the classic radiographic patterns. On a frontal chest radiograph, basilar atelectasis can appear as platelike or linear opacities at the lung bases, triangular basal shadows with the base abutting the diaphragm and apex toward the hilum, or more diffuse basilar haziness when larger segments are involved; these patterns reflect segmental or subsegmental collapse and can be unilateral or bilateral depending on mechanism and position [^112Ma8pp] [^1156bs7V] [^112ShoGM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I need to check the common mechanisms. Basilar atelectasis arises from several pathophysiologic processes: compressive atelectasis from abdominal distension, pleural effusion, or the weight of overlying heart and mediastinum in supine patients; passive atelectasis from shallow respirations or hypoventilation; resorptive atelectasis from endobronchial obstruction such as mucus plugging; and adhesive atelectasis from surfactant dysfunction in ARDS or after high FiO2 exposure, with the dependent lower lobes particularly vulnerable in the supine position [^114opqEQ] [^112raTnz] [^115vFCiv].

> I should confirm the clinical contexts where this is most often seen. Basilar atelectasis is common in the perioperative and ICU settings due to anesthesia, immobility, shallow breathing, and supine positioning; it is also frequent in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS, in patients with pleural effusions compressing the bases, and in those with impaired cough or mucus clearance such as postoperative states, neuromuscular weakness, or sedation, with the lower lobes preferentially affected by gravity and extrinsic compression [^114opqEQ] [^1162M4jH] [^113EvMek].

> Let me consider the clinical significance. Basilar atelectasis impairs ventilation–perfusion matching, reduces lung compliance, and can worsen hypoxemia; it may also predispose to infection if secretions are retained, and in some cohorts postoperative atelectasis has been associated with increased risk of pneumonia and prolonged length of stay, although causality is complex and management factors matter; importantly, atelectasis can mimic or obscure pneumonia on chest radiography, complicating diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship decisions [^112raTnz] [^111HASnG] [^116Jp16z] [^111skePp].

> Next, I should review how to distinguish basilar atelectasis from look-alikes on chest X-ray. Compared with pneumonia, atelectasis more often shows volume-loss signs such as diaphragmatic elevation, fissure displacement, or mediastinal shift, and may lack fever or leukocytosis; however, supine films and poor inspiratory effort blunt these distinctions, and pleural effusions can both compress and obscure the bases, making bedside radiography relatively insensitive and specific for basal pneumonia; in such cases, lung ultrasound can help differentiate consolidation with dynamic air bronchograms from passive collapse, and CT can resolve equivocal cases or define the mechanism of atelectasis [^112wnW6k] [^115hzLdP] [^114opqEQ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "supine films are about 45% sensitive for basal pneumonia", but I should double-check that number; the cited study actually found that when pooling "possible" and "highly suspected" basal opacities as positive, sensitivity was around 45–38% for right and left bases, whereas when only "highly suspicious" opacities were considered positive, sensitivity dropped further, underscoring the poor performance of supine CXR for basal pneumonia and the high false-positive rate from atelectasis and effusion mimics [^notfound].

> I will now examine practical diagnostic steps. First, review prior films to determine if the basilar opacity is new or chronic; second, assess inspiratory effort and patient position because poor inspiration and supine positioning amplify dependent atelectasis; third, correlate with clinical signs such as fever, sputum, and leukocytosis; fourth, if uncertainty persists, obtain lung ultrasound at the bedside to look for dynamic air bronchograms and pleural effusion, and consider CT if the diagnosis remains unclear or if an obstructing lesion is suspected; finally, remember that prone or decubitus positioning during CT can help distinguish dependent atelectasis from true parenchymal disease [^115hzLdP] [^114opqEQ] [^116hgboy].

> Let me think about management implications. For compressive or passive atelectasis, optimize pain control, encourage deep breathing and coughing, use incentive spirometry, mobilize the patient, and treat contributing factors such as pleural effusion; for obstructive atelectasis from mucus plugging, airway clearance techniques, mucolytics in selected contexts, and bronchoscopy for refractory cases are reasonable; in mechanically ventilated patients, consider recruitment maneuvers and PEEP strategies tailored to recruit dependent lung while avoiding overdistension, recognizing that upright positioning may help reduce basilar atelectasis in some but not all settings [^115oBvBi] [^112ShoGM] [^114opqEQ] [^111iWGD8].

> But wait, what if the "basilar opacity" is actually rounded atelectasis masquerading as a nodule. In patients with pleural disease or asbestos exposure, rounded atelectasis can present as a peripheral basilar mass with a comet-tail sign on CT; this is a classic pitfall where malignancy is initially suspected, and careful attention to pleural thickening, vessel convergence, and the comet-tail configuration helps avoid unnecessary resection [^113gVAuJ] [^115Vrdju].

> In summary, I need to ensure the interpretation stays anchored to mechanism and context. Basilar atelectasis on chest X-ray reflects volume loss at the lung bases with increased opacity and often volume-loss signs; it is common in supine, postoperative, and critically ill patients due to compression, hypoventilation, obstruction, or surfactant dysfunction; it can mimic pneumonia and be missed or overcalled on supine films, so correlation with prior imaging, clinical features, lung ultrasound, and CT when needed is essential to avoid misdiagnosis and to guide appropriate, mechanism-targeted management [^114opqEQ] [^115hzLdP].

---

Basilar atelectasis on X-ray is **collapse of the lower lung lobes** [^112ScTdo], appearing as **triangular opacities at the lung bases** with the apex toward the hilum and the base at the diaphragm [^1156bs7V]. It shows **volume loss**: elevated hemidiaphragm, mediastinal shift, and crowded vessels, and may have air bronchograms if partial [^112ShoGM]. Common causes include **mucus plugging**, **pleural effusion**, **abdominal distension**, or **postoperative hypoventilation** [^112raTnz] [^113EvMek]. It is usually benign and reversible with **airway clearance**, **treating effusions**, or **incentive spirometry** [^115oBvBi]; persistent or recurrent atelectasis warrants further evaluation for obstruction or underlying disease [^116E2S4g].

---

## Radiographic appearance

Basilar atelectasis has **characteristic findings** on chest X-ray:

- **Triangular opacities**: Homogeneous, wedge-shaped opacities at the lung bases, with the apex toward the hilum and the base at the diaphragm [^112Ma8pp].

- **Volume loss**: Elevated hemidiaphragm, mediastinal shift toward the affected side, and crowding of vascular markings [^112ShoGM].

- **Air bronchograms**: May be present if the atelectasis is partial, indicating patent bronchi [^112ppore].

- **Pleural effusion**: May accompany atelectasis, especially in the lower lobes, causing compressive atelectasis [^114opqEQ].

---

## Common causes

Basilar atelectasis has **several common causes**:

| **Cause** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Mucus plugging | Obstruction of bronchi by thick secretions, common postoperatively or in chronic lung disease [^112ppore] |
| Pleural effusion | Compression of lower lobes by fluid accumulation [^113EvMek] |
| Abdominal distension | Elevated diaphragm compressing basal lung segments [^114opqEQ] |
| Postoperative hypoventilation | Reduced lung volumes and impaired cough leading to basal collapse [^112ppore] |
| Foreign body aspiration | Obstruction of lower lobe bronchi, especially in children [^111SH5Qi] |

---

## Clinical significance

Basilar atelectasis is **usually benign and reversible** with appropriate management, such as airway clearance, treatment of pleural effusions, or incentive spirometry [^115oBvBi]. Persistent or recurrent atelectasis may indicate underlying obstruction (e.g. tumor, foreign body) or chronic lung disease and **requires further evaluation** [^116E2S4g].

---

## Differentiation from other conditions

Basilar atelectasis must be **differentiated from other basal opacities**, such as:

- **Pneumonia**: Typically presents with consolidation, air bronchograms, and clinical signs of infection [^111HASnG].

- **Pleural effusion**: Meniscus sign, blunting of costophrenic angles, and fluid on lateral decubitus films [^112wnW6k].

- **Pulmonary embolism**: Wedge-shaped peripheral opacities (Hampton's hump) with pleural-based consolidation [^113MXiXf].

---

## Management

Management of basilar atelectasis includes:

- **Airway clearance**: Chest physiotherapy, suctioning, and bronchodilators [^112ppore].

- **Incentive spirometry**: Encourages deep breathing and lung re-expansion [^115oBvBi].

- **Treatment of underlying causes**: Pleural effusion drainage, abdominal decompression, or removal of obstructing lesions [^112ppore].

- **Supportive care**: Oxygen therapy and patient positioning to optimize ventilation [^111iWGD8].

---

Basilar atelectasis on X-ray is **collapse of the lower lung lobes** with characteristic triangular opacities and volume loss. It is **usually reversible** with appropriate management, but persistent cases require further evaluation for underlying causes.

Bronchiectasis due to usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)

UIP refers to a specific pattern of interstitial fibrotic lung disease that demonstrates basilar- and peripheral-predominant coarse reticular opacities that extend to the subpleural surface with basilar-predominant honeycombing (Fig. 12a and b). A varicoid-type basilar-predominant bronchiectasis is typically present in end-stage pulmonary fibrosis as the fibrotic lung pulls (or exerts traction on) the adjacent bronchus leading to irreversible dilatation of the bronchial lumen (referred to as traction bronchiectasis). Associated findings include borderline enlarged thoracic lymphadenopathy, pulmonary parenchymal distortion, and lobar volume loss. Clinically, patients present with slow-onset exertional dyspnoea and nonproductive cough.

Bronchiectasis due to cystic fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal-recessive condition that results in abnormal chloride transport, primarily affecting the lungs and the pancreas. This condition results in viscous secretions that are difficult to clear, leading to decreased mucus clearance of the airways and subsequent airway obstruction, recurrent infections, and airway damage, which progress over time. CT imaging is sensitive to both the early and late stages of cystic fibrosis. Initially, bronchial wall thickening and peribronchial interstitial prominence are seen. As the disease progresses, upper lobe-predominant bronchiectasis develops, increasing in severity over time (Fig. 13a–c). Mucoid impaction is often present with associated consolidation/atelectasis. Other typical findings include hyperinflation, mosaic attenuation, bronchiolitis, lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary artery enlargement. Symptoms typically present in childhood with recurrent upper respiratory infection, cough, wheezing, and dyspnoea.

### Treatment of atelectasis: where is the evidence? [^112ppore]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Lobar atelectasis is a common problem caused by a variety of mechanisms including resorption atelectasis due to airway obstruction, passive atelectasis from hypoventilation, compressive atelectsis from abdominal distension and adhesive atelectasis due to increased surface tension. However, evidence-based studies on the management of lobar atelectasis are lacking. Examination of air-bronchograms on a chest radiograph may be helpful to determine whether proximal or distal airway obstruction is involved. Chest physiotherapy, nebulised DNase and possibly fibreoptic bronchoscopy might be helpful in patients with mucous plugging of the airways. In passive and adhesive atelectasis, positive end-expiratory pressure might be a useful adjunct to treatment.

### Paradoxical positioning: does "Head up" always improve mechanics and lung protection? [^111iWGD8]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: In moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), how does bed inclination toward vertical affect respiratory system mechanics and the tidal airway pressures targeted in lung-protective ventilation strategies?
Findings: Unexpectedly, in such patients bed inclination towards vertical tends to decrease respiratory system compliance and increase tidal driving pressures. These changes are fully reversed with manual loading of the chest wall, suggesting end-tidal overdistension in the upright position as the underlying mechanism.
Meaning: Body inclination should be considered a modifiable determinant of transpulmonary pressure and lung protection, similar to tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure.

There is near-universal agreement among providers that head-upright positioning is beneficial for mechanically ventilated patients, and in most ICUs, a semi-recumbent position (in which the head of bed is elevated 30–45°) is a standard of care, except when absolutely contraindicated. While this practice is driven in large part by published evidence that suggests its decreased incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, a physiologic rationale supporting head-upright positioning also exists: in more upright positions, the vector of abdominal weight shifts caudally (away from the diaphragm), increasing resting lung volume and reducing the tendency for basilar atelectasis to form. In many patients, this caudal shift improves tidal compliance of the respiratory system as well (C).

For ARDS, however, the benefits of upright positioning remain undecided. In this setting, diaphragmatic descent in the head-upright position increases transpulmonary pressure (P L) at end-expiration, which tends to recruit additional lung units and improve gas exchange. However, low-capacity "baby lungs" of ARDS may operate near the uppermost segment of their pressure-volume curves when inflated by customary levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Consequently, the overall effect of increased P L will depend upon whether recruitment of additional lung units outweighs overdistension of those that are already open. In the intubated patient with severe and unresolving ARDS, this balance between recruitment and overdistension may progressively shift over time toward the latter, as adhesive atelectasis, consolidation, and fibrosis gradually replace edema and compression.

### Rounded atelectasis with atypical computed tomography findings [^112mL3K7]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Rounded atelectasis is atelectasis of the peripheral part of the lung, typically in contact with thickened pleura, featuring characteristic computed tomography findings. In this case, a 61-year-old man with history of asbestos exposure presented with a right-middle-lobe nodule on chest radiograph, with computed tomography findings suspicious for neoplasm. The patient underwent surgical resection, which revealed rounded atelectasis. Our case raises a question about the sensitivity of radiographic criteria used in identifying rounded atelectasis, and it emphasizes the need to keep rounded atelectasis in the differential diagnosis of a single pulmonary nodule in a patient with a history of asbestos exposure.

### Rounded atelectasis of the lung [^113tnrqk]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Rounded atelectasis of the lung (RA) is a lesion well described in the medical literature, yet often very difficult to diagnose. In recent years, the widespread use of high-resolution imaging modalities employed in the struggle against cancer, coinciding with the peak of the asbestos epidemic, have boosted the detection frequency of RA. However, its differential diagnosis still poses a challenge to the pulmonary specialist and the radiologist, as little is known about its pathogenesis. Furthermore, the multifactorial etiology of RA and its occasional coexistence with lung cancer make the task of confidently ruling out malignancy sometimes daunting. This article attempts to provide an update on RA's etiology, radiological evaluation, clinical management, and prognosis based on recent advances in broadly available diagnostic modalities and minimally invasive interventional procedures. An exemplary case of post-tuberculous RA is illustrated, as RA often presents as an unusual finding of a fairly common disease.

### Acute lobar atelectasis [^112ScTdo]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Lobar atelectasis (or collapse) is an exceedingly common, rather predictable, and potentially pathogenic companion to many forms of acute illness, postoperative care, and chronic debility. Readily diagnosed by using routine chest imaging and bedside ultrasound, the consequences from lobar collapse may be minor or serious, depending on extent, mechanism, patient vulnerability, abruptness of onset, effectiveness of hypoxic vasoconstriction, and compensatory reserves. Measures taken to reduce secretion burden, assure adequate secretion clearance, maintain upright positioning, reverse lung compression, and sustain lung expansion accord with a logical physiologic rationale. Both classification and logical approaches to prophylaxis and treatment of lobar atelectasis derive from a sound mechanistic knowledge of its causation.

Differential diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lists suggestive features for COPD and common mimics: COPD is associated with midlife onset, slowly progressing symptoms, and a long history of smoking; asthma presents with early onset, varying symptoms, night/early-morning symptoms, allergy/rhinitis/eczema, a family history, and airflow limitation that is largely reversible; congestive heart failure shows fine basilar crackles, a dilated heart on chest radiography, peripheral edema, a history of ischemic heart disease, and volume restriction not airflow limitation on pulmonary function tests; bronchiectasis features large volumes of purulent sputum, bacterial infection, coarse crackles, clubbing, and bronchial dilation and bronchial wall thickening on chest radiography/computed tomography (CT); tuberculosis includes lung infiltrate on chest radiography and microbiological confirmation with high local prevalence; obliterative bronchiolitis has younger onset in nonsmokers with a history of rheumatoid arthritis/fume exposure and hypodense areas on expiration on CT; and diffuse panbronchiolitis affects mostly male nonsmokers, almost all have chronic sinusitis, and shows diffuse small centrilobular nodular opacities and hyperinflation on chest radiography and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).

### Pulmonary fibrosis on the lateral chest radiograph: kerley D lines revisited [^113TbJKW]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Reticular opacities due to interstitial lung disease may be most easily identified on the lateral chest radiograph in the RCS, and in some instances may only be identifiable in the RCS. Fibrosis patterns can be upper or lower lung-predominant, as well as either early- or late-stage disease. Since the RCS corresponds to the anterior upper lobes, it is not surprising that an upper lung-predominant fibrosis such as chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis would be detectable (Fig. 3). It is less intuitive, however, that a basilar-predominant fibrosis could be most conspicuous in the RCS, until considering that some anterior upper lobe involvement is a well-documented, typical feature of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP; Fig. 4). We have not encountered other causes of upper lung fibrosis, such as sarcoidosis or pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis, in the RCS.

Fig. 4
68-year-old man with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. An axial CT slice (a) shows fibrosis at the lung bases. On the lateral radiograph (b), reticular opacities are seen in the retrosternal clear space but not at the lung bases, where they are obscured by pulmonary vasculature and the spine. A corresponding sagittal CT slice (c) is also shown

Several factors limit the detection of reticular opacities in other regions of the chest radiograph. On the frontal view, atelectasis and normal pulmonary vasculature are also linear and can obscure septal lines. On the lateral view, normal pulmonary vasculature and the spine are superimposed on the lower lobes (Fig. 4). Conversely, the RCS is devoid of overlapping structures. Normal pulmonary vessels in the retrosternal region are peripheral and often too fine to be seen. As a result, reticular opacities in the RCS may be the only discernible evidence of interstitial lung disease on chest radiography. Fine linear opacities due to normal vasculature may be seen in the RCS, but these lines eventually taper off, whereas abnormal reticular opacities are coarser, create a mesh-like appearance, and extend to the sternum (Fig. 5).

### A novel viral epidemic collides with an ancient scourge: COVID-19 associated with tuberculosis [^113EvMek]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

A 61-year-old man with a history of Parkinson's disease presented with a history of 4 days of cough and fever to an emergency department in New York City. He described acute high-grade fever and cough with a background of 4 months of cough with occasional blood-streaked sputum. He was a New York City resident originally from China; he reported no known sick contacts or recent travel. Chest radiograph demonstrated a dense left basilar opacity (Figure 1), and point-of-care ultrasound revealed a left pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis (Video E1 in the online supplement). Patient was placed in respiratory and contact isolation because of concern about coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as well as tuberculosis (TB). Initial workup included a nasal pharyngeal swab, which tested positive by RT-PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Complete blood count revealed lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count 935 cells/μl), and other routine laboratory values were within normal limits. A thoracentesis was performed, and 1.5 L of bloody, lymphocyte-predominant pleural fluid was removed. Sputum stained for acid-fast bacilli revealed moderate mycobacteria, and Gene-Xpert MTB/RIF sputum assay confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

### Probable enterotoxin-associated toxic shock syndrome caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis [^111h1pQa]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Lumbar puncture obtained clear cerebrospinal fluid, with the following indices: 0 white blood cells, 2 red blood cells, glucose 78, and protein 15. Gram stain and bacterial culture were negative; a meningitis/encephalitis PCR panel (Quest, Minneapolis, MN) was negative. Additionally, serum herpes simplex virus DNA PCR was negative. Serum varicella zoster virus DNA PCR was not done.

The patient's voided urine culture was initially considered a contaminant (despite its pure growth at high colony count), so treatment was directed against possible viral and bacterial causes of encephalopathy. This included vancomycin (hospital day 1–5), ceftriaxone (hospital day 1–8), clindamycin (hospital day 1–5), and acyclovir (hospital day 2–4). Doxycycline was begun on hospital day 4 and continued for a 10-day course, given concern for possible Chlamydia or Mycoplasma encephalitis. In retrospect, doxycycline might well have been active against coagulase-negative staphylococci.

On the empirical therapy (vancomycin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and acyclovir), the patient became afebrile within 72 hours. White blood cell count had normalized to 7.1 by hospitalization day 2 (Table 1); at that time his platelet count reached its nadir (Table 1), and subsequently returned to normal. No intravenous immunoglobulin or steroids were given. Plasma was obtained from residual of other ordered tests for later study.

Abdominal ultrasound on hospitalization day 3 showed mild right collecting system dilatation and an unremarkable bladder. Besides the complete abdominal ultrasound, a negative chest X-ray was obtained on hospital day 1. Repeat chest X-ray (portable) showed perihilar and left basilar opacities, read as a combination of atelectasis and edema. Confusion and hallucination persisted after fever resolution and removal of sedation. MRI of the brain, including MRA and MRV, was negative.

### What can we learn from chest radiographs in hypoxemic asthmatics? [^116CHtS7]. Pediatric Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Chest radiographs (X-rays) are frequently obtained on children with asthma exacerbations who remain hypoxemic after therapy even though their utility has not been evaluated.

Objective

To compare X-rays in hypoxemic and non-hypoxemic asthmatic children.

Methods

Over 21 months, X-rays were obtained on all persistently hypoxemic asthmatics (1–17 years, oxygen saturation < 93% in room air), and some non-hypoxemic asthmatics. A pediatric radiologist blinded to the patients' symptoms evaluated each X-ray for lung size, extravascular lung fluid, and atelectasis. Clinical outcomes including duration of hypoxemia, length of hospital stay, and admission to the PICU were assessed through chart audit after hospital discharge.

Results

A total of 445 patients were enrolled and stratified into four groups based on initial and post-treatment pulse oximetry measurements. Hypoxemic groups I and II were more likely to have large or small lungs (P < 0.05), severe interstitial fluid (P < 0.01), and atelectasis (P < 0.01) compared to non-hypoxemic group IV. Group I was more likely to have fluid in the alveolar space compared to all other groups (P < 0.01). Within hypoxemic group I, there was no association between any radiographic findings and our clinical outcomes.

Conclusion

Large or small lung sizes, extravascular fluid, and atelectasis were more common in the X-rays of hypoxemic asthmatics.

### Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection: chest CT findings [^116hcZZ2]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe the chest CT findings in seven patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Conclusion

The most common CT finding in hospitalized patients with MERS-CoV infection is that of bilateral predominantly subpleural and basilar airspace changes, with more extensive ground-glass opacities than consolidation. The subpleural and peribronchovascular predilection of the abnormalities is suggestive of an organizing pneumonia pattern.

### Is atelectasis related to the development of postoperative pneumonia? a retrospective single center study [^111HASnG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The incidence of pneumonia that occurred within the first 30 days following surgery was evaluated as the primary outcome, as recommended as a follow-up period for the occurrence of adverse events in perioperative medicine. The secondary outcomes were ICU admission rate and postoperative LOS. Atelectasis was defined as lung opacification with a shift of the mediastinum, hilum, or hemidiaphragm toward the affected area, and compensatory overinflation in the adjacent non-atelectatic lung on CXR obtained within the first 7 postoperative days. Radiological diagnoses were reported by the attending radiologists independent of the study. Preoperative CXR is a routine evaluation in every department while postoperative CXR is routinely obtained in a few departments or as required when a patient have fever, or develops respiratory symptoms, including dyspnea, shortness of breath, cough and sputum, or decrease of oxygen saturation in our hospital.

Postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed by respiratory physicians as consulted by the clinicians in charge of the patients based on the US Centers for Disease Control definition of pneumonia with two or more serial CXR showing at least one of the following findings: (i) new or progressive and persistent infiltrates, (ii) consolidation, and (iii) cavitation (one radiograph is sufficient for patients with no underlying pulmonary or cardiac disease). They also should have at least one of the following signs: (i) fever (> 38℃) with no other recognized cause; (ii) leukopenia (white cell count < 4 × 10⁹ /L) or leukocytosis (white cell count > 12 × 10⁹ /L), (iii) altered mental status with no other recognized cause for adults > 70 years old; and at least two of the following: (i) new onset of purulent sputum or change in character of sputum, or increased respiratory secretions, or increased suctioning requirements, (ii) new onset or worsening cough, dyspnea, or tachypnea, (iii) rales or bronchial breath sounds, and (iv) worsening gas exchange (hypoxemia, increased oxygen requirement, increased ventilator demand).

### Diagnosis and initial management of nonmalignant diseases related to asbestos [^113gVAuJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Medium credibility.

Rounded atelectasis — synonyms, causes, pathology, and clinical considerations are outlined: Rounded atelectasis, also known as shrinking pleuritis, contracted pleurisy, pseudotumor, Blesovsky's syndrome, or folded lung, presents radiographically as a mass and may be mistaken for a tumor. The condition may result from infolding of thickened visceral pleura with collapse of the underlying lung parenchyma, and histologic examination shows folded and fibrotic visceral pleura with atelectasis and variable amounts of interstitial fibrosis in the adjacent lung parenchyma. Clinical experience suggests that it is more likely to occur today as a result of asbestos exposure than other causes, the sudden appearance of rounded atelectasis may follow acute pleuritis with effusion, it may be unilateral and bilateral, and asbestos bodies and/or evidence of asbestos should be carefully sought because it is frequently removed surgically as a suspected peripheral lung cancer.

This patient is a 76-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, hypotension, suspected GI bleed with severe anemia, and sepsis of unknown origin. She was positive for COVID-19 pneumonia and became acutely hypoxic on hospital day 3, requiring emergent intubation. The hospital course was complicated by septic shock leading to multi organ system failure. Throughout her hospital course she continued to require vasopressor support and was ventilator dependent. Her ventilator support requirements remained stable and approximately 3 weeks into her hospital course she was found to have extensive clinical left sided subcutaneous emphysema. This prompted a CXR revealing a left small to moderate basilar pneumothorax with diffuse subcutaneous emphysema (Fig. 4 a). The PEEP was decreased from 10 to 5 cm H₂O in the following 24 h and expectant management was pursued. Sequential X-rays showed pneumothorax stability and 2 days later follow up chest x-ray identified an additional small right sided apical pneumothorax (Fig. 4 b). Despite the decrease in vent settings, she was unable to be completely weaned from the ventilator. She had persistent tiny apical pneumothoraces until 11 days after the initial pneumothorax when CXR showed resolution of her pneumothoraces with unchanged subcutaneous emphysema. Her hospital course was complicated by renal failure and septic shock due to Staph aureus and E. coli pneumonia which required multiple vasopressors. She gradually became less stable and due to her prognosis, a family meeting was held to make the patient comfort measures only. She expired 21 days after initial pneumothorax seen with no evidence of redevelopment.

Chest X-ray image model

We process chest X-ray images using a deep convolutional neural network model, which we call COVID-GMIC, based on the GMIC model. COVID-GMIC has two desirable properties. First, COVID-GMIC generates interpretable saliency maps that highlight regions in the X-ray images that correlate with clinical deterioration. Second, it possesses a local module that is able to utilize high-resolution information in a memory-efficient manner. This avoids aggressive downsampling of the input image, a technique that is commonly used on natural images, which may distort and blur informative visual patterns in chest X-ray images such as basilar opacities and pulmonary consolidation. In Supplementary Table 4, we demonstrate that COVID-GMIC achieves comparable results to DenseNet-121, a neural network model that is not interpretable by design, but is commonly used for chest X-ray analysis –.

The architecture of COVID-GMIC is schematically depicted in Fig. 1 b. COVID-GMIC processes an X-ray image(H and W denote the height and width) in three steps. First, the global module helps COVID-GMIC learn an overall view of the X-ray image. Within this module, COVID-GMIC utilizes a global network f g to extract feature maps, where h, w, and n denote the height, width, and number of channels of the feature maps. The resolution of the feature maps is chosen to be coarser than the resolution of the input image. For each time window, we apply a 1 × 1 convolution layer with sigmoid activation to transform h g into a saliency mapthat highlights regions on the X-ray image which correlate with clinical deterioration. For visualization purposes, we apply nearest neighbor interpolation to upsample the saliency maps to match the resolution of the original image. Each elementrepresents the contribution of the spatial location (i, j) in predicting the onset of adverse events within time window t. In order to train f g, we use an aggregation functionto transform all saliency maps A t for all time windows t into classification predictions:where H + denotes the set containing the locations of the r % largest values in A t, and r is a hyperparameter.

### Predictors of airspace disease on chest X-ray in emergency department patients with clinical bronchiolitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111J59pv]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

An abnormal chest X-ray (CXR) inconsistent with simple bronchiolitis is found in 7%-23% of cases. Despite national guidelines stating "current evidence does not support routine radiography in children with bronchiolitis"; the use of CXR in these patients remains high. Inappropriate use of CXR not only exposes children to excess radiation, but also increases medical costs. The majority of the time, CXRs are obtained to diagnose or rule out pneumonia. We aim to provide an evidence-based approach defining the utility of CXR in bronchiolitis for the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial pneumonia.

Objectives

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe potential predictors of a CXR with airspace disease in patients with bronchiolitis.

Methods

We searched the medical literature from 1965 to June 2015 in PubMed/EMBASE using the following PICO formulation of our clinical question, "What characteristic(s) of history/physical examination (H&P) and vital signs (VS) in a child with bronchiolitis should prompt the physician to order a CXR?": Patients-pediatric emergency department (ED) patients (< 2 years) with clinical bronchiolitis; Intervention-H&P and VS; Comparator-a CXR positive for airspace disease (+CXR), defined as atelectasis versus infiltrate or infiltrate/consolidation; and Outcome-operating characteristics of H&P and VS predicting an +CXR were calculated: sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LR+ or LR-). The methodologic quality of the studies was assessed using the quality assessment of studies of diagnostic accuracy tool (QUADAS-2). We created a test-treatment threshold model based on the operating characteristics of the CXR to accurately identify a child with bronchiolitis and a superimposed bacterial pneumonia while accounting for the risks of a CXR and risks of treating patients with and without a bacterial infection.

Results

We found five studies including 1,139 patients meeting our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Prevalence of a +CXR ranged from 7% to 23%. An oxygen saturation < 95% was the predictor with highest LR+ of 2.3 (95% confidence interval = 1.3 to 3.07) to predict a +CXR. None of the H&P and VS variables were found to have sufficiently low LR- to significantly decrease the pretest probability of finding a +CXR. Our test-treatment threshold model showed that hypoxia (O₂ Sat < 95%) alone complicating bronchiolitis did not show a benefit to obtaining a CXR. Our model only suggested that a CXR maybe indicated for a child with hypoxia (O 2 Sat < 95%) and respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support.

Conclusion

No single predictor of a +CXR was of sufficient accuracy to either support or refute ordering a CXR in a child with clinical bronchiolitis. We provide a decision threshold model to estimate a test threshold for obtaining a CXR and a treatment threshold for administering antibiotics. Application of this model requires the clinician to approximate the empiric benefit of antibiotics based on the clinical situation, highlighting the importance of clinical assessment.

CTPA results of the patients

This study separately analyzed the CTPA characteristics of patients with ATB and PTE, and its direct signs of central, eccentric, mixed, and complete obstructive filling defects in the pulmonary artery; indirect signs include sparse blood vessels in the lung field, wedge-shaped pulmonary infarction with the tip pointing to the hilar and atelectasis, pulmonary hypertension, pleural effusion, etc. In this group, The CTPA characteristics of patients in test group were analyzed separately, and the peripheral type was higher than the central type (39 vs. 20, P = 0.024). The imaging characteristics of pulmonary infarction (8 vs. 0, P = 0.001) and atelectasis (34 vs. 31, P = 0.004) in test group were significantly more than those in control group, however, there was no difference in pleural effusion and cavity between the two groups (P > 0.05) (Table 4). From the images, we can see the chest CT findings of the two patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Both patients have extensive lesions. According to the vascular embolization site, one is a pure peripheral type, and the other has both central and peripheral types (Fig. 1).

Small airway disease on CT — lesion scale, voxel-level classification, and PRM/DPM performance are characterized as follows: Pathology of small conducting airways (≤ 2 mm in diameter) may be detected on CT as mosaicism, air trapping, ground-glass opacities, centrilobular nodules, tree-in-bud opacities, and atelectasis. To quantify air trapping, paired inspiratory/expiratory CT may be aligned for landmark coregistration, and individual voxels are classified as low attenuation, functional small airway disease (fSAD), or normal using either fixed attenuation thresholds with parametric response mapping (PRM) or continuous distributions of volume-dependent attenuation changes with the disease probability measure (DPM). Air-trapped regions on expiration without low-attenuation voxels on inspiration indicate fSAD, and fSAD from either method correlates with multivariate lung function endpoints. DPM and PRM yield consistent results in normal subjects.

### A deep-learning-based framework for identifying and localizing multiple abnormalities and assessing cardiomegaly in chest X-ray [^117KJDuZ]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Prospective validation

To further validate the clinical applicability of the YOLOX model, a prospective test dataset was constructed. The mAP values obtained by the YOLOX model reached 0.631, 0.731 and 0.753 with IoU-T of 0.5, 0.3 and 0.1, respectively. (Supplementary Fig. 14). It is not difficult to find that the model still obtains high performance, and its mAP value with IoU-T of 0.5 even was the highest in all test datasets. However, regardless of how the IoU-T changed, the AP value of atelectasis was always lowest (0.222). The precision, recall and F1-score values obtained for each abnormality with different IoU-Ts on the prospective test dataset can be found in Supplementary Tables 6–8.

False-positive (FP) findings by the YOLOX model on each test dataset

The number of FP findings in each CXR is an important index that reflects how much additional attention and effort would be needed in the CXR interpretation workflows. We calculated the number of FP findings for each abnormality in each CXR contained in all test datasets with different IoU-T values, and the results are shown in Supplementary Table 22. Note that nodules accounted for the largest proportion of FP findings among all abnormalities (e.g. 53.23% in external test dataset B with an IoU-T of 0.3). However, the average number of FP findings of all abnormalities in each CXR did not exceed one with an IoU-T of 0.5. Thus, we believe that the YOLOX model has good performance in controlling FP findings and will not increase the workload of radiologists.

### The value of supine chest X-ray in the diagnosis of pneumonia in the basal lung zones [^113XMzEB]. Academic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Basal lung opacities are frequently observed on supine chest x-ray (SCXR) of intensive care patients, causing insecurity among clinicians and radiologists. We sought to determine the diagnostic accuracy of SCXR for basal pneumonia.

Materials and Methods

We identified 172 patients who received both SCXR and computed tomography within 1 hour. Two readers examined the SCXR and rated findings in both basal zones according to the following scale: 0 = "no pneumonia", 1 = "possible pneumonia", 2 = "highly suspected pneumonia". Computed tomography served as standard of reference. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) were calculated once pooling 0 and 1 as negative and once pooling 1 and 2 as positive finding.

Results

When pooling 0 and 1 as negative, sensitivity was 0.45 (right)/0.38 (left), specificity was 0.94/0.97, PPV was 0.76/0.79, and NPV was 0.81/0.84. When pooling 1 and 2 as positive, sensitivity was 0.80/0.75, specificity was 0.62/0.58, PPV was 0.45/0.35, and NPV was 0.88/0.89. The most common findings in false-positive cases were combined pleural effusions and lower lobe atelectasis.

Conclusions

Interpreting only highly suspicious basal opacities as pneumonia considerably increases the PPV with almost constant NPV. Clinicians and radiologists should be aware of the limitations of SCXR regarding basal pneumonia.

Veil-like opacity

Left upper lobe collapse can present as a radiographic veil-like opacity projected over the left hemithorax, this subtle opacity is a result of anterior collapse of the left upper lobe, which produces a subtle opacity rather than a sharp interface with aerated lung as the X-ray beam crosses the abnormality en face rather than tangentially (Fig. 22). Associated radiographic features include elevation of the left hilum and hemidiaphragm and a crescentic lucency between the mediastinum and the atelectatic upper lobe known as the Luftsichel sign. The crescentic lucency represents the upward displacement of the lingula.

### Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. An official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^114fo2ji]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) narrative criteria — probable UIP linkage to histopathology and indeterminate pattern assignment state that an HRCT pattern of possible UIP with peripheral traction bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis in the correct clinical setting likely represents histopathologic UIP on biopsy; therefore, subpleural, basal-predominant reticular abnormalities with peripheral traction bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis should be regarded as "probable UIP", and ground-glass opacification may be present in probable UIP, but it is not a dominant feature. For the indeterminate for UIP pattern, atypical HRCT features frequently (i.e., about 30%) accompany a histopathologic pattern of UIP/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and the label should be assigned when HRCT demonstrates features of fibrosis but does not meet UIP or probable UIP criteria and does not explicitly suggest an alternative diagnosis; this includes patients with very limited subpleural ground-glass opacification or reticulation without obvious CT features of fibrosis in whom early UIP is suspected, where it should be confirmed with prone inspiratory views that the subpleural opacities do not represent dependent atelectasis. When the HRCT presentation appears as UIP, probable UIP, or indeterminate for UIP but ancillary findings suggest another cause, an alternative diagnosis to IPF should be reconsidered.

Fig. 1
Flowchart of the patients included in the study

After the analysis of the CT study, the patients were classified into three groups (Figs. 1, 2): (a) those who did not present atelectasis, (b) those who presented small atelectasi s (laminar, subsegmentary or segmentary atelectasis with estimated size of less than 5% of the forecasted lung volume) (small atelectasis hereinafter) and (c) those with significant atelectasis (atelectasis with estimated size of more than 5% of the forecasted lung volume) or a complete lobe collapse (large atelectasis hereinafter). In this sense, one radiologist specialized in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia performed a visual assessment based on the single slice in the CT with the largest atelectasis size and compared it to the estimated lung volume, classifying the patients into these three groups. We choose the 5% of lung surface as a cut-off point according to our capacity to detect and quantitate the % of lung with atelectasis. Table 1 shows basal characteristics of the patients that accomplished the inclusion criteria (including time from the beginning of symptoms).

### Accurate auto-labeling of chest X-ray images based on quantitative similarity to an explainable AI model [^115GDLuF]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Indeed, one limitation of our model is that its labeling accuracy and efficiency is directly proportional to the quality of the initial training set. This may help explain why cardiomegaly and pleural effusion - two high-conspicuity clinical output labels routinely correctly described in the radiology reports identified by NLP for model training - have higher efficiency metrics (Figs. 2 and 6) than pulmonary edema and pneumonia (Fig. 3), which are more non-specific and variably assessed by different radiologists. This also may help explain why the 1-pSim optimal values for NPV = 1 in Fig. 6 are higher than the 1-pSim optimal values for PPV = 1, for all clinical output labels except atelectasis (Fig. 4), since atelectasis is a lower conspicuity, more non-specific clinical output label typically noted in CXR radiology reports only when it is present, but not mentioned when it is absent (i.e. the model learned from its NLP derived training set to have a higher level of certainty, and hence a higher 1-pSim optimal value, when atelectasis is present, than when it is absent). Pulmonary edema and pneumonia, on the other hand, are typically described in CXR reports with a higher level of certainty when they are definitely absent (e.g. no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia), than when they are possibly present (e.g. cannot exclude pulmonary edema or pneumonia).

Moreover, because cardiomegaly and pleural effusion are focal, high-conspicuity regional imaging findings, they also demonstrate a higher TPCR performance with patch similarity than with confidence probability (Fig. 8). Similarly, for atelectasis, typically a more discrete, focal, regional CXR finding than pulmonary edema or pneumonia, both patch similarity and pSim (Fig. 8) show good TPCR performance relative to confidence probability. Conversely, for pulmonary edema, the only label for which TPCR performance is better with confidence probability than with patch similarity (Fig. 8), this result is consistent with the fact that confidence probability is more sensitive for the detection of global, non-localized features, which are routinely associated with pulmonary edema findings on CXR (i.e. pulmonary edema is visualized diffusely throughout the bilateral lung fields).

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia: pathobiological heterogeneity and diagnostic challenges [^1142SgZ2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Chest X-ray

In a recent UK survey, over 75% of ICU consultants reported they would request a CXR if clinically indicated by an acute change in clinical symptoms suspicious of VAP. CXRs are portable and enable bedside imaging, avoiding the risks associated with CT transfer. However, although relatively inexpensive and practical, the interpretation of CXR imaging is often challenging in critically ill ICU patients due to the overlap of other common pathologies which present with lung infiltrates, such as pulmonary contusions, atelectasis, pulmonary oedema or ARDS. CXR provides an isolated, two-dimensional image of a complex three-dimensional structure in which several tissues overlay one another, making interpretation challenging. CXR findings should be compared to previous imaging to establish new or progressive changes. The optimal approach for CXR requires posterior-anterior and lateral images in the erect posture, which is impossible in the critically ill patient, necessitating an anterior-posterior view. Imaging quality and interpretation are also confounded by factors such as body habitus, inspiration stage, disease progression and artefacts.

A recent systematic review reported that CXR had a sensitivity of 88.9% (95% CI 73.9–95.8) and a specificity of 26.1% (95% CI 15.1–41.4) with a significant discrepancy in interpretation, increasing the likelihood of late or missed diagnosis. A comparison of CT and CXR suggested poor cross-validation between CXR and CT chest, with less than 45% of opacities on CT observed on CXR and 26.9% vice versa. CXR may still be considered a valuable adjunct for diagnosing VAP.

### Assessment of recruitment from CT to the bedside: challenges and future directions [^115vFCiv]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Recruitability (atelectasis) distribution

To model the ARDS lung, it is helpful to view it as a mixture of pulmonary units with different physical status and characteristics (Fig. 4).
Some lung units, which are the core of the "baby lung" concept, have a nearly normal inflation status and are primarily located in the non-dependent regions of the lung (ventral in the supine position and dorsal in the prone position). The opening pressure of these units may be considered close to 0 cmH₂O, as they remain open at atmospheric pressure.
Compressive ("loose") atelectasis. These are caused by small airway collapse, which may leave some residual gas into the pulmonary units. These atelectasis are primarily caused by an increase in hydrostatic pressure due to the increase in lung weight. The affected lung units follow a spatial orientation which follows the gravitational axis from the non-dependent to the dependent lung. Across an iso-gravitational plane, not all the lung units have the same inflation status (all open or all closed), but the gas content varies due to the interaction between contiguous units (alveolar interdependence). The unit collapsing at end-expiration remains "loose" if they reopen during the next inspiration, being the opening pressure around 10–20 cmH₂O, otherwise the complete obstruction and reabsorption of gas will require higher pressures to reopen.
Obstructive (resorptive, "sticky") atelectasis. These are due to the complete reabsorption of gas from the pulmonary unit, which occurs when the airway remains closed for the entire respiratory cycle. This atelectasis are mostly distributed in the dependent regions, where the compressive forces are higher. Reabsorption atelectasis develops over time when regional gas uptake exceeds delivery, which depends on the F I O₂, regional ventilation/perfusion ratio, and likely the end-expiratory volume of the pulmonary units. Once no gas remains in these units, the transmural pressure required for reopening can reach 30–35 cm H₂O, corresponding to a plateau pressure exceeding 60 cm H₂O. It must be noted that the number of collapsed units is a determinant of the increase of the lung weight (i.e. the increase of the superimposed pressure).
The disease leading to ARDS may also cause a proportion of pulmonary units to be "consolidated". In this model consolidation refers to pulmonary units which are not only gasless, but their volume is occupied by liquid or solid material (e.g. as intra-alveolar edema, blood, cellular debris). In these units, the opening pressure is close to infinity, as no pressure will be able to increase the gas content. The distribution of consolidated units depends on the nature of the disease, and it is not predictable.

### Computed tomography scan contribution to the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia [^11556vYZ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conversely, some experts question the usefulness of demonstrating the presence of a pneumonic infiltrate on CT-scan in a patient without pneumonia on CXR but with a high burden of suggestive symptoms, arguing that in this scenario, antibiotic treatment should not be withhold. This opinion is comforted by a study suggesting that hospitalized patients without demonstrable infiltrate on CXR but with signs and symptoms of pneumonia had the same rate of pathogens identification in sputum and blood cultures and the same prognosis that those with a confirmed infiltrate on CXR. The patients without CXR infiltrate were older, and had a high prevalence of CXR modifications other than pneumonia (mainly lung emphysema, heart failure and atelectasis). Only 7% of them developed a pneumonic infiltrate on follow-up CXR realized 24–72 h later. However, pathogens identified in the blood cultures of the latter were mostly gram-negative aerobic bacilli or nonpneumoniae streptococci, compared with a majority of S. pneumoniae in patients with an infiltrate on CXR. This suggests that patients without radiologic infiltrate had other sources of infection and of respiratory symptoms.

Finally, even with CT-scan data, the presence of pneumonia cannot be unambiguously determined in some situations. Examples are patients with heart failure and pleural effusion, who frequently have basal atelectasis that cannot be distinguished from parenchymal infection; or patients with an acute infiltrate superimposed on a chronic interstitial pneumonia (Figs. 3 and 4). Hence, a diagnosis of pneumonia will still need a careful integration of clinical, biological and radiological findings.

### Surgical removal of an unusual huge solitary fibrous tumor in the mediastinum: a case report [^113nEmt9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 66-year-old female presented with an initial manifestation of ambiguous pain in the chest and dysphagia and later developed pitting edema in both lower extremities and cachexia five months before admission. Past medical history was unremarkable, and the patient denied exposure to asbestos or other drugs or harmful substances. In the physical examination, vital signs were stable, and nothing significant was found. However, laboratory findings showed hypoalbuminemia (albumin: 1.9 g/dl).

Before hospital admission, the patient underwent echocardiography, in which a mass was seen in the mediastinum. Therefore, a computed tomography (CT) was performed, showing an oval shaped, hypodense, well defined posterior mediastinal mass lesion measuring 160*80 mm in transverse and anteroposterior diameter, and 160mm in craniocaudal extension, causing anterior displacement of the heart, widening of subcarinal angle associated with mild to moderate right side pleural effusion. The adjacent thoracic vertebra was normal, however, linear atelectasis was also seen in basilar segment of right upper lobe (Fig. 1). Bronchoscopy was then performed, and a biopsy was taken. Pathological evaluation of the biopsy revealed a differential diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor or fibromatosis. The patient was then referred to our center for tumor excision.

### Heterogeneity and predictors of the effects of AI assistance on radiologists [^115woUc7]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

There are 15 pathologies with corresponding AI predictions: abnormal, airspace opacity, atelectasis, bacterial/lobar pneumonia, cardiomediastinal abnormality, cardiomegaly, consolidation, edema, lesion, pleural effusion, pleural other, pneumothorax, rib fracture, shoulder fracture and support device hardware. These pathologies, the interrelations among these pathologies and additional pathologies without AI predictions can be visualized in a hierarchical structure in Supplementary Fig. B.1. Radiologists were asked to familiarize themselves with the hierarchy before starting, had access to the figure throughout the experiment and had to provide predictions for pathologies following this hierarchy. This aimed to maximize clarity on the specific pathologies referenced in the experiment. When radiologists received AI assistance, they were simultaneously presented with the AI predictions for these 15 pathologies along with the patient's chest X-ray and, if applicable, their clinical history. The AI predictions were presented in the form of prediction probabilities on a 0–100 scale. The AI predictions were generated by the CheXpert model, which is a DenseNet121 (ref.)-based model for chest X-rays that has been shown to perform similarly to board-certified radiologists. The model generated a single prediction for fracture that was used as the AI prediction for both rib fracture and shoulder fracture. Authors of the CheXpert modeldecided on the 14 pathologies (with a single prediction for fracture) based on the prevalence of observations in radiology reports in the CheXpert dataset and clinical relevance, conforming to the Fleischner Society's recommended glossarywhenever applicable. Among the pathologies, they included 'Pneumonia' (corresponding to 'bacterial/lobar pneumonia') to indicate the diagnosis of primary infection and 'No Finding' (corresponding to 'abnormal') to indicate the absence of all pathologies. These pathologies were set in the creation of the CheXpert labeler, which has been applied to generate labels for reports in the CheXpert dataset and MIMIC-CXR, which are among the largest chest X-ray datasets publicly available.

### Heterogeneity and predictors of the effects of AI assistance on radiologists [^116QLbbQ]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

No singular trend was observed across individual pathologies. For eight pathologies (abnormal, airspace opacity, atelectasis, cardiomegaly, consolidation, lesion, pleural other and rib fracture), different AI error ranges showed statistically significant differences in treatment effect (Benjamini–Hochberg-adjusted P < 0.01). Among these pathologies, AI predictions that underestimated probabilities led to better treatment effects on airspace opacity, atelectasis, cardiomegaly, consolidation and lesion, whereas the trend was unclear for the remaining pathologies (Fig. 5b).

The same analysis could not be repeated for AUROC, because there were not both cases with the pathology present and cases with the pathology not present in each non-empty bin on all pathologies aggregated or any individual pathology, causing the AUROC to be undefined for most bins.

### Diagnosis and initial management of nonmalignant diseases related to asbestos [^113UUcMR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Medium credibility.

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in asbestos-exposed individuals — diagnostic sensitivity, imaging approach, and interpretation: HRCT is much more sensitive in the detection of asbestosis than plain chest radiographs, although even a normal HRCT cannot completely exclude asbestosis. Among asbestos-exposed individuals with unremarkable chest radiographic findings (ILO score 0/0 or 0/1), 34% were identified by HRCT as having findings suggestive of asbestosis. Prone views should always be obtained, as it is essential to distinguish between dependent atelectasis and parenchymal fibrosis in the posterior lung fields. HRCT findings in asbestosis are typically bilateral and include intralobular and interlobular septal thickening, subpleural "dotlike" opacities and lines, parenchymal bands, occasional ground-glass opacity, and honeycombing in advanced disease. The extent of parenchymal opacification does not correlate with cumulative asbestos exposure and thus cannot be used to estimate exposure.

Computed tomography allows an accurate assessment of the volumes of gas and lung tissue, respectively, and lung aeration. If computed tomographic sections are contiguous from the apex to the lung base, quantitative analysis can be performed either on the whole lung or, regionally, at the lobar level. Analysis requires a manual delineation of lung parenchyma and is facilitated by software, including a color-coding system that allows direct visualization of overinflated, normally aerated, poorly aerated, and nonaerated lung regions. In addition, lung recruitment can be measured as the amount of gas that penetrates poorly aerated and nonaerated lung regions after the application of positive intrathoracic pressure.

Data Summary

The lung in acute respiratory distress syndrome is characterized by a marked increase in lung tissue and a massive loss of aeration. The former is homogeneously distributed, although with a slight predominance in the upper lobes, whereas the latter is heterogeneously distributed. The lower lobes are essentially nonaerated, whereas the upper lobes may remain normally aerated, despite a substantial increase in regional lung tissue. The overall lung volume and the cephalocaudal lung dimensions are reduced primarily at the expense of the lower lobes, which are externally compressed by the heart and abdominal content when the patient is in the supine position. Two opposite radiologic presentations, corresponding to different lung morphologies, can be observed. In patients with focal computed tomographic attenuations, frontal chest radiography generally shows bilateral opacities in the lower quadrants and may remain normal, particularly when the lower lobes are entirely atelectatic. In patients with diffuse computed tomographic attenuations, the typical radiologic presentation of "white lungs" is observed. If these patients lie supine, lung volume is preserved in the upper lobes and reduced in the lower lobes, although the loss of aeration is equally distributed between the upper and lower lobes. This observation does not support the "opening and collapse concept" described as the "sponge model". In fact, interstitial edema, alveolar flooding, or both, not collapse, are histologically present in all regions of the lung in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Compression atelectasis is observed only in caudal parts of the lung, where external forces (such as cardiac weight, abdominal pressure, and pleural effusion) tend to squeeze the lower lobes. When a positive intrathoracic pressure is applied to patients with focal acute respiratory distress syndrome, poorly aerated and nonaerated lung regions are recruited, whereas lung regions that are normally aerated at zero end-expiratory pressure tend to be rapidly overinflated, increasing the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury.

Conclusion

Selection of the optimal positive end-expiratory pressure level should not only consider optimizing alveolar recruitment, it should also focus on limiting lung overinflation and counterbalancing compression of the lower lobes by maneuvers such as appropriate body positioning. Prone and semirecumbent positions facilitate the reaeration of dependent and caudal lung regions by partially relieving cardiac and abdominal compression and may improve gas exchange.

### Enhancing fairness in AI-enabled medical systems with the attribute neutral framework [^117P8Jtv]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Figure 5 showcases four examples evaluated by AI judges, human judges, and DDMs. It can be observed that the neutralized X-ray image increases the uncertainty of the AI judges and human judges in identifying the attributes compared to the original X-ray image. However, the neutralized-based DDM can still identify the corresponding findings from the neutralized X-ray images, and the detection results are consistent with those of the original-based DDM.

Four examples showcasing disease diagnosis on original and neutralized X-ray images.

The attributes for each example are as follows: a female, < 60 y; b female, ≥ 60 y; c male, < 60 y; and d male, ≥ 60 y. The identified findings for these examples are as follows: a infiltration; b emphysema; c nodule; and d atelectasis, effusion. Each subfigure consists of an original X-ray image and its corresponding neutralized X-ray image. The neutralized attributes are sex and age, and the modification intensity α is 0.5. The attributes of the X-ray images are identified by AI judges and human judges, while the findings of X-ray images are identified by the DDM. AI judges and DDMs report output probabilities.

Comet tail sign

The "comet tail" sign consists in a curvilinear opacity that leads from a subpleural mass towards the ipsilateral hilum (Fig. 7). It was described in 1986 in a case report by Verschakelen. The "tail of the comet" represents the distorted vessels and bronchus near the contiguous area of the round atelectasis. Frequently, a thickening of the adjacent pleura and a displacement of the adjacent fissures are associated. Round atelectasis is a form of rare parenchymal collapse which occurs adjacent to the pleural surface, with a frequent presence of air bronchogram in the context. Over time, it has been given various names, such as "Blesovsky syndrome" or "atelectasic pseudotumor", often reproducing a tumor-like appearance. The atelectasis may be explained by the presence of irritant substances along the pleural surface, such as asbestos: consequently, the pleura appears thickened, and the pulmonary parenchyma may be contracted — developing a round form of atelectasis.

Fig. 7
Comet tail sign. Axial CT image (a) shows a round consolidation (black asterisk) and stretched vessel and bronchus (white arrows): these combinations — reproducing a "comet tail" at the border of a round lesion — suggest the presence of round atelectasis. On axial CT image (b, mediastinal window), a dorsal pleural plaque with calcification is also appreciable (white arrowhead)

### Pulmonary atelectasis: a pathogenic perioperative entity [^1162M4jH]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Atelectasis occurs in the dependent parts of the lungs of most patients who are anesthetized. Development of atelectasis is associated with decreased lung compliance, impairment of oxygenation, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and development of lung injury. The adverse effects of atelectasis persist into the postoperative period and can impact patient recovery. This review article focuses on the causes, nature, and diagnosis of atelectasis. The authors discuss the effects and implications of atelectasis in the perioperative period and illustrate how preventive measures may impact outcome. In addition, they examine the impact of atelectasis and its prevention in acute lung injury.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound in patients with COVID-19: pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or something else? [^117Qd4dh]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a very heterogeneous disease. Some aspects of COVID-19 pneumonia question the real nature of ground glass opacities and its consolidative lesions. It has been hypothesized that COVID-19 lung involvement could represent not only a viral effect but also an immune response induced by the infection, causing epithelial/endothelial lesions and coagulation disorders. We report 3 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in which contrast-enhanced ultrasound was suggestive of consolidations with perfusion defects, at least in part caused by ischemic or necrotic changes and not only by inflammatory or atelectasis events.

### Is atelectasis related to the development of postoperative pneumonia? a retrospective single center study [^113dsa93]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that a high inspired oxygen fraction (versus a low inspired oxygen fraction) had no effect on the incidence of pneumonia despite the increased incidence of postoperative atelectasis in patients undergoing non-thoracic surgery under general anesthesia. Three possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain the atelectasis: resorption of alveolar air (i.e. absorption atelectasis), direct compression of lung tissue (i.e. compression atelectasis), and surfactant impairment. The atelectasis was mainly attributed to absorption of alveolar air that spontaneously resolves within 24 to 48 h in a previous study. On the other hand, upper abdominal surgery, which favors the development of compression atelectasis, was more frequent and the duration of general anesthesia eliciting both forms of atelectasis (i.e. surfactant dysfunction and compression) was longer in the atelectasis group than in the non-atelectasis in our study. The discrepancy between the studies may be accounted for by different pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development of atelectasis.

The reported incidence of postoperative pneumonia varies widely by the site and type of surgery performed from 0.5% to 28.9%. The incidence in our study (3.2%) was higher than that (1.8%) in ASA status III patients undergoing non-cardiothoracic predominantly abdominal and pelvic surgery. The subjects were limited to 7-day postoperative follow-up in their study, whereas ours were to 30-day. In addition, 38.0% of postoperative CXRs were obtained from patients with symptoms of respiratory diseases including fever, shortness of breath, and cough. It has been reported that atelectasis itself does not complicate pneumonia, but may contribute to the development of pneumonia when exposed to infectious agents. Since the fever that accompanies atelectasis is related to infection distal to the obstructed airway, atelectasis may have progressed to pneumonia in some patients with postoperative CXR. Alternatively, it is also possible that pneumonia might have led to atelectasis because the presence of fever may reflect infectious complications rather than atelectasis. A longer follow-up period and bias in patient selection may explain why the incidence of pneumonia in our study was higher than that in a previous one.

### Airway closure, more harmful than atelectasis in intensive care? [^111wMvaU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Since the mid-1980s, atelectasis has been demonstrated during anesthesia in lung healthy subjects and in intensive care patients suffering from acute respiratory failure and requiring ventilator support. In the latter case, there are additional causes of airless lung tissues, such as alveolar fluid filling and consolidation. The airless tissue is still perfused, causing a shunt with impairment of the oxygenation of blood. Moreover, cyclic opening and closing of alveolar units may harm the tissue and trigger an inflammatory reaction. This is well known and has been considered a major morphological disturbance in the mechanically ventilated subject. However, there are indirect observations of another morphological disturbance, some airways that are either continuously closed or cyclically opening and closing during the ventilation. This airway closure is a normal phenomenon, although of small magnitude and seldom continuous, in awake, spontaneously breathing healthy subjects. It begins in dependent lung regions and spreads out to include additional airways during the continuing expiration. However, during anesthesia and in acute respiratory failure airway closure is much more marked and may be of similar importance as alveolar airlessness in impeding lung function, and promoting inflammation.

### Effect of variations in atelectasis on tumor displacement during radiation therapy for locally advanced lung cancer [^1139UxnA]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Patients with AT have significantly greater PT displacement than patients without AT. AT and PT volume changes during radiation treatment were associated with tumor displacements that exceed standard setup margins. The use of bronchi that are close to the PT to assess the impact of AT change on PT shift without the confounding issue of PT regression needs further study before bronchi can be used as a surrogate for the PT. Repeated 3-dimensional imaging is recommended in patients with AT to evaluate for PT displacements during treatment and image guidance strategies such as a traffic light protocolshould be considered to manage these patients.

### Assessment of mass classification from chest X-ray using double-transfer learning: a comparative study with diverse image selection for single-transfer learning [^111tj39p]. Clinical Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of double-transfer learning (double-TL) in enhancing the artificial intelligence (AI) model performance of mass image classification of chest X-Ray images.

Materials and Methods

Chest X-ray images of various diseases (infiltration, atelectasis, effusion, and nodule) were selected for the single-TL phase in double-TL process. Then four AI models (Infiltration-Mass, Atelectasis-Mass, Effusion-Mass, and Nodule-Mass) were trained using double-TL. For comparison, an AI model of Mass was trained using single-TL.

Results

The area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.795, 0.785, 0.785, and 0.783 for the Effusion-Mass, Infiltration-Mass, Atelectasis-Mass, and Nodule-Mass models, respectively, while the Mass model showed an AUC of 0.788. The Nodule-Mass model achieved the highest recall for disease (0.75) and precision for healthy (0.86). Overall, the double-TL models showed comparable or slightly improved performance over the Mass model.

Conclusion

Although double-TL showed marginal improvements in some models, such as higher sensitivity in the Nodule-Mass model, overall performance gains were limited. These findings highlight that double-TL may benefit specific tasks but did not consistently outperform single-TL. The performance of double-TL is highly contingent upon both the size and feature similarity of the selected images, indicating that appropriate image selection is crucial for maximising the efficacy of double-TL in healthcare applications.

### Diagnosis and initial management of nonmalignant diseases related to asbestos [^112JgdL4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Medium credibility.

Asbestosis imaging — CT and HRCT roles: A chest film clearly showing characteristic signs of asbestosis with a compatible exposure history is adequate for diagnosis without further imaging; conventional CT is superior to chest films for identifying parenchymal lesions, rounded atelectasis, and pleural plaques, but has been displaced by high-resolution CT (HRCT) because HRCT is more sensitive for detecting parenchymal fibrosis; in low profusion categories, CT signs cluster as honeycombing and thickening of septa and interlobular fissures, diffuse pleural thickening with parenchymal bands and rounded atelectasis suggesting visceral pleural fibrosis, and pleural plaques; HRCT has an important role when experienced readers disagree about abnormalities on a high-quality chest film, when chest radiographic findings are equivocal, when diminished pulmonary function is present with otherwise normal chest radiographs, and when extensive overlying pleural abnormalities obscure parenchymal markings, and because it is more sensitive than other techniques it may reveal abnormalities with uncertain prognostic significance.

### Is atelectasis related to the development of postoperative pneumonia? a retrospective single center study [^116Jp16z]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, it is a single center study, and there may be a lack of representativeness of the entire population. Second, being a retrospective study, it is not free from bias in patient selection and treatment. Not all covariates were controlled, nor were demographic and clinical characteristics. Third, the intraoperative use of high oxygen concentration or no PEEP is known to be associated with increased severity of atelectasis. However, anesthetic management during the surgery was not harmonized among patients, and every patient followed routine anesthetic management in our hospital. Fourth, CXR, an inexpensive and the most frequently ordered radiological test, was used to determine atelectasis, resulting in some under-estimation of actual atelectasis cases. Chest CT scans have shown greater diagnostic sensitivity in patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery compared with CXR and remains the accepted standard when measuring atelectasis. In addition, lung ultrasound was shown to be superior to CXR in diagnosing PPCs following cardiothoracic surgery. It has been widely used since it is portable, dynamic, and free of radiation. Finally, we did not control for baseline lung function and did not report on the specific interventions used to manage postoperative atelectasis, which limits the ability to make specific recommendations for clinical practice.

In conclusion, our retrospective study demonstrated that patients with postoperative atelectasis had a 2.33-fold higher risk of postoperative pneumonia than those without. Moreover, the development of postoperative atelectasis was associated with a prolonged LOS, while not being with ICU admission. Clinicians should try to prevent or treat postoperative atelectasis to reduce devastating adverse events including postoperative pneumonia, and to decrease resource utilization and healthcare expenditure in patients undergoing elective non-cardiothoracic surgery. Atelectasis as a risk factor for pneumonia warrants further investigation.

### Dieulafoy's disease of the bronchus: rare but potentially fatal: a case report and a review of literature [^114JXodx]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Establishing the diagnosis of Dieulafoy's disease can be quite difficult. An exhaustive evaluation was lead with chest X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, bronchoscopies, biopsies and bronchial angiographies in historical cases.

In Dieulafoy's disease of the bronchus, chest X-rays and chest CT are rarely contributive to the diagnosis. The relevance of this exam is its contribution to excluding other lung diseases causing the bleeding. In this review, Chest X-ray was performed for 38 patients. Whereas, 79 patients had chest CT. They showed mostly manifestations of an intrapulmonary hemorrhage with ground glass opacities (24 cases) and inflammatory changes (34 cases). Other findings were atelectasis (10 cases), consolidation (5 cases), bronchiectasis (10 cases) and endobronchial nodes or masses (6 cases). Due to lack of specificity and sensitivity, most authors agree that chest X-rays and CT scans are not the best modality to diagnose Dieulafoy's disease.

### Chest-CT mimics of COVID-19 pneumonia-a review article [^112jiuZd]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Chest-CT has been widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic, being a fast and easily accessible technique in most healthcare centers. CT has a high sensitivity, about 94–97%, in detecting early signs of COVID-19 pneumonia, disease progression, complications, and possible alternative diagnoses such as heart failure or pulmonary embolism. However, the specificity of CT is low (about 37%), since many lung diseases that can mimic COVID-19 pneumonia CT appearance. Indeed, many radiology professionals societies recommend against performing CT as a primary technique for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

Particularly, the Fleischner Society Multinational Consensus Statement attempts to standardize the criteria for the use and interpretation of CT in COVID-19 pandemic, by stratifying patients according to risk and severity of symptoms. According to the Multinational Consensus Statement, CT is not recommended as a screening tool for COVID-19 infection in asymptomatic patients nor in patients with mild symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection, unless there are risk factors for progression. CT is indicated in patients with moderate to severe symptoms, regardless of the RT-PCR result, and in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection with worsening respiratory symptoms.

Nowadays, in most institutions, pulmonary CT is usually performed using 64-, 256-, or 128-slice multidetector row CT scanners. Images are acquired with the use of standard tube voltage and current settings (120 kV, 200 mAs, varying depending on patients' body mass index, 16 × 0.75 collimation and pitch = 0.938) with a scanning range covering the area from lungs apices to the diaphragm, generally with a cranio-caudal scanning direction.

Patients are generally scanned in supine position during a deep-inspiration breath hold. However, prone position can be particularly useful to differentiate between parenchymal abnormalities in the posterior regions and dependent lung atelectasis. Expiratory acquisition may be needed to distinguish air-trapping from hypo-vascular mosaic attenuation; it needs to be noted though, that expiratory acquisitions are not routinely performed as it might be physically demanding for patients with acute disease, such as COVID-19 pneumonia.

### Anesthesia considerations to reduce motion and atelectasis during advanced guided bronchoscopy [^116aoVKd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Atelectasis is common during advanced guided bronchoscopic biopsy and can cause CT-to-body divergence, interfering with the ability to obtain diagnostic tissue. The anesthesia techniques proposed in this paper are designed to stabilize dependent areas of the lung, reduce atelectasis, minimize motion artifact, and provide more accurate localization during guided bronchoscopy. Future randomized studies are needed to prospectively compare bronchoscopy procedures with and without optimized ventilation strategies.

### Lung function imaging methods in cystic fibrosis pulmonary disease [^1111UtZM]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

X-Ray based methods

Chest X-Ray (CXR)

Chest X-Ray is a fast and widely used method of assessing anatomical changes in the lungs. For patients with Cystic Fibrosis it is recommended to perform a chest X-Ray once a year. However, due to the low spatial resolution, it is only suitable for providing global morphological information such as atelectasis or pleural effusion. Furthermore, it does not give any functional information.

High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT)

High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) in patients with Cystic Fibrosis was performed for the first time almost 30 years ago. Since then, HRCT has become the most widely utilised method to assess morphological changes in CF-related lung disease. Due to the high spatial resolution, it has been demonstrated to be more sensitive in detecting pulmonary abnormalities than spirometry. CT is especially helpful in visualizing trapped gas which occurs even in infants not experiencing other pulmonary symptoms. A recent study demonstrated that gas trapping measured by CT correlates well with spirometry.

To reduce movement artefact, especially in infants, researchers use controlled ventilation high resolution computed tomography (CV-HRCT). The images are comparable with those from adults undertaking the breath-hold test, and the method has been used to detect CF-related lung disease in infants. Recently Sheikh et al. (2015) presented outcomes showing CV-HRCT was sensitive enough to detect improvements in lungs after antibiotic therapy, and thus assessed the effectiveness of the applied treatment. Nevertheless, both HRCT and CXR require significant exposure to X-Rays. Although the radiation induced cancer risk in CF patients undertaking annual CT lung scans is less than 0.5% (the background radiation induced cancer risk is 1.64%), it must be noted that the cumulative radiation dose to multiple CXR may have unknown adverse effects.

Normal post-operative anatomy

A. Wedge resection and segmentectomy Wedge resection is a non-anatomic sublobar resection, whereas segmentectomy corresponds to an anatomic sublobar resection of one to four segments. CXR and CT show a linear increased density due to a parenchymal staple line (Fig. 1). At early stage, a small area of peripheral ground-glass opacities and consolidation can be observed on CT images, reflecting contusion and haemorrhage. Fig. 1 Wedge resection. Axial CT image (parenchymal window) shows a linear increased density due to a parenchymal staple line (black arrow)
B. Lobectomy and bilobectomy One or two lobes are resected, resulting in a significant loss of volume, with compensation by expansion and reorientation of the remaining lobe(s), associated with mediastinal deviation and displacement of the bronchovascular hilar structures. Post-operative monitoring consists of a daily CXR, on which the positioning of the drain(s) is evaluated, as well as the re-expansion of the remaining homolateral lobe(s) (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Post-operative radiograph of a right lower lobe resection. CXR allows visualisation of the drains in postero-basal (black arrow) and antero-apical (white arrow) positions The early post-operative aspect consists in a pneumothorax or hydropneumothorax of low abundance, parietal emphysema and retraction of the hemithorax. After a few days and weeks, a decrease in the signs of retraction and an expansion of the remaining lobe(s) appear. Later on, imaging shows retraction of the operated hemithorax, mediastinal attraction, filling of the costo-diaphragmatic recess, elevation of the diaphragmatic dome, hilar displacement and pulmonary hyperlucency (related to compensatory hyperinflation with relative vascular rarefaction); parietal sequelae and surgical material persist. Chest X-ray can demonstrate juxta-phrenic peak sign or a pseudo-lobar collapse aspect that can be misleading for atelectasis if the operating history is not known by the radiologist (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 Lobar pseudo-collapse and juxta-phrenic peak sign. A: CXR showing a left upper lobar pseudo-collapse (white arrow). B: right juxta-phrenic peak sign (white arrowhead) Scissure changes and displacement may vary according to the site of lobectomy. Left upper lobectomy: imaging shows an ascension of the lower lobe with its scissural aspect facing the anterior upper mediastinum where a fluid collection can appear and persist permanently or be secondarily replaced by fibrous tissue. Left lower lobectomy: downward and backward movement of the lingula. Right upper lobectomy: upward displacement of the middle lobe and the apical segment of the lower lobe, revealing a frontally oriented cranial neoscissure in the extension of the initial oblique scissure. Right middle lobectomy: slight loss of lung volume, with merging of the upper and lower lobes, revealing an oblique caudal neoscissure. Right lower lobectomy: downward displacement of the dorsal segment of the upper lobe and rearward displacement of the middle lobe, showing an axially oriented posterior neoscissure; there may be a notable variation, with a greater displacement of the dorsal segment of the upper lobe extending to the diaphragm. Bilobectomy: the loss of volume is much greater, with mediastinal deviation on the operated side and diaphragmatic ascent; in case of missing information, it is possible to identify the residual lobe by looking at the vessels and the bronchial tree (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Scissure changes and normal displacement after lobectomy (parenchymal windowing). A: Sagittal CT image of a left upper lobectomy showing hyperinflated left lower lobe and mediastinal fat attraction without scissure.

E Sagittal CT image after right middle lobectomy with oblique caudal neoscissure (black arrow). F: Sagittal CT image after right lower lobectomy with axially oriented posterior neoscissure (white arrowhead)
C. Pneumonectomy Corresponds to the resection of an entire lung with or without resection of the parietal pleura. Post-operative monitoring consists of a daily CXR that visualises the evolution of the pneumonectomy cavity. In the early post-operative period, an air-filled cavity with parietal and sometimes mediastinal emphysema is visualised in the immediate aftermath, with the trachea and mediastinum in median position. A progressive accumulation of liquid is observed with the appearance of an air–fluid level. The cavity fills at a rate of about two intercostal spaces per day. The key point to remember is that the air–fluid level reaches the upper half or two-thirds of the hemithorax in 4 to 7 days. Complete filling occurs after a few weeks or months. Absence of filling or decrease in the level should raise concern for complication. The trachea and mediastinum gradually move to the operated side, with ascent of the diaphragmatic dome and intercostal pinch on the same side. The contralateral lung undergoes compensatory expansion and becomes hypoattenuating due to vascular rarefaction (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Pneumonectomy cavity evolution. A: First post-operative CXR in the hours following left pneumonectomy, with a chest tube in antero-apical position. B: Day 3 CXR with progressive filling of the pneumonectomy cavity. C: Day 7 CXR on which you can see that the air–fluid level reaches two-thirds of the pneumonectomy cavity. D: CXR after 2 months showing a complete filling of the cavity Later, the pulmonary arterial stump may be the site of an alluvial thrombus (Fig. 6), generally non-pathological if it is not progressive. A long bronchial stump may be the site of an accumulation of secretions of fluid like and sometimes tissular attenuation on unenhanced chest CT. In such case, contrast uptake would suggest local recurrence or superimposed infection. Mediastinal deviation on the side of the pneumonectomy is seen at variable degrees. Possible parietal sequelae that can consist of costal reshaping, herniation of the parietal fat at the site of thoracic wall resection, lymph node removal clips and possibly a high attenuation Goretex prosthesis can be present in case of diaphragmatic surgery. Fig. 6 Alluvial thrombus. Axial CT image (mediastinal window) showing an alluvial thrombus in the left pulmonary arterial stump (black arrow) An interposition flap may cover the bronchial stump and show fatty attenuation. Finally, normal evolution of the post-pneumonectomy space can be towards complete resorption or the persistence of a residual pouch.
D. Sleeve lobectomy It is an alternative to pneumonectomy when the tumour invades the origin of a lobar bronchus or when N1 nodes are fixed at the origin of the lobar bronchus to be resected. This technique has the advantage of preserving a better inspiratory reserve than pneumonectomy. An enlarged lobectomy is performed to remove the invaded bronchial division with reimplantation of the remaining lobe on the main bronchus via a termino-terminal anastomosis, with or without arterial reimplantation. This surgery mostly involves the right upper lobe because of the advantage of the relative length of the intermediate bronchus allowing for reimplantation (Table 1, Fig. 7). Fig. 7 Schematic figure of sleeve lobectomy. Left: tumour involving the proximal right upper lobe bronchus is resected along with a segment of the intermediate bronchus with negative margins along with a segment of the intermediate bronchus.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of point-of-care ultrasound examinations [^111tPMdA]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). High credibility.

AIUM point-of-care lung ultrasound — key interpretive findings for lung sliding, loss of sliding, B-lines, and consolidation are described as follows. The finding of lung sliding is 100% sensitive for the exclusion of pneumothorax present at a given interspace, but multiple rib interfaces should be examined if the suspicion of pneumothorax is high, and a small apical pneumothorax may be missed because of shadowing from bone; if the presence of lung sliding is unclear in a patient with a high pretest probability, a further evaluation should be performed. When this pattern is present, pneumothorax cannot be ruled out, and examples of disease processes that cause loss of lung sliding without pneumothorax include pleurodesis, severe emphysema with bullous lung disease, a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome pattern, opposing main-stem intubation, and apnea. A B-line pattern can be present in, but not specific to, cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and the thickness of the pleura and the location of the B-line pattern may aid in the differentiation of these two disease processes. The clinician may be able to differentiate between atelectasis and pneumonia causing the consolidation.

### Pulmonary fibrosis on the lateral chest radiograph: kerley D lines revisited [^113PNv1g]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Fig. 5
63-year-old asymptomatic man with a normal radiograph (a) showing fine linear opacities in the retrosternal clear space that taper before reaching the sternum. In contrast, coarse reticular opacities form a mesh and extend to the sternum (b) in a 67-year-old man with an unclassified pulmonary fibrosis (CT not shown)

Some individuals with an abundance of soft tissue in the chest wall, such as obese people or women with large breasts, have an opaque retrosternal space. In these instances, the opacity of the retrosternal region is similar to that of the heart and not as lucent as the retrocardiac clear space. Nevertheless, basilar-predominant pulmonary fibrosis may still be better visualized in an opaque RCS than in the retrocardiac clear space (Figs. 6 and 7).

Fig. 6
67-year-old man with mild pulmonary fibrosis anteriorly and posteriorly on a sagittal CT slice (a). On the lateral radiograph (b), fibrosis is only evident anteriorly, despite the small size of the retrosternal clear space. The frontal radiograph (c) is normal

Fig. 7
84-year-old woman with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. On the lateral radiograph (a), reticular opacities are easily seen through an opaque retrosternal space. Although the retrocardiac space is more lucent, reticular opacities are not seen at the lung bases, despite the basilar predominance typical of UIP demonstrated on axial (b) and sagittal (c) CT slices

Although a lateral radiograph is not routinely performed at some institutions, nearly all of the outpatient chest radiographs at our institution include both frontal and lateral views. Many of our referrers request frontal and lateral radiographs as the initial work-up for interstitial lung disease prior to chest CT. We have found the lateral view to be a useful supplement to the frontal radiograph, particularly for evaluation of the RCS. In addition to occasionally being the only sign of interstitial lung disease on otherwise normal radiographs, the recognition of Kerley D lines can also boost the confidence of the radiologist who suspects but is uncertain about reticular opacities on the frontal view.

### Effect of variations in atelectasis on tumor displacement during radiation therapy for locally advanced lung cancer [^1121qJ1e]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Statistics

The associations between PT and AT parameters, such as volume reduction and PT position changes, were analyzed using a linear regression model or Mann–Whitney U test. Significance was assumed at P < .05. A multivariate model with independent variables for changes in PT and AT volumes was used to determine an association with PT displacement using both the COM and BB methods.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: classification, evaluation, and management of childhood interstitial lung disease in infancy [^117Q5BPD]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) imaging — perform thin-section CT at pediatric-experienced centers is suggested: For patients with chILD syndrome, we suggest that thin-section CT scans be performed at centers with expertise in performing pediatric chest CT, if possible (weak recommendation). The rationale states that pediatric imaging techniques can be challenging and require experience to obtain high-quality images that lead to an accurate diagnosis, including controlling lung inflation for inspiratory and expiratory imaging, use of high-pitch CT to minimize imaging time and motion, pediatric sedative medication when appropriate, and ventilation support to minimize atelectasis. Each technique appears to improve diagnostic accuracy, although confidence is limited by study design and small studies, and the recommended location reflects the belief that upsides such as improved diagnostic accuracy outweigh downsides such as cost and potential need for sedation.

### Perioperative pulmonary atelectasis: part I. biology and mechanisms [^112raTnz]. Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary atelectasis is common in the perioperative period. Physiologically, it is produced when collapsing forces derived from positive pleural pressure and surface tension overcome expanding forces from alveolar pressure and parenchymal tethering. Atelectasis impairs blood oxygenation and reduces lung compliance. It is increasingly recognized that it can also induce local tissue biologic responses, such as inflammation, local immune dysfunction, and damage of the alveolar-capillary barrier, with potential loss of lung fluid clearance, increased lung protein permeability, and susceptibility to infection, factors that can initiate or exaggerate lung injury. Mechanical ventilation of a heterogeneously aerated lung (e.g., in the presence of atelectatic lung tissue) involves biomechanical processes that may precipitate further lung damage: concentration of mechanical forces, propagation of gas-liquid interfaces, and remote overdistension. Knowledge of such pathophysiologic mechanisms of atelectasis and their consequences in the healthy and diseased lung should guide optimal clinical management.

### Clinical and organizational factors in the initial evaluation of patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116E2S4g]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Clinically symptomatic presentation — radiographic features by histology: The majority of patients with lung cancer present because of symptoms related to their tumors. In patients with nonspecific systemic symptoms, such as weight loss, the chest radiograph will be helpful in focusing attention quickly on the lungs as the most likely primary site, and in those with primary tumor symptoms, certain chest radiographic features should heighten concern for lung cancer, including that unexplained pleural effusion should always raise concern for malignancy. Central tumors may cause mechanical airway obstruction with associated atelectasis or parenchymal consolidation. Classically, squamous cell carcinomas are believed to arise in the central bronchi with local extension into the hilum and mediastinum, predisposing to bronchial obstruction, although peripheral squamous cell carcinomas with or without cavitation are not uncommon. Adenocarcinomas, which now comprise the majority of bronchogenic carcinomas, have been classically described as peripheral nodules or masses but may also present as central lesions with large airway obstruction. Small cell carcinomas, accounting for about 15% of all lung cancers, rarely present as isolated pulmonary nodules and are typically associated with hilar or mediastinal adenopathy and distant metastases.

### Radiographic uncertainty and outcomes of children with lower respiratory tract infections [^111skePp]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

Among 410 children with suspected pneumonia, nearly all improved within 1 week of ED discharge independent of radiographic findings. Among children without radiographic pneumonia (including those with atelectasis on CXR), improvement and postdischarge quality of life were not associated with antibiotic use. Our findings support withholding antibiotics among children with suspected LRTI but who have a normal or atelectatic chest radiograph and who are well enough to be discharged from the ED.

Antibiotic use increased with increasing certainty in the radiographic interpretation of pneumonia. Approximately half of children with probable atelectasis received antibiotics, suggesting therapeutic decisions are challenging when provided with a CXR interpretation that is not definitive. However, even among patients with radiographic pneumonia, a bacterial etiology is uncommon: in one study of 2222 children hospitalized with radiographic CAP, thorough pathogen testing identified a viral presence in 73% and bacterial presence in 15%. The absence of a clear association between antibiotic therapy and quality of life outcomes, including symptom improvement intervals, suggests that overdiagnosis may be occurring in this group. That is, many of the children without definitive (or with equivocal) radiographic pneumonia likely do not have a bacterial source that would benefit from antibiotics. However, these findings should be interpreted with the awareness that a higher proportion of children who did not receive antibiotics were more likely to have unscheduled follow-ups and antibiotic changes, though individual counts for these analyses were low in our sample. A clearer understanding of the balance of benefits and harms of antibiotics in children without radiographic pneumonia is needed, but this likely represents an important target of antimicrobial stewardship. When antibiotics are provided to children who are unlikely to benefit, potential harms are introduced, including antimicrobial resistance, side effects (e.g. diarrhea, rash), and allergy mislabeling.

### Basilar invagination diagnosis, classification, and radiology: WFNS spine committee recommendations [^112yBXNg]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A systematic literature review and consensus using Delphi method.

Objective

This review aimed to analyze recent literature on diagnosis, classification, and radiologic characteristics of Basilar Invagination (BI) to generate recommendations on these topics.

Summary Of Background

Basilar invagination diagnosis, classifications, and radiologic characteristics evolved during the last decade; however, many debatable criteria disturb a common language fundamental to compare clinical research.

Material and Methods

The WFNS Spine Committee organized two separate consensus meetings to discuss and create statements that were voted on to reach a consensus.

Results

Basilar invagination mainly results from a CVJ developmental abnormality and is often associated with congenital anomalies. There is also an acquired type that occurs by bone softening, such as rheumatoid arthritis. It can be classified as type I (atlantoaxial dislocation) and type II (without atlantoaxial dislocation) basilar invagination. Clinical signs may either be due to brainstem compression or cervical spinal cord compression and instability. Although many radiologic measurements are proposed, the most reliable ones are the McRae line, Chamberlain line, and Boogard angle.

Conclusions

Diagnosis of basilar invagination should be made by midsagittal craniocervical x-rays, CTs or MRI. There are two types of basilar invagination: type I basilar invagination is associated with instability, and treatment can focus on stabilization. However, type II basilar invagination may need decompressive surgeries.

### Patient rotation chest X-rays and the consequences of misinterpretation in paediatric radiology [^116ot1vt]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We aimed to demonstrate the consequences of rotation on neonatal chest radiographs and how it affects diagnosis. In addition, we demonstrate methods for determining the presence and direction of rotation.

Background

Patient rotation is common in chest X-rays of neonates. Rotation is present in over half of chest X-rays from the ICU, contributed to by unwillingness of technologists to reposition new-borns for fear of dislodging lines and tubes. There are six main effects of rotation on supine paediatric chest X-rays: 1) unilateral hyperlucency of the side that the patient is rotated towards; 2) the side 'up' appears larger; 3) apparent deviation of the cardiomediastinal shadow in the direction that the chest is rotated towards; 4) apparent cardiomegaly; 5) distorted cardio-mediastinal configuration; and 6) reversed position of the tips of the umbilical artery and vein catheters with rotation to the left. These effects can cause diagnostic errors due to misinterpretation, including air-trapping, atelectasis, cardiomegaly, and pleural effusions, or disease may be masked. We demonstrate the methods of evaluating rotation with examples, including a 3D model of the bony thorax as a guide. In addition, multiple examples of the effects of rotation are provided including examples where disease was misinterpreted, underestimated or masked.

Conclusion

Rotation is often unavoidable in neonatal chest X-rays, especially in the ICU. It is therefore important for physicians to recognise rotation and its effects, and to be aware that it can mimic or mask disease.

### Endovascular treatment of aberrant systemic arterial supply to normal basilar segments of the right lower lobe: case report and review of the literature [^112RF3ns]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 17-year-old man with acute chest pain due to a partial thrombosis of a pseudosequestration. Unlike a true sequestration, there was a normal bronchial distribution and the involved lung parenchyma was normal on CT scan. A therapeutic transarterial embolization of the aberrant systemic artery from the proximal abdominal aorta was performed successfully. The patient did not suffer from further chest pain during the follow-up of 12 months. A contrast-enhanced CT scan 4 months later demonstrated complete occlusion of the embolized aberrant artery. Our case represents an alternative treatment to surgery for this rare abnormality.

### Doubts and concerns about COVID-19 uncertainties on imaging data, clinical score, and outcomes [^114dH7ax]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In order to answer such questions, this study included the first chest CT examination carried out by each patient during the hospitalization independently of the time elapsed between the onset of symptoms or positive NAAT result and chest CT examination to allow the correlation of CT scores with different stages and disease progression. This way, patients with severe clinical conditions were also included allowing to investigate CT abnormalities linked with disease severity. CT images were assessed for scan quality considering motion artifacts and inspiratory level. The 7 parameters we adopted to investigate and assess each CT examination, are below reported:

A) - CO-RADS scores based on COVID-19 lung involvement ranged from 1 to 5, with higher values reflecting an increase in likelihood of patients having confirmed COVID-19 with lung involvement, whereas lower values were attributed to CT examinations either normal or showing abnormalities less likely linked to COVID-19 infection in which an alternative diagnosis was more probable. CO-RADS is a useful tool used to diagnose COVID-19, especially when NAATs are not readily available. The 5-score CO-RADS scale (Table 1) is summarized as follows: 1: very low level of suspicion; 2: low level of suspicion; 3: equivocal findings; 4: high level of suspicion; 5: very high level of suspicion.
B) - Chest CT score for single lobe involvement. 0: 0%; 1: < 5%; 2: 5–25%; 3: 26–50%; 4: 51–75%; 5: > 75%.
C) - Dominant pattern (consolidation, ground-glass opacity, multifocal, crazy-paving, or reverse halo), defined by the Fleischner Society (Additional file 1, section b).
D) - Dominant distribution (lower lobes, peripheral, bronchocentric, dorsal, apical, or diffuse).
E) - Additional COVID-19 related findings (vascular enlargement, pleural thickening, air bubble sign, halo sign, subpleural sign, perilobular pattern, and subpleural sparing).
F) - Additional findings not typical for COVID-19 (pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, discrete small nodules, tree-in-bud, cavitation, isolated lobar/segmental consolidation, smooth interlobular septal thickening, atelectasis, and lymphadenopathy).
G) - Comorbidities at CT (cardiomegaly, aortic/coronaric calcifications, pre-existing pulmonary disease, steatosis, and tracheomalacia).

### Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. An official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^116hgboy]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning parameters — recommended scanning protocol and advantages include a noncontrast examination and volumetric acquisition with sub-millimetric collimation, shortest rotation time, highest pitch, and tube settings appropriate to patient size, typically 120 kVp and ≤ 240 mAs, with lower tube potentials (e.g., 100 kVp) encouraged for thin patients. Reconstruction of thin-section CT images (≤ 1.5 mm) should be contiguous or overlapping, using a high-spatial-frequency algorithm, with an iterative reconstruction algorithm if validated on the CT unit (if not, filtered back projection). Number of acquisitions includes supine inspiratory (volumetric), supine expiratory (volumetric or sequential), prone only inspiratory scans (optional), and inspiratory scans at full inspiration. Advantages include acquisition covering the entire lung volume (vs. analysis of 10% of lung volume with sequential scanning), dramatic increase in temporal resolution and speed of data acquisition with motion-free images, expiratory scans useful to detect air trapping, prone scans allowing analysis of peripheral lung changes without dependent lung atelectasis that may be mistaken for abnormal lung infiltration or mimic disease, and the caution that inadequate inspiration increases lung attenuation (which should not be interpreted as ground-glass attenuation) and is responsible for dependent lung atelectasis (which may mimic abnormal lung infiltration or mask subtle abnormalities). The recommended radiation dose for the inspiratory volumetric acquisition is 1–3 mSv, with a strong recommendation to avoid "ultralow-dose CT" (< 1 mSv), and this provides considerable dose reduction compared to conventional scanning.

### Anesthesia considerations to reduce motion and atelectasis during advanced guided bronchoscopy [^111Cj2DG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Mechanisms leading to atelectasis during bronchoscopy and increased airway resistance. A Surface tension caused by water molecules leads to attraction. B Once the airflow is disrupted in atelectatic lung units, turbulent airflow leads to increased airway resistance. C As the bronchi decrease in diameter, there is a substantial increase in airways resistance. D Compliance curve for alveoli. As the lung deflates, resistance increases and gas flow through the airways decreases. Atelectatic lung units have poor compliance and require significant changes in inflation pressure to result in minor changes in volume

Breath-hold for image acquisition

Timing the breath-hold

A breath-hold is required to reduce motion artifact and provide clearer, more accurate images during certain image-guided bronchoscopy procedures (e.g. fluoroscopic navigation, CBCT). These procedures require a complete lack of movement beyond cardiac pulsations; therefore, a carefully timed breath-hold is essential. The breath-hold should be performed at peak inspiration, not at end-expiration. This does not require a vital capacity maneuver, rather, it should occur at the end of a normal inspiratory breath (Fig. 4).

### CXR-LLaVA: a multimodal large language model for interpreting chest X-ray images [^115fCiv4]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The model achieved an excellent average F1 score of 0.81, outperforming the GPT-4-vision and Gemini-Pro-Vision models, which scored 0.62 and 0.68, respectively. The model's sensitivity of 0.80 was higher than GPT-4-Vision's 0.61 but lower than Gemini-Pro-Vision's 0.91. Its specificity of 0.89 was higher than both GPT-4-Vision's 0.79 and Gemini-Pro-Vision's 0.30

Table 3 presents the model's pathology detection performance on the CheXpert internal test set. The model achieved an average F1 score of 0.57, a sensitivity of 0.90, and a specificity of 0.67 for five pathological findings: atelectasis, cardiomegaly, consolidation, edema, and pleural effusion. While it performed relatively well in identifying lung opacity, atelectasis, and pleural effusion, its effectiveness in detecting consolidation was lower. This average F1 score of 0.57 is marginally lower than that of CheXzero, which achieved 0.61, and slightly below the 0.62 F1 score reported for human radiologists. No established F1 scores from CheXzero and human radiologists are available for diagnosing lung opacity and support devices, but our model demonstrated commendable F1 scores in detecting these conditions in CXR.

### Changes in radiologists' gaze patterns against lung X-rays with different abnormalities: a randomized experiment [^117HWu1Y]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

The workload of some radiologists increased dramatically in the last several, which resulted in a potentially reduced quality of diagnosis. It was demonstrated that diagnostic accuracy of radiologists significantly reduces at the end of work shifts. The study aims to investigate how radiologists cover chest X-rays with their gaze in the presence of different chest abnormalities and high workload. We designed a randomized experiment to quantitatively assess how radiologists' image reading patterns change with the radiological workload. Four radiologists read chest X-rays on a radiological workstation equipped with an eye-tracker. The lung fields on the X-rays were automatically segmented with U-Net neural network allowing to measure the lung coverage with radiologists' gaze. The images were randomly split so that each image was shown at a different time to a different radiologist. Regression models were fit to the gaze data to calculate the treads in lung coverage for individual radiologists and chest abnormalities. For the study, a database of 400 chest X-rays with reference diagnoses was assembled. The average lung coverage with gaze ranged from 55 to 65% per radiologist. For every 100 X-rays read, the lung coverage reduced from 1.3 to 7.6% for the different radiologists. The coverage reduction trends were consistent for all abnormalities ranging from 3.4% per 100 X-rays for cardiomegaly to 4.1% per 100 X-rays for atelectasis. The more image radiologists read, the smaller part of the lung fields they cover with the gaze. This pattern is very stable for all abnormality types and is not affected by the exact order the abnormalities are viewed by radiologists. The proposed randomized experiment captured and quantified consistent changes in X-ray reading for different lung abnormalities that occur due to high workload.

### Evaluation of the impact of artificial intelligence-assisted image interpretation on the diagnostic performance of clinicians in identifying endotracheal tube position on plain chest X-ray: a multi-case multi-reader study [^117LcksS]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Endotracheal intubation remains the gold-standard method for securing a definitive airway in patients with reduced levels of consciousness, impending airway compromise, severe respiratory failure or to facilitate major surgery. Over 60% of critically ill patients require endotracheal intubation, with around 45% of patients experiencing adverse peri-intubation events. Studies have reported endotracheal tube (ETT) misplacement in up to 17% of intubations, with risk factors such as emergency intubation in non-theatre settings commonly being identified. Inaccurately positioned ETTs can lead to inadequate ventilation and oxygenation, resulting in impaired gas exchange, worsening respiratory failure, and diminished oxygen delivery to vital organs. Proximal misplacement can result in cuff leaks, and an increased risk of inadvertent extubation. Additionally, distal misplacement can contribute to complications such as inadvertent one-lung ventilation, pneumothorax, atelectasis, and pneumonia. Prompt detection and correction of ETT misplacement are crucial to prevent adverse outcomes. Detecting misplacement through difficulty in ventilation, clinical examination, or by physiological derangement (e.g. continuous monitoring/capnography) is not without error and ETT position for patients requiring prolonged intubation is typically confirmed via chest x-ray (CXR). Interpretation of the ETT position with respect to the carina on CXR can itself be challenging, depending on a number of factors such as the experience of the clinician, the quality of the image, characteristics of the patient or type of ETT.

### Evaluating a large language model's accuracy in chest X-ray interpretation for acute thoracic conditions [^115eJQGE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has great ability to impact healthcare. Chest X-rays are essential for diagnosing acute thoracic conditions in the emergency department (ED), but interpretation delays due to radiologist availability can impact clinical decision-making. AI models, including deep learning algorithms, have been explored for diagnostic support, but the potential of large language models (LLMs) in emergency radiology remains largely unexamined.

Methods

This study assessed ChatGPT's feasibility in interpreting chest X-rays for acute thoracic conditions commonly encountered in the ED. A subset of 1400 images from the NIH Chest X-ray dataset was analyzed, representing seven pathology categories: Atelectasis, Effusion, Emphysema, Pneumothorax, Pneumonia, Mass, and No Finding. ChatGPT 4.0, utilizing the "X-Ray Interpreter" add-on, was evaluated for its diagnostic performance across these categories.

Results

ChatGPT demonstrated high performance in identifying normal chest X-rays, with a sensitivity of 98.9%, specificity of 93.9%, and accuracy of 94.7%. However, the model's performance varied across pathologies. The best results were observed in diagnosing pneumonia (sensitivity 76.2%, specificity 93.7%) and pneumothorax (sensitivity 77.4%, specificity 89.1%), while performance for atelectasis and emphysema was lower.

Conclusion

ChatGPT demonstrates potential as a supplementary tool for differentiating normal from abnormal chest X-rays, with promising results for certain pathologies like pneumonia. However, its diagnostic accuracy for more subtle conditions requires improvement. Further research integrating ChatGPT with specialized image recognition models could enhance its performance, offering new possibilities in medical imaging and education.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia and atelectasis: evaluation through bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis [^111wbHRk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Surfactant offers protection against alveolar collapse and contributes to the local defense mechanism, but it is unclear if surfactant alterations have a role in the development of atelectasis or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The present study was undertaken to monitor surfactant, as well as biochemical BAL fluid alterations, during the course of VAP and atelectasis in mechanically ventilated patients without primary cardiopulmonary disease, to elucidate the pathogenesis and to differentiate these two entities. DESIGN. Prospective controlled study.

Setting

14-bed general ICU of a 750-bed University Hospital.

Patients

Sixty-one ventilated patients, without primary cardiopulmonary disease-normal initial chest X-ray, satisfactory oxygenation (PaO₂/FiO₂ > 300 mmHg), and expected time of ventilation exceeding 2 weeks-were initially enrolled. Twelve of them developed VAP and eight lobar or segmental atelectasis during the 2-week study period.

Interventions

An initial BAL was performed in all patients within 48 h from admission. Patients who developed VAP or atelectasis were subjected to a second and third BAL during and after the resolution of VAP or atelectasis, respectively.

Measurements and Results

VAP and atelectasis resulted in a significant increase of total protein and markers of inflammation, such as PAF and neutrophils, which partially remitted after their resolution. Large surfactant aggregates, which contribute to surface tension decrease, were significantly reduced during both entities and remained low even after their resolution.

Conclusions

BAL alterations during VAP and atelectasis suggest increased alveolar-capillary permeability, severe surfactant abnormalities, and signs of local inflammatory reaction. These alterations are associated with the observed deteriorated gas exchange and lung mechanics and could predispose to further lung injury in ventilated patients.

The original train-test splits released by the authors have been retained in our experiments too with no overlap occurring between the two sets. COVID-19 Kaggle: The COVID-19 Radiography Database from Kaggle is a database of chest X-rays images from 3616 COVID-19 positive images, 10,192 normal, 6012 lung opacity(non-COVID) and 1345 viral pneumonia images. For label alignment we used only COVID-19 positive and normal images. This dataset was curated from researchers at Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh and collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia. PTB-XL: The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt XL(PTB-XL) ECG dataset is a large dataset of 21837 clinical 12-lead ECGs from 18885 patients of 10 second length recorded on Schiller AG devices over 7-years from 1989–1996 with labels of Normal ECG, Myocardial Infarction, ST/T Change, Conduction Disturbance, and Hypertrophy. From the 5 classes we utilized Conduction Disturbance (4907 ECGs) and Hypertrophy (2655 ECGs). LUDB: Lobachevsky University Electrocardiography Database (LUDB) database consists of 10-second 12-lead ECG signal records acquired on a Schiller Cardiovit AT-101 cardiograph. They collected ECGs from 200 patients with various cardiovascular diseases between 2017–2018 at the Nizhny Novgorod City Hospital No 5. To perform external validation on the PTB-XL model we filtered for patients that had cardiovascular diseases that fell into the "conduction disturbance" (66 ECGs) or "hypertrophy" (142 ECGs) classes which are classes also found in the PTB-XL ECG dataset. From the 200 Lobachevsky ECG dataset, 157 patients were selected for external validation for having an overlapping diagnosis with the PTB-XL ECG dataset. There were 91, 15, and 51 patients classified as hypertrophy, conduction disturbance and both hypertrophy an conduction disturbance, respectively.

### Extravascular lung water index measurement in critically ill children does not correlate with a chest X-ray score of pulmonary edema [^1158hUiR]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Chest x-ray

The chest x-rays were obtained in anteroposterior direction with the patient in supine position using a digital imaging system. The required energy (kV) was dependent on body weight and age and the actual x-ray was taken during maximal inspiration. The chest x-rays were analyzed on a dedicated digital radiology workstation with which, among others, brightness and contrast can be modified. Two radiologists with special pediatric expertise used the scoring system designed by Halperin et al (Table 1). This scoring technique divides the lungs into six regions. Right upper lobar, right perihilar, right lower, left upper, left perihilar and left lower lobar. The pulmonary regions are each scored using a semi-continuous scoring system consisting of 0 to 65 points. A score of 0 points indicates no signs of edema whereas a value of 65 represents severe edema. The points for the six regions are summed to construct the total score. In this way the total score ranges between 0 and 390 points. When a lung region could not be assessed because of atelectasis it was rated the mean value of the other two regions on the same side.

Table 1
Chest x-ray scoring system for quantification of pulmonary edema

Based upon Halperin et al.

The radiologists were unaware of other patient characteristics but also unaware of the score of the other radiologist. Afterwards the inter-observer variability was calculated using concordance correlation and weighted kappa. The mean total scoring of the two radiologists was used to compare the chest x-ray score with the other recorded variables.

### Two new radiological findings to improve the diagnosis of bronchial foreign-body aspiration in children [^113Jte3G]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2004). Low credibility.

Our objective was to report on two new chest X-ray signs (hyperinflation or obstructive emphysema with atelectasis in the same hemithorax, and aeration within an area of atelectasis) in children with foreign-body aspiration (FBA). We performed a retrospective review of clinical characteristics and chest X-ray films of 133 children with FBA. Of 133 children, 45% were under 3 years old. History of a choking crisis was present in 101 (75.8%); however, it was only elicited upon follow-up questioning in 33 children (32.7%). Early foreign-body (FB) extraction (< 24 hr) was performed in 17.3%; removal took place between 1–7 days in 29.3%. The site of aspirated FBs was bronchial in 78.9%, laryngeal in 6%, and tracheal in 4.5%, with mobile FB in the trachea/bronchi in 4.5%. The chest X-ray was normal in 11.3%. Positive findings included: radiopaque FB (23.3%); hyperinflation or obstructive emphysema (21.8%); hyperinflation or obstructive emphysema with atelectasis in the same hemithorax (18%); lobar atelectasis (12.8%); whole-lung atelectasis (6.8%); shift of mediastinal shadow (11%); and aeration within an area of atelectasis (6%). In conclusion, if a history of choking crisis is not present in a child with suspected FBA, two previously undescribed radiological signs (hyperinflation or obstructive emphysema with atelectasis in the same hemithorax, and aeration within an area of atelectasis) should be sought in order to improve the utility of chest-X ray for early diagnosis of FBA.

Quantitative imaging metrics — common sources of systematic errors in imaging and analysis include six categories with representative examples: technical issues during acquisition (differences in hardware and software, acquisition protocol, signal-to-noise ratio, and resolution), biased sampling of structure for analysis (comparison of mismatched airways), failure to define an appropriate reference space, issues with segmentation or registration, inaccurate assumptions or simplifications (assuming alveolar airspaces are spheres), and failure to consider spatiotemporal and biological heterogeneity (anatomical or gravitational gradients in tissue density, ventilation, and perfusion).

### Differentiation of pleural effusions from parenchymal opacities: accuracy of bedside chest radiography [^112wnW6k]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine, with CT as the reference standard, the ability of radiologists to detect pleural effusions on bedside chest radiographs.

Materials and Methods

Images of 200 hemithoraces in 100 ICU patients undergoing chest radiography and CT within 24 hours were reviewed. Four readers with varying levels of experience reviewed the chest radiographs and predicted the likelihood of the presence of an effusion or parenchymal opacity on independent 5-point scales. The results were compared with the CT findings.

Results

All readers regardless of experience had similar accuracy in detecting pleural effusions. Among 117 pleural effusions, 66% were detected on chest radiographs (53%, 71%, and 92% of small, moderate, and large effusions) with 89% specificity. Similarly, 65% of all parenchymal opacities were detected on chest radiographs, also with 89% specificity. Most (93%) of the misdiagnosed pulmonary opacities were simply not seen. Meniscus, apical cap, lateral band, and subpulmonic opacity were highly specific findings but had low individual sensitivity for effusions. The finding of homogeneous opacity, including both layering and gradient opacities, was the most sensitive sign of effusion. Atelectasis can occasionally mimic the pleural veil sign of effusion, accounting for most false-positive findings.

Conclusion

Radiologists interpreting bedside chest radiographs of ICU patients detect large pleural effusions 92% of the time and can exclude large effusions with high confidence. However, small and medium effusions often are misdiagnosed as parenchymal opacities (45%) or are not seen (55%). Pulmonary opacities often are missed (34%) but are rarely misdiagnosed as pleural effusions (7%).

### The empty azygos fissure [^1136wBYm]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

The azygos fissure is typically visible on chest radiography as a right paramediastinal supernumerary line in projection of the right lung apex. The azygos vein, located at the bottom of the fissure, is visible as a teardrop-shaped opacity. The empty azygos fissure is a rare finding. It is the consequence of the displacement of the azygos vein out of the fissure with a close paramediastinal position. This phenomenon, related to lung collapse, has been described in the literature as the migration of the azygos vein due to various etiologies such as increased intrathoracic pressure, spontaneous or iatrogenic pneumothorax, or even during sudden development of kyphosis. In our clinical case, the empty azygos fissure was developed after drainage of a large right pleural effusion. An empty azygos fissure must therefore suggest a history of pulmonary atelectasis related to pneumothorax or large drained effusion.

### Lung ultrasound vs chest radiography for pneumonia diagnosis in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit: a systematic review and Bayesian network diagnostic meta-analysis [^115hzLdP]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In the ICU, diagnostic imaging is constrained by patient instability and limited access to advanced scanners. Bedside CXR is usually restricted to a single supine projection, resulting in sub-optimal sensitivity, whereas transporting patients receiving mechanical ventilation to CT carries logistic cost, radiation exposure, and a well-documented risk of cardiorespiratory deterioration. LUS can be performed at the bedside in minutes, requires no ionising radiation, and provides dynamic, repeatable information that is immediately actionable. Our findings therefore suggest that LUS may be considered the preferred first-line imaging test when pneumonia is suspected in critically ill adults, reserving CT for equivocal or complex cases.

Hansell and colleagues performed a meta-analysis in ICU patients that compared LUS and CXR for the generic finding of lung consolidation, irrespective of aetiology. Their pooled estimates (sensitivity 0.91 and specificity 0.77) are numerically close to the values we report, but the two reviews draw on mutually exclusive primary studies because of different eligibility criteria. We included only studies in which pneumonia was clinically adjudicated and CT-confirmed, whereas Hansell et al. accepted any parenchymal consolidation. Owing to this definitional gap, their dataset is not shown in Figure S13, which is limited to pneumonia-specific evidence. Nonetheless, both reviews converge on the same message: bedside LUS is substantially more sensitive than portable CXR in the intensive-care setting, emphasising the need to interpret imaging findings within the clinical context.

Despite the well-defined sonographic features of pneumonia, real-time recognition can be challenging for less experienced operators. Mechanically ventilated patients have a high incidence of atelectasis, which is both frequent and multifactorial. Extrinsic compression caused by prolonged supine positioning or obstructive causes like mucus plugging or impaired bronchial clearance can cause atelectasis. The distinction between pneumonia and atelectasis is based on the presence of dynamic air bronchograms (associated with alveolar filling) vs static or fluid bronchograms (more indicative of passive collapse or obstruction). This distinction, though diagnostically critical, may be subtle and technically demanding, and it requires sufficient skill in acquiring and interpreting LUS images. The importance of thorough scanning, including dorsal lung zones, and interpretative expertise cannot be underestimated when LUS findings can resemble pneumonia. This is necessary to avoid false positives, which could result in unnecessary antibiotic treatment or delayed recognition of other causes of respiratory failure.

### Respiratory physiotherapy and incidence of pulmonary complications in off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery: an observational follow-up study [^112ShoGM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Following the protocol of the A Coruña University Hospital for this type of surgical patients, a thoracic x-ray (anterior-posterior and lateral) was taken during the preoperative phase, as well as immediately after surgery in the intensive care unit (ICU), on the ward, once the drains had been removed (48 hours after surgery), and on discharge from hospital. X-ray examinations were given at the same frequency to patients who received preoperative physiotherapy and those who did not.

The intensivist used the thoracic x-ray to determine the presence or absence of complications during the patients' stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Once they had been transferred to the ward, this task was carried out by the doctor in charge of the ward, who did not know if the patients had received preoperative physiotherapy or not. Patients were classified into the following groups according to the diagnosis of atelectasis: detectable or undetectable atelectasis by x-ray. Evidence of atelectasis on the X-ray were considered by the radiologists as direct signs (displacement of interlobar fissures) and indirect signs (local increase in density, elevation of diaphragm, mediastinal displacement and compensatory overinflation, displacement of hila, approximation of ribs, absence of an air bronchogram, absence of visibility of the interlobar artery). Atelectasis was classified by the radiologists as platelike (also called linear), and segmental (unilateral or bilateral lobar atelectasis). In order to increase the statistical power of the analysis, we reported the incidence of atelectasis as 'yes' or 'no', regardless of the degree. Atelectasis reported at any time throughout the follow-up was counted as an "event".

Justification of the Sample Size

The sample size of n = 263 patients made it possible to study the characteristics of the patients with a security of 95% and a precision of ± 6.1%. A sample size of n = 103 patients in each group would be required in order to detect a difference of 17% vs. 34% in the incidence of atelectasis between those patients receiving preoperative respiratory physiotherapy and those who did not, with a security of 95% and a statistical power of 80%. Patients were included consecutively until the minimum sample size was achieved in both study groups. As a result, we finally included 159 patients who received preoperative respiratory physiotherapy, and 104 who did not.

### Pulmonary atelectasis: a frequent alternative diagnosis in patients undergoing CT-PA for suspected pulmonary embolism [^111vYgB9]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of atelectasis as an alternative diagnosis in patients who underwent computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CT-PA) for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), and to contrast the pathophysiology of pulmonary atelectasis and PE, both of which are associated with dyspnea and hypoxemia. We retrospectively identified 144 consecutive emergency department patients (n = 49) and inpatients (n = 95) admitted between July 2001 and June 2002 who were evaluated with CT-PA for suspected PE. There were 98 women and 46 men with a mean age of 58 years (range 27–95 years). Each CT report was reviewed for PE, the words "atelectasis", "collapse", and/or "volume loss", findings known to predispose to atelectasis, and alternative diagnoses. CT scans of those with PE and those with atelectasis were reviewed. Each case was categorized into one of three groups, as follows: group 1, PE; group 2, atelectasis of three or more segments and no PE; group 3, neither PE nor atelectasis. PaO2 was documented, when available (n = 115), with PaO2 > 100 mmHg recorded as 100 mmHg. Reports for group 3 were reviewed for alternative diagnoses. Thirteen percent of the study population (19/144, group 1) had PE, and two of them had concomitant atelectasis; mean PaO2 was 69 mmHg (range 38–100 mmHg). Nineteen percent of the study population (27/144, group 2) had atelectasis of three or more segments without PE; mean PaO2 was 73 mmHg (range 45–100 mmHg). Sixty-eight percent of the study population (98/144, group 3) had neither PE nor atelectasis; mean PaO2 was 79 mmHg (range 36–100 mmHg). There was a significant difference in the PaO2 between groups 1 and 3 (Student's t-test), with group 2 intermediate. Seventy percent of group 2 (19/27) had at least one finding predisposing to atelectasis: central bronchial abnormality (n = 6), moderate or larger pleural effusion (n = 11), pleural mass, pneumothorax, elevated hemidiaphragm, and severe kyphosis (the last four all n = 1 each), versus 16% (3/19) of group 1 (P < 0.05). Sixty-three percent of group 3 (62/98) had one or more alternative diagnoses on CT that explained the patient's symptoms as follows: pneumonia (28%, 27/98), other lung disease (18%, 18/98), congestive heart failure (13%, 13/98), and malignancy (13%, 13/98). Pulmonary atelectasis was common in patients undergoing CT-PA for suspected PE, equaling pneumonia as the most common alternative diagnosis. Most patients with atelectasis had predisposing findings on CT. Pulmonary atelectasis and PE cause similar symptoms by different mechanisms of ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

### Effects of 30% vs. 60% inspired oxygen fraction during mechanical ventilation on postoperative atelectasis: a randomised controlled trial [^114Si614]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have provided conflicting results; thus the effect of FiO 2 on atelectasis requires further investigation. Additionally, several issues in such research should be noted and improved upon. First, most of the previous studies usually compared the effects of extremely high FiO 2 (80–100%) and low FiO 2 (30–40%) on atelectasis. In clinical practice, a moderate FiO 2 of 50–60% is more conventionally used. However, the effect of low (30%) versus moderate (60%) FiO 2 on atelectasis remains unclear. Second, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and recruitment maneuvers have often been used in studies to investigate the effect of FiO 2 on atelectasis. As PEEP and recruitment maneuvers could reduce the incidence and extent of atelectasis, the independent effect of FiO 2 on atelectasis remains to be investigated. Third, although lung ultrasound was used in previous studies to diagnose atelectasis, it cannot measure the volume of atelectasis. Computed tomography (CT) is the current gold standard for diagnosing atelectasis and it can accurately measure the volume of different aeration regions.

Therefore, we conducted a randomised controlled study to investigate the effects of 30% versus 60% FiO 2 without PEEP and recruitment maneuvers on postoperative atelectasis volume measured by CT scans. We tested the hypothesis that 30% FiO 2 during mechanical ventilation could reduce postoperative atelectasis volume compared with 60% FiO 2.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: classification, evaluation, and management of childhood interstitial lung disease in infancy [^1164GGwA]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Controlled ventilation HRCT (CVHRCT) in chILD imaging — capabilities and evidence limitations are noted: Controlled ventilation HRCT (CVHRCT) is a technique that facilitates assessment of the extent of air trapping and ground glass opacities, prevents dependent atelectasis from masking pathologic abnormalities, and eliminates motion artifact by controlling both motion and lung volume. Mask ventilation is used to deliver deep breaths to a sedated child, resulting in a short period of apnea during which the lungs are imaged at TLC or FRC. No studies have compared CVHRCT to either HRCT or conventional CT in chILD syndrome, and some clinicians question whether the increased risk of anesthesia or sedation is justified.

### Recalibration of deep learning models for abnormality detection in smartphone-captured chest radiograph [^114YYW6G]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Internal validation

First, we developed and internally tested our models using the MIMIC-CXR database. That is, both the training images and the source of the testing photographs, Photo-MMC, were derived from the same database. As shown in Fig. 2a, across the six major radiological findings, Model-ORIG shows a performance decrease from an averaged AUROC of 0.86 to 0.77 (p < 0.0001) compared to our comparison reference. After model recalibration, the Model-RECA shows significant performance recovery from an averaged AUROC of 0.77 to 0.84 (p < 0.0001), close to our comparison reference. Figure 3 shows the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The blue lines show the comparison reference. The yellow lines show the results when the Model-ORIG was evaluated using CXR photographs. The green lines show the performance of the Model-RECA on the CXR photographs. The AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and accuracy for all 14 labels are presented in Supplementary Table 2. The results reiterate two insights and underscore the importance of this study. First, the model trained on the original CXRs was incapable of maintaining its performance on CXR photographs. Second, the recalibration process improved the model performance and successfully transferred image-based models' detection accuracy to the CXR photographs.

Blue lines show the ROC curves using the uncalibrated model on original CXRs. The yellow and green lines show the results of interpreting CXR photographs using the uncalibrated model (Model-ORIG) and recalibrated model (Model-RECA), respectively. The AUC of Model-ORIG is significantly greater than that of Model-RECA for each disease (p < 0.0001).

### Establishment of seven lung ultrasound phenotypes: a retrospective observational study of an LUS registry [^116Uarqp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The foundational rules for pathophysiological phenotyping of lung ultrasound are structured around several key assessments:

Comprehensive Lung Assessment: The lungs are segmented into 12 zones for detailed evaluation — six per side (L1 to L6 on the left and R1 to R6 on the right). Each zone is scrutinized for specific lung ultrasound patterns, categorized as A, B1, B2, C1, C2, C3, and C4.

Gravity Dependence Assessment: This involves identifying gravity-dependent atelectasis through changes in ultrasound patterns of B2 or higher in both zone 6 areas, supplemented by one of the following criteria: MLUSS is higher in bilateral zones 5–6 compared to zones 3–4, with zones 3–4 MLUSS equal to or greater than zones 1–2. The combined MLUSS of bilateral zones 4 and 6 surpasses that of zones 1–2 and zones 3, 5. Only one side of zone 6 exhibits a C1 to C4 pattern. Phenotypes not meeting these criteria are classified as non-gravity-dependent.

3 Distribution Area Assessment:

Diffuse: Symmetrical appearance of B or C patterns in two or more areas in the bilateral non-gravity dependent zones (1/2/3/4).
Unilateral: B or C patterns appear in two or more adjacent areas (zones 1, 2 or zones 3, 4 or zones 5, 6).
Localized: B or C patterns occur in any one area of the unilateral chest wall (zones 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) or several adjacent areas show B patterns without symmetry.

4 Lesion Type Assessment:

Areas with pleural sliding (pattern A) are defined as non-atelectasis.
B1 or B2 areas are defined as interstitial atelectasis.
C1, C2, or C4 areas are defined as consolidation.
C3 areas are considered non-expansive atelectasis.
Other: When C1 coexists with B2, it is considered equivalent toB2. B1 adjacent to C2 is not classified separately. The severity of lung lesions is ranked from mild to severe as follows: interstitial atelectasis < atelectasis < consolidation.

Injury to the lung parenchyma includes pulmonary contusion, laceration, torsion and herniation. These conditions can be complicated by atelectasis, aspiration pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Lung trauma is seldom a reason for surgical treatment. This is indicated in cases of injury of the major blood vessels, signs of active bleeding, large hematomas or hemodynamic instability in the context of pulmonary involvement.

### Lobar atelectasis as a cause of triangular roentgen shadows in bronchiectasis… [^112Ma8pp]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A few years ago we became interested in the occurrence of triangular basal shadows in roentgenograms of the chest of patients suffering from bronchiectasis. The first patient showing a triangular basal shadow discovered by one of us afforded an excellent opportunity for the investigation of the production of this type of shadow, as it was possible to study roentgenograms of the chest before and after the injection of iodized poppy seed oil 40 per cent into the bronchi, and later to remove the part of the lung causing the shadow and to observe its gross and microscopic appearance. The shadows are seen as homogeneous areas of increased density, triangular in shape, with one side of the triangle along the mediastinum, the lower side parallel with the diaphragm and the hypotenuse running from near the root of the lung to join the lower side at varying distances from.

### Lobar collapse in children… [^1156bs7V]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The collapse of one lobe of the lung may take place in various locations and from several causes. Its actual occurrence is so restricted to the atelectasis of a lower lobe, characterized radiologically, by a basilar triangular shadow, that its discussion is practically limited to the study of the latter condition. Since Dieulafoy1 first described these shadows in 1910 there has been no dearth of literature on the subject. My only excuse for adding to its volume is the clinical and pathologic material that I have to present, which may add to the elucidation of a still unsettled problem. Before proceeding with the discussion of basilar triangular shadows, I would like to mention the rarer cases in which lobar collapse of an upper lobe occurs. Years ago, Heller2 described a series of cases of bronchiectasis in children from 9 months to 7½ years of age. The lesions involved. BOYD GL. LOBAR COLLAPSE IN CHILDREN.

### Atelectasis and bronchiectasis in children… [^114G5BiX]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Clinical and necropsy observations in relatively advanced cases have been the basis for the many theories regarding the development of bronchiectasis. Little has been known about its pathogenesis. No prebronchiectatic conditions have been recognized, and no serial biopsies have been recorded to show the changes from one period to another. Even if advisable, serial biopsies would most likely not reveal a true picture after the first tissue was removed. If, on the other hand, a large series of children with bronchiectasis were found to show a common, almost characteristic appearance in roentgenograms of the chest during the early period of clinical symptoms, a means would be at hand for the recognition of the onset of a bronchiectatic process, possibly before the actual dilatations of the bronchi had occurred. The pathologic changes in the cases that came to necropsy soon after the presence of this sign and subsequent roentgen observations in. ANSPACH WE.
