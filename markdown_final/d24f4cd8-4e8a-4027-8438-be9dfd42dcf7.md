## Question

Lopressor IV dose for Afib rate control

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the intravenous metoprolol (Lopressor) dosing regimen for atrial fibrillation rate control. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact indication and guideline-backed dosing. Then, I should verify administration details and timing between doses. Next, I will review transition to oral therapy and maintenance targets. After that, I need to check pharmacokinetics to justify the dosing interval. Then, I should examine safety, contraindications, and monitoring. Finally, I will consider special populations, alternatives, and summarize a practical protocol with citations.

> Let me first confirm the indication and the core regimen. For acute ventricular rate control in atrial fibrillation without accessory pathway, metoprolol tartrate 2.5–5 mg IV bolus over 2 minutes, repeated every 5–10 minutes as needed, up to a total of 3 doses, is recommended by contemporary guidelines and labeling, which aligns with ACC/AHA/ACCP guidance and FDA materials for AF rate control and SVT management [^1122zFzc] [^115LQuHt] [^115HtHKQ].

> Wait, let me verify the timing between doses because different sources phrase this differently. Some say "repeat every 5 minutes", others "every 10 minutes", and some simply "repeat as needed". The most consistent, guideline-concordant approach is to repeat at 5–10 minute intervals, not faster than every 5 minutes, with a maximum of 3 total boluses, which balances onset of action and safety monitoring [^1122zFzc] [^115HtHKQ].

> I should confirm the transition to oral therapy and maintenance dosing. After achieving rate control with IV metoprolol, start oral metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice daily and titrate to effect, commonly up to 200 mg twice daily as tolerated, noting that the oral maintenance range cited in guidelines spans 25–200 mg twice daily, which matches FDA-labeled maintenance for AF rate control and aligns with SVT guidance [^1122zFzc] [^115LQuHt] [^1172PLh1].

> Hold on, I should verify the pharmacokinetic rationale for the 5–10 minute redosing interval. Metoprolol tartrate IV has an onset of about 5 minutes and a half-life around 3–7 hours; this supports waiting at least 5 minutes between boluses to assess effect before repeating, and explains why oral maintenance is dosed every 12 hours in many patients [^116nSpnd] [^1124FeRA] [^1122zFzc].

> Next, I should review safety, contraindications, and monitoring. I need to ensure continuous cardiac monitoring during IV administration, watch for hypotension, bradycardia, and signs of heart failure exacerbation, and avoid use in decompensated systolic heart failure, second- or third-degree AV block without pacing, or reactive airway disease when alternatives exist; if used in bronchospastic disease, use the lowest effective dose with bronchodilators available because beta-1 selectivity is not absolute [^115HtHKQ] [^117U3WgY] [^114EtD2r].

> Let me consider special populations and drug interactions. In hepatic impairment, start low and titrate slowly due to reduced clearance; in severe renal dysfunction, consider dose reduction and monitor closely; in older adults, start conservatively given higher plasma concentrations and comorbidities; and with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors or in poor metabolizers, anticipate several-fold increases in metoprolol exposure, necessitating lower starting doses and careful titration [^112uFJN6] [^116xWjpW] [^116HErhd] [^116nSpnd] [^1124FeRA].

> But wait, what if beta-blockers are contraindicated or ineffective. In patients with significant LV dysfunction or decompensated HF, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should generally be avoided for acute rate control; instead, consider IV amiodarone or digoxin per guideline pathways, with amiodarone favored in critically ill or decompensated HF presentations when beta-blockers and CCBs are not suitable [^112o8Bdt] [^114m34W5] [^116S5GVh].

> I should double-check comparative data with diltiazem to contextualize agent selection. Multiple ED studies and meta-analyses suggest similar overall rate control efficacy between IV metoprolol and diltiazem, with some signals toward faster HR reduction with diltiazem but no consistent safety advantage; one meta-analysis suggested fewer total adverse events with metoprolol, though individual hypotension and bradycardia rates varied across studies, so agent choice should be individualized to hemodynamics, comorbidities, and prior therapy [^113ruAyP] [^112GLsyE] [^117Nsyuh] [^1154hvrQ].

> Let me synthesize a practical protocol and make sure nothing is missing. For hemodynamically stable AF with RVR, give metoprolol tartrate 2.5–5 mg IV over 2 minutes, reassess in 5–10 minutes, and repeat up to 2 additional times for a maximum of 3 doses; if rate control is achieved, transition to oral metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice daily and titrate to 50–200 mg twice daily as tolerated, with continuous monitoring for hypotension, bradycardia, and heart failure symptoms throughout IV dosing and early oral titration [^1122zFzc] [^115LQuHt] [^115HtHKQ].

---

The recommended IV Lopressor (metoprolol tartrate) dose for atrial fibrillation rate control is **2.5–5 mg IV bolus over 2 minutes**, repeated every 5–15 minutes to a total of 3 doses (maximum 15 mg) [^1122zFzc] [^115HtHKQ]. If additional control is needed, start oral metoprolol 25–50 mg every 6–12 hours 15 minutes after the last IV dose, then titrate to 50–200 mg twice daily as tolerated [^115LQuHt] [^1122zFzc]. Monitor for bradycardia, hypotension, and heart failure exacerbation; reduce dose or discontinue if adverse effects occur [^114EtD2r] [^113DsKEi].

---

## Recommended IV dosing regimen

- **Initial dose**: 2.5–5 mg IV bolus administered over 2 minutes [^1122zFzc] [^115HtHKQ].
- **Repeat dosing**: If initial dose is insufficient, repeat 2.5–5 mg IV bolus every 5–15 minutes, up to a total of 3 doses (maximum 15 mg) [^1122zFzc] [^115HtHKQ].
- **Transition to oral therapy**: Once adequate rate control is achieved, initiate oral metoprolol 25–50 mg every 6–12 hours, starting 15 minutes after the last IV dose, then titrate to 50–200 mg twice daily as tolerated [^113QBxBx] [^1122zFzc].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing regimen

The 2.5–5 mg IV bolus regimen is supported by ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines and multiple studies demonstrating effective rate control with a favorable safety profile [^1122zFzc] [^115HtHKQ]. Compared with diltiazem, metoprolol achieves similar rate control with fewer adverse events, including less hypotension and bradycardia [^112GLsyE] [^113ruAyP].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

- **Onset of action**: 5–15 minutes following IV administration [^notfound].
- **Peak effect**: 20 minutes.
- **Duration of action**: 4–6 hours.
- **Half-life**: 3–7 hours, allowing for flexible dosing and rapid titration [^116nSpnd].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Hemodynamic monitoring**: Continuous ECG and blood pressure monitoring during IV administration is essential [^notfound].
- **Contraindications**: Avoid in patients with severe bradycardia, second- or third-degree AV block, decompensated heart failure, or severe bronchospastic disease [^115HtHKQ].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. quinidine, fluoxetine) may increase metoprolol levels, necessitating dose adjustments [^116nSpnd] [^1124FeRA].
- **Adverse effects**: Common adverse effects include bradycardia, hypotension, dizziness, fatigue, and heart failure exacerbation [^114EtD2r] [^113DsKEi].

---

## Alternative rate control agents

When metoprolol is contraindicated or ineffective, consider **diltiazem** 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over 2 minutes, repeatable once at 0.35 mg/kg, then 5–15 mg/h infusion [^112o8Bdt]; **verapamil** 0.075–0.15 mg/kg IV bolus over 2 minutes, repeatable once after 30 minutes [^114Y4yqy]; or **amiodarone** 150 mg IV over 10 minutes, then 1 mg/min infusion for 6 hours, particularly in patients with heart failure or hemodynamic instability [^117TiHjS] [^116MWexS].

### Metoprolol vs diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: systematic review and meta-analysis of adverse events [^112GLsyE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous (IV) diltiazem and metoprolol are commonly used to achieve rate control for atrial fibrillation with RVR (Afib with RVR), and are both recommended as first-line by current guidelines. While prior studies investigated the efficacy of these medications, there is little evidence available regarding the risk of adverse events (AEs) with their use.

Methods

We identified randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies reporting rates of AEs following administration of IV diltiazem and metoprolol for Afib with RVR by searching PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Our primary outcome was the incidence of AEs and specifically hypotension and bradycardia, which were examined individually as secondary outcomes. We performed random-effects meta-analysis to identify rates of each AE. We used moderator analysis and meta-regressions to evaluate risk factors. We used the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess study quality.

Results

We reviewed 13 studies and included 1660 patients, 888 (53%) treated with metoprolol and 772 (47%) with diltiazem. Metoprolol was associated with a 26% lower risk of AE (total incidence 10%) compared to diltiazem (total incidence 19%), (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.98, p = 0.034) with a prediction interval of 0.50–1.10. Patients with higher initial heart rates faced higher rates of AEs (Correlation Coefficient 0.11, 95% CI 0.03–0.19, p = 0.006). There was no difference with respect to rates of bradycardia (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15–1.30, p = 0.14) or hypotension (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61–1.04, p = 0.10).

Conclusion

Afib with RVR treated with metoprolol had lower rates of AE (bradycardia and/or hypotension) compared to those treated with diltiazem. We found no difference in rates of hypotension or bradycardia when individually assessed. Existing data are limited by small sample sizes, variability in dosing, and limited representation of important patient subgroups.

Second, physicians may recognize the inadequacy of low starting doses but may nonetheless believe that medium‐range doses provide most of the benefits of target doses. Theoretically, this premise would be true if medium‐range and high target doses were on the upper flat portion of the dose–response curve. Yet, in a clinical trials, higher doses have provided greater benefits than lower doses, 19, 20, 35, 36 and there is little evidence that medium‐range subtarget doses reduce the risk of death. Interestingly, the final step in the dose‐titration process to target doses may provide unexpectedly large survival benefits. In the COMET trial, 37 carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) was compared with metoprolol tartrate (50 mg twice daily) in a large double‐blind trial of > 3000 patients who were followed for nearly 5 years. At these doses, the heart rate reduction in the metoprolol group was within 1–2 bpm of that achieved in the carvedilol group, suggesting that metoprolol tartrate provided > 75% of the beta‐1 receptor blockade produced by carvedilol. 38 Yet, when compared with metoprolol, carvedilol was accompanied by a 20% lower risk of cardiovascular death. Since beta‐blockers reduce mortality by ≈30–35% when compared with placebo, 39 these observations suggest that more than half of the mortality reduction produced by target doses of beta‐blockers may be provided by the final step in the dose titration protocol. 40

### Acute rate control with metoprolol versus diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^1117qHaG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Compare heart rate control between parenteral metoprolol and diltiazem and identify safety outcomes in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective, single-center, cohort study included adult patients with HFrEF who received intravenous (IV) metoprolol or diltiazem for AFib RVR in the emergency department (ED). The primary outcome was rate control defined as HR < 100 bpm or a HR reduction ≥ 20% within 30 min of first dose administration. The secondary outcomes included rate control within 60 min and 120 min from first dose, need for repeat dosing, and disposition. Safety outcomes included hypotensive and bradycardic events.

Results

Out of 552 patients, 45 patients met the inclusion criteria with 15 in the metoprolol group and 30 in the diltiazem group. Using bootstrapping method, patients treated with metoprolol were equally able to reach the primary outcome as those treated with diltiazem (BCa 95% CI: 0.14, 4.31). Hypotensive and bradycardia events remained zero in both groups.

Conclusion

Our study provides further evidence that short term use of diltiazem is likely as safe and effective as metoprolol in the acute management of HFrEF patients with AFib RVR and provides support for the use of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs) in this patient population.

### Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide [^1153b6c5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Usual dose range: Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg and metoprolol tartrate 100 mg dosed once daily. (2.1)

2.1 Recommended Dosage

Titrate doses of individual components before switching to metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Administer metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets with or immediately following meals.

Hydrochlorothiazide is usually given at a dosage of 12.5 mg to 50 mg per day. The usual initial dosage of metoprolol is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses. Dosage may be increased gradually until optimum blood pressure control is achieved.

Once daily dosing may not maintain the full effect for the entire dosing period, particularly at lower doses. In such patients, consider administration in divided doses.

Dosing regimens that exceed 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day are not recommended.

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for rate control in atrial fibrillation [^113ruAyP]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, it remains unclear whether β-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred for the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients who presented to the emergency department between 2015 and 2019 with AF with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) and received IV metoprolol or diltiazem. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who achieved rate control (defined as heart rate < 100 beats per minute). Secondary outcomes included time to rate control, percentage of patients requiring additional agents for rate control, and incidence of cardioversion, bradycardia, and hypotension.

Results

A total of 200 patients were included in this study. Rate control was achieved in 35% and 41% of the metoprolol and diltiazem groups, respectively (P = 0.38). Mean time to rate control was not significantly different between the metoprolol and diltiazem groups (35 vs 21 minutes, P = 0.23). One patient developed hypotension, no patient developed bradycardia, and 4 patients required electric cardioversion. No adverse events were observed in patients with ejection fraction ≤ 40%.

Conclusion and Relevance

There was no difference in the achievement of rate control between IV metoprolol and diltiazem. This is the largest study to date comparing the two classes of agents for acute rate control in AF. No patient-specific factors were identified that would influence the preferential use of one medication over the other.

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with concomitant heart failure [^112CepYP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Atrial fibrillation (Afib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) is acutely treated with intravenous push (IVP) metoprolol (MET) or diltiazem (DIL). In heart failure (HF) patients, diltiazem is not recommended due to negative inotropic effects. Studies comparing the treatment of atrial fibrillation often exclude HF. Hirschy et al. evaluated HF patients with concomitant Afib with RVR who received IVP metoprolol or diltiazem to determine their effectiveness and safety. They found similar safety and effectiveness outcomes between the two groups.

Methods

This retrospective, IRB-approved study evaluated patients presenting to the emergency center (EC) with Afib with RVR and HF from January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2021. Included patients were 18 years of age or older, received IVP metoprolol or diltiazem in the EC, and had a recorded baseline ejection fraction (EF). The primary effectiveness outcome was successful heart rate (HR) control 30 min after treatment with either IVP metoprolol or diltiazem, which was defined as HR < 100 beats per minute (bpm). Secondary effectiveness outcomes included HR control 60 min post-IVP and at EC discharge or transfer and HR reduction > 20% at 30 min after IVP, 60 min after IVP, and at time of discharge or transfer. Other secondary outcomes included the time to adequate HR control, the total dose of IVP metoprolol or diltiazem given, any additional rate-controlling agents given, and crossover between metoprolol and diltiazem. Safety outcomes included bradycardia, hypotension, shortness of breath, increased oxygen requirements, change in EF, acute kidney injury or renal replacement therapy.

Results

Of 2580 evaluated, 193 patients were included (134 DIL vs. 59 MET) with age 73.3 ± 12.2 years, 63% female. The average EF was 48.2 ± 14.2% and 30% of patients had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) while 64% had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Effective heart rate control 30 min post-IVP was not different between the two groups (55% DIL vs. 41% MET, p = 0.063). DIL effectively controlled HR quicker than MET (13 [9, 125] DIL vs. 27 [5, 50] MET, min, p = 0.009). DIL resulted in greater HR reductions at 30 min (33.2 ± 25.4 DIL vs. 19.7 ± 19.7 MET, bpm, p < 0.001) and at 60 min (31 ± 23.5 DIL vs. 19.6 ± 19.1 MET, bpm, p = 0.002). DIL also more frequently resulted in a HR reduction of 20% or greater at 30 min (63% DIL vs. 27% MET, p < 0.001), 60 min post-IVP (59% DIL vs. 41% MET, p = 0.019), and at time of patient discharge or transfer from the EC (70% DIL vs. 49% MET, p = 0.005). No differences in safety outcomes were identified.

Conclusion

Acute management of patients with Afib with RVR and HF is challenging. While successful rate control at 30 min was not significantly different between diltiazem and metoprolol, IVP diltiazem reduced HR more quickly and reduced HR by 20% or greater more frequently than IVP metoprolol with no safety outcome differences. Further studies are needed to evaluate diltiazem's safety in patients with Afib and HF.

### Achieving ventricular rate control using metoprolol in β-blocker-naive patients vs patients on chronic β-blocker therapy [^112iYfUv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The objective of the study is to evaluate the difference in ventricular rate control using an intravenous (IV) metoprolol regimen commonly used in clinical practice in patients receiving chronic β-blocker therapy compared to patients considered β-blocker naive admitted to the emergency department (ED) for atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate.

Methods

A single-center retrospective cohort study of adult ED patients who were admitted with a rapid ventricular rate of 120 beats per minute (bpm) or greater and treated with IV metoprolol was performed. Rate control was defined as either a decrease in ventricular rate to less than 100 bpm or a 20% decrease in heart rate to less than 120 bpm after metoprolol administration. Patient demographics, differences in length of stay, and adverse events were recorded.

Results

A total of 398 patients were included in the study, with 79.4% (n = 316) receiving chronic β-blocker therapy. Patients considered to be β-blocker naive were more likely to achieve successful rate control with IV metoprolol compared to patients on chronic β-blocker therapy (56.1% vs 42.4%; p = 0.03). β-Blocker-naive status was associated with a shorter length of stay in comparison to patients receiving chronic β-blocker therapy (1.79 vs 2.64 days; P < .01).

Conclusion

Intravenous metoprolol for the treatment of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate was associated with a higher treatment response in patients considered β-blocker naive compared to patients receiving chronic β-blocker therapy.

### Comparison of sustained rate control in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: metoprolol vs. diltiazem [^117Nsyuh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare sustained rate control with intravenous (IV) diltiazem vs. IV metoprolol in acute treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This retrospective chart review at a large, academic medical center identified patients with AF with RVR diagnosis who received IV diltiazem or IV metoprolol in the ED. The primary outcome was sustained rate control defined as heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute without need for rescue IV medication for 3 h following initial rate control attainment. Secondary outcomes included time to initial rate control, HR at initial control and 3 h, time to oral dose, admission rates, and safety outcomes.

Results

Between January 1, 2016 and November 1, 2018, 51 patients met inclusion criteria (diltiazem n = 32, metoprolol n = 19). No difference in sustained rate control was found (diltiazem 87.5% vs. metoprolol 78.9%, p = 0.45). Time to rate control was significantly shorter with diltiazem compared to metoprolol (15 min vs. 30 min, respectively, p = 0.04). Neither hypotension nor bradycardia were significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Choice of rate control agent for acute management of AF with RVR did not significantly influence sustained rate control success. Safety outcomes did not differ between treatment groups.

### Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide [^112gighT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with beta adrenergic blockers, exacerbations of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction may occur. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly resume therapy and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing metoprolol tartrate in patients treated only for hypertension.

5.2 Heart Failure

Worsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of beta-blockers. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of metoprolol. It may be necessary to lower the dose of metoprolol tartrate or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of metoprolol tartrate.

5.3 Bronchospastic Disease

Beta adrenergic blockers can cause bronchospasm. Patients with bronchospastic diseases should, in general, not receive beta-blockers. Because of its relative beta1cardio-selectivity, however, metoprolol tartrate may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of metoprolol tartrate and have bronchodilators (e.g., beta2-agonists) readily available or administered concomitantly.

5.4 Bradycardia

Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, conduction disorders (including Wolff-Parkinson-White) or on concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)] that cause bradycardia may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate in patients receiving metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — beta-adrenergic blockers for ventricular rate control are supported by comparative data and require caution in heart failure. In 7 of 12 comparisons, beta-adrenergic blockade proved safe and effective for control of heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and superior to placebo, and in the AFFIRM study beta blockers achieved specified heart rate endpoints in 70% of patients compared with 54% with calcium channel blockers; beta blockers should be initiated cautiously in patients with AF and heart failure (HF) who have reduced ejection fraction, and atenolol, metoprolol, and sotalol provide better control of exercise-induced tachycardia than digoxin.

### Metoprolol vs. diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^117JARSL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of metoprolol versus diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective cohort study of patients with HFrEF in AF with RVR receiving either intravenous push (IVP) doses of metoprolol or diltiazem was conducted between January 2012 and September 2016. The primary outcome was successful rate control within 30 min of medication administration, defined as a heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute or a HR reduction ≥ 20%. Secondary outcomes included rate control at 60 min, maximum median change in HR, and incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion to normal sinus rhythm within 30 min. Signs of worsening heart failure were also evaluated.

Results

Of the 48 patients included, 14 received metoprolol and 34 received diltiazem. The primary outcome, successful rate control within 30 min, occurred in 62% of the metoprolol group and 50% of the diltiazem group (p = 0.49). There was no difference in HR control at predefined time points or incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion. Although baseline HR varied between groups, maximum median change in HR did not differ. Signs of worsening heart failure were similar between groups.

Conclusions

For the acute management of AF with RVR in patients with HFrEF, IVP diltiazem achieved similar rate control with no increase in adverse events when compared to IVP metoprolol.

### Metoprolol tartrate (metoprolol tartrate) [^116HErhd]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Late Treatment:

Start patients with contraindications to treatment during the early phase of suspected or definite myocardial infarction, patients who appear not to tolerate the full early treatment, and patients in whom the physician wishes to delay therapy for any other reason on metoprolol tartrate tablets, 100 mg twice daily, as soon as their clinical condition allows. Continue therapy for at least 3 months. Although the efficacy of metoprolol tartrate beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established, data from studies with other beta blockers suggest that treatment should be continued for 1–3 years.

Special populations

Pediatric patients: No pediatric studies have been performed. The safety and efficacy of metoprolol tartrate in pediatric patients have not been established.

Renal impairment: No dose adjustment of metoprolol tartrate is required in patients with renal impairment.

Hepatic impairment: Metoprolol tartrate blood levels are likely to increase substantially in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, metoprolol tartrate should be initiated at low doses with cautious gradual dose titration according to clinical response.

Geriatric patients (> 65 years): In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Method of administration:

For oral treatment, the tablets should be swallowed un-chewed with a glass of water. Metoprolol tartrate should always be taken in standardized relation with meals. If the physician asks the patient to take metoprolol tartrate either before breakfast or with breakfast, then the patient should continue taking metoprolol tartrate with the same schedule during the course of therapy.

### Metoprolol tartrate (metoprolol) [^116nSpnd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Distribution

About 12% of the drug is bound to human serum albumin.

Metoprolol crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been reported in the CSF in a concentration 78% of the simultaneous plasma concentration.

Elimination

Elimination is mainly by biotransformation in the liver, and the plasma half-life ranges from approximately 3 hours to 7 hours.

Metabolism

Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S- enantiomers, and is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. When administered orally, it exhibits stereoselective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype.

Excretion

Less than 5% of an oral dose of metoprolol is recovered unchanged in the urine; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta-blocking activity. Following intravenous administration of metoprolol, the urinary recovery of unchanged drug is approximately 10%.

Mean dialytic clearance of metoprolol following oral administration in patients receiving high-flux hemodialysis is 87 mL/min. Mean total systemic clearance of metoprolol following intravenous administration in patients with chronic renal failure is 1 L/min.

Drug Interactions

CYP2D6

Metoprolol is metabolized predominantly by CYP2D6. In healthy subjects with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotype, co-administration of quinidine 100 mg, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, and immediate-release metoprolol 200 mg tripled the concentration of S-metoprolol and doubled the metoprolol elimination half-life. In four patients with cardiovascular disease, co-administration of propafenone 150 mg t.i.d. with immediate-release metoprolol 50 mg t.i.d. resulted in steady-state concentration of metoprolol 2- to 5-fold what is seen with metoprolol alone. Extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

12.5	Pharmacogenomics

CYP2D6 is absent in about 8% of Caucasians (poor metabolizers) and about 2% of most other populations. CYP2D6 can be inhibited by several drugs. Poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity.

### Metoprolol (Metoprolol tartrate) [^112QxpL4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol tartrate, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly reinstate metoprolol tartrate, and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing metoprolol tartrate in patients treated only for hypertension.

5.2 Heart Failure

Worsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of metoprolol tartrate. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of metoprolol tartrate [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. It may be necessary to lower the dose of metoprolol tartrate or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of metoprolol tartrate.

5.3 Bronchospastic Disease

Patients with bronchospastic disease, should in general, not receive beta-blockers, including metoprolol tartrate. Because of its relative beta1cardio-selectivity, however, metoprolol tartrate may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of metoprolol tartrate. Bronchodilators, including beta2-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4 Pheochromocytoma

If metoprolol tartrate is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.

### Evaluation of metoprolol versus diltiazem for rate control of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department [^1154hvrQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of the metoprolol and diltiazem administration in the Emergency Department (ED) for rate control of supraventricular tachycardia.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who presented to the ED with ventricular rates ≥ 120 beats per minute (bpm) and who received bolus doses of either intravenous metoprolol or intravenous diltiazem. The primary outcome was achievement of rate control, defined as heart rate < 110 bpm, at two hours after administration of the last bolus dose of metoprolol or diltiazem. Safety outcomes included occurrence of hypotension, defined as systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure < 60 mmHg, and bradycardia, defined as heart rate < 60 bpm.

Results

There were 166 patients receiving metoprolol and 183 patients receiving diltiazem included in the study. The primary outcome, rate control at two hours after the last bolus dose of metoprolol or diltiazem was similar between the two groups (45.8% vs 42.6%, p = 0.590, respectively). The percentage of patients achieving rate control was also similar (47.0% vs 41.6%, p = 0.333) at one hour. At 0.5 h HR had a significantly greater numerical (diltiazem: 29.3 ± 23.1 bpm vs metoprolol: 21.8 ± 18.9 bpm, p = 0.012) and percent decrease (21.1% vs 15.94%, p = 0.014) in the diltiazem group compared to metoprolol. There was no significant difference in occurrence of bradycardia in the two groups (diltiazem: 3.83% vs metoprolol: 1.2%, p = 0.179). More patients in the diltiazem group compared to the metoprolol group experienced hypotension (39.3% vs 23.5%, p = 0.002). The difference in systolic hypotension events was not significantly different (9.29% vs 5.42%, p = 0.221), while the difference in diastolic hypotension events was significantly different (37.7% vs 22.3%, p = 0.002).

Conclusion

There was no difference in acute rate control effectiveness two hours after the last bolus dose of diltiazem and metoprolol for supraventricular tachycardias. There was a significantly higher occurrence of hypotension in the diltiazem group which was driven by higher rates of diastolic blood pressures less than 60 mmHg.

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for rate control in noncardiac, nonthoracic postoperative atrial fibrillation [^112QN4a7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Little guidance exists on effective management of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) following noncardiac, nonthoracic (NCNT) surgery.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to identify whether a difference exists between intravenous (IV) metoprolol and diltiazem when used to achieve hemodynamically stable rate control in POAF following NCNT surgery.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study examined critically ill adult surgical patients experiencing POAF with rapid ventricular response. Inclusion in the metoprolol or diltiazem treatment group was determined by the initial rate control agent chosen by the prescriber. The primary end point was hemodynamically stable rate control, defined by heart rate (HR) < 110 beats/min and blood pressure > 90 mm Hg, maintained for 6 hours.

Main Results

Patients on metoprolol (n = 66) and diltiazem (n = 55) were similar in age, comorbidities, surgical procedure distribution, acuity of illness, and home rate and rhythm control medications continued during hospitalization; 76% of diltiazem-treated patients achieved hemodynamically stable rate control, compared with only 53% of those receiving metoprolol (P = 0.005). Safety end points were similar between groups, including the portion requiring a new vasopressor or fluid bolus for hemodynamic support.

Conclusions

In NCNT surgery, patients with POAF, IV diltiazem more effectively controlled HR and hemodynamics compared with metoprolol. Results warrant further research into optimal medical management of POAF in this population using these 2 agents.

CYP2D6 is absent in about 8% of Caucasians (poor metabolizers) and about 2% of most other populations. CYP2D6 can be inhibited by several drugs. Poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity.

5.1 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered Metoprolol tartrate, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly reinstate Metoprolol tartrate, and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing Metoprolol tartrate in patients treated only for hypertension.

5.2 Heart Failure

Worsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of Metoprolol tartrate. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of Metoprolol tartrate [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. It may be necessary to lower the dose of Metoprolol tartrate or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of Metoprolol tartrate.

5.3 Bronchospastic Disease

Patients with bronchospastic disease, should in general, not receive beta-blockers, including Metoprolol tartrate. Because of its relative beta1cardio-selectivity, however, Metoprolol tartrate may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of Metoprolol tartrate. Bronchodilators, including beta2-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4 Pheochromocytoma

If Metoprolol tartrate is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.

### Metoprolol (Metoprolol tartrate) [^114mkPDm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Excretion

Approximately 95% of the dose can be recovered in urine. In most subjects (extensive metabolizers), less than 5% of an oral dose and less than 10% of an intravenous dose are excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. In poor metabolizers, up to 30% or 40% of oral or intravenous doses, respectively, may be excreted unchanged; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta-blocking activity. The renal clearance of the stereo-isomers does not exhibit stereo-selectivity in renal excretion.

Specific populations

Geriatric patients: The geriatric population may show slightly higher plasma concentrations of metoprolol as a combined result of a decreased metabolism of the drug in elderly population and a decreased hepatic blood flow. However, this increase is not clinically significant or therapeutically relevant.

Renal impairment: The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol tartrate in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects.

Hepatic Impairment: Since the drug is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism, hepatic impairment may impact the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol.

Drug Interactions

Metoprolol is metabolized predominantly by CYP2D6. In healthy subjects with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotype, coadministration of quinidine 100 mg, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, and immediate-release metoprolol 200 mg tripled the concentration of S-metoprolol and doubled the metoprolol elimination half-life. In four patients with cardiovascular disease, coadministration of propafenone 150 mg t.i.d. with immediate-release metoprolol 50 mg t.i.d. increased the steady-state metoprolol concentration 2-to 5-fold compared to metoprolol alone. Extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

12.5 Pharmacogenomics

CYP2D6 is absent in about 8% of Caucasians (poor metabolizers) and about 2% of most other populations. CYP2D6 can be inhibited by several drugs. Poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity.

### Achieving ventricular rate control in patients taking chronic β-blocker therapy [^113qz7fv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The objective of this study is to evaluate the difference in response to ventricular rate control with intravenous (IV) metoprolol compared to IV diltiazem in patients taking chronic beta-blocker therapy who present to the emergency department (ED) in atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR).

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of adult patients taking chronic oral metoprolol. Chronic metoprolol therapy was defined as patients prescribed and taking oral metoprolol within 5days of study inclusion. Rate control was defined as either a decrease in ventricular rate < 100bpm or < 120bpm if the decrease was at least 20% from the presenting heart rate.

Results

A total of 332 patients were included, with 16 patients in the IV diltiazem group and 316 patients in the IV metoprolol group. In the diltiazem arm, 68.8% of patients achieved successful rate control compared to 42.4% of patients in the metoprolol group (p = 0.067). Treatment with IV metoprolol resulted in more hospital admissions (58% vs. 6.25% with diltiazem, p < 0.001). Treatment with diltiazem was associated with a greater incidence of bradycardia compared to IV metoprolol (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.002).

Conclusions

The use of IV diltiazem was associated with a higher rate of successful response to rate control compared to IV metoprolol in patients in AF with RVR on chronic beta-blocker therapy, however the difference between groups was not statistically significant.

2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS atrial fibrillation guideline — Heart rate targets for rate control in arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): The ideal target heart rate remains uncertain, but given potential harms of rapid ventricular rates, a stricter strategy may be reasonable. In AF-CHF, rate control was defined as ventricular rate < 80 bpm at rest and < 110 bpm during a 6-minute walk test. In RACE II, 614 patients with permanent AF were randomized to strict control (< 80 bpm at rest and < 110 bpm with moderate exercise) versus lenient control (resting heart rate, < 110 bpm), showing similar outcomes, though patients were rate controlled at enrollment (baseline heart rate, 96 bpm), and only 15% had LVEF < 40% with very few > 100 bpm. In a crossover study of 20 patients with persistent AF and LVEF < 40%, metoprolol (average dose, 121 mg) targeted < 70 bpm and after 3 months reduced resting heart rate from 94 ± 14 bpm to 85 ± 12 bpm without significant QOL or functional differences. Strict rate control is also advisable in patients with ICDs and CRT.

### Do metoprolol and carvedilol have equivalent effects on diurnal heart rate in patients with chronic heart failure? [^112tzUKt]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Carvedilol exerted a greater reduction in mortality than metoprolol tartrate in the Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET). However, it is unclear if the degree and time course of beta1-blockade during a 24-h period was similar with each agent at the doses used. Therefore we analyzed 24-h ECG Holter recordings from a study which compared the long-term clinical efficacy of metoprolol tartrate to carvedilol in chronic heart failure patients using the same dosing regimen as in COMET.

Methods and Results

Fifty-one patients with chronic heart failure with a mean LVEF 26 ± 1.8% were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive metoprolol tartrate 50 mg bid or carvedilol 25 mg bid. 24-h ECG monitoring (Holter) was performed at baseline, 12 weeks and 1 year. Adequate quality recordings for analysis were obtained from 43 subjects at baseline, 42 at 12 weeks and 29 subjects at 1 year. Both drugs produced a fall in average 24-h heart rate from baseline at 12 weeks and at 1 year: metoprolol 88 ± 3 to 71 ± 2 and 69 ± 3 bpm; carvedilol 83 ± 3 to 70 ± 2 and 70 ± 3 bpm respectively (all p < 0.001). The pattern of suppression of heart rate during the 24-h period was similar for both drugs.

Conclusion

Metoprolol tartrate 50 mg bid and carvedilol 25 mg bid had similar effects on 24-h heart rate. This result suggests that the degree of beta1-blockade produced by these two drugs in these doses is comparable and the superior survival effect of carvedilol compared to metoprolol seen in COMET is likely to be due to actions of carvedilol other than beta1-blockade.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — pharmacological rate control (Class I): Measurement of the heart rate at rest and control of the rate with pharmacological agents are recommended for persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) (Level of Evidence: B). In the absence of preexcitation, intravenous beta blockers (esmolol, metoprolol, or propranolol) or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) are recommended to slow the ventricular response to AF in the acute setting, with caution in hypotension or heart failure (HF) (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous digoxin or amiodarone is recommended to control heart rate in patients with AF and HF without an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). For patients with activity-related AF symptoms, adequacy of rate control should be assessed during exercise and pharmacological treatment adjusted to keep the rate in the physiologic range (Level of Evidence: C). Oral digoxin is effective to control resting heart rate in AF and is indicated for HF, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, or sedentary individuals (Level of Evidence: C).

### Hemodynamic comparison of intravenous push diltiazem versus metoprolol for atrial fibrillation rate control [^115j9vYP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Intravenous push (IVP) diltiazem and metoprolol are commonly used for management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED). This study's objective was to determine if there was a significant difference in blood pressure reduction between agents.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of adult patients initially treated with IVP diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED from 2008 to 2018. Primary endpoint was mean reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to nadir during the study period. Study period was defined as time from first dose of IVP intervention to 30 min after last dose of IVP intervention or first dose of maintenance therapy, whichever came first.

Results

A total of 63 diltiazem patients and 45 metoprolol patients met eligibility criteria. Baseline characteristics were similar except for initial ventricular rate (VR) and home beta-blocker use. Median dose of initial intervention was 10 [10–20] mg and 5 [5–5] mg for diltiazem and metoprolol respectively. Mean SBP reduction was 18 ± 22 mmHg for diltiazem compared to 14 ± 15 mmHg for metoprolol (p = .33). Clinically relevant hypotension was similar between groups 14% vs. 16% (p = .86). Rate control was achieved in 35 (56%) of the diltiazem group and 16 (36%) of the metoprolol group (p = .04).

Conclusion

IVP diltiazem and metoprolol caused similar SBP reduction and hypotension when used for initial management of AF with RVR in the ED. However, rate control was achieved more often with diltiazem.

### Presence and development of atrial fibrillation in chronic heart failure. experiences from the MERIT-HF study [^111BHfce]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation is common in heart failure, but data regarding beta-blockade in these patients and its ability to prevent new occurrence of atrial fibrillation are scarce.

Methods

Baseline ECGs in MERIT-HF were coded regarding baseline rhythm, and outcome was analyzed in relation to rhythm. Occurrence of atrial fibrillation during follow-up was also analyzed.

Results

At baseline atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in 556 patients (13.9%). Mean metoprolol CR/XL dose in patients in atrial fibrillation (154 mg) and sinus rhythm (158 mg) was similar, as well as decrease in heart rate (14.8 and 13.7 bpm, respectively). Only 61 (total of 362) deaths occurred in those in atrial fibrillation at baseline, 31 on placebo and 30 on metoprolol (RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.61–1.65). During follow-up, new atrial fibrillation was observed in 85 patients on placebo and 47 patients on metoprolol (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.37–0.76; p = 0.0005).

Conclusion

First, given the wide confidence interval, it was impossible to detect an interaction between metoprolol and mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Second, in patients with sinus rhythm at baseline, metoprolol reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation during follow-up. However, we must be extremely cautious in over-interpreting effects in these subgroups.

### Atrial fibrillation (acute onset) [^114ZCcRn]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute atrial fibrillation is rapid, irregular, and chaotic atrial activity of recent onset. Various definitions of acute atrial fibrillation have been used in the literature, but for the purposes of this review we have included studies where atrial fibrillation may have occurred up to 7 days previously. Risk factors for acute atrial fibrillation include increasing age, cardiovascular disease, alcohol, diabetes, and lung disease. Acute atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. The condition resolves spontaneously within 24 to 48 hours in more than 50% of people; however, many people will require interventions to control heart rate or restore sinus rhythm.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent embolism, for conversion to sinus rhythm, and to control heart rate in people with recent-onset atrial fibrillation (within 7 days) who are haemodynamically stable? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 26 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amiodarone, antithrombotic treatment before cardioversion, atenolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, digoxin, diltiazem, direct current cardioversion, flecainide, metoprolol, nebivolol, propafenone, sotalol, timolol, and verapamil.

### 2009 ACCF / AHA focused update on perioperative beta blockade [^113nvXgt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Perioperative beta-blocker therapy — current data suggest benefit and specify use: beta blockers reduce perioperative ischemia and may reduce the risk of MI and cardiovascular death in high-risk patients; continuation for ACCF/AHA Class I indications continues to be a Class I recommendation; when possible and where indicated, beta blockers should be started days to weeks before elective surgery, the dose should be titrated perioperatively, and titrated rate control should continue intraoperatively and postoperatively, if possible, to maintain a heart rate of 60 to 80 bpm in the absence of hypotension; by contrast, routine administration of higher-dose long-acting metoprolol on the day of surgery without titration is associated with an overall increase in mortality, and routine high-dose beta blockers without dose titration before noncardiac surgery are not useful, may be harmful, and carry a new Class III recommendation.

Beta blockers — maintenance and relapse prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) with structural heart disease: beta blockers are generally not considered primary therapy for maintenance of sinus rhythm, but evidence shows moderate efficacy, including a placebo-controlled study of 394 patients with persistent AF showing lower early recurrence and slower ventricular response with sustained-release metoprolol than placebo; two studies found atenolol and bisoprolol as effective as sotalol and better than placebo for reducing paroxysmal AF frequency and duration and relapse probability. In persistent AF, carvedilol and bisoprolol after cardioversion produced similar relapse reductions over 1 y, and an observational study noted reduced AF risk during an average follow-up of 3.2 y. These agents may be effective in postoperative patients but potentially aggravate vagally mediated AF.

Class II

β Blockers are recommended as a first‐line therapy for rate control in AF with COVID‐19 infection. 46 All β blockers may have drug interactions with lopinavir/ritonavir, including PR prolongation, second‐degree heart block, and third‐degree heart block. 24, 47 Lopinavir/ritonavir may increase carvedilol and metoprolol serum concentration through CYP2D6 inhibition, 47 and telemetry should be monitored closely (Figure 1).

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine inhibit CYP2D6 and may increase plasma concentration of metoprolol 48; a similar effect may be observed in carvedilol but has never been studied.

Carvedilol is a nonselective β blocker. Only immediate release is recommended in AF guidelines and only oral form is available, which limits its utility in acute AF with rapid ventricular response. 17, 49 Metoprolol and esmolol are cardioselective β blockers. 50 Metoprolol comes in both intravenous and oral forms, 17 whereas esmolol only has intravenous preparation. Both are effective when administered in AF, with rapid ventricular response. 17 β Blockers should also be avoided in acute decompensated CHF and bronchospasm. 49

Class III

Amiodarone blocks multiple ion channels, including I Na, I Kr, calcium channel, and acetylcholine‐dependent potassium channel, as well as α and β receptors. 38 It prolongs QT but is rarely associated with torsade de pointes (< 0.5%). 51 Amiodarone is the most effective and most common AAD used in AF. 52 It is preferred for AF rate and rhythm control in critically ill COVID‐19 patients with significant CHF or borderline blood pressure. 46 However, information on amiodarone and COVID‐19 pharmacotherapy interactions is limited. Surveillance for liver, lung, and thyroid toxicity is recommended for long‐term amiodarone therapy and for short‐term use if clinically indicated. Long‐ and short‐term presentations of amiodarone toxicity have been reported. 53, 54 Pulmonary toxicity may be a concern for COVID‐19 patients with severe pneumonia who require prolonged mechanical ventilation.

### Titration to target dose of bisoprolol vs. carvedilol in elderly patients with heart failure: the CIBIS-ELD trial [^111FpTt4]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic heart failure is a growing epidemic associated with high mortality, morbidity, and quality of life (QoL) impairment and is a substantial burden on health systems. Three key trials have randomized nearly 9000 patients with systolic heart failure to beta-blocker (bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol succinate controlled release) or placebo and demonstrated a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations. – Nevertheless, recent large international surveys have shown that only 20–40% of heart failure patients are taking beta-blockers and the mean dose is half the recommended target.

The underuse and underdosing of beta-blockers may reflect a reluctance to change practice stemming from their long-standing contraindication in heart failure. Conversely, it may reflect a true lack of tolerability of beta-blockers in patients who are typically relatively old, have co-morbidities, and are taking a range of other drugs. It is noteworthy that many previous beta-blocker trials included heart failure patients who were younger (mean age 61–64) than those encountered in routine practice (mean age 71–75). –,

Class effects may not be uniform and tolerability may differ between the commonly used beta-blockers, reflecting their distinct pharmacological profiles such as selectivity for the β 1 -adrenoceptor subtype (bisoprolol) or vasodilatory activity (carvedilol). However, differences in tolerability have not been systematically studied. If one proven beta-blocker were better tolerated than another it could be of considerable public health importance. Results of the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET), suggested that overall tolerability of carvedilol vs. metoprolol tartrate does not differ, but it has been suggested that this interpretation is problematic because doses were not equivalent. The second Carvedilol Open-Label Assessment found good tolerability for carvedilol in older heart failure patients, but no previous double-blind randomized trial had tolerability as the primary endpoint.

### Maintenance of sinus rhythm with metoprolol CR initiated before cardioversion and repeated cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study [^1175YaAn]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the effect of metoprolol in combination with repeated cardioversion on maintenance of sinus rhythm (SR).

Methods and Results

Consecutive outpatients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) were randomized to treatment with metoprolol CR or placebo in a double-blind fashion. Study treatment was started at least one week before direct current (DC) cardioversion. Patients were followed once a week during the first 6 weeks after cardioversion. In case of relapse during this period, a second cardioversion was performed. Total treatment time was 6 months. A total of 168 patients were randomized to metoprolol (n = 83) or placebo (n = 85). The dose of study treatment at cardioversion was 169 ± 47 mg in the metoprolol group and 180 ± 40 mg in the placebo group (P = 0.12). In an intention-to-treat analysis, 46 patients (55%) in the metoprolol group and 34 patients (40%) in the placebo group (P = 0.04) had SR 1 week after cardioversion, and 38 patients (46%) in the metoprolol group compared with 22 patients (26%) in the placebo group had SR after 6 months (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

A treatment strategy of metoprolol CR started before cardioversion in combination with prompt second cardioversion in case of early relapse (1–6 weeks) significantly increases the proportion of patients in SR during six months of follow-up.

### Comparison of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure in the carvedilol or metoprolol European trial (COMET): randomised controlled trial [^116icuNU]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Beta blockers reduce mortality in patients who have chronic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.

Methods

In a multicentre, double-blind, and randomised parallel group trial, we assigned 1511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) and 1518 to metoprolol (metoprolol tartrate, target dose 50 mg twice daily). Patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), previous admission for a cardiovascular reason, an ejection fraction of less than 0.35, and to have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. Analysis was done by intention to treat.

Findings

The mean study duration was 58 months (SD 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (0.07) and the mean age 62 years (11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio 0.83 [95% CI 0.74–0.93], p = 0.0017). The reduction of all-cause mortality was consistent across predefined subgroups. The composite endpoint of mortality or all-cause admission occurred in 1116 (74%) of 1511 on carvedilol and in 1160 (76%) of 1518 on metoprolol (0.94 [0.86–1.02], p = 0.122). Incidence of side-effects and drug withdrawals did not differ by much between the two study groups.

Interpretation

Our results suggest that carvedilol extends survival compared with metoprolol.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^113ESvYB]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that the sequencing of Step 2 and Step 3 can be appropriately modified under certain circumstances. For example, treatment with spironolactone or eplerenone may be considered as Step 2 and initiated before sacubitril/valsartan if the patient seems unlikely to tolerate the hypotensive effects of angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibition, e.g. patients with a systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg. Additionally, if a patient is already receiving treatment with a conventional inhibitor of the renin–angiotensin system, it is appealing to consider switching to sacubitril/valsartan and initiating treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist at the same time. Simultaneous inhibition of the actions of neprilysin and aldosterone is not expected to produce any meaningful adverse interaction. By contrast, we would be reluctant to start sacubitril/valsartan and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist simultaneously in a patient who is not already receiving an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, since the combination can result in worsening renal function or hyperkalaemia unless the tolerability of a conventional inhibitor of the renin–angiotensin system has been firmly established in an individual patient.

Once all four foundational drugs have been initiated within 4 weeks, physicians can then increase the dose of each drug towards the target doses used in clinical trials, as tolerated by the patient. Such up‐titration may be particularly important with respect to the use of beta‐blockers. In the COMET trial, up‐titration of carvedilol to target doses provided incremental benefits with respect to all‐cause mortality when compared with medium doses of metoprolol tartrate; interestingly, this benefit could not be predicted by the achievement of a target heart rate, since the difference in resting heart rate between the carvedilol and metoprolol groups in that trial was only 1 bpm.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2022). High credibility.

Coronary CTA heart rate control and medications — the majority of patients referred for coronary CTA require pre-medication with beta-blockers to achieve heart rate control and reduce heart rate variability, and SCCT guidelines for the performance and acquisition of coronary CTA should be followed; generally, a target heart rate of 60 beats per minute or less is usually appropriate; oral metoprolol administration is the usual practice, with 50–100 mg by mouth 1 hour prior to imaging, and slow-release formulations of oral metoprolol should not be used; at the time of scanning, supplementation with IV metoprolol can be used to achieve target heart rates (5 mg IV), followed by repeated 5 mg doses as necessary, typically up to 20–25 mg total; ivabradine can be used in addition to or in lieu of beta-blockers for heart rate control prior to coronary CTA, with a sample protocol of 15 mg orally 60–75 minutes prior to scanning, but it is ineffective in patients who are not in sinus rhythm.

Atrial fibrillation rate control — comparative drug effects and emergency department outcomes show heart rate reductions across agents and similar acute care outcomes between classes. In a prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, crossover study, the 24-hour mean heart rate was 96 ± 12 bpm at baseline (no treatment), 75 ± 10 bpm with diltiazem, 81 ± 11 bpm with verapamil, 82 ± 11 bpm with metoprolol, and 84 ± 11 bpm with carvedilol, with all drugs significantly reducing heart rate versus baseline. In a retrospective cohort from two urban emergency departments, a total of 259 consecutive patients were enrolled, with 100 receiving calcium channel blockers and 159 receiving beta blockers; twenty-seven percent of patients taking beta blockers were admitted, while 31.0% of patients taking calcium channel blockers were admitted, with no significant differences in emergency department length of stay, adverse events, or 7- or 30-day revisits. A follow-up analysis of the AFFIRM study reported no difference in all hospitalization and all-cause mortality among participants receiving beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or digoxin as a single rate-control agent at baseline.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: a clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^116XDtfT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.

Similarly, Lucio et al, randomized 200 patients underwent isolated CABG to receive either metoprolol or no drug. Metoprolol was given orally adjusted to maintain optimal heart rate and started from the 12th hour to the 7th postoperative day or hospital discharge. Postoperative AF and flutter occurred at 24% in control versus 11% in metoprolol group (p = 0.02). Tsuboi et al, randomized 160 patients who underwent scheduled isolated CABG to receive either carvedilol or not. Postoperative paroxysmal AF was 15% in carvedilol group (p = 0.009). White et al, assigned randomly 41 patients after CABG to receive prophylactic timolol or placebo. Timolol 0.5 mg diluted in 10 mL of saline was given IV over 1 min twice daily only when patient condition was stable, following oral timolol twice daily for 7 days. Timolol decreased significantly (p < 0.05) the episodes of supraventricular tachycardia as well as of AF and/or flutter. Lamb et al, randomized 60 patients underwent CABG treated with atenolol or not. Remarkably, 37% of patients in control group experienced a sypraventricular arrhythmia compared to 3% in atenolol group (p = 0.001). Several studies compared the efficacy of iv or oral b-blocker as well as different types of b-blocker. Halonen et al, in an attempt to compare the iv with the oral use of metoprolol, randomized 240 patients who underwent first on pump CABG, aortic valve replacement or combined aortic valve replacement and CABG. In both groups, the metoprolol administration was based on heart rate for a 48 hour period. Postoperative AF presented a significant decrease (p = 0.036) in IV group (16.8%) compared to oral group (28.1%). It should be mentioned that patients at risk to develop complications associated with IV metoprolol were excluded. Also, Maniar et al randomized 47 patients for elective CABG to receive either esmolol IV or standard oral β-blocker (propanolol/metoprolol). Esmolol was given within 6 to 18 hours of arrival to recovery room, continued for up to 24 hours and then these patients transitioned to oral β-blocker. The incidence of postoperative AF was the same (26%) in both groups. However, patients in esmolol group developed significant adverse effects (hypotension, symptomatic bradycardia, CHF) compared to oral β-blocker. An important limitation was that patients in oral β-blocker group received greater number of bypass grafts than in the esmolol group. Similarly, Balcetyte - Harris et al, showed that the tolerance to esmolol was poor, and that its effectiveness in the prevention of atrial fibrillation was not better than oral b-blockers.

### Metoprolol versus amiodarone in the prevention of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery: a randomized trial [^1175MRjB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend β-blockers as the first-line preventive treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) after cardiac surgery. Despite this, 19% of physicians report using amiodarone as first-line prophylaxis of postoperative AF. Data directly comparing the efficacy of these agents in preventing postoperative AF are lacking.

Objective

To determine whether intravenous metoprolol and amiodarone are equally effective in preventing postoperative AF after cardiac surgery.

Design

Randomized, prospective, equivalence, open-label, multicenter study. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00784316)

Setting

3 cardiac care referral centers in Finland.

Patients

316 consecutive patients who were hemodynamically stable and free of mechanical ventilation and AF within 24 hours after cardiac surgery.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive 48-hour infusion of metoprolol, 1 to 3 mg/h, according to heart rate, or amiodarone, 15 mg/kg of body weight daily, with a maximum daily dose of 1000 mg, starting 15 to 21 hours after cardiac surgery.

Measurements

The primary end point was the occurrence of the first AF episode or completion of the 48-hour infusion.

Results

Atrial fibrillation occurred in 38 of 159 (23.9%) patients in the metoprolol group and 39 of 157 (24.8%) patients in the amiodarone group (P = 0.85). However, the difference (-0.9 percentage point [90% CI, -8.9 to 7.0 percentage points]) does not meet the prespecified equivalence margin of 5 percentage points. The adjusted hazard ratio of the metoprolol group compared with the amiodarone group was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.76).

Limitations

Caregivers were not blinded to treatment allocation, and the trial evaluated only stable patients who were not at particularly elevated risk for AF. The withdrawal of preoperative β-blocker therapy may have increased the risk for AF in the amiodarone group.

Conclusion

The occurrence of AF was similar in the metoprolol and amiodarone groups. However, because of the wide range of the CIs, the authors cannot conclude that the 2 treatments were equally effective.

### Intravenous administration of metoprolol is more effective than oral administration in the prevention of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery [^115TpqTy]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia to occur after cardiac surgery, with an incidence of 20% to 40%. AF is associated with postoperative complications, including increased risk of stroke and need of additional treatment, as well as prolonged hospital stay and increased costs. It has been shown that prophylactic oral administration of beta-blocker therapy reduces the incidence of postoperative AF after cardiac surgery. However, it is possible that absorption of drugs is impaired after cardiopulmonary perfusion associated with cardiac surgery. The purpose of this prospective, controlled, randomized trial was to study compare intravenous and per oral metoprolol administration in the prevention of AF after cardiac surgery.

Methods and Results

240 consecutive patients who were scheduled to undergo their first on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), aortic valve replacement, or combined aortic valve replacement and CABG were randomized to receive 48-hour infusion of metoprolol or oral metoprolol starting on the first postoperative morning. Patients were excluded if they had contraindications for beta-blocker or had to stay > 1 day in the intensive care unit. Dosage of metoprolol was adjusted according to heart rate. The dosage was 1 to 3 mg/h in the intravenous group and from 25 mg twice per day to 50 mg 3 times per day in the oral group. The incidence of postoperative AF was significantly lower in the intravenous group than in the oral group (16.8% versus 28.1%, P = 0.036). No serious adverse effects were associated with intravenous metoprolol therapy.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that intravenous metoprolol is well-tolerated and more effective than oral metoprolol in the prevention of AF after cardiac surgery.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^115Wmqtv]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Each of the criteria proposed in the table deserves thought and deliberation, particularly with respect to the use of beta‐blockers. Since not all beta‐blockers reduce mortality, the only members of the drug class that warrant inclusion in stratum I are those that have been specifically shown to reduce mortality in large‐scale trials. Furthermore, analyses of these trials have raised important questions about the ability of beta‐blockers to prolong survival in patients with atrial fibrillation, 48 potentially because the target doses used in the pivotal trials may have caused excessive slowing of the ventricular response, which predisposed to fatal bradyarrhythmic events. 49 Consequently, patients with atrial fibrillation who are treated with a beta‐blocker are assigned to stratum I with no designated target heart rate, since heart rates of 80–90 bpm may be appropriate targets for the use of beta‐blockers if patients have atrial fibrillation. 50

### Relationships among achieved heart rate, β-blocker dose and long-term outcomes in patients with heart failure with atrial fibrillation [^111HKac6]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

It is not clear why the clinical benefits observed by achieving target doses of β-blockers and target heart rates in those with HF and sinus rhythm are not seen in the setting of AF, but there are several potential mechanisms. The variability in R-R intervals in AF leads to a reduction in cardiac output and an increase in left atrial pressure independent of effects on heart rate or atrial activity. This phenomenon may be particularly prominent in patients with LV dysfunction. This reduced cardiac output could be further decreased with the acute haemodynamic changes of β-blocker therapy. The combination of these effects may lead to adverse haemodynamic changes that prevent patients from achieving the long-term benefits from β-blocker therapy. This hypothesis could be tested by looking at the effects of β-blocker therapy in patients with HF and AF stratified by cardiac output prior to initiation of therapy. Alternatively, the loss of atrial contraction and the consequently lower stroke volume that occurs when AF is present may, in the patient with HF, require a higher heart rate to maintain clinical stability. The heart rate-lowering effects of β-blockers in sinus rhythm are primarily through effects on the sinus node, while in AF these changes are through effects on the atrioventricular node. The benefit shown with the use of ivabradine suggests that the beneficial effects of these agents may be specific to effects on the sinus node. Regardless, further clarification of the mechanisms underlying the differences between patients with HF in AF and sinus rhythm, may suggest how to optimise the management of these patients.

Admission tachycardia

We found that patients admitted with a heart rate > 120 bpm had an improved prognosis, which seems primarily related to a reduction in repeat hospitalisation. This has not previously been reported in this population, to the best of our knowledge. This analysis was not prespecified, and could represent a chance finding. While this group tended to be younger, we also suspect that those with significant tachycardia at admission may be more likely to have AF as a cause rather than a consequence of HF. This includes the subset of patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, a condition known to have a more benign prognosis than other causes of HF once rate and/or rhythm are controlled. Alternatively, elevated heart rates may provide beneficial haemodynamic compensation during times of stress in these patients. Finally, patients with tachycardia on admission may have larger changes in heart rate with therapy, a metric known to be important in predicting response to therapy which was also associated with reduced outcomes in patients with HFrEF. Regardless, this is an interesting finding which should be prospectively validated in future studies.

### High-dose intravenous metoprolol usage for reducing heart rate at CT coronary angiography: efficacy and safety [^116qrcp6]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the usage, safety, and efficacy of high-dose intravenous metoprolol for heart rate reduction in computer tomographic (CT) coronary angiography.

Materials and Methods

As this was retrospective analysis of anonymous data, medical ethics committee approval was waived by the regional health research authority. Patients, who had known iodinated contrast medium allergy, contraindications to β-blockers, atrial fibrillation, and indications other than suspected coronary artery disease, were excluded from analysis. The ultimate study population of 662 were analysed with details of intravenous metoprolol doses, complications, heart rate before administration of intravenous metoprolol (resting heart rate, RHR), heart rate at acquisition of scan (acquisition heart rate, AHR), and usage of low radiation dose protocols.

Results

Of the ultimate study population of 662 patients, 183 had no intravenous metoprolol with mean acquisition heart rate (AHR) of 58 beats per minute (bpm), 257 had 1–15 mg intravenous metoprolol with mean AHR of 57 bpm, 114 had 16–29 mg intravenous metoprolol with mean AHR of 62 bpm and 108 had ≥ 30 mg intravenous metoprolol with mean AHR of 66 bpm. In the group receiving intravenous metoprolol, average usage was 19 mg (maximum 67 mg) with average reduction in HR of 15 bpm. There were no clinical incidents in relation to the use of high-dose intravenous metoprolol.

Conclusion

Higher doses of intravenous metoprolol are beneficial in achieving target heart rates to facilitate usage of low radiation dose protocols. With appropriate exclusion criteria, higher doses of intravenous metoprolol, well in excess of 15 mg, can be safely administered when carefully titrated.

### Effects of metoprolol and carvedilol on cause-specific mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure – COMET [^116nDQor]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers with different receptor bindings reduce mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. We compared the effects of the beta1-blocker metoprolol tartrate and the beta1-, beta2-, and alpha1-blocker carvedilol.

Methods

In a randomized double-blind design, 3029 patients with chronic congestive heart failure requiring diuretic therapy and with left ventricular dysfunction were randomized to treatment with carvedilol (n = 1511) or metoprolol tartrate (n = 1518) and titrated to target doses of 25 mg of carvedilol twice daily or 50 mg of metoprolol tartrate twice daily. The main outcome measures were total mortality and the combination of mortality or hospitalization for any cause. Secondary end points were cardiovascular death, combinations of morbidity and mortality, New York Heart Association class, worsening of heart failure, hospitalizations, and discontinuation of study therapy.

Results

A total of 512 and 600 patients in the carvedilol group and metoprolol group, respectively, died (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.74–0.93, P = 0.0017). Cardiovascular death was reduced by carvedilol (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70–0.90, P = 0.0004). There were fewer sudden deaths and deaths caused by circulatory failure or by stroke in the carvedilol group. There was no difference in all-cause hospitalizations or in worsening heart failure between treatment groups. The incidence of fatal or nonfatal acute myocardial infarction was significantly lower in the carvedilol group (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52–0.97, P = 0.03). Discontinuations of study therapy were similar in the 2 groups.

Conclusion

Compared with metoprolol tartrate, carvedilol reduced cardiovascular mortality, sudden death, death caused by circulatory failure, death caused by stroke, as well as fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions.

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: an umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^117G5797]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The strength of this analysis was the use of a systematic and methodical approach to assess all published meta-analyses of randomised trials across different cardiovascular diseases. By focusing on the highest quality data through a detailed risk of bias and quality assessment, we were able to come to conclusions across various cardiovascular conditions and subgroups. The trial populations were heterogeneous, but this provides results that are more likely to represent clinical practice. It would not have been feasible to assess all individual RCTs due to the vast number included in our analysis. Our analysis provides the most comprehensive and contemporary summary of the efficacy of beta-blockers across cardiovascular diseases, thereby aiding physicians to initiate, maintain or withdraw therapy in a patient group that frequently has multi-morbidity and more than one clinical indication.

As with all systematic reviews, we are limited by the individual RCTs and the methodology of the component meta-analyses. IPD has important advantages over aggregate data meta-analysis, including the ability to improve data quality and increase the precision of effect size. Unfortunately, the series of IPD analyses from the Beta-blockers in Heart Failure Collaborative Group were the only IPD studies available. Nevertheless, at least for major outcomes, conventional meta-analysis can provide similar results and conclusions.

There are cardiovascular indications for beta-blockers where data are extremely limited. Beta-blockers are commonly used to control heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation; however, the evidence base is extremely limited at present and we identified no studies eligible for inclusion. Other cardiac populations where beta-blockers are regularly prescribed but where randomised trial evidence is limited include chemotherapy toxicity, cardiomyopathies and other arrhythmias (atrial and ventricular tachycardia).

There are also important and complex pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences between beta-blocker subtypes, including lipid solubility, intravenous versus oral administration routes, bioavailability and first-pass metabolism variations. However, with the exception of hypertension, we were unable to assess heterogeneity of treatment effects between different beta-blockers. Finally, the trade-off between efficacy and adverse events will vary according to individual patient characteristics (cardiovascular condition, disease severity and course, comorbidities, and coexisting therapies) and beta-blocker effects (pharmacodynamics, receptor selectivity, dose and route of administration). All of these factors, and more, will impact on the clinical decision to prescribe beta-blocker therapy.

### Dose of metoprolol CR / XL and clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure: analysis of the experience in metoprolol CR / XL randomized intervention trial in chronic heart failure (MERIT-HF) [^116za918]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

We performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis in the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Chronic Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) with the aim of reporting on the heart rate (HR) response during the titration phase and clinical outcomes from the three-month follow-up visit to end of study in two dosage subgroups: one that had reached more than 100 mg of metoprolol CR/XL once daily (high-dose group; n = 1,202; mean 192 mg) and one that had reached 100 mg or less (low-dose group; n = 412; mean 76 mg).

Background

Clinicians have questioned whether patients need to reach the target beta-blocker dose to receive benefit. METHODS; Outcome (Cox-adjusted) was compared with all placebo patients with dose available at the three-month visit (n = 1,845).

Results

Data indicated somewhat higher risk in the low-dose group compared with the high-dose group. Heart rate was reduced to a similar degree in the two dose groups, indicating higher sensitivity for beta-blockade in the low-dose group. The reduction in total mortality with metoprolol CR/XL compared with placebo was similar: 38% (95% confidence interval, 16 to 55) in high-dose group (p = 0.0022) and also 38% (95% CI, 11 to 57) in the low-dose group (p = 0.010).

Conclusions

Risk reduction was similar in the high- and low-dose subgroups, which, at least partly, may be the result of similar beta-blockade as judged from the HR response. The results support the idea of an individualized dose-titration regimen, which is guided by patient tolerability and the HR response. Further research is needed to shed light on why some patients respond with a marked HR reduction and reduced mortality risk on a relatively small dose of a beta-blocker.
