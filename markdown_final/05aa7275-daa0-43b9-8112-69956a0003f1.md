## Question

Should jardiance be discontinued in a patient with hfref and recurrent utis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Jardiance (empagliflozin) should be stopped in a patient with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who has been having recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the magnitude of cardiovascular benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors in HFrEF. Then, I should verify the actual risk of UTIs with empagliflozin from trials and labeling. Next, I will review guidance on when UTIs should prompt discontinuation. After that, I should examine data on outcomes if SGLT2 therapy is stopped after a UTI. Finally, I will consider mitigation strategies and formulate a risk–benefit recommendation with a monitoring plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and stakes: empagliflozin is foundational therapy in HFrEF, with large RCTs showing approximately a 25% reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization, largely driven by fewer HF hospitalizations, and this benefit is consistent regardless of diabetes status, which is why major guidelines list SGLT2 inhibitors as one of the four pillars for HFrEF alongside ARNI/ACEi/ARB, beta-blocker, and MRA [^11371Zhr] [^112ufkSP] [^113Y5edZ].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of UTI risk so I don't overstate it: across pooled empagliflozin trials, UTI rates are modestly higher than placebo and still low in absolute terms, with female sex carrying a higher risk. Importantly, serious UTI events such as pyelonephritis or urosepsis are rare and were not increased in large RCTs, though postmarketing cases do occur, which is why FDA labeling advises vigilance and prompt treatment rather than automatic discontinuation [^112BEkJ3] [^117HNuYc] [^114quRym].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — guidelines emphasize a high threshold for stopping SGLT2 inhibitors for GU infections: the ACC/AHA and VA/DoD materials instruct clinicians to recognize increased risk of genital mycotic infections and UTIs, counsel on hygiene, and treat infections promptly. They do not recommend routine discontinuation for uncomplicated UTIs, underscoring that the cardiovascular benefit generally outweighs the manageable infection risk [^114vLWKb] [^117HNuYc] [^113KJpTn].

> I need to check whether stopping empagliflozin after a UTI helps or harms: real-world and emulation analyses show that patients who discontinue SGLT2 inhibitors after a UTI have higher risks of cardiovascular and renal events without reducing recurrent UTI risk, and withdrawal of empagliflozin in stable HF patients leads to rapid loss of hemodynamic and clinical benefits, reinforcing that stopping the drug may worsen outcomes without preventing future infections [^111BMCp8] [^113hES9Z] [^114vBwWc].

> But wait, what if the infections are severe or complicated? I should double-check that nuance: if a patient develops urosepsis, pyelonephritis, or requires hospitalization for UTI, guidelines support temporary interruption during the acute episode, evaluation for modifiable risk factors, and reconsideration of continuation after resolution. In contrast, recurrent uncomplicated UTIs alone are not a mandate to stop therapy, and preventive strategies should be optimized instead [^114vLWKb] [^113KJpTn].

> Next, I should review practical mitigation steps before considering discontinuation: screen for and treat asymptomatic bacteriuria only in pregnancy, reinforce perineal hygiene, encourage adequate hydration, review concomitant immunosuppression or urinary tract anatomy, and consider UTI prophylaxis such as cranberry or methenamine if appropriate. If infections persist despite optimization, a short drug holiday may be reasonable, but I need to ensure the heart failure regimen remains intact and plan to rechallenge given the magnitude of benefit [^111VyW5E] [^114vBwWc].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line: empagliflozin should generally not be discontinued solely for recurrent uncomplicated UTIs in HFrEF, because the proven reductions in HF hospitalization and cardiovascular events are large and sustained, the absolute UTI risk increase is small and manageable, stopping the drug increases cardiovascular and renal risk without preventing recurrences, and guideline-directed mitigation and prompt treatment of infections provide a safer path than withdrawal [^11371Zhr] [^112ufkSP] [^111BMCp8] [^114vLWKb].

> Final recommendation: continue empagliflozin, implement infection-prevention measures, treat each UTI promptly, and consider temporary interruption only for severe or complicated infections requiring hospitalization. If discontinuation is contemplated, reassess after correcting reversible UTI risks and plan early reinitiation because the heart failure benefit remains substantial and is lost quickly after withdrawal [^114quRym] [^114vBwWc].

Empagliflozin (Jardiance) **should not be automatically discontinued** in HFrEF patients with recurrent UTIs, as its cardiovascular and renal benefits are substantial [^11371Zhr] [^113Y5edZ] and the absolute UTI risk increase is modest [^112BEkJ3]. Discontinuation is appropriate only for **severe or complicated UTIs** (e.g. pyelonephritis, urosepsis) or when infections persist despite optimal management. Instead, manage infections proactively with hygiene, hydration, and prompt antibiotic therapy [^111VyW5E]; consider temporary interruption only during active infection, then resume once resolved. Continued empagliflozin is favored given its mortality and hospitalization benefits [^112ufkSP] unless infections are life-threatening or refractory [^113KJpTn].

---

## Clinical benefits of empagliflozin in HFrEF

Empagliflozin provides **significant cardiovascular and renal benefits** in HFrEF, including:

- **Reduced cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization**: 25% relative risk reduction (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.65–0.86) [^11371Zhr] [^112ufkSP].
- **Reduced HF hospitalizations**: 30% relative risk reduction (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.58–0.85) [^11371Zhr] [^112ufkSP].
- **Slowed renal function decline**: Reduced annual eGFR decline (-0.55 vs -2.28 mL/min/1.73 m²/year; P < 0.001) [^11371Zhr].
- **Consistent benefits**: Regardless of diabetes status, age, or renal function [^113VrdGn] [^11371Zhr].

These benefits **outweigh the modest UTI risk**, making continuation the default unless infections are severe or refractory [^113KJpTn].

---

## Risk of urinary tract infections with empagliflozin

Empagliflozin increases UTI risk via glucosuria, but the **absolute risk is modest**:

- **UTI incidence**: 9.3% (10 mg) and 7.5% (25 mg) vs 8.2% with placebo in pooled trials [^notfound].
- **Discontinuation due to UTI**: Rare (0.1–0.2%) [^112BEkJ3].
- **Serious UTIs**: Pyelonephritis and urosepsis are rare but reported; monitor and treat promptly [^114NcY2t] [^114vLWKb].

Most UTIs are uncomplicated and manageable with standard care [^1172Lufc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines emphasize **individualized risk–benefit assessment**:

- **ACC/AHA 2024**: SGLT2 inhibitors are foundational in HFrEF; monitor for infections and treat promptly [^114vLWKb].
- **ESC 2021**: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death; use across HFrEF [^113Y5edZ].
- **VA/DoD 2023**: Consider tolerability, including recurrent genitourinary infections, but benefits generally outweigh risks [^115o2419].

These guidelines support **continuation unless infections are severe or refractory** [^1172Lufc].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting discontinuation

Discontinuation is reasonable in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Severe or complicated UTIs (pyelonephritis, urosepsis) | Life-threatening infections requiring immediate cessation and aggressive management [^114NcY2t] [^114vLWKb] |
| Recurrent UTIs despite optimal preventive measures | Persistent infections despite hygiene, hydration, and antibiotic prophylaxis |
| Patient preference or nonadherence | Significant quality-of-life impact or inability to adhere due to recurrent infections |

---

## Management strategies for recurrent UTIs in HFrEF patients on empagliflozin

Before discontinuing, **implement the following**:

- **Hygiene and hydration**: Emphasize perineal hygiene and adequate fluid intake [^117HNuYc].
- **Prompt antibiotic therapy**: Treat infections quickly to prevent complications [^114vLWKb].
- **Prophylactic antibiotics**: Consider for frequent recurrences after addressing modifiable risks [^notfound].
- **Temporary interruption**: Hold during active infection, then resume once resolved [^notfound].

These measures often **reduce recurrence** while preserving empagliflozin's benefits [^114vBwWc].

---

## Impact of discontinuation on cardiovascular outcomes

Discontinuing empagliflozin can **worsen outcomes**: withdrawal increases the risk of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization and accelerates renal decline, underscoring the need to resume therapy once infections resolve [^114vBwWc] [^111BMCp8].

---

## Alternative therapies

If empagliflozin is discontinued, **consider alternatives** with caution: other SGLT2 inhibitors have similar UTI risks, and alternatives like GLP-1 receptor agonists or DPP-4 inhibitors lack comparable HF benefits; individualized selection is essential [^115NBw4k] [^115o2419] [^113vjHGE].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Empagliflozin **should not be automatically discontinued** in HFrEF patients with recurrent UTIs. Its cardiovascular and renal benefits are substantial, and the UTI risk is modest and manageable [^11371Zhr] [^113Y5edZ]. Continue therapy and implement infection-prevention strategies; reserve discontinuation for severe or refractory infections. If stopped, plan to resume once the infection resolves to avoid losing cardiorenal protection [^113KJpTn] [^114vBwWc].

5.5	Volume Depletion

STEGLUJAN can cause intravascular volume contraction which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including STEGLUJAN. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)], elderly patients, patients with low systolic blood pressure, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating STEGLUJAN in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. In patients with volume depletion, correct this condition before initiating STEGLUJAN. Monitor for signs and symptoms of volume depletion, and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.6	Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections, including urosepsis and pyelonephritis, requiring hospitalization in patients receiving medicines containing SGLT2 inhibitors. Treatment with medicines containing SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.7	Heart Failure

An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of STEGLUJAN prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of STEGLUJAN.

The incidence of AEs, serious AEs and AEs leading to drug discontinuation increased with age in both treatment arms (Table 2). Within each age group, empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of AEs compared with placebo. Regarding AEs of specific interest in patients aged 75 or older, such as hypotension, hypoglycaemia, volume depletion, urinary tract infections, hypo‐ and hyperkalaemia, empagliflozin was not associated with an increase in these AEs compared with placebo.

Figure 2 — Practical guide for initiating SGLT2 inhibitors describes patient selection, intervention, and follow-up for type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease and eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2; high-priority features include ACR ≥ 200 mg/g [≥ 20 mg/mmol] and heart failure, and potential contraindications include genital infection risk, diabetic ketoacidosis, foot ulcers, and immunosuppression. SGLT2 inhibitor options with proven benefits are canagliflozin 100 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 10 mg, with education on sick day protocol, perioperative care, and foot care, and follow-up includes assessing adverse effects, reviewing knowledge, and anticipating an acute drop in eGFR, which is generally not a reason to stop the SGLT2 inhibitor. For glycemia, hypoglycemia risk factors include insulin or sulfonylurea use, history of severe hypoglycemia, and HbA1c at or below goal; if high, education includes hypoglycemia symptoms and glycemia monitoring and consider insulin/sulfonylurea dose reduction, with follow-up to ask about hypoglycemia and reduce sulfonylurea or insulin if needed. For volume, volume depletion risk factors include concurrent diuretic use, tenuous volume status, and history of AKI; if high, education includes volume depletion symptoms and consideration of diuretic dose reduction, with follow-up to re-assess volume and reduce concomitant diuretic if needed.

Sensitivity Analysis

According to the analysis excluding the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial, a similar pattern was observed for all the cardiovascular outcomes studied in the overall cohort and patients with diabetes (Tables S31). In patients with CKD, however, canagliflozin was associated with lower risk of hospitalizations for HF compared with empagliflozin (HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.54–0.95]). In patients without CKD, ertugliflozin was associated with higher risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalizations for heart failure than empagliflozin (HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.02–1.66]), and dapagliflozin was associated with higher risk of hospitalization for HF than empagliflozin (HR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.01–1.70]). The analysis excluding the VERTIS‐CV trial showed a similar result as the principal analyses (Tables S32).

Safety Outcomes

No significant differences between the SGLT2 inhibitors were observed in the risk of limb amputation, fractures, hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, UTI, and genital infections (Figures S5 through S10), whereas ertugliflozin and empagliflozin were associated with higher risks of orthostatic hypotension than canagliflozin (Figure S11). Empagliflozin was also associated with a higher risk of orthostatic hypotension than dapagliflozin.

Volume depletion was increased to a small extent by SGLT2i (Figure 4(A), OR: 1.18, FE p < .001, RE p = .0026), but acute kidney injury (AKI) was reduced by 25% (Figure 4(B), p < .001), with the latter effect expected to be highly reproducible given the narrow width of the prediction interval. Mycotic infections were increased to a large extent by SGLT2i (Figure 4(C), OR of 3.9, p < .0001 for both FE and RE), but urinary tract infections (UTI) to small degree (Figure 4(D), OR 1.08, FE p = .0217, RE p = .0651).

### Efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure: observational evidence in geriatric patients AGING-HF [^111bY2dJ]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown beneficial effects in heart failure (HF) management, but data on their use in geriatric populations with high comorbidity remain limited. This observational study aimed to assess the real-world efficacy and safety of SGLT2i in elderly patients with HF.

Methods

This prospective multicenter study included 496 patients hospitalized for acute heart failure across 3 geriatric units. The mean age was 90 years, and the mean Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 8.2. Participants were divided into 2 groups: the SGLT2i group (n = 260) receiving SGLT2i (empagliflozin or dapagliflozin) alongside standard HF treatment, and the Control group (n = 236) receiving only standard HF treatment. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, HF rehospitalizations, and adverse events over 1 year.

Results

SGLT2i use was associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.46–0.98]; P = 0.031), HF rehospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.42–0.97]; P = 0.037), and the composite outcome (hazard ratio, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.44–0.82]; P = 0.001) at 1 year, after multivariable adjustment. No significant interaction was observed between left ventricular ejection fraction status and SGLT2i use (P for interaction = 0.12). Although urinary and genital infections were more frequently reported in the SGLT2i group, treatment discontinuation remained low (2.7%).

Conclusions

In this elderly population with high comorbidity, SGLT2i therapy was associated with substantial reductions in mortality and HF rehospitalization, and showed good tolerability and an acceptable safety profile.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in older adults — SGLT2 inhibitors reduce HbA1c by ~0.8%, can reduce weight, and do not cause hypoglycemia; empagliflozin and canagliflozin have been shown to decrease major adverse cardiovascular events, heart failure, and the progression of CKD; these compounds cause an obligate increase in urine volume and an increase in urogenital candida infections, and because adverse effects related to volume depletion were more frequent in older patients treated with canagliflozin, recommendations limit the dosage to 100 mg/d in such patients.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) for kidney protection in T2D — An SGLT2i with proven kidney protection is recommended for people with T2D who have an eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m2; in those with HF, empagliflozin can be used with an eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and if eGFR drops below this level on treatment, the SGLT2i does not have to be stopped unless kidney replacement therapy is required. Recognized side effects are not greater at lower eGFR, initial reports of higher rates of lower extremity amputation with canagliflozin have not been substantiated, SGLT2is tend to lower serum potassium, and the risk of AKI is actually reduced by 25% with SGLT2i use in persons with T2D.

### Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin (Qtern) [^113vjHGE]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Heart Failure

In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), more patients randomized to saxagliptin (289/8280, 3.5%) were hospitalized for heart failure compared to patients randomized to placebo (228/8212, 2.8%). In a time-to-first-event analysis the risk of hospitalization for heart failure was higher in the saxagliptin group (estimated Hazard Ratio: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.51). Subjects with a prior history of heart failure and subjects with renal impairment had a higher risk for hospitalization for heart failure, irrespective of treatment assignment.

Consider the risks and benefits of QTERN prior to initiating treatment in patients at a higher risk of heart failure. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of QTERN.

5.4 Volume Depletion

Dapagliflozin can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating QTERN in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. QTERN is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.5 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)].

### Early initiation of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in acute heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116VoPQn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Acute heart failure (AHF) refers to rapid or gradual onset of symptoms or signs of heart failure (HF), severe enough to lead to an unplanned visit or intravenous treatment but, above all, hospital admission or an emergency department visit. Despite recent advances, AHF remains a leading global cause of hospitalizations and death and hence heavy organizational and financial burden on health care systems. Importantly, this burden is expected to growand has already had a strong negative impact on patients themselves, with an in‐hospital mortality rate from 5% to 10%, and postdischarge 1‐year mortality rate of 25% to 30%, urging improvement of specific management.

In this perspective, the recent surge of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) represented a major advancement, demonstrating unique efficacy across the whole spectrum of chronic HF in reducing recurrent hospitalizations and cardiovascular death, resulting in a class I recommendation for the baseline treatment of all patients with HF in both the 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America guidelines and the 2023 update of the 2021 European guidelines, regardless of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or the presence of diabetes. In settings of AHF, many novel specific treatments have been attempted without yielding significant improvements and showing even by contrast disappointing results on the mortality rate. Until recently, AHF usual initial management primarily consists of diuretic therapy and addressing specific triggers, while simultaneously initiating and uptitrating guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) as soon as possible.

Given the promising results of SGLT2is in chronic HF, several randomized controlled trials have sought to evaluate their relevance in AHF, demonstrating consistent efficacy in decongestion, albeit with limited evidence for survival improvement, and persistent concerns about the occurrence of adverse events such as acute kidney injury (AKI), ketoacidosis, or urinary tract infections, representing potential limitations to their early introduction, as highlighted in both American and European guidelines. However, many of these studies were not powered to study impactful end points such as all‐cause death or rehospitalization rates and may be subject to biases due to the small scale of patient populations or the limited number of participating centers.

Therefore, we conducted a pooled data meta‐analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of early initiation of SGLT2i add‐on therapy in patients hospitalized for AHF.

### Effect of empagliflozin on the clinical stability of patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction: the EMPEROR-reduced trial [^116JSDgy]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

In addition to the adjudication and characterization of hospitalizations for heart failure, at each scheduled study visit, patients were prospectively asked about interval events and changes in the use of diuretics that reflected the occurrence of worsening heart failure since the last visit. Events that were considered to reflect clinical deterioration included: (1) worsening heart failure that required the use of an intravenous drug for heart failure in an emergency department; (2) worsening heart failure that required the use of an intravenous drug for heart failure in an outpatient urgent care setting; (3) intensification of daily doses of diuretics for worsening symptoms; and (4) worsening NYHA functional class. Events treated in an emergency department, urgent care setting, or during a hospital stay shorter than that required for an adjudicated event were grouped together. Physicians were not provided any specific guidance as to the degree or duration of diuretic intensification that would qualify as representing a clinically meaningful change. Ascertainment of these events and measures were prospectively collected in the case report form, and their inclusion in analyses of individual and composite end points was prespecified before the blind of the trial was broken.

Statistical Analysis

For time-to-first-event analyses, differences between the placebo and empagliflozin groups were assessed for statistical significance using a Cox proportional hazards model, with prespecified covariates of age, sex, geographical region, diabetes status at baseline, left ventricular ejection fraction, and estimated glomerular filtration rate at baseline. For these analyses, the assumption of proportional hazards was investigated, and no violations were observed. For the analysis of total (first and repeated) events, between-group differences were assessed using a joint frailty model, with cardiovascular death (for end points including heart failure events) or all-cause mortality (for end points including all-cause hospitalization) as competing risks, and using covariates that were used for time-to-first-event analyses. For the analysis of changes in vital signs and laboratory measurements, treatment effects were assessed based on changes from baseline using a mixed model for repeated measures that included age and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate as linear covariates and baseline score by visit, visit by treatment, sex, region, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction, individual last projected visit based on dates of randomization and trial closure, and baseline diabetes status as fixed effects. The analysis of changes in NT-proBNP was performed on log-transformed data. All P values reported are 2-sided, and P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

### Safety, tolerability and effects on cardiometabolic risk factors of empagliflozin monotherapy in drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes: a double-blind extension of a phase III randomized controlled trial [^116vraZW]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2015). Low credibility.

During the extension trial, patients continued to receive diet and exercise counselling based on local recommendations. Patients who received rescue medication during the initial 24-week study and were still receiving it at the start of the extension study were to continue their rescue medication throughout the extension study. Rescue medication could be initiated during the extension trial if a patient had a confirmed plasma glucose level > 10 mmol/l after an overnight fast or HbA1c > 8%. The choice and dose of rescue medication were at the discretion of the investigator, except that DPP-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues were not permitted. In cases of hypoglycaemia, dose reduction or discontinuation of rescue medication was to be initiated. If hyper- or hypoglycaemia could not be controlled, the patient was to be discontinued from the trial.

Endpoints and assessments

The primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 was analyzed in the initial trial. No primary endpoint was defined for the extension study. Exploratory efficacy endpoints in the extension trial were change from baseline in HbA1c, FPG, body weight, SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at week 52 and week 76. Other exploratory endpoints were the percentage of patients who were treated in the extension trial and had HbA1c ≥ 7% at baseline who reached HbA1c < 7% at week 76 and the use of rescue therapy over 76 weeks. Baseline was defined as the last observed measurement before the first administration of study drug in the initial trial.

Safety was assessed through the reporting of adverse events [AEs; coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 16.0]. AEs of special interest included confirmed hypoglycaemic events (plasma glucose ≤ 3.9 mmol/l and/or requiring assistance) and AEs consistent with urinary tract infection (UTI), genital infection and volume depletion, which were identified using prospectively defined search categories based on 77, 89 and 8 MedDRA preferred terms, respectively. Changes from baseline in clinical laboratory values at week 76 were also assessed.

### The cardiovascular outcomes, heart failure and kidney disease trials tell that the time to use sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors is now [^117SaWyK]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Sodium glucose contrasporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) were initially introduced as a novel class of modestly effective antiglycemics. Over the last 5 years, multiple members of this class have been examined for their cardiovascular safety, effects on heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in diverse populations with or without diabetes type 2. The plethora of studies and outcomes examined make it difficult for the practitioner to track the entirety of the evidence. SGLT2i improve cardiorenal outcomes and have a beneficial risk benefit ratio across populations with cardiovascular disease, HFrEF and kidney disease. In this quantitative review, we synthesize the data from the large outcomes trials about the benefits and risks of SGLT2i. SGLT2i reduce all cause, cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, need for dialysis and acute kidney injury as a class effect across a broad range of populations with diabetes Type 2 at risk for cardiovascular disease, patients with HFrEF or CKD with or without diabetes. While certain adverse events for example, diabetic ketoacidosis and genital mycotic infections are reproducibly increased by SGLT2i, the absolute increase in the risk of these complications is smaller than the absolute risk reductions conferred by SGLT2i. Other complications such as amputations, fractures and urinary tract infections are increased to a lesser degree, or not at all (e.g. hypoglycemia). Overall, SGLT2is appear to have a favorable safety profile and thus should be used by cardiologists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, primary care physicians when managing the cardiorenal risk of their patients.

### Comparison of effectiveness among different sodium-glucose cotransoporter-2 inhibitors according to underlying conditions: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115NBw4k]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

To investigate the individual profile of each SGLT2 (sodium‐glucose cotransoporter‐2) inhibitor in patients with different backgrounds.

Methods and Results

This study included 21 placebo‐controlled randomized controlled trials with a total of 96 196 participants, investigating empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and sotagliflozin. The primary efficacy end point was the composite of cardiovascular death and hospitalizations for heart failure. The secondary efficacy end points were all‐cause death, cardiovascular death, hospitalizations for heart failure, kidney disease progression, and acute kidney injury. We conducted subgroup analyses based on the underlying comorbidities, including diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Safety end points were also assessed among SGLT2 inhibitors in the overall cohort. In the overall cohort, there were no significant differences in the primary efficacy outcome among the SGLT2 inhibitors, while empagliflozin (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.53–0.92]) and dapagliflozin (HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56–0.96]) were associated with lower risk of acute kidney injury than sotagliflozin. The presence or absence of diabetes did not alter the results. In patients with chronic kidney disease, there were no differences in the efficacy outcomes among SGLT2 inhibitors, while in patients without chronic kidney disease, empagliflozin was associated with lower risk of the primary outcome compared with ertugliflozin (HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.60–0.98]). For safety outcomes, no significant differences were observed in amputation, urinary tract infection, genital infection, hypoglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis.

Conclusions

The differences in reducing cardiovascular and kidney outcomes as well as safety profiles across SGLT2 inhibitors were not consistently significant, although empagliflozin might be preferred in patients without chronic kidney disease. Further investigations are needed to better understand the mechanism and clinical effectiveness of each SGLT2 inhibitor in certain populations.

### Comparative effectiveness of individual sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors [^113EgfQR]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Evidence on cardiovascular benefits and safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors is mainly from placebo-controlled trials. Therefore, the comparative effectiveness and safety of individual SGLT-2 inhibitors remain unknown.

Objective

To compare the use of canagliflozin or dapagliflozin with empagliflozin for a composite outcome (myocardial infarction [MI] or stroke), heart failure hospitalization, MI, stroke, all-cause death, and safety outcomes, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), lower-limb amputation, bone fracture, severe urinary tract infection (UTI), and genital infection and whether effects differed by dosage or cardiovascular disease (CVD) history.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This comparative effectiveness study using target trial emulation included adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using 3 US claims databases using data from August 2014 through June 2020. The study was conducted from August 2023 to July 2024, with a follow-up period of up to 8 years, and the analysis was completed in July 2024.

Exposures

First dispensing of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin without any use of SGLT-2 inhibitors during the prior 365 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Database-specific models were weighted using propensity score matching-weights to adjust for 129 confounders. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs for outcomes were estimated using weighted Cox proportional hazards models. HRs were pooled across databases using a fixed-effect meta-analysis.

Results

Across the databases, 232 890 patients receiving canagliflozin, 129 881 patients receiving dapagliflozin, and 295 043 patients receiving empagliflozin were identified. Compared with empagliflozin initiators, those receiving canagliflozin or dapagliflozin were less likely to have diabetes-related conditions or a history of CVD at baseline. For MI/stroke risk, both canagliflozin (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91–1.05) and dapagliflozin (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.89–1.03) were comparable to empagliflozin. For heart failure hospitalization, dapagliflozin initiators had a higher risk (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02–1.39), particularly at the low dose of 5 mg (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.12–1.50). These findings were consistent across subgroups of CVD history. For safety events, compared with empagliflozin, canagliflozin initiators had a lower risk of genital infections (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91–0.97) but a higher risk of severe UTIs (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03–1.24), and dapagliflozin initiators had lower risks of genital infections (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89–0.95) and DKA (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68–0.90).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that individual SGLT-2 inhibitors demonstrated comparable cardiovascular effectiveness at clinically effective doses, though low-dose dapagliflozin showed a reduced benefit for heart failure hospitalization compared with empagliflozin.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and atrial fibrillation in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review with meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials [^115AJwC5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall, SGLT2 inhibitors are well tolerated and generally safe agents. Because of the higher levels of urine glucose caused by the glycosidic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors, relatively high prevalence of urinary tract infections was noted in our analysis. Of note, in the present study the effect of dapagliflozin on urinary tract infections was more manifest than that of empagliflozin or canagliflozin. The same conclusion was also drawn in the meta-analysis by Liu et al. who elucidated that dapagliflozin alone is related to a significantly higher risk for urinary tract infections. However, such infections are easy to manage and rarely recur. Additionally, initial concerns on safety signals for cerebrovascular risk were not supported in the present analysis. The drug effect on myocardial infarction is still a topic of meaningful investigation.

The data presented herein indicated that SGLT2 inhibitors should be considered in populations with type 2 diabetes for AF/AFL prevention, given that they safely reduced HbA1c, body weight, and blood pressure and widely reduced the risk of HF across the spectrum of these patients. These risk factors did not modify AF/AFL reductions. Moreover, such effects appeared to be more evident with longer durations of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. Reductions in all-cause mortality could also be expected, which slightly differed in magnitude based on baseline age characteristics, but were present throughout the age range. Patients with diabetes are a particularly susceptible population at increased risk of AF/AFL and HF. A considerable body of large-scale placebo-controlled trials in populations with type 2 diabetes are needed to clarify whether SGLT2 inhibitors exhibit beneficial effects in reducing AF/AFL.

Although this meta-analysis provides the first evidence for a favourable effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on reducing AF/AFL risk, several limitations in our work should be emphasized. First, several small-sized studies did not report AF outcomes. However, the results of our meta-analysis are expected to be statistically stable and robust based on the large sample size. Second, the data that we used lacks information at the individual level, and we failed to identify new and recurrent AF/AFL. Even though we have identified the specific AF/AFL-reduction benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors, further investigations are required to explore the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in both new and recurrent AF/AFL. Third, each patient in the included studies was given background hypoglycaemic therapy, which may influence cardiovascular outcomes to some extent. The results of our work showed that patients with type 2 diabetes had reductions in AF/AFL incidence from the addition of SGLT2 inhibitors to guideline-directed medical therapy.

SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1-RAs — implementation considerations include that potential risks of SGLT2 inhibitors are described as generally infrequent or rare (eg, urinary tract infection, diabetic ketoacidosis, amputation), that there needs to be a continuous effort to change the language so these agents are recognized as cardiorenal metabolic agents rather than solely glucose-lowering medications, and that communications to frontline practicing physicians should address concerns including drug safety, use in the elderly, and use in renal impairment.

### Comparison of effectiveness among different sodium-glucose cotransoporter-2 inhibitors according to underlying conditions: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113VrdGn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

SGLT2 (sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2) inhibitors were initially introduced as a class of antihyperglycemic medications for patients with diabetes. In addition to their fundamental role as diabetic agents, such as lowering glycated hemoglobin, body weight, and blood pressure, they have demonstrated promising effects in reducing cardiovascular and renal outcomes among patients with diabetes across numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs).,

Furthermore, a growing body of evidence shows that SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce cardiovascular and renal events regardless of the presence of diabetes, baseline kidney function, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Recent meta‐analyses of large RCTs showed the consistent effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in reducing the risks of composite renal outcome, acute kidney injury (AKI), the composite of cardiovascular death and hospitalizations for heart failure (HF), cardiovascular death, all‐cause death, and hospitalizations for HF across the included population. These findings supported the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HF or chronic kidney disease (CKD), irrespective of the diabetic status or the kidney disease causes.

Nonetheless, because the existing RCTs compared SGLT2 inhibitors with placebo, the hierarchical assessment of superiority among SGLT2 inhibitors has not yet been ascertained. Limited data from a retrospective cohort study suggested that dapagliflozin, compared with empagliflozin, was associated with lower risk of HF in patients with diabetes. Although a few network meta‐analyses reported almost similar efficacy profiles across SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiorenal outcomes in patients with or without diabetes and those with CKD or HF, comprehensive assessments according to various patient backgrounds are yet to be determined.

Moreover, it is essential to consider the safety profile of each SGLT2 inhibitor when selecting a specific agent within the class. However, proper selection remains uncertain without the comparative safety evidence. Because adverse events of SGLT2 inhibitors, such as genital infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), and hypovolemia, can lead to treatment discontinuation, the comparative safety profiles should be investigated.

To address these important knowledge gaps, in this network meta‐analysis, we aimed to pool various populations (ie, with or without diabetes, with or without CKD, and HF phenotype: HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF] or HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]) from previous RCTs and indirectly compare the efficacy and safety of each SGLT2 inhibitor, with potential important clinical implications in specific agent selection according to diabetes, CKD, or HF phenotypes.

### Empagliflozin and cardiovascular and kidney outcomes across KDIGO risk categories: analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial [^112V86o4]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

In the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG Outcome), empagliflozin, in addition to standard of care, significantly reduced risk of cardiovascular death by 38%, hospitalization for heart failure by 35%, and incident or worsening nephropathy by 39% compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Using EMPA-REG Outcome data, we assessed whether the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD classification had an influence on the treatment effect of empagliflozin.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Patients with type 2 diabetes, established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard of care. Post hoc, we analyzed cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, and safety, using the two-dimensional KDIGO classification framework.

Results

Of 6952 patients with baseline eGFR and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio values, 47%, 29%, 15%, and 8% were classified into low, moderately increased, high, and very high KDIGO risk categories, respectively. Empagliflozin showed consistent risk reductions across KDIGO categories for cardiovascular outcomes (P values for treatment by subgroup interactions ranged from 0.26 to 0.85) and kidney outcomes (P values for treatment by subgroup interactions ranged from 0.16 to 0.60). In all KDIGO risk categories, placebo and empagliflozin had similar adverse event rates, the notable exception being genital infection events, which were more common with empagliflozin for each category.

Conclusions

The observed effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes were consistent across the KDIGO risk categories, indicating that the effect of treatment benefit of empagliflozin was unaffected by baseline CKD status.

Other Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials for Glycemic Control in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Genital Mycotic Infections: In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults, the incidence of genital mycotic infections (e.g., vaginal mycotic infection, vaginal infection, genital infection fungal, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and vulvitis) was increased in patients treated with JARDIANCE compared to placebo, occurring in 0.9%, 4.1%, and 3.7% of patients randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively. Discontinuation from trial due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with either JARDIANCE 10 mg or 25 mg.

Genital mycotic infections occurred more frequently in female than male patients (see Table 2).

Phimosis occurred more frequently in male patients treated with JARDIANCE 10 mg (less than 0.1%) and JARDIANCE 25 mg (0.1%) than placebo (0%).
Urinary Tract Infections: In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults, the incidence of urinary tract infections (e.g., urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and cystitis) was increased in patients treated with JARDIANCE compared to placebo (see Table 2). Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections were more likely to experience a urinary tract infection. The rate of treatment discontinuation due to urinary tract infections was 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.1% for placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively.

Urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in female patients. The incidence of urinary tract infections in female patients randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg was 16.6%, 18.4%, and 17.0%, respectively.

Results

Patients

A total of 7020 patients at 590 sites in 42 countries received at least one dose of study drug. The baseline characteristics of the study population, including medications used at baseline, have been described. Mean (SD) age was 63.1 (8.6) years, mean (SD) body mass index was 30.6 (5.3) kg/m 2, 72% were male, 25.9% had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, 46.6% had a history of myocardial infarction, 10.1% had heart failure, and 5.5% had atrial fibrillation. At baseline, ∼81% of patients were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers, 65% on β-blockers, 43% on diuretics, and 6% on mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Patient disposition in this trial has been described. Overall, 97% of patients completed the study, with 25% of patients prematurely discontinuing study drug. In both treatment groups, the most common reason for premature discontinuation of study medication was adverse events. The median duration of treatment was 2.6 years and the median observation time was 3.1 years. Final vital status was available for 99% of patients.

### Blinded withdrawal of long-term randomized treatment with empagliflozin or placebo in patients with heart failure [^114vBwWc]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

It is not known whether the benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in heart failure persist after years of therapy.

Methods

In the EMPEROR-Reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trials in Chronic Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction) and EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome Trials in Chronic Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) trials, patients with heart failure were randomly assigned (double-blind) to placebo or empagliflozin 10 mg/day for a median of 16 and 26 months, respectively. At the end of the trials, 6799 patients (placebo 3381, empagliflozin 3418) were prospectively withdrawn from treatment in a blinded manner, and, of these, 3981 patients (placebo 2020, empagliflozin 1961) underwent prespecified in-person assessments after ≈30 days off treatment.

Results

From 90 days from the start of closeout to the end of double-blind treatment, the annualized risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure was lower in empagliflozin-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (10.7 [95% CI, 9.0–12.6] versus 13.5 [95% CI, 11.5–15.6] events per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.76 [95% CI, 0.60–0.96]). When the study drugs were withdrawn for ≈30 days, the annualized risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure increased in patients withdrawn from empagliflozin but not in those withdrawn from placebo (17.0 [95% CI, 12.6–22.1] versus 14.1 [95% CI, 10.1–18.8] events per 100 patient-years for empagliflozin and placebo, respectively). The hazard ratio for the change in risk in the patients withdrawn from empagliflozin was 1.75 (95% CI, 1.20–2.54), P = 0.0034, whereas the change in the risk in patients withdrawn from placebo was not significant (hazard ratio 1.12 [95% CI, 0.76–1.66]); time period-by-treatment interaction, P = 0.068. After withdrawal, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score declined by 1.6 ± 0.4 in patients withdrawn from empagliflozin versus placebo (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, withdrawal of empagliflozin was accompanied by increases in fasting glucose, body weight, systolic blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, N-terminal pro-hormone B-type natriuretic peptide, uric acid, and serum bicarbonate and decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (all P < 0.01). These physiological and laboratory changes were the inverse of the effects of the drug seen at the start of the trials during the initiation of treatment (≈1–3 years earlier) in the same cohort of patients.

Conclusions

These observations demonstrate a persistent effect of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure even after years of treatment, which dissipated rapidly after withdrawal of the drug.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) exposure and outcomes in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review of population-based observational studies [^113NyFEm]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and more recently for heart failure with or without diabetes. They have been shown to be safe (from the cardiovascular (CV) perspective) and effective (in terms of glycaemia, and in some cases, in reducing CV events) in extensive randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, there remain concerns regarding the generalisability of these findings (to those ineligible for RCT participation) and about non-CV safety. For effectiveness, population-based pharmacoepidemiology studies can confirm and extend the findings of RCTs to broader populations and explore safety, for which RCTs are not usually powered, in more detail.

Methods

A pre-planned and registered ((International PROSPEctive Register Of Systematic Reviews) PROSPERO registration CRD42019160792) systematic review of population-based studies investigating SGLT2i effectiveness and safety, following Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines was conducted.

Results

A total of 37 studies were identified (total n = 1,300,184 adults; total follow-up 910,577 person-years; exposures: SGLT2i class, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) exploring CV disease (CVD) outcomes, acute kidney injury (AKI), lower limb amputation (LLA), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), bone fracture, urinary tract infection (UTI), genital mycotic infection (GMI), hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis and venous thromboembolism. For CV and mortality outcomes, studies confirmed the associated safety of these drugs and correlated closely with the findings from RCTs, which may extend to primary CVD prevention (major adverse cardiovascular events point estimate range (PER) hazard ratio (HR) 0.78–0.94; hospitalised heart failure PER HR 0.48–0.79). For safety outcomes, SGLT2i exposure was not associated with an increased risk of AKI (PER HR 0.40–0.96), fractures (PER HR 0.87–1.11), hypoglycaemia (PER HR 0.76–2.49) or UTI (PER HR 0.72–0.98). There was a signal for increased association for GMIs (PER HR 2.08–3.15), and possibly for LLA (PER HR 0.74–2.79) and DKA (PER HR 0.96–2.14), but with considerable uncertainty.

Conclusion

In T2D, SGLT2is appear safe from the CV perspective and may have associated benefit in primary as well as secondary CVD prevention. For safety, they may be associated with an increased risk of GMI, LLA and DKA, although longer follow-up studies are needed.

14.4 Heart Failure Trials in Adults

EMPEROR-Reduced (NCT03057977) was a double-blind trial conducted in adults with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class II-IV) with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% to evaluate the efficacy of JARDIANCE as adjunct to standard of care heart failure therapy.

Of 3,730 patients, 1,863 were randomized to JARDIANCE 10 mg and 1,867 to placebo and were followed for a median of 16 months. The mean age of the trial population was 67 years (range: 25 to 94 years) and 76% were men, 24% were women, and 27% were 75 years of age or older. Approximately 71% of the trial population were White, 18% Asian, and 7% Black or African American. At baseline, 50% of the patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus.

At randomization, 75% of patients were NYHA class II, 24% were class III, and 0.5% were class IV. The mean LVEF was 28%. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 62 mL/min/1.73 m2and the median urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) was 22 mg/g. Approximately half of the patients (52%) had eGFR equal to or above 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 24% had eGFR 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 19% had eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 5% had eGFR 20 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Echocardiography parameters (Table 3 and Fig. 3)

Two patients (6%) had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and 33 patients (94%) had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Although LVDd did not change significantly, LVDs was significantly decreased after 6 and 12 months of canagliflozin treatment compared with baseline (6 months: p = 0.027, 12 months: p = 0.016). EF displayed a significant increase at 12 months relative to baseline and 6 months (baseline: p = 0.005, 6 months: p = 0.023), while the E/e′ ratio was significantly decreased at 6 and 12 months versus baseline (both p < 0.001). Finally, LVMI was significantly decreased after 6 and 12 months of treatment compared with baseline (6 months: p = 0.003, 12 months: p < 0.001), and also showed a significant decrease at 12 months relative to 6 months (p = 0.028).

Adverse reactions

During the treatment period, there were no adverse events such as hypoglycemia, aggravation of diabetes, dehydration, worsening of heart failure, urinary tract infection, or lower extremity amputation. Three patients had mild lower limb edema and furosemide was discontinued in 4 patients (at 2 months in 2 patients and at 4 months in 2 patients). Antihypertensive drugs were discontinued in 4 patients (Ca antagonists in 1 patient at 5 months and in 3 patients at 6 months; renin inhibitor in 1 patient at 4 months), while β-blockers were discontinued in 3 patients due to a decrease of the heart rate (1 patient at 3 months and 2 patients at 4 months).

### The current role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus management [^1139vHCq]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic, complex metabolic disease characterized by chronic hyperglycemia causing from insufficient insulin signaling because of insulin resistance or defective insulin secretion, and may induce severe complications and premature death. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are oral drugs used to reduce hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM, including empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, dapagliflozin and canagliflozin. The primary objective of this article is to examine the clinical benefit, safety, and tolerability of the four SGLT2 inhibitors approved by the US FDA. SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion via inhibiting SGLT2 to decrease renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and reduce the renal threshold for glucose. Rather than stimulating insulin release, SGLT2 inhibitors improve β-cell function by improving glucotoxicity, as well as reduce insulin resistance and increase insulin sensitivity. Early clinical trials have confirmed the beneficial effects of SGLT2 in T2DM with acceptable safety and excellent tolerability. In recent years, SGLT2 inhibitors has been successively approved by the FDA to decrease cardiovascular death and decrease the risk of stroke and cardiac attack in T2DM adults who have been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, treating heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction, and treat diabetic kidney disease (DKD), decrease the risk of hospitalization for HF in T2DM and DKD patients. SGLT2 inhibitors are expected to be an effective treatment for T2DM patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease. SGLT2 inhibitors have a similar safety profile to placebo or other active control groups, with major adverse events such as Ketoacidosis or hypotension and genital or urinary tract infections.

### Urinary tract infection and continuation of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in diabetic patients [^111BMCp8]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

To investigate the impact of incident urinary tract infection (UTI) and subsequent sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors discontinuation on clinical outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors.

Methods

This territory-wide cohort study analysed patients with T2DM prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors from January 2015 to June 2022. Primary outcomes included primary cardiovascular composite outcomes (heart failure hospitalization, stroke, myocardial infarction, or all-cause mortality) and primary renal composite outcomes (50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], end-stage renal failure, or all-cause mortality). The secondary outcome was recurrent UTI. A target trial emulation was applied to estimate the impact of discontinuing SGLT2 inhibitors.

Results

Among 61 606 eligible patients, 3921 (6.36%) had at least one UTI incidence during follow-up. Patients with incident UTI exhibited a higher risk of primary cardiovascular composite outcomes [hazards ratio (HR): 3.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.88–3.51] and primary renal composite outcomes (HR: 2.51, 95% CI: 2.32–2.72) compared to those without UTI. Following a UTI, 32.31% of patients discontinued SGLT2 inhibitors. Discontinuation was associated with a higher cardiovascular (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.20–1.53) and renal (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.21–1.51) risks compared to continued use, while the risk of recurrent UTI was similar (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.22–4.29).

Conclusions

New-onset UTI was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and renal events in patients with T2DM prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors. Discontinuing SGLT2 inhibitors after a UTI was linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes but was not associated with fewer recurrent UTI.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors and severe urinary tract infections: real-world meta-analysis of cohort studies [^116v7hYc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This real-world study provides insights into the FDA's 2015 communication regarding SGLT2i and severe urinary tract infections, indicating that SGLT2i does not appear to increase the risk of severe UTIs compared with other glucose-lowering therapies. This is important as SGLT2i is considered by the ADA as the preferred treatment for T2DM, providing significant improvements in cardiovascular health compared with older-generation glucose-lowering medications.

The findings have important clinical implications, reassuring physicians and reducing treatment discontinuation after a severe UTI event, ultimately enhancing adherence, particularly for patients on the low-risk end. Also, it facilitates the assessment of benefits and risks for prescribing SGLT2i to CKD patients in greater need of its protective effects and enhances guideline implementation.

Unlike older-generation glucose-lowering therapies, SGLT2i effectively and preferably treats T2DM while providing cardioprotective benefits that may prevent decompensation during acute events. They may also have immunomodulatory effects, potentially explaining the reduced association in CKD.

As adverse events are a common reason for non-adherence, improving this aspect could help reduce the need for exogenous insulin, lower hospitalization rates, and decrease overall mortality.

Study visits and follow‐up

After provision of informed consent, Visit 1 starts a 14 ± 7 day enrolment period during which the trial inclusion and exclusion criteria are checked and baseline information is collected (including from clinical examination and laboratory measurements). Visit 2 is the randomization visit at which further assessments are conducted (Figure 1 and online supplementary Table S1) and study drug is dispensed. Visit 3 takes place 14 ± 3 days and Visit 4 60 ± 7 days after randomization, with a particular focus on assessment of heart failure and volume status, adverse events, and checking blood chemistry (including renal function and potassium). Further visits take place at 120 ± 7, 240 ± 14, 360 ± 14 days and 4 monthly thereafter. The schedule of assessments is shown in the online supplementary Table S1.

Study drug dose reduction/discontinuation

Study drug should be permanently discontinued if pregnancy or diabetic ketoacidosis occur. Dose reduction (to dapagliflozin 5 mg daily or matching placebo) or temporary discontinuation may be considered in cases of acute, unexpected, declines in eGFR (while investigating other causes such as nephrotoxic drugs, urinary tract infection, or obstruction). Similarly, in cases of volume depletion and/or hypotension, alternative causes should be considered (e.g. gastrointestinal fluid loss, use of non‐essential blood pressure‐lowering drugs) and the dose of concomitant diuretic therapy re‐assessed and reduced, if appropriate. Temporary interruption of study drug may also be considered, prophylactically, in patients at potential risk of volume contraction/hypotension, such as patients with an acute medical illness potentially causing volume depletion because of inadequate fluid intake or fluid/blood losses (e.g. gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage), or patients undergoing major surgery.

The dose of evidence‐based, life‐saving, heart failure therapies should not be reduced just to maintain treatment with study drug. If possible, the dose of study drug should be increased again if the adverse effect is resolved. Even if study drug is discontinued, investigators are asked to ensure that scheduled study visits, follow‐up procedures and data collection continue according to the study protocol until study closure.

### Empagliflozin: role in treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114yi7sf]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Empagliflozin is an oral treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Recently, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study has shown that empagliflozin added to standard of care treatment reduced the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with T2DM who were also at increased CV risk. The risk of major adverse CV events (MACE: first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) was reduced by 14% relative to placebo (HR 0.86; 95.02% CI: 0.74–0.99; P = 0.04 for superiority). The risk of CV death was reduced by 38% relative to the placebo group (HR 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49–0.77; P < 0.001) and the risk of death from any cause by 32% (HR 0.68; 95% CI: 0.57–0.82; P < 0.001). Furthermore, empagliflozin was associated with reduced risk of hospitalization for heart failure and of renal adverse events. As well as EMPA-REG OUTCOME, empagliflozin has been studied in a number of clinical trials in patients with T2DM, in various combinations, including with insulin. Empagliflozin has shown significant improvements in glycemic control, body weight, and blood pressure, albeit improvements are limited in patients with declining renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2). Empagliflozin has been generally well tolerated, with the typical adverse events of genital mycotic infections usually being straightforward to manage. Considering all the data together, empagliflozin appears to be a promising option for many patients with T2DM, but care will still be needed to ensure that use is appropriate for an individual patient's characteristics.

UTI events after 24 weeks were reported in 8.3–10.3% of empagliflozin patients versus 8.0% of those on placebo, and the rates of genital infection events were 2.3–2.7% for empagliflozin and 0.9% for placebo. A pooled analysis of safety data from four 24-week phase 3 trials (n = 2,477) examined the effect of empagliflozin on UTIs and genital infections. The percentage of patients with events consistent with a UTI was similar across all groups (7.5% and 9.3% for empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, vs. 8.2% for placebo); however, more patients receiving empagliflozin reported events consistent with genital infection (4.2% and 3.6% for empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, vs. 0.7% for placebo). Both types of event were more common in women than in men, and were more common in patients with a history of UTI or genital infection. Nevertheless, of those who reported events consistent with UTI or genital infection, most experienced only one episode; the episodes were generally mild in severity, and very few led to study discontinuation [4 cases of UTI (placebo: 1 case; empagliflozin: 2 cases, 10 mg and 1 case, 25 mg); 3 cases of genital infection (empagliflozin: 1 case, 10 mg; 2 cases, 25 mg)].

In the CANVAS programme, 10 142 T2DM patients were randomly allocated to canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg/day or placebo. Canagliflozin was associated with a significant doubling in the risk for amputations, mainly toe and metatarsal amputations (6.3 versus 3.4 cases per 1000 patient-years, HR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.41–2.75). The risk was similar for ischaemic and infective aetiologies and for 100 and 300 mg doses. Overall amputation risk was strongly associated with baseline history of prior amputation (major or minor) (HR = 21.31, 95% CI 15.40–29.49) and other established risk factors. No interactions between randomized treatment and participant characteristics explained the effect of canagliflozin on amputation risk. For every clinical subgroup studied, numbers of amputation events projected were smaller than the numbers of MACE averted (HR = 1.97). Additionally, no differences in the incidence of amputations were observed in the CREDENCE RCT in patients with DKD randomized to 100 mg/day canagliflozin. Interestingly, when CREDENCE was started the amputations warning regarding the CANVAS study was already released, and investigators were aware of this ADR. However, no differences regarding baseline peripheral artery disease between the two studies were observed. In the DECLARE study, comparing dapagliflozin versus placebo added to standard care in 17 160 patients followed for a median of 4.2 years, there were no differences in the incidence of amputations, stroke or fractures, with a significant increase of UTI or genital infections and DKA. Moreover, there was a lower risk of hypoglycaemia, AKI and bladder cancer in the dapagliflozin-treated group (Supplementary data, Tables S1 and S2). To clarify whether the amputation risk could be a class effect of SGLT2i, a thorough collection of prospective data on amputations and other foot-related complications is required in all ongoing and future long-term randomized clinical trials (e.g. DAPA-CKD, Dapagliflozin in Patients with Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction (DAPA-HF) and DECLARE with dapagliflozin; EMPagliflozin outcomE tRial in Patients With chrOnic heaRt Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR-Preserved) and EMPagliflozin outcomE tRial in Patients With chrOnic heaRt Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR-Reduced); and Cardiovascular Outcomes Following Ertugliflozin Treatment in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Participants With Vascular Disease (VERTIS CV) with ertugliflozin).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115o2419]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus with heart failure — SGLT-2 inhibitors to prevent hospitalization: For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure, we recommend a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor to prevent hospital admissions for heart failure. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation, categorized it as Reviewed, New-added, stated that the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was high, and found that the benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) for patients with T2DM and HF outweighed the potential harm. Guideline-directed medical therapy includes SGLT-2 inhibitors as part of an initial "four pillar" approach for patients with heart failure along with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, beta blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and adding an SGLT-2 inhibitor to a regimen in a patient already achieving glycemic goals might require de-escalation of other medications to limit the risk of hypoglycemia. Evidence cited notes empagliflozin has been shown effective in patients with reduced and preserved ejection fraction and that dapagliflozin similarly reduced the rate of heart failure outcomes, while some systematic reviews suggest that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) might also reduce HHF but the overall impact on HHF is likely minimal without albiglutide, which is no longer marketed in the U.S. Implementation should consider patient factors and tolerability described here, including urinary frequency (especially with coexisting bladder or prostate conditions), a history of recurrent or severe genitourinary infections, and in older patients on other antihypertensives or diuretics or those with systolic heart failure the possibility of symptomatic hypotension or volume depletion that might require de-escalation or discontinuation of therapy.

### Effect of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction [^112dvYaQ]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

No therapy has shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure across the entire range of ejection fractions seen in clinical practice. We assessed the influence of ejection fraction on the effect of the sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin on heart failure outcomes.

Methods and results

A pooled analysis was performed on both the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved trials (9718 patients; 4860 empagliflozin and 4858 placebo), and patients were grouped based on ejection fraction: < 25% (n = 999), 25–34% (n = 2230), 35–44% (n = 1272), 45–54% (n = 2260), 55–64% (n = 2092), and ≥ 65% (n = 865). Outcomes assessed included (i) time to first hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular mortality, (ii) time to first heart failure hospitalization, (iii) total (first and recurrent) hospitalizations for heart failure, and (iv) health status assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). The risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure declined progressively as ejection fraction increased from < 25% to ≥ 65%. Empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization, mainly by reducing heart failure hospitalizations. Empagliflozin reduced the risk of heart failure hospitalization by ≈30% in all ejection fraction subgroups, with an attenuated effect in patients with an ejection fraction ≥ 65%. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were: ejection fraction < 25%: 0.73 (0.55–0.96); ejection fraction 25–34%: 0.63 (0.50–0.78); ejection fraction 35–44%: 0.72 (0.52–0.98); ejection fraction 45–54%: 0.66 (0.50–0.86); ejection fraction 55–64%: 0.70 (0.53–0.92); and ejection fraction ≥ 65%: 1.05 (0.70–1.58). Other heart failure outcomes and measures, including KCCQ, showed a similar response pattern. Sex did not influence the responses to empagliflozin.

Conclusion

The magnitude of the effect of empagliflozin on heart failure outcomes was clinically meaningful and similar in patients with ejection fractions < 25% to < 65%, but was attenuated in patients with an ejection fraction ≥ 65%.

Key Question

How does ejection fraction influence the effects of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure and either a reduced or a preserved ejection fraction?

Key Finding

The magnitude of the effect of empagliflozin on heart failure outcomes and health status was similar in patients with ejection fractions < 25% to < 65%, but it was attenuated in patients with an ejection fraction ≥ 65%.

Take Home Message

The consistency of the response in patients with ejection fractions of < 25% to < 65% distinguishes the effects of empagliflozin from other drugs that have been evaluated across the full spectrum of ejection fractions in patients with heart failure.

### Empagliflozin and risk of lower respiratory tract infection in heart failure with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction: an EMPEROR-preserved analysis [^116eFyKw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are common worldwide. Patients with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (HFmrEF/HFpEF) have a high risk of developing LRTI. Prior studies were able to show that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors may reduce the incidence of LRTI in patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate patient characteristics and prognosis according to LRTI status and to assess the effect of empagliflozin on LRTI in 5988 patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF enrolled in the EMPEROR-Preserved trial randomized to either empagliflozin or placebo over a median follow-up of 26months.

Methods and Results

Time-updated models were used to study the mortality risk after a LRTI. Cox regression was used to study the effect of empagliflozin on incident LRTI. Throughout the follow-up, 699 of 5988 (11.7%) patients developed LRTI: these were older, were more frequently hospitalized within the previous year, had type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and had higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels than patients without incident LRTI. Patients who developed LRTI had a 2.7-fold higher risk of subsequent mortality compared to patients without LRTI. The incidence of LRTI was 5.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.6–5.8) events per 100 person-years in the empagliflozin group and 6.2 (95% CI 5.6–6.9) events per 100 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.71–0.96, p = 0.014). The total number of LRTI events was reduced in the empagliflozin group (incidence rate ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.68–0.94, p = 0.008). No effect of empagliflozin was observed on COVID-19 incidence.

Conclusion

In EMPEROR-Preserved, LRTI was frequent and associated with a poor prognosis. Empagliflozin was associated with a reduced risk of LRTI compared to placebo.

Outcomes assessed included (i) time to first hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular mortality, (ii) time to first heart failure hospitalization, (iii) total (first and recurrent) hospitalizations for heart failure, and (iv) health status assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). The risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure declined progressively as ejection fraction increased from < 25% to ≥ 65%. Empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization, mainly by reducing heart failure hospitalizations. Empagliflozin reduced the risk of heart failure hospitalization by ≈30% in all ejection fraction subgroups, with an attenuated effect in patients with an ejection fraction ≥ 65%. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were: ejection fraction < 25%: 0.73 (0.55–0.96); ejection fraction 25–34%: 0.63 (0.50–0.78); ejection fraction 35–44%: 0.72 (0.52–0.98); ejection fraction 45–54%: 0.66 (0.50–0.86); ejection fraction 55–64%: 0.70 (0.53–0.92); and ejection fraction ≥ 65%: 1.05 (0.70–1.58). Other heart failure outcomes and measures, including KCCQ, showed a similar response pattern. Sex did not influence the responses to empagliflozin.

Conclusion

The magnitude of the effect of empagliflozin on heart failure outcomes was clinically meaningful and similar in patients with ejection fractions < 25% to < 65%, but was attenuated in patients with an ejection fraction ≥ 65%.

Key Question

How does ejection fraction influence the effects of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure and either a reduced or a preserved ejection fraction?

Key Finding

The magnitude of the effect of empagliflozin on heart failure outcomes and health status was similar in patients with ejection fractions < 25% to < 65%, but it was attenuated in patients with an ejection fraction ≥ 65%.

Take Home Message

The consistency of the response in patients with ejection fractions of < 25% to < 65% distinguishes the effects of empagliflozin from other drugs that have been evaluated across the full spectrum of ejection fractions in patients with heart failure.

### Interplay of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and empagliflozin in heart Failure: EMPEROR-reduced [^113QVYMs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors favorably influence the clinical course of patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.

Objectives

This study sought to study the mutual influence of empagliflozin and MRAs in EMPEROR-Reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction).

Methods

Secondary analysis that compared the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo in 3,730 patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, of whom 71% used MRAs at randomization.

Results

The effects of empagliflozin on the primary endpoint, on most efficacy endpoints, and on safety were similar in patients receiving or not receiving an MRA (interaction p > 0.20). For cardiovascular death, the hazard ratios for the effect of empagliflozin versus placebo were 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65 to 1.05) in MRA users and 1.19 (95% CI: 0.82 to 1.71) in MRA nonusers (interaction p = 0.10); a similar pattern was seen for all-cause mortality (interaction p = 0.098). Among MRA nonusers at baseline, patients in the empagliflozin group were 35% less likely than those in the placebo group to initiate treatment with an MRA following randomization (hazard ratio: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.85). Among MRA users at baseline, patients in the empagliflozin group were 22% less likely than those in the placebo group to discontinue treatment with an MRA following randomization (hazard ratio: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.96). Severe hyperkalemia was less common in the empagliflozin group.

Conclusions

In EMPEROR-Reduced, the use of MRAs did not influence the effect of empagliflozin to reduce adverse heart failure and renal outcomes. Treatment with empagliflozin was associated with less discontinuation of MRAs.

### The cardiovascular outcomes, heart failure and kidney disease trials tell that the time to use sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors is now [^114Qrwpp]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Sodium glucose contrasporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) were initially introduced as a novel class of modestly effective antiglycemics. Over the last 5years, multiple members of this class have been examined for their cardiovascular safety, effects on heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in diverse populations with or without diabetes type 2. The plethora of studies and outcomes examined make it difficult for the practitioner to track the entirety of the evidence. SGLT2i improve cardiorenal outcomes and have a beneficial risk benefit ratio across populations with cardiovascular disease, HFrEF and kidney disease. In this quantitative review, we synthesize the data from the large outcomes trials about the benefits and risks of SGLT2i. SGLT2i reduce all cause, cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, need for dialysis and acute kidney injury as a class effect across a broad range of populations with diabetes Type 2 at risk for cardiovascular disease, patients with HFrEF or CKD with or without diabetes. While certain adverse events for example, diabetic ketoacidosis and genital mycotic infections are reproducibly increased by SGLT2i, the absolute increase in the risk of these complications is smaller than the absolute risk reductions conferred by SGLT2i. Other complications such as amputations, fractures and urinary tract infections are increased to a lesser degree, or not at all (e.g., hypoglycemia). Overall, SGLT2is appear to have a favorable safety profile and thus should be used by cardiologists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, primary care physicians when managing the cardiorenal risk of their patients.

### The effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists on cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes [^1156okCA]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

In 2008, the US FDA suggested that new antidiabetic therapies be evaluated for associated alterations of cardiovascular risk, given concerns that specific glucose‐lowering drugs might worsen cardiovascular outcomes (CVOs). 24, 25 Empagliflozin was the first novel SGLT‐2 inhibitor with results on cardiovascular outcomes. The EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial (Table 1), which randomized patients to receive 10 mg empagliflozin, 25 mg empagliflozin, or placebo once daily, was a multi‐center trial that included 7020 adults at high cardiovascular risk (based on history of cardiovascular disease) and with glycated hemoglobin between 7.0% and 9.0% (or 10.0% if on stable glucose‐lowering therapy). 26 The primary outcome of EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, which was a composite of cardiovascular death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, and non‐fatal stroke, was significantly less likely to occur in the pooled empagliflozin group (10.5%) compared to the placebo group (12.1%, P = 0.04). The secondary outcome, cardiovascular death, occurred in 12.8% of patients in the empagliflozin group compared to 14.3% of the placebo group, although this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.08). 26 Interestingly, there was not a significant change in the rate of myocardial infarction or stroke between the two groups; hospital admission for heart failure, however, was significantly less likely in the empagliflozin group (occurring in 2.7%) vs the placebo group (4.1%, P = 0.002). 26 After the first 12 weeks of the trial, during which glucose‐lowering therapy was held stable, those in the empagliflozin group had glycated hemoglobin levels about 0.5 percentage points lower than those in the control group, with little difference between the 10 and 25 mg/day groups. 26 At 4 years, the difference between the empagliflozin groups and the placebo groups was about 0.3%, although adjustment of antiglucose medications was allowed after week 12. 26 Rates of serious adverse events, adverse events, and overall rates of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis were similar between the empagliflozin groups and the placebo group, although adverse, severe adverse and serious adverse events, genital infections, and urinary tract infections were significantly more in the pooled empagliflozin group compared to the placebo group. 26

### The sweet spot: heart failure prevention with SGLT2 inhibitors [^116LgPYj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a novel class of medications that reduce plasma glucose concentrations through an insulin-independent mechanism of increased urinary glucose excretion, with concomitant natriuresis and diuresis. Clinical outcomes trials with SGLT2 inhibitors revealed a cardioprotective benefit among patients with diabetes mellitus, with a consistent reduction in hospitalization for heart failure. As such, the 2018 updated US and European treatment guidelines for diabetes mellitus incorporated SGLT2 inhibitors as second-line glucose-lowering agents after metformin. Although well tolerated, there are known adverse effects with SGLT2 inhibitors that require clinical monitoring, such as genital mycotic infections, diabetic ketoacidosis, volume depletion particularly in the setting of concomitant diuretic use, and lower limb amputations with canagliflozin. Ongoing clinical trials will uncover the potential benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with prevalent heart failure with or without diabetes mellitus.

2 METHODS

The current study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis: the PRISMA Statement. 14 This study is exempted from IRB approval and contains no patient‐level data.

2.1 Search strategy

A systematic search was performed of PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and Web of Science and the clinical trial registry maintained at clinicaltrials.gov from 1966 to September 2018 with the terms: pioglitazone or actos AND gliflozin or sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor or empagliflozin or dapagliflozin or canagliflozin or ipragliflozin or tofogliflozin or remogliflozin AND glucose or Hba1c or blood pressure or mortality or death or heart failure or cancer or infection or hypoglycaemia or oedema or weight or side effect. We restricted the search to studies in humans and clinical trials. There was no language restriction. We retrieved further information by a manual search of references from recent reviews and relevant published original studies. Two investigators (HWL and ML) independently conducted the literature search, screen of abstracts and selection of included trials.

2.2 Study selection and data abstraction

We selected studies using the following entry criteria: (a) the study was randomized controlled trial; (b) patients had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus; (c) the comparison treatment was SGLT‐2 inhibitor plus pioglitazone (active group) vs pioglitazone (control group); (d) reported at least one measure of the following: mean and standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE) were reported for change from baseline in HbA1c, fasting glucose, and body weight, in active and control groups; (e) intended follow‐up of at least 24 weeks for all participants. All data from eligible studies were abstracted by two independent investigators (HWL and ML) according to standard protocol. Discrepancies were resolved by joint discussion. Recorded data variables were trial name, year of publication, study area, treatment regimens and daily dose for each group, mean age, number of participants, number of events/participants in certain end‐points (eg, people who achieved Hba1c < 7.0, hypoglycaemia, death, heart failure, urinary tract infection, genital tract infection), percentage of women, duration of follow‐up and mean and SD or SE of the interested variables or event of each groups.

### Use of SGLT2 inhibitors in pediatric heart failure: a multi-center study [^1129QGX3]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are utilized in pediatric heart failure (HF) with little data on dosing or safety profile. Our aim is to report on dosing and adverse events associated with SGLT2i use in pediatric HF.

Methods

A retrospective study was performed utilizing the Advanced Cardiac Therapies Improving Outcomes Network (ACTION) pediatric heart failure registry. Patient demographics, medical regimen, echocardiographic data, laboratory data, adverse events, and relevant heart failure outcomes were collected at SGLT2i initiation and last follow-up.

Results

At time of database query, data from 278 patients from 19 institutions were common. The most common SGLT2i prescribed was dapagliflozin (244) followed by empagliflozin (34). Median age at initiation was 15.1 years (IQR 10.7–18.2), 106 had DCM, 54 had Fontan physiology, and 67% of patients were initiated in the outpatient setting. For all patients prescribed dapagliflozin, the median mg/kg/dose at initiation was 0.11 (IQR 0.08–0.14). The median follow-up was 195 days (IQR 90–450, n = 180). In the follow-up cohort, 32 patients discontinued SGLT2i with 15 due to drug intolerance. 28 patients had a total of 34 adverse events (AE) reported. The most common AE was UTI (11) followed by AKI (10). After SGLT2i initiation, 13% of patients had a subsequent HF admission, 5% had a VAD, and 9% underwent heart transplantation.

Conclusion

In pediatric HF, SGLT2is are being utilized in a diverse patient population. AKI and UTI were the most common reported AE. Typical initiation dose is approximately 0.1mg/kg/dose. Prospective studies are needed to help determine efficacy.

### Management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^112y2xKu]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Pillar 4: Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors

SGLT2i are well-established hypoglycaemic agents used in the management of type II diabetes. These promote glycosuria and natriuresis by reducing reuptake of glucose and sodium in the proximal renal tubule. Recent evidence has established this class of medication as a key therapy in HFrEF. Both dapagliflozin and empagliflozin have demonstrated ~25% relative risk reduction when compared with placebo in a combined endpoint of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death in otherwise well-treated patients with HFrEF, both with and without diabetes. Current ACC/AHA and ESC guidelines strongly support the use of SGLT2i at an early stage in HFrEF and they are approved for use in the UK by NICE. There is a potential for over-diuresis with concomitant use of ARNI and loop diuretic and careful clinical assessment is required in these circumstances.

From a practical perspective, starting four drugs simultaneously in a patient group who often have significant comorbidity or frailty can be challenging. An approach which concentrates on the phenotype of the individual patient with the goal to establish the four pillars of treatment as rapidly as possible should be the ambition for all individuals with HFrEF. This underscores the pivotal role of the heart failure nurse specialist who can support and educate the patient, their caregivers and the general practitioner through this process and the necessary follow-up and monitoring after each titration. Side effects and complications are commonly encountered and if these occur without ready access to advice, cessation or delays in therapy are very likely.

### Empagliflozin and linagliptin (Glyxambi) [^115L6zPC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in female patients. The incidence of urinary tract infections in female patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 16.6%, 18.4%, and 17.0%, respectively. The incidence of urinary tract infections in male patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 3.2%, 3.6%, and 4.1%, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
Lower Limb Amputations: Across four empagliflozin outcome trials, lower limb amputation event rates were 4.3 and 5.0 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo group and the empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg dose group, respectively, with a HR of 1.05 (95% CI) (0.81, 1.36). In a long-term cardio-renal outcome trial, in patients with chronic kidney disease, the occurrence of lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 2.9, and 4.3 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo, and empagliflozin 10 mg treatment arms, respectively. GLYXAMBI is not indicated for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of empagliflozin PO (also known as Jardiance):
- **Acute pyelonephritis, urosepsis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of serious UTIs, including pyelonephritis and urosepsis.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Consider reducing the insulin or insulin secretagogue dose.
- **Diabetic ketoacidosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, especially in patients with pancreatic disorders, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, recent surgery, reduced insulin dose, volume depletion, or excessive alcohol use. Consider obtaining ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis as indicated. Assess for ketoacidosis in patients presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis, regardless of blood glucose levels. Withhold empagliflozin at least 3 days, if possible, before major surgery or procedures associated with prolonged fasting. Resume once clinically stable and after oral intake has resumed.
- **Fournier's gangrene**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of Fournier's gangrene.
- **Lower extremity amputation**: use extreme caution in patients with a history of prior amputation, PAD, or neuropathy.
- **Reactivation of genital mycotic infections**: use caution in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections.
- **Volume depletion**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of volume depletion, especially in patients with renal impairment, taking loop diuretics, or advanced age. Assess and correct volume status before initiating empagliflozin. Monitor for volume depletion throughout treatment.

SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists — use around acute coronary syndrome (ACS), perioperative precautions, and post–myocardial infarction (MI) trial data: The cardiovascular benefits of sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are well documented in stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and type 2 diabetes, as well as in heart failure (HF) regardless of diabetes status. GLP-1 receptor agonists may lead to weight loss, and semaglutide has been shown to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in overweight or obese patients with stable ASCVD but has not been studied early after ACS. SGLT-2 inhibitors may increase the risk of urinary tract infection, genital mycotic infection, hypovolemia, and acute kidney injury; due to a higher risk of perioperative diabetic and euglycemic ketoacidosis, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin should be stopped ≥ 3 days and ertugliflozin ≥ 4 days prior to scheduled surgery, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Efficacy and safety have been studied in 2 large trials after MI: in patients without diabetes or HF, dapagliflozin was not shown to reduce cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization in acute MI with impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic function, and empagliflozin did not significantly reduce all-cause death or first HF hospitalization in similar patients, although HF hospitalizations were reduced; no new safety concerns were identified and use of an SGLT-2 inhibitor does not need to be deferred in indicated patients at hospital discharge.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and mycotic genital or urinary tract infections in heart failure [^113KJpTn]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) improve clinical outcomes in persons with heart failure (HF). This class of agents has been consistently associated with an increased risk of mycotic genital infections (MGIs), and in some, but not all trials, urinary tract infections (UTIs). Other medications widely used for cardiac conditions do not cause MGIs and UTIs, so cardiologists and their supporting teams will be encountering clinical questions that they previously did not have to address. This review provides clinicians with practical recommendations about SGLT2i use in individuals with HF as related to the associated MGI and possible UTI risks. Overall, given the benefit of SGLT2is in clinical outcomes, the threshold for not initiating or discontinuing SGLT2is due to concerns for MGIs or UTIs should be high for persons with HF. Likewise, when SGLT2is are discontinued for such concerns, the threshold for reinitiation should be low.

### Genitourinary tract infections in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors: JACC review topic of the week [^111VyW5E]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have been shown to reduce adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, all-cause mortality, and heart failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure, as well as adverse renal outcomes. However, concerns regarding the heightened risk of genitourinary (GU) infections, particularly urinary tract infections, remain a significant barrier to their wider adoption. Addressing these misconceptions using existing evidence is needed to ensure proper risk-benefit assessment and optimal utilization of this efficacious therapy. This review aims to provide a balanced perspective on the evidence-based cardiovascular and renal benefits of SGLT2is and the associated risk of GU infections. We also summarize and propose clinical practice considerations for SGLT2i-associated GU infections focusing on patients with cardiovascular disease.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are described as having well-documented cardiovascular benefits in stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with type 2 diabetes and in heart failure (HF); semaglutide reduces major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in overweight or obese patients with stable ASCVD but has not been studied early after acute coronary syndromes (ACS). SGLT-2 inhibitors may increase risks including urinary tract infection, genital mycotic infection, hypovolemia, and acute kidney injury, and due to perioperative ketoacidosis risk canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin should be stopped ≥ 3 days and ertugliflozin ≥ 4 days before scheduled surgery including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). After myocardial infarction (MI), efficacy and safety have been evaluated in 2 large trials; in patients without diabetes or HF and with acute MI and impaired left ventricular systolic function, dapagliflozin did not reduce cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization, and empagliflozin did not significantly reduce all-cause death or first HF hospitalization, although empagliflozin reduced HF hospitalizations in this population. No new safety concerns were identified, and use of an SGLT-2 inhibitor does not need to be deferred at hospital discharge in patients with an indication.

### Dapagliflozin and diuretic utilization in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: the DELIVER trial [^113HZQSf]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Certain important limitations of this analysis should be noted. First, missing or inadequate dose information precluded analysis of all patients at certain time points. Second, specific clinical rationale motivating modifications to diuretic regimens was not available and may reflect issues other than volume status alone. Third, while information on diuretic regimens and start and stop dates were collected at study visits, these data were not cross-referenced against pharmacy claims data or other objective sources. Finally, DELIVER did not collect measures of diuresis and natriuresis such as urinary volumes or urinary electrolyte profiles.

In conclusion, in this pre-specified analysis of DELIVER in patients with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, dapagliflozin safely improved clinical outcomes across a wide range of diuretic use and doses. Treatment with dapagliflozin significantly reduced loop diuretic requirement over time, which appears to be driven by lower needs for diuretic intensification and underscores dapagliflozin's effect to prevent worsening heart failure. However, there were limited differences in the necessity for loop diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction between treatment arms. As such, these data may argue against anticipatory loop diuretic dose reduction at the time of SGLT2 inhibitor initiation.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors and severe urinary tract infections: real-world meta-analysis of cohort studies [^112AKaw9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a drug safety communication regarding the increased risk of serious urinary tract infection (UTI) associated with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is).

The impact of the glucosuric effect on UTI risk is debated. Previous meta-analyses show an insignificant association between SGLT2i use and UTI but are not entirely ruled out.

In a meta-analysis of 86 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) enrolling 50 880 patients, the risk of urosepsis was insignificant with SGLT2i vs placebo. Still, a wide 95% confidence interval (CI) interpreted the results as inconclusive (Relative Risk = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.57–3.48, I² = 0%).

Evidence concerning hospitalization due to severe UTI is limited. This definition aligns with the FDA's characterization of serious UTI. The findings from pharmacovigilance analysis formed the basis for the FDA warning issued in 2015. Therefore, our objective is to investigate the relationship between SGLT2i and severe UTI.

The extensive observational studies collected over the years have helped clarify the association, particularly for patient groups often excluded from RCTs, older populations, women, and high comorbidities. Therefore, our meta-analysis includes observational studies over the years, explicitly analyzing severe UTI events.

According to studies, significant improvements in cardiovascular outcomes associated with SGLT2i could significantly reduce overall cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations due to heart failure, particularly in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. - A review published by the European Society of Cardiology addressed the controversial issue of cardiovascular safety concerning older glucose-lowering medications, such as dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i), which are not recommended as a first-line treatment option for diabetic patients with heart failure. In addition, sulfonylureas may increase the risk of heart failure, potentially leading to hospitalizations due to hypoglycemia. It is well known that the early stages of sepsis can present as hypoglycemia and may be linked to the severity of the disease, resulting in poorer hospitalization outcomes.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The efficacy and safety of JARDIANCE for glycemic control were evaluated in a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild and moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In this trial, 195 adult patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 60 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 91 adult patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 97 patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. The glucose lowering benefit of JARDIANCE 25 mg decreased in adult patients with worsening renal function. The risks of renal impairment, volume depletion adverse reactions and urinary tract infection-related adverse reactions increased with worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Use of JARDIANCE for glycemic control in patients without established cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors is not recommended when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

JARDIANCE was evaluated in 7,020 adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (eGFR greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, in a total of 9,718 patients with heart failure (eGFR greater than or equal to 20 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved trials, and in 6,609 adult patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 20 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the EMPA-KIDNEY study. The safety profile across eGFR subgroups in these trials was consistent with the known safety profile [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4, 14.5)].

Efficacy and safety trials with JARDIANCE did not enroll adult patients with an eGFR less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m2or on dialysis. Once enrolled, adult patients in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME, EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, and EMPA-KIDNEY trials were not required to discontinue therapy for worsening of eGFR to less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m2or initiation of dialysis [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4, 14.5)].

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of dapagliflozin / saxagliptin PO (also known as Qtern):
- **Acute pancreatitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as saxagliptin has been associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis.
- **Acute pyelonephritis, urosepsis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of serious UTIs, including pyelonephritis and urosepsis.
- **Angioedema**: use caution in patients with a history of angioedema related to other DPP4 inhibitors.
- **Arthralgia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as DPP4 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of severe and disabling arthralgia.
- **Bullous pemphigoid**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as DPP4 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of bullous pemphigoid.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Consider reducing the insulin or insulin secretagogue dose.
- **Diabetic ketoacidosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, especially in patients with pancreatic disorders, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, recent surgery, reduced insulin dose, volume depletion, or excessive alcohol use. Consider obtaining ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis as indicated. Assess for ketoacidosis in patients presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis, regardless of blood glucose levels. Withhold dapagliflozin at least 3 days, if possible, before major surgery or procedures associated with prolonged fasting. Resume once clinically stable and after oral intake has resumed.
- **Fournier's gangrene**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of Fournier's gangrene.
- **HF**: use caution in patients with a history of HF or renal impairment. Assess renal function before initiating saxagliptin.
- **Reactivation of genital mycotic infections**: use caution in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections.
- **Volume depletion**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of volume depletion, especially in patients with renal impairment, taking loop diuretics, or advanced age. Assess and correct volume status before initiating dapagliflozin. Monitor for volume depletion throughout treatment.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for the management of pediatric heart failure (update from 2014) [^112Ck5Kw]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors — pediatric heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): There are no RCTs and limited data on the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in pediatric HF, and a recent meta-analysis reported use in those 3 months to 24 years. The pediatric study described was a prospective observational study in 38 nondiabetic patients aged 3 months to 21 years already on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) treated with dapagliflozin, with improvements in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and 4 patients experiencing acute kidney injury and 6 with a symptomatic urinary tract infection. In children with symptomatic HFrEF, SGLT2 inhibitors may be considered, although their safety and effectiveness in children have not been systematically studied (Class IIb, Level of Evidence C). For context, SGLT2 inhibitors are now recommended in adults with symptomatic HFrEF to decrease hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality.

### Cardiovascular and renal outcomes with empagliflozin in heart failure [^11371Zhr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. More evidence is needed regarding the effects of these drugs in patients across the broad spectrum of heart failure, including those with a markedly reduced ejection fraction.

Methods

In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 3730 patients with class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less to receive empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or placebo, in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure.

Results

During a median of 16 months, a primary outcome event occurred in 361 of 1863 patients (19.4%) in the empagliflozin group and in 462 of 1867 patients (24.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65 to 0.86; P < 0.001). The effect of empagliflozin on the primary outcome was consistent in patients regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. The total number of hospitalizations for heart failure was lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.85; P < 0.001). The annual rate of decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate was slower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (-0.55 vs. -2.28 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area per year, P < 0.001), and empagliflozin-treated patients had a lower risk of serious renal outcomes. Uncomplicated genital tract infection was reported more frequently with empagliflozin.

Conclusions

Among patients receiving recommended therapy for heart failure, those in the empagliflozin group had a lower risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure than those in the placebo group, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes.

### Kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: a consensus statement [^1112dVvq]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall, genital mycotic infections are the most frequent side effect observed with SGLT2i. The incidence of UTI in patients treated with SGLT2i is similar to that seen in all people with T2DM. Hypoglycemia can occur when a SGLT2i is used as an add-on to other agents causing hypoglycemia, such as insulin or sulfonylureas. Volume depletion and hypotension are rare and can be minimized by adjusting diuretic and antihypertensive treatment in patients at risk. The incidences of AKI, amputation (largely feet and toes), and fractures are rare and can be prevented by careful monitoring and avoiding use in high-risk patients.

Ongoing SGLT2i Trials Assessing Renal Outcomes

Multiple trials assessing the renal benefits of SGLT2i are ongoing. The RACELINES trial will assess the clinical effects and mechanism of monotherapy and combination therapy of the SGLT2i empagliflozin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor linagliptin on renal physiology and biomarkers in metformin-treated T2DM patients. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial will compare the renal effect of a SGLT2i and a sulfonylurea. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial will evaluate the effect of empagliflozin on kidney disease progression or CV death in people without T2DM. Despite optimal treatment with RAAS inhibitors, many patients with non-diabetic kidney disease show progressive kidney function loss, which is associated with high residual proteinuria. The recently completed DIAMOND study was conducted to assess the renoprotective effects of dapagliflozin in non-diabetic patients with proteinuria. The DAPA-CKD trial, evaluating the efficacy of dapagliflozin in patients with CKD stages 2–4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with and without T2D, will be stopped early due to overwhelming efficacy. The treatment paradigm for CKD, for people with and without T2DM, may change after the release of the ongoing trial results over the next few years. These trials are listed in Table 4 with their primary outcome measures.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors as an early, first-line therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^112eLVfk]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

ACEi or ARNI and MRA, among the pillars of HFrEF therapy, often cause hyperkalaemia, especially in patients with CKD, leading to under‐prescription of evidence‐based treatment and worse outcome.SGLT2 inhibitors were not associated with significant changes in potassium levels in major trials, also reducing the need for close laboratory monitoring. A sub‐analysis of DAPA‐HF showed lower rates of hyperkalaemia with dapagliflozin in the subgroup of individuals treated with MRAs. Although this observation has not been confirmed in EMPEROR‐Reduced, results showed fewer discontinuation of MRAs among patients prescribed with empagliflozin. Reduced rates of hyperkalaemia with SGLT2 inhibitors have also been demonstrated in adjacent clinical trials of patients with CKD. Adverse events observed in major clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. Genital infections are among the most common complications in patients with diabetes treated with SGLT2 inhibitors as a consequence of glycosuria. Of note, sotagliflozin was associated with more frequent adverse events, including diarrhoea, hypotension and hypoglycaemia, generally not observed in the other SGLT2 inhibitor trials. This adverse event rate can likely be attributed to additional inhibition effects exerted by sotagliflozin on the gastrointestinal and renal SGLT1.

Safety and tolerability

Several clinical trials involving SGLT-2 inhibitors in T2DM patients have shown more adverse reactions such as genital infections, amputations, DKA, and fractures in SGLT-2 inhibitor compared with placebo. There is little or no evidence of effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on blindness, amputation, neuropathic pain, eye disease, or health-related quality of life in large meta-analyses. Compared with GLP-1 agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors were related to a lower risk of adverse events resulted in patient withdrawal. SGLT2 inhibitors significantly decreased the risk of all serious adverse events (HR = 0.91, P < 0.001) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (HR = 0.74; P < 0.001). A meta-analysis reported dose-independent adverse events with SGLT2 inhibitors. Compared with controls or placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors did not increase the risk of acute pancreatitis.

Overall adverse events and adverse event-related discontinuation rates were generally similar between placebo, sitagliptin, glimepiride, and SGLT-2 inhibitors. However, canagliflozin 100 mg had a higher incidence of adverse events than placebo or sitagliptin. The safety profile of empagliflozin was similar to sitagliptin or metformin, and most adverse events were mild or moderate in intensity. Adverse events were similar between dapagliflozin and placebo, with few adverse events associated with volume depletion (< 1% vs. 0%) or renal function (1% vs < 1%). The most common adverse events related to dapagliflozin in DURATION-8 were diarrhea, injection site nodules, nausea, and urinary tract infection. In DAPA-HF, the incidence of adverse reactions associated with volume depletion, renal insufficiency, as well as hypoglycemia did not differ between placebo and dapagliflozin. The incidence of hypovolemia, symptomatic hypoglycemia, and urinary tract infection did not differ obviously between groups in patients receiving ertugliflozin compared with placebo or metformin.

CKD chronic kidney disease, HF heart failure, RR risk ratio, T2DM type 2 diabetes mellitus

The most common adverse event related to SGLT2is is genital fungal infections, which has been reported to occur in up to 11% of those receiving SGLT2i treatment. However, most SGLT2i-related genital mycotic infections are easily managed with topical antifungal agents, and do not require treatment discontinuation, except in cases of recurrent or persistent candidiasis. Urinary infections may also occur; nevertheless, these infections are usually rare and can be addressed with standard antibiotics. Individuals prescribed an SGLT2i should be informed about the possibility of urogenital infections and encouraged to maintain basic genital hygiene and seek medical attention if symptoms of urogenital infection develop.

### Comparison of effectiveness among different sodium-glucose cotransoporter-2 inhibitors according to underlying conditions: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114xbTYi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

To investigate the individual profile of each SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransoporter-2) inhibitor in patients with different backgrounds.

Methods and Results

This study included 21 placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials with a total of 96196 participants, investigating empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and sotagliflozin. The primary efficacy end point was the composite of cardiovascular death and hospitalizations for heart failure. The secondary efficacy end points were all-cause death, cardiovascular death, hospitalizations for heart failure, kidney disease progression, and acute kidney injury. We conducted subgroup analyses based on the underlying comorbidities, including diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Safety end points were also assessed among SGLT2 inhibitors in the overall cohort. In the overall cohort, there were no significant differences in the primary efficacy outcome among the SGLT2 inhibitors, while empagliflozin (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.53–0.92]) and dapagliflozin (HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56–0.96]) were associated with lower risk of acute kidney injury than sotagliflozin. The presence or absence of diabetes did not alter the results. In patients with chronic kidney disease, there were no differences in the efficacy outcomes among SGLT2 inhibitors, while in patients without chronic kidney disease, empagliflozin was associated with lower risk of the primary outcome compared with ertugliflozin (HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.60–0.98]). For safety outcomes, no significant differences were observed in amputation, urinary tract infection, genital infection, hypoglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis.

Conclusions

The differences in reducing cardiovascular and kidney outcomes as well as safety profiles across SGLT2 inhibitors were not consistently significant, although empagliflozin might be preferred in patients without chronic kidney disease. Further investigations are needed to better understand the mechanism and clinical effectiveness of each SGLT2 inhibitor in certain populations.

Mortality, hospitalization for heart failure and adverse events

The model captured the incidence of first and recurrent HHF and urgent HF visits as discrete clinical events, as well as capturing the occurrence of relevant AEs, cardiovascular and all‐cause mortality. Parametric multivariable survival analysis was used to model all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality over time, adjusted for time‐updated KCCQ‐TSS, baseline patient characteristics including T2DM and study arm, as such, patients with lower KCCQ‐TSS or comorbid T2DM were at increased risk of mortality and HHF events. Analysis was conducted from an intention‐to‐treat perspective using the complete DAPA‐HF dataset. 14 The approach to statistical model selection was consistent with guidelines for the analysis of survival data alongside clinical trials, with goodness‐of‐fit assessed through minimizing Akaike Information Criterion. 22, 23 Mortality was assumed to follow a Weibull distribution in the base‐case analysis, following survival extrapolations compared to previously published long‐term projections to ensure plausible extrapolations. 24, 25, 26 Sensitivity of the results of the model to the choice of survival distribution was assessed using deterministic sensitivity analysis. The proportion of deaths attributable to non‐cardiovascular causes was calculated using country‐specific life‐tables, adjusted to remove cardiovascular mortality to avoid double‐counting. 27, 28, 29, 30 Negative binominal generalized estimating multivariable regression models were developed to estimate the incidence of HHF and urgent HF visits in order to capture both first and subsequent episodes of worsening HF. As only 33 first urgent HF visits were observed in DAPA‐HF, the incidence of urgent HF visits was applied using a constant, treatment arm specific incidence rate. Details of the regression models developed for mortality and HHF are provided in online supplementary Table S3.

The following specific AEs were modelled: volume depletion, worsening renal function, episodes of major hypoglycaemia, fracture, diabetic ketoacidosis, amputation, urinary tract infection and genital infection. The incidence of genital infection was not routinely collected in DAPA‐HF, as such modelled incidence rates are based on the dapagliflozin and placebo arms of DECLARE‐TIMI 58. 31 Serious AEs were not modelled in their entirety due to the overall favourable tolerability profile associated with dapagliflozin, with 35.7% of patients treated with dapagliflozin experiencing a serious AE in comparison with 40.2% in the placebo arm of DAPA‐HF. Treatment specific AEs were modelled assuming a constant hazard; these are reported in online supplementary Table S4.

### Empagliflozin in heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction [^113eU5Rj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, but their effects in patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction are uncertain.

Methods

In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 5988 patients with class II-IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of more than 40% to receive empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or placebo, in addition to usual therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure.

Results

Over a median of 26.2 months, a primary outcome event occurred in 415 of 2997 patients (13.8%) in the empagliflozin group and in 511 of 2991 patients (17.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69 to 0.90; P < 0.001). This effect was mainly related to a lower risk of hospitalization for heart failure in the empagliflozin group. The effects of empagliflozin appeared consistent in patients with or without diabetes. The total number of hospitalizations for heart failure was lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (407 with empagliflozin and 541 with placebo; hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.88; P < 0.001). Uncomplicated genital and urinary tract infections and hypotension were reported more frequently with empagliflozin.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin reduced the combined risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes.

5.4 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

There have been reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving empagliflozin. Treatment with empagliflozin increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when GLYXAMBI is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin. Therefore, a lower dosage of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with GLYXAMBI.

5.6 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene)

Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.

Patients treated with GLYXAMBI presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue GLYXAMBI, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.

5.7 Genital Mycotic Infections

Empagliflozin increases the risk for genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections. Monitor and treat as appropriate.

### Effect of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction [^116L1FcG]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this pooled analysis of the EMPEROR-Preserved and EMPEROR-Reduced trials involving 9718 patients with heart failure, we found that empagliflozin reduced the risk of heart failure hospitalizations across a broad range of ejection fractions. Specifically, empagliflozin reduced both the time to first hospitalizations for heart failure and the total (first and recurrent) hospitalizations for heart failure to a similar degree (by 25–35%) in patients with ejection fractions ranging from < 25% to < 65%. A benefit of empagliflozin was not apparent only in patients in the highest ejection fraction subgroup, i.e. those with an ejection fraction of ≥ 65% (Graphical Abstract). The pattern of effects was similar in men and women. Examination of the effects of empagliflozin on health status by the KCCQ-CSS showed a pattern of the influence of ejection fraction that was strikingly consistent with the pattern of the influence of ejection fraction on the effect of the drug on heart failure outcomes.

These findings should be considered in the context of the reported results with neurohormonal antagonists. In trials with candesartan (an angiotensin receptor blocker), spironolactone (a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist), and sacubitril/valsartan (an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor), investigators have reported a linear relationship between ejection fraction and the magnitude of the treatment effect. For each of these drugs, the most marked risk reduction was seen in patients with an ejection fraction of 30% or less; an intermediate risk reduction was seen in patients with an ejection fraction > 30% to < 50%; and there was minimal or no risk reduction in patients with an ejection fraction > 50–55%. In contrast to these findings, ejection fraction did not influence the magnitude of the response to empagliflozin in most patients with heart failure, with a similar relative risk reduction for hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with an ejection fraction < 30%, 40–50%, or > 50 to < 65%. Furthermore, whereas sex has been reported to influence the response to spironolactone and sacubitril/valsartan, the response to empagliflozin in the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved trials did not differ between men and women, and we did not observe a significant treatment-by-sex-by ejection fraction interaction.

### Evaluation of the effect of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibition with empagliflozin on morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction: rationale for and design of the EMPEROR-reduced trial [^114pGAq4]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Drugs that inhibit the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes. In populations that largely did not have heart failure at the time of enrolment, empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin decreased the risk of serious new-onset heart failure events by ≈30%. In addition, in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin reduced the risk of both pump failure and sudden deaths, the two most common modes of death among patients with heart failure. In none of the three trials could the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure be explained by the actions of these drugs as diuretics or anti-hyperglycaemic agents. These observations raise the possibility that SGLT2 inhibitors could reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with established heart failure, including those without diabetes. The EMPEROR-Reduced trial is enrolling ≈3600 patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤ 40%), half of whom are expected not to have diabetes. Patients are being randomized to placebo or empagliflozin 10 mg daily, which is added to all appropriate treatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and neprilysin, beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The primary endpoint is the time-to-first event analysis of the combined risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure, but the trial will also evaluate the effects of empagliflozin on renal function, cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, and recurrent hospitalization events. By adjusting eligibility based on natriuretic peptide levels to the baseline ejection fraction, the trial will preferentially enrol high-risk patients. A large proportion of the participants is expected to have an ejection fraction < 30%, and the estimated annual event rate is expected to be at least 15%. The EMPEROR-Reduced trial is well-positioned to determine if the addition of empagliflozin can add meaningfully to current approaches that have established benefits in the treatment of chronic heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Landmark CVOTs with SGLT2‐Is have generated a paradigm shift in the management of patients with T2DM, specifically in those with prior macrovascular disease, with a transition from past algorithms based primarily on glucose and HbA1c control to a more comprehensive strategy focused on CV prevention. This possible benefit was acknowledged by the FDA, which added a new indication to empagliflozin, and is now partially recognized by the 2018 American Diabetes Association guideline, thus increasing the competition to identify the optimal glucose‐lowering combination.

Large PER studies such CVD‐REALs should be commended for advancing knowledge by pooling such large amounts of prescription data and providing data on heterogeneous cohorts of patients with T2DM. Overall, data from observational cohort studies are not only in agreement with those from RCTs, but also found a larger benefit compared with CVOTs in a population with lower CV risk. Notwithstanding these impressive results and sophisticated statistical techniques, we cannot yet firmly conclude that there is a class effect, and uncertainty remains on safety issues in particular, including BKAs, infections, fractures and renal effects (Figure 2). In essence, confounders were largely minimized through propensity analysis, whereas immortal time bias and time‐lag bias were not fully accounted for in CVD‐REAL studies. 18, 21 The heterogeneity of cohorts stresses the importance of assessing patients for comparability before data pooling. We believe that the strength of CVD‐REAL studies lies not in their ability to merge worldwide data, but in capturing the specificities of prescription patterns. In other words, data from a single database should be described as primary analysis (instead of being provided as supplementary material), and discussed in the context of a cross‐national comparison.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in HFrEF — In DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced, SGLT2i compared with placebo reduced the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization by approximately 25%, with greater reduction in HF hospitalization (30%); with dapagliflozin, risk of cardiovascular death was lowered (18%) and all-cause mortality (17%). In SOLOIST-WHF, among patients with diabetes and HF hospitalization (79%: LVEF, < 50%) enrolled before discharge or within 3 days of discharge, sotagliflozin reduced the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, or urgent HF visits by 33%. SGLT2i increased risk for genital infections, and caution is warranted for euglycemic ketoacidosis, genital and soft tissue infections, and adjustment of diuretics, if needed, to prevent volume depletion.

### Association between sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor use and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes after urinary tract infection [^113hES9Z]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Infections remain a frequent and clinically significant complication in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), primarily due to persistent hyperglycaemia, immune dysregulation, and endothelial dysfunction which together impair host defence mechanisms. Among these, urinary tract infections (UTIs) and acute pyelonephritis are especially common and may trigger prolonged inflammatory responses, metabolic instability, and organ vulnerability in diabetic patients. The period following such infections — often termed the "vulnerable recovery phase" — has been associated with increased risks of systemic complications, renal function deterioration, and cardiovascular events. Despite growing awareness of this transitional window, there remains limited evidence to guide the selection of optimal antihyperglycaemic agents that can safely support recovery while minimizing long‐term adverse outcomes.

Sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have emerged as a preferred therapeutic class for patients with T2DM, owing to their demonstrated benefits in reducing cardiovascular mortality, slowing kidney disease progression, and improving heart failure outcomes in multiple randomised controlled trials. These organ‐protective effects are thought to arise from pleiotropic mechanisms, including natriuresis, modulation of tubuloglomerular feedback, reduction in oxidative stress, and anti‐inflammatory activity. However, due to their known association with genital and urinary tract infections, clinicians have exercised caution regarding their use in patients with a recent history of UTI. While meta‐analyses suggest that the risk of serious infections such as urosepsis remains low with SGLT2i, the perceived infection‐related risk may influence prescribing decisions in real‐world settings. Consequently, many clinicians delay or avoid initiating SGLT2i in the post‐UTI period, potentially foregoing the opportunity for cardiometabolic benefit.

Methods

Study Design and Patient Population

The design of the EMPEROR-Preserved trial has been described previously. In brief, participants were men or women ≥ 18 years of age who have chronic HF with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to IV symptoms and an LVEF of > 40% with no previous measurement of ≤ 40%. Patients were also required to have an elevated NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) level (> 900 or > 300 pg/mL in patients with and without atrial fibrillation, respectively) and a documented hospitalization for HF or evidence of structural heart disease within 12 months before enrollment. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo or empagliflozin 10 mg daily for a median of 26 months. The ethics committee at each center approved the trial, and all patients provided written informed consent.

Trial Outcomes

The outcomes for this analysis included the primary outcome, which was time to cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization, and secondary outcomes, including total HF hospitalization, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, health status as measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), and NYHA functional class. The KCCQ scores were summarized as total symptom score consisting of symptom frequency and burden; a clinical summary score consisting of physical limitation and total symptom score; and an overall summary score, which combines the clinical summary score, quality of life, and social limitation domains. Physiological measures included body weight, systolic blood pressure, NT-proBNP, uric acid, and hematocrit at 52 weeks. Change in diuretic therapy (increase in dose, decrease in dose, initiation, and permanent discontinuation) and safety outcomes, which included any adverse events, serious adverse events, volume depletion, acute renal failure, confirmed hypoglycemia, genital infection, and bone fractures, were also reported.

### A complete review of empagliflozin: most specific and potent SGLT2 inhibitor used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1127s8mN]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are the latest class of drugs to be introduced for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). They reduce hyperglycemia by increasing urinary glucose excretion and exert favorable effects beyond glucose control with consistent body weight, blood pressure, and serum uric acid reductions. Empagliflozin is a potent SGLT2 inhibitor used to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM. It has the highest SGLT2 specificity among all the clinically used or currently tested SGLT2 inhibitors. Low risk of hypoglycemia, absence of weight gain and demonstrated cardiovascular risk reduction support its consideration as a first line medication in addition to metformin for patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease. Mostly reported adverse events are genital mycotic infections, while urinary tract infections and events linked to volume depletion are rather rare. This review covers the complete information on empagliflozin including the history of its development, synthesis, pharmacology and different methods which have been reported for its analysis.

Methods

Data Access and Responsibility

The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the article and its online supplementary files.

Search Strategy

Databases (PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched, without language restriction, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing SGLT2i add‐on therapy in settings of AHF, using the search terms as outlined in Table S1, from inception to May 31, 2024. The search was kept current by setting up automated reminders from PUBMED for new publications. Institutional review committee approval was not required given that this is a meta‐analysis of published data. The study was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42024556171).

Article Selection

Titles and abstracts of studies retrieved using the search strategy were independently screened by 2 investigators (C.D. and M.C.) to identify randomized controlled clinical trials with an active arm involving the initiation of an SGLT2i (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, sotagliflozin) in patients hospitalized with AHF. RCTs including patients with stable and chronic HF without acute exacerbation requiring unplanned hospitalization were not included. No minimum sample size was required for inclusion. The full texts of potentially eligible studies were retrieved and independently assessed for eligibility by the 2 investigators. Discrepancies between investigators were discussed collegially, and the final decision was then made by consensus.

Outcomes

Efficacy outcomes of interest were all‐cause death (primary end point), HF rehospitalizations, and the composite of cardiovascular death or HF events (encompassing urgent visits and unplanned hospitalizations for AHF). Safety outcomes included the occurrence of AKI, ketoacidosis, urinary tract infections, hypotension, and hypoglycemia. The definitions of each event used by each trial were used in this analysis. The events reported at the longest follow‐up time point were abstracted from each of the trials.

SGLT2i therapies should be prescribed with caution in people requiring a rapid reduction in insulin dose, due to insulinopenia, which may increase DKA risk. *Decisions should be based upon recent eGFR measurement, rather than historical tests. ‡ SGLT2i therapies may be initiated in people with eGFR 60 mL/min/1.73m 2. Individuals already treated with canagliflozin or empagliflozin who demonstrate renal decline may continue treatment until eGFR reaches < 45 mL/min/1.73m 2. Dapagliflozin should be discontinued for those who demonstrate eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2. Urinary symptoms, due to glucosuria, can be an issue for people prescribed SGLT2i medicines. However, UTIs are relatively rare and these medicines may be prescribed for people with a history of UTIs. ◆Monitor HbA1c levels regularly and cease SGLT2is if elevated levels continue, following treatment initiation. SGLT2i treatments are not currently recommended for use alongside loop diuretics. However, this may be subject to change as the evidence-base evolves. EMPA-REG and CANVAS CV outcome trials included subgroups of people with T2DM who were receiving loop diuretics and ongoing trials aim to evaluate co-prescribing of these agents. † SGLT2i treatment should be suspended in individuals with acute illness until fully recovered

The tool aims to support clinicians in selecting appropriate people with T2DM for SGLT2i therapies, in line with the current evidence base and guidelines.

Safety

When selecting a therapy for an individual patient, hypoglycemia risk is usually a key driver. In clinical trials, empagliflozin has not been associated with hypoglycemia, with no increase in risk of confirmed hypoglycemia except when used with background sulfonylurea or fixed-dose insulin. When empagliflozin was given as monotherapy, or as add-on to stable metformin, pioglitazone (with or without metformin), or metformin plus sulfonylurea, no confirmed hypoglycemic AEs that required assistance were reported.

For clinical practice, a key question is the proportion of patients likely to discontinue the drug because of AEs. Across a pooled analysis of all empagliflozin randomized clinical trials, including 3695 patients who received placebo, 3806 empagliflozin 10 mg, and 4782 empagliflozin 25 mg, a similar percentage in each treatment group discontinued because of an AE (5.0%, 5.3%, and 5.6% in the empagliflozin 10, 25 mg, and placebo groups, respectively). The AEs most commonly associated with empagliflozin at either dose have been urinary tract infections and genital mycotic infections. For genital mycotic infections, the association with empagliflozin is clear, with these AEs occurring in 4.7% of the empagliflozin 10 mg group, 5.6% of the 25 mg group, and 1.1% of the placebo group in the pooled analysis. For urinary tract infections, the association is less clear: across the pooled analysis, the incidence was similar across groups, but an increased risk has been recorded in some of the individual trials; for example, with monotherapy, events consistent with urinary tract infection were reported in 5% of the placebo group, 7% of the empagliflozin 10 mg group, and 5% of the empagliflozin 25 mg group. In the pooled analysis, urosepsis was reported in 0.1%, 0.1%, and < 0.1% of the placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg groups, respectively, and pyelonephritis was reported in 0.1%, < 0.1%, and < 0.1% of the respective groups, suggesting no increased risk. However, 19 cases of urosepsis and pyelonephritis that started as urinary tract infections in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors were identified among events reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System database. All cases were hospitalized, and two needed hemodialysis. The database included events reported between March 2013 and October 2014, and as empagliflozin was not available in the US until September 2014, it is not surprising that the reported cases occurred with canagliflozin (n = 10) or dapagliflozin (n = 9), and the FDA has added warnings and precautions to the labeling for all SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Patients should be advised about signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections, as well as about seeking medical advice, so they can be treated promptly, if appropriate.

Trial End Points

We specified 3 measures as major outcomes to be evaluated in a hierarchical manner.

The primary end point was the composite of adjudicated cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, analyzed as time-to-first-event. The first secondary end point was the occurrence of all adjudicated hospitalizations for heart failure (including first and recurrent events). The second secondary end point was the analysis of the slope of the change in estimated glomerular filtration rate during double-blind treatment, which was supported by an analysis of a composite of end-stage renal events. We planned to enroll ≈3600 patients who were expected to experience a target of 841 adjudicated primary end point events during a follow-up period of 6 to 36 months.

To ascertain these major outcomes, we prospectively collected information on all deaths, all hospitalizations for any reason, and all emergent and urgent outpatient events that may reflect worsening heart failure. Hospitalizations were classified as cardiovascular or noncardiovascular based on the judgment of the investigator. In contrast, a heart failure hospitalization was prospectively identified by a clinical-event committee in a blinded manner using prespecified criteria. To qualify as an adjudicated heart failure hospitalization, patients were required to have meaningful worsening of their clinical status and intensification of treatment for heart failure. The duration of the in-hospital stay was at least 12 hours; if the patient had not received intravenous medications for heart failure, the minimum stay of an adjudicated heart failure hospitalization was 24 hours. Investigators documented the clinical course of each hospital admission on a dedicated form, including the prescribing of medications and devices used to treat episodes of clinical decompensation. The committee also adjudicated the occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, and transient ischemic attack.

### Association between sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor use and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes after urinary tract infection [^112tVsea]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The observed survival benefit aligns with cardiovascular outcome trials such as Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA‐REG OUTCOME), the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS), and the Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58 (DECLARE–TIMI 58), which demonstrated all‐cause mortality reductions with SGLT2i, albeit with variability in effect size and consistency. Meta‐analyses further support a class‐wide mortality benefit, especially for empagliflozin. Our study adds evidence for mortality reduction in a post‐UTI context, a phase marked by heightened systemic stress but often underrepresented in trials. Notably, survival benefit was seen even among patients without prior CVD, suggesting that SGLT2i may mitigate early pathophysiological processes — such as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction or autonomic imbalance — triggered by infection. Subgroup analyses showed stronger effects among women, younger individuals, and those without baseline CVD, who may retain greater physiological reserve. The early separation in survival curves (Figure 2A) underscores the potential value of timely SGLT2i initiation. Although not designed to establish superiority, the comparison with DPP‐4i argues against deferring SGLT2i initiation during recovery.

SGLT2 inhibitors — infectious safety concerns — include that an increased risk for genital mycotic infections has been seen with all SGLT2 inhibitors, and perineal hygiene should be discussed with all individuals placed on these agents; although these infections are usually not serious and tend to resolve with a brief course of antifungal agents, careful education and monitoring should occur in patients at high risk including the immunocompromised. Although there have been spontaneous postmarketing reports of pyelonephritis and urosepsis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, large clinical trials have shown no difference in the rates of any urinary tract infections between SGLT2 inhibitors and placebo, and rare postmarketing reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum led the FDA to request a warning be added to SGLT2 inhibitor prescribing.

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^113SXQVF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American College of Physicians type 2 diabetes guideline — Outcome ratings (Appendix Table 2) identify critical outcomes as All-cause mortality, Amputations, Congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization, Diabetic ketoacidosis, Discontinuation due to adverse events, Lactic acidosis, Major adverse cardiovascular events, Myocardial infarction, Progression of chronic kidney disease, Serious adverse events, Severe hypoglycemia, and Stroke; important outcomes are All-cause hospitalizations, Glucosuria, Glycemic control, Perineal infection, Urinary tract infection, and Weight change. Outcomes in boldface were prioritized by the Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) to be evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach and in evidence-to-decision tables, and although the CGC prioritized weight change, data were too infrequently reported and heterogeneous for total body weight loss ≥ 10% to be analyzed and evaluated with GRADE.
