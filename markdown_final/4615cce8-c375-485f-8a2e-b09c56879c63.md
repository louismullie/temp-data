## Question

If a patient is taking levothyroxine 75mcg and TSH is low with t3 and t4 normal, do adjust medication

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a patient on levothyroxine 75 mcg/day who now has a low TSH with normal free T4 and T3, and whether the dose should be adjusted. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is primary hypothyroidism and whether TSH is an appropriate guide. Then, I should verify how "low" the TSH is and what the normal ranges are. Next, I will consider potential transient causes or lab artifacts before changing the dose. After that, I should apply guideline-based dosing principles for dose reduction. Finally, I will plan the monitoring interval and address special scenarios like central hypothyroidism, older age, or pregnancy that might alter targets or timing [^113SVBJx] [^111CMEpL] [^111wnznq].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and ensure this is primary hypothyroidism, because in central hypothyroidism TSH is unreliable and dosing must be guided by free T4 rather than TSH; I should not jump to conclusions until I know the etiology and the assay context, including timing of blood draw relative to the dose and consistency of the levothyroxine product, as changes in brand can shift TSH even at the same dose [^112GQShE] [^1113UfcP] [^1174XEgy] [^117LFNGB].

> Now, I need to quantify what "low TSH" means; if the TSH is below the assay lower limit (commonly around 0.4 mIU/L), that meets biochemical criteria for subclinical hyperthyroidism, whereas values in the lower-normal range may still be acceptable depending on the patient; wait, let me verify that I am using the correct reference interval for the specific lab, and I should double-check that the free T4 and T3 are truly normal for that assay, since mild free hormone elevations can accompany a suppressed TSH [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to a dose change just yet; I should consider transient or reversible causes of a suppressed TSH on replacement therapy, including over-replacement, inconsistent administration, interactions with calcium, iron, PPIs, or soy, recent product switch, and, importantly, intercurrent illness or adrenal insufficiency, which can transiently lower TSH; I need to check a repeat TSH (and free T4) in 4–6 weeks, ensure stable dosing and product consistency, and only act if the pattern persists [^113AV4mB] [^1174XEgy] [^117LFNGB] [^111rgtSQ].

> If the suppressed TSH persists on a repeat test, I should reduce the levothyroxine dose; guidelines support dose decrements of about 12.5–25 mcg, so from 75 mcg/day, I would decrease to 62.5 mcg/day or 50 mcg/day depending on comorbidities and risk tolerance; wait, I should confirm the patient's weight and lean mass, because weight-based full replacement is about 1.6 mcg/kg, and 75 mcg/day may be excessive for lighter individuals or those with residual thyroid function, explaining the low TSH [^111CMEpL] [^114C5Dxo] [^113K4pNY].

> Next, I should review special populations and targets; in older adults or those with cardiovascular disease, I should be more conservative with targets, often accepting a TSH in the upper-normal range and using smaller dose changes to avoid precipitating arrhythmias or bone loss; in contrast, in differentiated thyroid cancer, intentional TSH suppression may be desired, so I must confirm the indication before reducing the dose; I need to ensure I am not inadvertently changing a suppressive regimen to a replacement target [^114q7F9o] [^113JDiSi] [^111sQoM3].

> I will now examine the monitoring cadence; after any dose change, I should recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks, since steady state is reached in about that interval; once the TSH is stable in the desired range, periodic monitoring every 6–12 months is appropriate, with earlier reassessment if symptoms, weight, or medications change; I should double-check that I am drawing blood consistently before the morning dose to avoid transient post-dose peaks confounding interpretation [^114BCykN] [^111sQoM3] [^111wnznq].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite normalizing TSH; I should not assume thyroid etiology in that case, as many patients on LT4 report residual symptoms unrelated to thyroid status; randomized trials generally do not show benefit from adding liothyronine in unselected patients, so I should prioritize evaluation for nonthyroidal causes before escalating therapy, and only consider a cautious, time-limited combination trial in select, persistently symptomatic cases after excluding other diagnoses [^112wUhU4] [^1164Lxwn] [^114PQwXT].

> Putting this together, my plan is: confirm primary hypothyroidism and assay context, repeat TSH and free T4 in 4–6 weeks while ensuring stable dosing and product consistency, and if TSH remains suppressed, reduce levothyroxine by 12.5–25 mcg (for example, 75 to 62.5 mcg/day), then recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks and titrate to a TSH target appropriate for the patient's age, comorbidities, and indication; I should document the rationale and counsel on adherence and administration to minimize variability [^111CMEpL] [^114BCykN] [^111wnznq].

In a patient on levothyroxine 75 mcg/day with **low TSH and normal free T4/T3**, this is **biochemical overtreatment** [^111CMEpL] and warrants a dose reduction to prevent long-term harms such as atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis [^116ZT95f] [^112wUhU4]. Reduce the dose by **12.5–25 mcg** (to 50–62.5 mcg/day) [^111CMEpL], recheck TSH and free T4 in 6–8 weeks [^114BCykN] [^111wnznq], and titrate to a TSH target of 0.5–2.5 mIU/L. If TSH remains low after adherence and drug interactions are addressed, consider switching to a liquid or softgel formulation [^notfound] or once-weekly dosing [^117Tv9cU] [^114WSNFH].

---

## Clinical significance of low TSH with normal free T4 and T3

Low TSH with normal free T4 and T3 indicates **subclinical hyperthyroidism** due to excess levothyroxine [^notfound]. This pattern reflects **over-replacement** and increases risks of atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and fractures, especially in older adults [^113JDiSi].

---

## Recommended management strategy

### Step 1: confirm adherence and absorption

Before adjusting the dose, confirm **adherence** and rule out **absorption issues**:

- **Adherence**: Ask about missed doses, timing, and food/drug interactions [^114JDqUJ].

- **Absorption**: Check for calcium, iron, PPIs, or soy taken within 4 hours of levothyroxine [^116SXxfK].

- **Formulation**: Consider liquid or softgel if absorption is suspected [^115V2h1X] [^116NSG5q].

---

### Step 2: dose reduction

If adherence and absorption are adequate, **reduce the dose** by 12.5–25 mcg (to 50–62.5 mcg/day) [^111CMEpL].

---

### Step 3: monitoring and titration

Recheck **TSH and free T4** in 6–8 weeks [^1175pGeU] and titrate to a TSH target of 0.5–2.5 mIU/L [^notfound]. Once stable, monitor TSH every 6–12 months [^111sQoM3].

---

## Special considerations

### Elderly patients or those with cardiovascular disease

In elderly patients or those with cardiovascular disease, **start low and titrate slowly** to avoid arrhythmias [^114q7F9o] [^111CMEpL].

---

### Patients with persistent symptoms despite biochemical euthyroidism

If symptoms persist despite biochemical euthyroidism, **evaluate for non-thyroid causes** and avoid unnecessary dose increases [^112wUhU4] [^114gSiVd].

---

## Management of low TSH with normal free T4 and T3 on levothyroxine

| **Step** | **Action** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm adherence and absorption | Rule out preventable causes of low TSH [^113AV4mB] [^113YhKa3] |
| 2 | Reduce dose by 12.5–25 mcg | Correct overtreatment and reduce risks [^111CMEpL] |
| 3 | Recheck TSH and free T4 in 6–8 weeks | Ensure biochemical control [^114BCykN] |
| 4 | Titrate to TSH 0.5–2.5 mIU/L | Maintain euthyroidism [^notfound] |
| 5 | Monitor every 6–12 months | Maintain stability [^111sQoM3] |

---

## Conclusion

Low TSH with normal free T4 and T3 on levothyroxine 75 mcg/day indicates **over-replacement** [^111CMEpL]. Reduce the dose by 12.5–25 mcg, recheck in 6–8 weeks, and titrate to a TSH of 0.5–2.5 mIU/L to minimize risks of atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis [^113JDiSi].

Levothyroxine dosage — starting dose determinants: When deciding on a starting dose of levothyroxine, the patient's weight, lean body mass, pregnancy status, etiology of hypothyroidism, degree of thyrotropin elevation, age, and general clinical context, including the presence of cardiac disease, should all be considered, and the serum thyrotropin goal appropriate for the clinical situation should also be considered.

Taking together the reported findings, the current guideline recommendation of a standard 1.6 µg/kg LT4 dose does not appear to be fully supported by evidence.

According to the study aim, the results of the present systematic review show that just above one-third of athyreotic patients have normal TSH at their first postsurgery follow-up independently of the strategy used to decide the LT4 starting dose. Despite LT4 therapy being a well-established and safe treatment, achieving euthyroidism at the first postthyroidectomy follow-up remains challenging. Although some differences in terms of euthyroidism rates were reached, previously tested dosing strategies ranging from very simple ones to rather complex algorithms do not fully account for interindividual variability, underscoring the limitations of a one-size-fits-all approach. Further investigation is needed to uncover these factors and develop more precise, individualized dosing algorithms to improve postthyroidectomy management. Future well-controlled and adequately sized prospective studies specifically designed to address this issue should take into account specific participant eligibility criteria including age, BMI, body composition, underlying thyroid disorders, concomitant therapies, causes of malabsorption, comorbidities, and patient compliance.

### Study protocol; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^116GLqG2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The dose is changed according to the serum TSH level as follows; 6–8 weeks after randomisation a blood sample is taken for serum TSH, with three possible actions:
TSH < 0.4 mU/L: treatment dose reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – blinding maintained by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose; these patients will have a further check TSH after 6–8 weeks; if TSH remains < 0.4 mU/L patient will be withdrawn from randomised treatment.
TSH ≥ 0.4 and < 4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose; patient to be reviewed at 12 months.
TSH remains elevated (≥ 4.6 mU/L): additional 25 micrograms levothyroxine, giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

Titration of dose of levothyroxine (25 micrograms increments) against serum TSH is repeated up to a maximum of two occasions, at 6–8 week intervals, with a check of serum TSH performed at 6–8 weeks after all dose titrations. The investigators remained masked to the results of TSH measurements throughout the course of the study.

The above process (but with only a single up-titration) is repeated at 12 months (plus or minus 1 month) then annually (at 24 and 36 months plus or minus 1 month). The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine that is prescribed is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration (by computer algorithm) is performed in the placebo group aiming for approximately the same frequency as that likely to be required in the levothyroxine-treated group. We have adopted an adaptive schedule, in which the data centre allocates the same proportion of placebo patients to have dose adjustment (up and down) as are required in the levothyroxine group. This ensures that the burden of assessment, and number of tablets to be taken, is the same in both the levothyroxine and placebo groups. The computer generated allocation also ensures that the clinical investigators remain blind to treatment allocation.

Levothyroxine dosing and monitoring — primary hypothyroidism: Except in secondary (central) hypothyroidism, dose titration is guided by serum thyrotropin (TSH), with the "target TSH typically being 0.5 to 3.5 or 4 mIU/L". "Dose adjustments are usually made 4–6 weeks after initiating therapy", typically in increments of "12.5–25 μg/d", and "the serum TSH is then repeated in 4–6 weeks, until the TSH target has been reached". Ongoing monitoring is advised as "serum TSH should be measured in 4–6 months and then at 12 months to assure stability". In patients with coronary artery disease, initiation should be conservative: "Patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) should always be started on a low LT4 dose (12.5–25 μg/d), with gradual increases based on symptoms and serum TSH levels".

Different levothyroxine products and serum TSH — Because use of different levothyroxine products may sometimes be associated with altered serum TSH values, a change in an identifiable formulation of levothyroxine (brand name or generic) should be followed by re-evaluation of serum TSH at steady state. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### Treatment of hypothyroidism [^115ZzzzT]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease affects up to 0.5 percent of the population of the United States. Its prevalence is higher in women and the elderly. The management of hypothyroidism focuses on ensuring that patients receive appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy and monitoring their response. Hormone replacement should be initiated in a low dosage, especially in the elderly and in patients prone to cardiac problems. The dosage should be increased gradually, and laboratory values should be monitored six to eight weeks after any dosage change. Once a stable dosage is achieved, annual monitoring of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is probably unnecessary, except in older patients. After full replacement of thyroxine (T4) using levothyroxine, the addition of triiodothyronine (T3) in a low dosage may be beneficial in some patients who continue to have mood or memory problems. The management of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (a high TSH in the presence of normal free T4 and T3 levels) remains controversial. In these patients, physicians should weigh the benefits of replacement (e.g., improved cardiac function) against problems that can accompany the excessive use of levothyroxine (e.g., osteoporosis).

Hospitalized but not critically ill patients starting or increasing levothyroxine — therapeutic goal: The therapeutic goal of levothyroxine replacement in non-critically ill patients is long-term normalization of serum thyrotropin when steady-state thyroid hormone levels are achieved, and levothyroxine should not be titrated to serum free thyroxine levels unless serum thyrotropin cannot be relied upon. Strong recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### Levothyroxine: conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^114PQwXT]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Although combined treatment sounds promising, the results from clinical trials comparing monotherapy and combined therapy are conflicting. In a previous study involving 19 patients, the TSH levels were normalized only when patients' T3 levels were not significantly different from those of controls. The results are inconsistent with those of more recent double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Four systematic reviews and meta-analyses based on RCTs failed to show any advantages in quality of life, mood states, or psychometric performance for patients receiving combination therapy. Although previous meta-analyses reported a preference for combined therapy by patients, a more recent meta-analysis based on 7 blinded RCTs did not support this conclusion, suggesting that T3 may serve as a "placebo" and raise patients' expectations in some nonblinded studies. Taken together, as recommended by the American Thyroid Association, "the use of combined replacement therapy, with the administration of both LT4 and liothyronine (LT3), is generally not recommended due to the low quality of the available evidence. A trial may be considered in those patients with normal values of serum TSH who continue to complain of symptoms of hypothyroidism. Also, in these cases, the presence of coexistent nonthyroid problems should be first ruled out". We further recommend discussing the financial burdens with these patients while addressing concomitant diseases and mitigating their unrealistic expectations.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^114BCykN]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — dose adjustment and monitoring: Dose adjustments are guided by serum TSH determinations 4–8 weeks following initiation of therapy, dosage adjustments, or change in the L‑thyroxine preparation. While TSH levels may decline within a month of initiating therapy with doses of L‑thyroxine such as 50 or 75 μg, making adjustments with smaller doses may require 8 weeks or longer before TSH levels begin to plateau, and increment changes of 12.5–25 μg are initially made. Once an adequate replacement dosage has been determined, periodic follow‑up evaluations with repeat TSH testing at 6‑month and then 12‑month intervals are appropriate, and some clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism may take up to 3–6 months to resolve after serum TSH has returned to normal.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic modeling: a novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^113NVeoS]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study to suggest LT4 dosage adjustment based on repeated fT4 and TSH measurements during the first two weeks after thyroidectomy. Application of the DAT enabled the clinician to make appropriate dosage adjustments after only two weeks. It is hard to compare the performance of our model directly against other published dosage schemes, because they all use the entire TSH reference range as goal achievement, while we used a narrower TSH target also for replacement therapy. The reason we did not include TSH range > 2.0 mIU/L in our targets was that high normal TSH values are associated with comorbidity, and to make our TSH targets more applicable to all diagnoses in the study, including cancer. The study was thus not designed to evaluate our model against other published dosage schemes, but to evaluate whether computerized modeling would allow meaningful early LT4 dose adjustments, before a steady state is reached. When recalculating our eight-week data for patients with goiter using the entire TSH reference range as goal achievement, we found, however, that our model outperforms other published dosage schemes. Care must be taken when interpreting these data, as the number of patients is low both in our study groups and in comparable studies.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^115a2k8B]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

Strength of guidance is stated as "Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence".

Levothyroxine (LT4) potency, substitution, and monitoring — recommendations and cautions: Since 2007 the FDA has required that LT4 preparations maintain 95%–105% of their stated potency, revised from a prior requirement of 90%–110%, throughout their shelf life, and has required that all LT4 products be reassessed as though they were new drugs. When a generic or branded LT4 meets these criteria, the FDA has determined that preparations can be substituted by the pharmacy unless dispensed as written. The three endocrine societies recommend repeat thyroid function testing when a patient is switched from one LT4 preparation to another to ensure that the goal TSH and FT4 and T3 concentrations are achieved, and it is recommended that, once the therapeutic target is reached, the patient should remain on the same medication and, if possible, on the same dose and preparation of medication to the extent possible. It seems reasonable to keep a patient on a given product and, if a change is necessary, TSH levels should be rechecked; in patients with thyroid cancer, it is important to maintain LT4 product stability when a desired goal TSH is relevant for possible disease recurrence or progression.

### Levothyroxine monotherapy: what works better for the individual with hypothyroidism? [^114gSiVd]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

I explore objective data not supporting the addition of liothyronine (medication) (LT3) to levothyroxine (medication) (LT4) in patients with hypothyroidism. Accurate identification of patients with symptomatic (almost exclusively overt) hypothyroidism is important in evaluating clinical outcomes of therapies. Recent studies have documented that nearly a third of individuals who are offered thyroid hormone are euthyroid at the time of initiation. Additionally, others are clinically diagnosed without biochemical confirmation, so a sizable proportion of those started on LT4 are not hypothyroid. The assumption that nonhypothyroid symptoms will resolve with LT4 is problematic. The true underlying cause of these symptoms remains unidentified and untreated.

Methods

In a narrative fashion I will review the positive predictive value of and correlation of symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism and confirmed hypothyroidism likely to favorably respond to thyroid hormone replacement.

Results

Following a review of the reliability of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in predicting a euthyroid state, the correlation of circulating triiodothyronine (serum measurement) (T3) levels with symptoms and predictive value of T3 to forecast the outcome of adding LT3 to LT4 will be reviewed. The utility of striving for high, middle, or low TSH set points within the expected range to predict changes in clinical quality of life and the ability of blinded patients to sense subtle differences along this spectrum will be documented. In addition, the clinical impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the type 2 deiodinase gene will be reviewed. Finally, the overall satisfaction of selected patients with their thyroid hormone treatments will be outlined and preferences for T3-containing treatments from blinded studies will be summarized.

Conclusion

Basing thyroid hormone treatment decisions on patient symptoms likely results in missed diagnoses We should encourage primary care physicians to assess a differential diagnosis, exclude other diagnoses, and not assume a thyroid etiology when TSH is normal. Modifying treatment to a particular TSH target or adjusting based on a low T3 level does not seem to enhance patient outcomes. Finally, pending further trials of "symptomatic" participants, using sustained release LT3 to mimic normal physiology, and including monocarboxylate 10 transporter and Type 2 deiodinase polymorphisms and objective outcomes, I will continue to depend on therapy with LT4 monotherapy and seek alternative explanations for my patients' nonspecific symptoms.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^117Tv9cU]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine dosing frequency and adherence — once-weekly and twice-weekly regimens: A randomized cross-over trial of once weekly oral administration of 7 times the usual daily levothyroxine (LT4) dose versus daily dosing found weekly therapy produced supratherapeutic T4 for about 24 hours while T3 remained within the reference range, and over 6 weeks other biochemical and clinical markers, including patient symptoms, did not differ from daily therapy. A second similar 6-week cross-over trial showed greater increases in T4 after weekly dosing than daily dosing without symptoms or echocardiographic evidence of hyperthyroidism. For patients in whom daily LT4 intake is unsuccessful, options include observed therapy or reducing the frequency of LT4 ingestion to twice weekly or weekly with a starting dose equal to the weight‑adjusted daily regimen (i.e., 7 times the daily dose); parenteral LT4 is also possible, although no trials were identified.

Pregnancy — levothyroxine therapy for overt hypothyroidism should be titrated to trimester-specific thyrotropin targets, with serial serum thyrotropin assessed every 4 weeks during the first half of pregnancy and reassessed during the second half; for women already taking levothyroxine, two additional doses per week (one extra dose twice weekly with several days separation) may be started as soon as pregnancy is confirmed; Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Trimester thyrotropin reference ranges are provided as 0.1–2.5 mIU/L (first), 0.2–3.0 mIU/L (second), and 0.3–3.0 mIU/L (third). Thyroid function should be monitored every 4–6 weeks at least for the first and second trimesters and also reassessed during the third trimester, and up to 70% of women will require adjustments of 30% or more from the preconception dose.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — initial L‑thyroxine dosing: With initial thyroid hormone replacement, replacement therapy requires approximately 1.6 μg/kg of L‑thyroxine daily; patients who are athyreotic and those with central hypothyroidism may require higher doses, while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or after treatment for Graves' disease may require less. In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH > 12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete

Start LEVO-T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of LEVO-T is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of LEVO-T may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start LEVO-T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of LEVO-T dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate LEVO-T dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^116vxZgc]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) bioequivalence — FDA criteria and clinical assessment: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines an LT4 formulation as equivalent if the 90% confidence interval of the difference of the pharmacokinetically derived areas under the curve (AUC) and difference of maximal concentrations (Cmax) of serum T4 fall within 80%–125% of a reference product when a comparable dose is administered to healthy volunteers, and in this analysis the LT4 dose is only tested at a single oral dose of 600 μg. The guideline states this definition is problematic because it does not require assessment of serum TSH and because 600 μg is pharmacologic, and proposes assessing comparable serum T4, T3, and TSH after daily dosing for at least 4–6 weeks in athyroid individuals; simulation studies also support TSH-based protocols for judging bioequivalence rather than pharmacokinetic indices.

Impaired Bioavailability and Malabsorption of Oral LT4 Tablets

The tablet form is the predominant preparation of LT4, accounting for more than 95% of LT4 prescriptions. Generally, a dose of LT4 of 1.6 to 1.8 µg/kg body weight is sufficient for the normalization of thyroid function. Unfortunately, more than 30% to 50% of LT4-treated patients are estimated to be either undertreated or overtreated. Impaired bioavailability of LT4 is a common cause of off-target serum TH levels and has been reported in patients with many medical conditions, including concurrent diseases, coingestion with drugs or food, a switch in the LT4 preparation, improper storage, or poor compliance. Patients will present with elevated TSH levels, and reduced T3 and T4 levels and thus require a dose adjustment (> 1.9 µg/kg). Identification of the underlying cause is required to eliminate hypothyroid symptoms (Fig. 2).

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

Intervention

The investigational medicinal products are levothyroxine sodium (T4) as 25 or 50 microgram tablets for oral administration and a matching placebo. All tablets are white and round in shape with the strength imprinted, identically packaged in blisters and packed in plain cardboard cartons to maintain study blinding. Participants are advised to take the suggested dose of study medication once daily half an hour before breakfast.

The intervention group will start with levothyroxine 50 micrograms daily (25 micrograms in participants with < 50 kg body weight or with a history of coronary heart disease) and the control group with matching placebo for six to 8 weeks.

After 6–8 weeks a venous blood sample is taken for TSH assessment. Based on the TSH results, the data centre advises the new dose of study medication or placebo to the clinical investigators.
If TSH < 0.4 mU/L: the treatment dose is reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – effected by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose. These participants will have a further TSH check after 6–8 weeks. If TSH remains < 0.4 mU/L participant will be withdrawn from randomised treatment and referred to usual care.
If TSH ≥ 0.4 and < 4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose.
If TSH remains elevated (≥ 4.6 mU/L): 25 micrograms of levothyroxine will be added. Giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^111esriY]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Children in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests)

Therapy may begin at full replacement doses in otherwise healthy individuals less than 50 years old and in those older than 50 years who have been recently treated for hyperthyroidism or who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg/kg/day (e.g., 100–125 mcg/day for a 70 kg adult). Older patients may require less than 1 mcg/kg/day. Levothyroxine sodium doses greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and/or drug interactions.

For most patients older than 50 years or for patients under 50 years of age with underlying cardiac disease, an initial starting dose of 25–50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended, with gradual increments in dose at 6–8 week intervals, as needed. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is 12.5–25 mcg/day, with gradual dose increments at 4–6 week intervals. The levothyroxine sodium dose is generally adjusted in 12.5–25 mcg increments until the patient with primary hypothyroidism is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH has normalized.

In patients with severe hypothyroidism, the recommended initial levothyroxine sodium dose is 12.5–25 mcg/day with increases of 25 mcg/day every 2–4 weeks, accompanied by clinical and laboratory assessment, until the TSH level is normalized.

In patients with secondary (pituitary) or tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, the levothyroxine sodium dose should be titrated until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

Symptoms and TSH in levothyroxine-treated patients — In levothyroxine (LT4) users, a cross-sectional analysis of 697 patients taking LT4 showed a correlation between higher thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and more hypothyroid symptoms, even within the subset of 43 patients who were overtly euthyroid; however, another cross-sectional study did not find a relationship between well-being and TSH categories of less than and greater than 2 mIU/L, and a randomized, controlled cross-over trial of three LT4 dose targets reported no differences in the major outcomes of patient preference. A nonrandomized open-label study noted symptomatic improvement on an LT4 dose 50 μg higher than the optimal dose with low TSH, yet the summary states that patients treated with LT4 to euthyroid TSH goals may experience more symptoms than people without treated hypothyroidism, and increasing LT4 dose does not affect these symptoms. Psychological distress among those referred for thyroid testing was approximately twice as high as in the general population under physician care, with 54% versus 19% having GHQ scores > 3.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic modeling: a novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^117MxN5T]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

The consequences of efficient dosage adjustments after thyroidectomy in terms of work capacity, sick leave, quality of life, or other patient-reported outcomes have to be determined before we know whether a minimum of five postoperative blood draws is acceptable. The number is comparable with routine follow-up in the first author's clinic before development of the DAT (Supplemental Data). There is, however large variation in the reported number of necessary dosage adjustments after thyroidectomy, probably reflecting that optimal care is yet to be established. We believe that the advantages of the DAT outweigh the extra cost of early blood samples, for example by reducing the number of follow-up visits and shortening the dosage adjustment period. In addition, further refinement of our model could lower the number of needed samples.

The failure of the simplified DAT to improve dosage for thyrotoxic patients suggests that individual fT4-TSH estimations are necessary to achieve successful dosage with our model. The majority of the patients in the thyrotoxicosis group had a totally suppressed TSH before surgery and were still on anti-thyroid hormone drugs. Slow recovery of normal TSH dynamics after prolonged suppression made our model vulnerable to mistakes, as it relied heavily on initial blood samples. In addition, our assumption that a log-linear relationship exists between TSH and fT4 may not be valid for this group. The overall altered metabolism in patients with Graves' disease could also be changing during the course of follow-up, making initial estimations invalid later on.

In conclusion, application of the DAT for LT4 dosage was superior to clinician dosage adjustment in patients who were euthyroid before total thyroidectomy. Further studies should include patient-reported outcome measures and investigate whether faster dosage adjustment has direct implications for health or quality of life.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

Antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy in pregnancy — monitoring and regimen selection emphasizes monthly assessment with dose adjustment, using the lowest effective ATD dose, avoiding block-replacement with levothyroxine, titrating primarily to free T4 rather than TSH, and monitoring both mother and fetus. Thyroid function should be assessed at least monthly with ATD dose adjustment; the dose of ATD should be kept as low as possible; block-replacement therapy consisting of ATD plus levothyroxine should not be used in pregnancy and, if still needed, therapy should be changed to an ATD alone; free T4 is most closely correlated with good fetal outcome and serum TSH should not be used as sole guide; maternal thyroid function should be monitored frequently with noninvasive fetal assessment to balance therapy for acceptable thyroid function in mother and fetus.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^1156ZVou]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Total thyroidectomy requires lifelong replacement therapy with levothyroxine (LT4). Achieving optimal thyroid hormones replacement promptly after surgery is important but somehow challenging. Indeed, previous studies addressing this topic clearly indicate that a significant proportion of patients who are started on LT4 therapy for postthyroidectomy hypothyroidism require multiple dose adjustments over time. The clinical scenario is thus how we should choose the starting LT4 dose in patients just after total thyroidectomy to warrant the highest rate of euthyroidism at the first postsurgery evaluation. While initial investigations used fixed LT4 doses, revised and eventually adjusted at early follow-up, more recent studies propose potential tailored approaches to more precisely estimate the optimal LT4 dose. Current clinical guidelines on the treatment of primary hypothyroidism recommend that when choosing a starting dose of LT4, several factors including patient's weight, lean body mass, etiology of hypothyroidism, degree of thyrotropin elevation, age, and comorbidities (ie, particularly cardiac diseases) should all be taken into account. Most papers suggest that in athyreotic patients, a starting LT4 dose of 1.6 to 1.8 mcg/kg of body weight would be adequate, even though other authors have advocated for a higher starting dose of 2.0 to 2.1 mcg/kg, at least in selected settings.

There is general agreement that the etiology sustaining hypothyroidism impacts on the optimal LT4 dose, making athyreotic patients, owing to the lack of residual functional thyroid tissue, more likely to require a higher LT4 dose as compared to patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Furthermore, the therapeutic target of TSH may vary in relation to the underlying condition, such as in patients with thyroid cancer who may require higher LT4 doses (ie, TSH-suppressive therapy). In addition, from the patient's standpoint, promptly achieving euthyroidism can provide clinical benefits in terms of both well-being and reduction of further clinical consultations. Although the number of studies in this field is significant, no clear and solid information is available about the optimal LT4 starting dose to be used in athyreotic subjects with no (or at least minor) need for further adjustment over time.

Diverse causes potentially underlie decreased quality of life in biochemically euthyroid patients treated for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine. Once these contributing factors are addressed, if symptoms persist, there may be benefit to personalized use of combination therapy adding liothyronine. This approach should be carefully monitored: avoiding overtreatment and ensuring that therapy is only continued if it improves patient-reported quality of life. Most randomized clinical trials have not shown benefits, perhaps because of not targeting the most symptomatic patients. Sustained-release liothyronine preparations may soon be available for optimally designed studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism in select patients.

### Levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism based on thyroid function: a 10-year clinical retrospective study [^1122y35z]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

In our retrospective observation of patients administered individualized dosages of levothyroxine according to their initial TSH level at diagnosis, after 1 month, there were four patients (10.8%) in group A, one patient (3.8%) in group B, four patients (23.5%) in group C, and three patients (8.3%) in group D who did not reach the normal TSH level. Furthermore, there were eight patients (21.6%) in group A, one patient (3.8%) in group B, and one patient (2.7%) in group D who had an FT4 level beyond the upper limit of normal values at 1 month following treatment. At the follow-up time, the dosage of levothyroxine for each patient was adjusted according to thyroid function, and their thyroid function eventually returned to a normal range. Our study suggests that to reduce the risk of levothyroxine overdose, individualized levothyroxine dosage should be adjusted. Currently, there is no exact dosage for patients with different TSH levels; however, for most patients with mildly elevated TSH, low-dose thyroxine could restore their TSH level to normal 1 month after treatment. It is critical to follow up regularly during treatment to monitor thyroid function and adjust the thyroxine dosage to maintain thyroid function within the normal range.

Research performed by Soliman et al. (2012) revealed that 25% of the patients (n = 45) treated with a high dose of levothyroxine (10–15 μg/kg·d) developed hyperthyroidism. Craven and Frank (2018) reported that a high initial levothyroxine dosage (> 12.5 μg/kg·d) may have caused hyperthyroidism. After a period of follow-up, more than half of the patients required a reduction in their dosage; thus, the authors suggested reducing the initial dosage to avoid overtreatment. Nevertheless, comparative studies between individualized treatment and high initial dosage treatment are scarce. We explored the correlation between levothyroxine dosage and patient thyroid function and between thyroid function restoration time and patient TSH levels after individualized treatment through a clinical retrospective study.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty Are Complete

Start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of EUTHYROX is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 mcg per day to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg per day to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of EUTHYROX may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg per day to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of EUTHYROX dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 (L-thyroxine) level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate EUTHYROX dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, ETA 2018 guidelines recommend to assess the adequacy of replacement therapy 6–8 weeks after initiation of levothyroxine therapy with concomitant free T4 and TSH measurements in patients with CeH, provided that blood is withdrawn before the morning replacement dose or at least 4 hours after the levothyroxine administration. Aim to maintain free T4 levels above the median value of the normal range.

Measurements of TSH and fT4 from a subset of the RCT population (left) and two example patients (center and right) during the first two weeks after thyroidectomy. Hyper parameters of the Bayesian regression lines estimated from the pilot population used to develop our model. For estimation of individual TSH/fT4 relationships a Bayesian regression model was used instead of OLS to compensate for the low number of samples and for censoring. Center: A patient without detectable TSH, naive OLS would give flat/no response. The Bayesian model gives more plausible estimate with response extending below censoring limit, slope is informed by population data. Right: Bayesian slope is less steep than naive patient specific OLS as informed by population data. fT4, free thyroxine; OLS, ordinary least squares; RCT, randomized controlled trial; TSH, thyrotropin.

FIG. 2.
Study design for randomized controlled validation trial. After total thyroidectomy, the surgeon chose an LT4 starting dosage based on diagnose and clinical routine. TSH and fT4 was measured four times the next two weeks to allow early dosage adjustment. The patients were randomized to the application of a DAT or not (control) for dosage adjustments that were supervised by an experienced endocrine surgeon in either case. Eight weeks after surgery, successful dosage adjustment was evaluated based on TSH measurements. If the TSH target was not achieved, the patient continued six-week dosage adjustment cycles. DAT, decision aid tool.

FIG. 3.
Output from the DAT guided the clinician to increase LT4 dosage 20 days after thyroidectomy, when the DAT was applied in this example patient (same as in Fig. 1, right). A near twofold increase in dosage is suggested to reach the target of TSH < 0.10 mIU/L. The plots show the actual measurements of fT4 (A) and TSH (B) alongside the model estimates. The suggested dosages and the projected responses are also shown to facilitate evaluation from the clinician before deciding on the final dosage.

Eight weeks after surgery (i.e. 5–6 weeks after the first follow-up), blood tests were again evaluated. If the TSH target was reached, they left the study and continued follow-ups by surgeons, endocrinologists, or general practitioners, according to local routines. If the TSH target was not reached, the participants entered loops of follow-up every six weeks until the TSH target was reached (Fig. 2). On each follow-up, the DAT was applied only to the DAT group.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

Cost versus benefit

The average follow-up period in the study was 127 ± 6.4 days, or ∼18 weeks, ranging from 47 to 468 days. The average number of postoperative blood draws in this period was 6.6 ± 0.15, and the average number of follow-up visits was 3.6 ± 0.14 (Table 3). For goiter and cancer groups, the application of the DAT reduced the number of blood draws needed [t = 2.47, p = 0.02 and t (50) = 3.14, p = 0.003 respectively] and the number of follow-up visits [t = 2.16, p = 0.04 and t (50) = 3.15, p = 0.003] as compared with their respective controls. As our RCT did not have a control arm with an ordinary standard of care, we made a comparison with retrospective data from a similar population operated three years before the DAT study (Supplementary Table S1). Lab records from these patients showed that the average number of blood draws before the TSH targets were reached was 8.6, which is higher than for patients in the current RCT (Supplemental Data).

Results

The DAT was tested in a validation RCT on patients diagnosed with goiter and differentiated thyroid cancer, and the simplified DAT was tested on patients with thyrotoxicosis. There was no statistical difference between the DAT and control groups in the basic characteristics of the groups, nor in the initial and final dosages of LT4 (Table 1, multiple t -tests, uncorrected p -values > 0.15 for all variables). Most patients with cancer received TSH suppression, while all patients with goiter and most patients with thyrotoxicosis received replacement therapy. There was no difference in clinically decided TSH targets between DAT and controls (all patients with goiter had the same TSH target, Pearson Chi-square p = 0.58 for cancer and p = 0.61 for thyrotoxicosis).

Faster dosage adjustment with DAT in patients with goiter and cancer

For all RCT-groups together, 24 of 68 patients (35%) had reached their narrow TSH targets eight weeks after surgery if the dosage adjustment was assisted by the DAT, in contrast to 10 of 67 patients (15%) in the control group (Chi-square = 7.43, p = 0.006). As the applied DAT for thyrotoxic patients used a simplified population based fT4 target, in contrast to the individually estimated fT4 targets for patients with goiter and cancer, all further analysis was done on subgroups. Forty percent of patients with goiter and 59% of patients with cancer in DAT groups were within the TSH target after 8 weeks compared with 0% and 19% in control groups, respectively (Fig. 4A, Chi-squares 7.94, p = 0.005 and 8.87, p = 0.003). To make our results more comparable with other published dosage schemes, we also calculated the proportion of patients with goiter with TSH within the normal reference range rather than within the narrower TSH goal (0.5–2.0 mIU/L) used in the study. The reference range was 0.2–4.3, 0.3–3.7 or 0.4–4.5 mIU/L depending on the recruiting hospital. After 8 weeks, 80% of patients with DAT had TSH values within the normal range, which was significantly higher than 19% of controls (Chi-square 9.31, p = 0.002).

### Evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of different levothyroxine preparations in the treatment of human thyroid disease [^114cuoXF]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

At the present time, optimal therapy for hypothyroidism requires replacement of the deficiency in thyroid hormone with synthetic levothyroxine. Precise titration of this narrow therapeutic index drug is necessary to return the patient to a chemically and clinically euthyroid state. Seven levothyroxine formulations are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and four are available to the physician. Proper dosage is established based on thyrotropin (TSH) testing and clinical evaluation. Each levothyroxine preparation must comply with FDA standards for bioavailability but may vary with respect to its dissolution and absorption properties and are not interchangeable. This equivalence testing is done on normal volunteers and requires a suprapharmacologic dose of levothyroxine in order to make the determination of bioavailability. In this review we discuss the various methods to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and bioequivalence of levothyroxine preparations in the treatment of thyroid disease. These are relevant to the physician and patient because small differences in the efficacy can produce unwanted effects of either underreplacement or overreplacement.

Technical remarks note that Free T4 is the parameter that has been most closely correlated with good fetal outcome and that serum TSH may still be suppressed and should not be used as the guide in treatment, although normalization of maternal TSH during ATD therapy may indicate a need to reduce the dose of ATD. ATD plus levothyroxine should not be used in pregnancy; if a woman receiving such therapy becomes pregnant, therapy should be changed to an ATD alone.

Levothyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations — clinical significance of within‑reference‑range T3 changes: The significance of perturbations in serum triiodothyronine concentrations within the reference range or of mildly low serum triiodothyronine concentrations is unknown. According to the current model, normalizing serum thyroid‑stimulating hormone (TSH) is generally considered the target of therapy, and serum T3 is typically not measured or monitored, and direct evidence on whether small decrements in plasma T3 have clinically important sequelae is lacking. Some data in humans suggest maintenance of serum T3 concentrations is clinically important; for example, in one study of 15 athyreotic patients taking LT4, a progressive 50% fall in T3 induced by PTU over 8 days led to a doubling of TSH even though T4 was constant.

Hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine (LT4) — serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels relative to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) normalization are described as follows: Patients with hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine to achieve normal serum TSH values may have serum triiodothyronine concentrations that are at the lower end of the reference range, or even below the reference range, and the clinical significance of this is unknown. LT4 is an effective, convenient, and cost-effective treatment for hypothyroidism. The evidence base includes at least eight studies examining serum T3 levels in humans being treated with LT4, although only two were prospective. In cross-sectional comparisons, despite similar TSH values, LT4-treated patients had significantly lower T3 concentrations than controls.

Introduction

An estimated 5of the population require thyroxine replacement therapy due to thyroid dysfunction or surgery. In the United States, levothyroxine (LT4) has been among the three most prescribed medications for years. Surprisingly, dosage adjustment remains a significant clinical problem even though LT4 has been on the market for almost seven decades and was first synthesized in 1927. The time to achieve euthyroidism after thyroidectomy is often more than a year. The long interval could be due to the long half-life of LT4 (about one week), the narrow therapeutic window, variations in bioavailability and pharmacodynamics, and nonadherence. Long-term hypothyroidism and iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis have implications for cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, quality of life, neurological disease, dementia, cancer treatment, and even mortality. Shorter periods with suboptimal dosage are more likely to affect quality of life, work capacity and have social consequences.

Several attempts have been made to predict the required LT4 dosage after thyroidectomy or in treatment of hypothyroidism. The published dosage schemes are variations of weighted relationships between LT4 dosage and person weight, height, sex, age, and drug interactions. At best, they retrospectively predict the correct dosage for 60–65% of the patients. However, prospective testing of the formulas is limited and often provides inferior results. Leaving a priori dosage estimates behind, we decided to use a patient-tailored approach that estimates the free thyroxine (fT4) pharmacokinetics and the thyrotropin (TSH)/fT4 relationship for each individual patient based on repeated blood samples. We hypothesized that rather than waiting six to eight weeks for hormone levels to stabilize, dosage adjustments after only two weeks would be feasible if the clinician was assisted by a computerized decision aid tool (DAT) predicting the future fT4 and TSH responses. We further assumed that the best prediction could be done by combining population data and the results of individual blood samples drawn during the first two weeks after thyroidectomy. The objective of the study was to test whether application of the DAT led to more efficient dosage adjustments for patients starting LT4 therapy after total thyroidectomy, as compared with randomized controls.

### Optimal levothyroxine dosing strategy for immune checkpoint inhibitor-related hypothyroidism: a retrospective study [^1163XWD9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related hypothyroidism is mostly irreversible and prompt thyroid hormone replacement therapy is crucial, especially for patients undergoing neoadjuvant immunotherapy.

Objective

This study aimed to propose a novel titration strategy for ICI-related hypothyroidism, evaluate levothyroxine (LT4) dose differences between hypothyroidism patterns, and develop a predictive equation for the optimal LT4 dose.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Tertiary academic hospital.

Patients

109 patients with ICI-related hypothyroidism.

Interventions

Rapid versus conventional titration strategy.

Main Outcome Measures

The time to achieve normal free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.

Results

Patients with transient thyrotoxicosis followed by overt hypothyroidism (Toxic-OHypo) required higher LT4 doses to achieve a euthyroid state compared to isolated overt hypothyroidism, with a mean difference of 0.23 μg/kg/day (95% confidence interval, 0.08–0.38). In patients with ICI-related overt hypothyroidism and no cardiac disease, who had elevated TSH levels within 4 weeks of the last documented low or normal TSH, a rapid titration strategy was implemented. This strategy significantly improved the cumulative incidence of achieving normal FT4 and TSH levels compared to conventional titration strategy (hazard ratio [HR], 4.44; 95% CI, 2.24–8.82; HR, 4.11; 95% CI, 2.18–7.73, respectively), with a comparable safety profile. Predicted LT4 dose at euthyroid state (µg/kg/day) = (-0.016×body weight) + (0.109×baseline TSH level) + 2.661 for patients with Toxic-OHypo.

Conclusions

LT4 requirements vary depending on the subtype of ICI-related hypothyroidism. The rapid titration strategy reduced the time to achieve a euthyroid state without a significant increase in adverse effects compared to conventional LT4 replacement therapy.

### Levothyroxine sodium (Levo-T) [^111sQoM3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer

Generally, TSH is suppressed to below 0.1 IU per liter, and this usually requires a LEVO-T dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be lower.

2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of LEVO-T may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dose. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.

Pediatrics

In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in children as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dose stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of LEVO-T therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of LEVO-T [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^117P4p5a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

All studies were conducted in referral hospital centers. The normal TSH range was reported by all studies, with most using 0.4 to 4.5, while only 1 study applied a 0.4 to 2.5 range. For tumors, different risk categories were considered: low risk (0.5–2), intermediate risk (0.1–0.5), and high risk (< 0.1). Of the 11 studies included, 7 analyzed patients using a single LT4 dosing method: 2 studies used a dose/kg approach, 3 applied a fixed-dose regimen, and 2 employed an algorithm-based method. In the remaining 4 studies, multiple groups of patients received different dosing strategies: 3 compared 2 groups (1 using a dose/kg method and the other an algorithm-based approach) and 1 examined 4 groups using a dose/kg method but with a different TSH target according to their disease.

As a result, the 11 studies yielded 17 patient groups. Among them, 3 groups followed a fixed-dose regimen [2 receiving 100 mcg, 1 receiving 150 mcg], 9 groups used a dose/kg approach, and 5 groups applied an algorithm-based calculation.

A detailed description of the algorithm-based approaches is reported in Supplemental Material 3.

All studies reported the number of euthyroid patients at the first control, which was typically conducted at 6 to 8 weeks, with the widest timeframe being 4 to 15 weeks.

Quantitative Analysis (Meta-analysis)

The pooled proportion of patients achieving target thyroid hormone levels at the first postthyroidectomy follow-up was 33.9% (803/2577 patients), with a confidence interval from 29.3% to 38.5% (Fig. 2). The analysis included 17 different study populations, demonstrating substantial heterogeneity (I² = 82.68%). A comparative analysis based on key study characteristics was performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity (Table 2).

Central hypothyroidism in pregnancy — monitoring and levothyroxine dosing: We recommend that clinicians monitor fT4 or total T4 levels every 4–6 weeks for women with CH who become pregnant and that these women may require increased L-T4 doses to maintain pregnancy targets. Many women with primary hypothyroidism require significant (20–50%) increases in L-T4 doses early in pregnancy, with current recommendations to increase L-T4 by two extra pills per week upon confirming pregnancy; however, women with CH may not require the same degree of dose escalation. If pregnancy-specific fT4 reference ranges are not available, clinicians can use total T4 reference ranges adjusted upward by 50%; in CH, serum TSH is not useful for monitoring, so clinicians should use either fT4 or total T4, and an alternative approach is to monitor total T4 adjusting the nonpregnant reference range upward by 50%.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^116SXxfK]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

General Principles

The goal of replacement therapy is to achieve and maintain a clinical and biochemical euthyroid state. The goal of suppressive therapy is to inhibit growth and/or function of abnormal thyroid tissue. The dose of LEVOTHROID®that is adequate to achieve these goals depends on a variety of factors including the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions, including pregnancy, concomitant medications, and the specific nature of the condition being treated (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Hence, the following recommendations serve only as dosing guidelines. Dosing must be individualized and adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

LEVOTHROID®is administered as a single daily dose, preferably one-half to one hour before breakfast. LEVOTHROID®should be taken at least 4 hours apart from drugs that are known to interfere with its absorption (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Due to the long half-life of levothyroxine, the peak therapeutic effect at a given dose of levothyroxine sodium may not be attained for 4–6 weeks.

Caution should be exercised when administering LEVOTHROID®to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, to the elderly, and to those with concomitant adrenal insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS).

No effect of population-based DAT version for thyrotoxic patients

In the thyrotoxicosis group, we could not reliably estimate individual fT4 targets due to frequent TSH suppression. Instead, we applied a simplified DAT version with a population-based fT4 target. The number of patients who reached their TSH target after 8 weeks was not different between the DAT and control groups (Fig. 5A; Chi-square 1.63, p = 0.20).

To evaluate how the DAT impacted the clinician's decision after two to three weeks, we classified the early adjustments as either in the "right direction" (toward what later became the final dosage) or in the opposite "wrong direction", or as "no change" (Table 2). For all control groups, "no change" was the preferred choice, while adjustments in the right direction was far more common than wrong direction adjustments for all groups. For statistical analysis, the difference between LT4 dosage at any timepoint and the final dosage was calculated for the first 20 weeks (Fig. 4B). After 2 weeks, clinicians made significant adjustments toward the "correct" final dosage for patients with DAT [t (65) = 3.31, p = 0.002], but not for controls [t (65) = 1.00, p = 0.32]. Subgroup analysis revealed that the effect of DAT was present in both goiter [t = 3.16, p = 0.006] and cancer [t = 3.52, p = 0.002] groups. The results from control groups indicate that the experienced clinicians were not able to make significant dose adjustments based on the TSH and fT4 values from the first two weeks without assistance of the DAT. The effect of the DAT in goiter and cancer groups was reflected in the total time to reach TSH targets (Fig. 4C). The average time to reach the TSH targets in the DAT/goiter group was 105 ± 13 days compared with 162 ± 17 days in the control/goiter group [t = t = 2.59, p = 0.016]. The DAT/cancer group reached TSH targets on average 87 ± 10 days after surgery, significantly shorter than 127 ± 13 days in controls [t (49) = 2,48, p = 0.017].

A maximum of two levothyroxine up-titrations at the start of the trial and one up-titration at 12 and 24 month (± 1 month) intervals with repeated TSH measurements after 6–8 weeks ensure adequate levothyroxine treatment while avoiding potential over-replacement. The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration adopting an adaptive schedule is performed in the placebo group by the data centre. A similar proportion of placebo patients will have up and down titrations of study medication as the intervention group to ensure the number of tablets and assessments is similar in both groups.

Because all thyroid function measurements are available only to the data centre, the clinical investigators remain fully blinded to the treatment allocation process during the trial.

Accountability logs recording the quantities of study medication dispensed to and returned from study participants, batch numbers and expiry dates are available for all study drug movements.

Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated study medication:
If overt biochemical hypothyroidism is identified (TSH > 20 mU/L and/or fT4 below the reference range) a second TSH with fT4 within 2 weeks is requested. Upon confirmation of biochemical hypothyroidism the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the General Practitioner (GP) for usual care.
If overt biochemical hyperthyroidism is identified (TSH < 0.4 mU/L) in the placebo group, or consecutively in the treatment group despite downtitrations, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the GP for usual care.
If for clinical reasons (e.g. major illness) a proposed change in study medication or placebo is deemed inappropriate the algorithm is overridden by the local principal coordinator and no change in study medication takes place.

Randomisation

Participants are randomised to either the levothyroxine or placebo treatment arm (ratio 1:1) using the randomly permuted block method, stratified by site, sex and starting dose. The data centre (Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow, Scotland) independently provides the randomisation schedule. Mawdsley Brooks & Co. implements the schedule through identical packaging of levothyroxine and matching placebo tablets.

Patient allocation is conducted via the dedicated trial web portal by the study nurses. When a participant is eligible based on entering the eligibility criteria in an electronic case report form (eCRF) supervised by a medically certified Principle Investigator, a central computer will trigger the decision.

DAT development and validation study design

The DAT was developed on pilot data as described in Supplemental Data. Briefly, the model parameters were derived from four blood draws analyzed for TSH and fT4 obtained during the first two weeks of LT4 therapy. We assumed a log-linear relationship between TSH and fT4, and we modeled individual TSH-fT4 response and fT4 pharmacokinetics informed by population data. Individual TSH-fT4 responses are illustrated in Figure 1. We tested the DAT in a prospective multicenter trial where participants were randomized to either application of the DAT or not (controls). We used an automated stratified randomization based on diagnosis and participating hospital. After surgery, and before randomization, all participants were prescribed an LT4 starting dosage, usually between 100 and 150 μg/day depending on diagnosis, body weight, age, and comorbidity. They were then asked to give pre-LT4 ingestion blood samples twice per week for two weeks postoperatively (Fig. 2). To reduce variation in the measurements and model, patients were instructed to take the medicine and give all blood samples in the morning. On days of blood samples, patients were instructed to delay intake of LT4 until the blood was drawn. Two to three weeks after surgery, the participants received a follow-up call advising them to either keep the current dosage or change it. In the DAT group, the responsible surgeon was assisted by the DAT with a graphical plot of the predicted fT4 and TSH given a suggested dosage change (Fig. 3). The DAT was disabled in the control group, but the same blood samples were available to the clinician. We collected preoperative data about diagnosis, TSH-target, height, weight, age, sex, surgery date, creatinine, albumin, TSH, fT4, and free triiodothyronine. Postoperative data were collected about LT4 dosage, TSH, and fT4.

### Levothyroxine dose and risk of fractures in older adults: nested case-control study [^113JDiSi]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Clinical application of results

As levothyroxine requirements decrease with age, iatrogenic hyperthyroidism is more common in older people. Despite this, studies show that for many people levothyroxine dosage is not adjusted as they age because either monitoring for thyroid dysfunction may be not be carried out or indicated dose adjustments identified by monitoring may not be implemented. While the optimal levothyroxine dose for adults is 1.6–1.8 µg/kg/day, older people often require much lower doses to achieve euthyroidism, and most recommend a reduced dose of 0.5 µg/kg/day in seniors (age > 65 years). While the dosages observed in our study were largely appropriate for younger adults, the average daily doses in the medium and high dose categories (0.076 and 0.122 mg/day) may have exceeded the recommendation for most people aged over 70. It is also possible that levothyroxine treatment may have deleterious effects on bone even in people who are biochemically euthyroid. Recently it has been shown that the risk of vertebral fractures in older adults is increased with serum thyroid stimulating hormone use in the lower range of normal limits. To minimise the risk of fracture further work is necessary to determine whether bone can be affected by "euthyroid" doses of levothyroxine and whether treatment targets need to be adjusted in older people whose true "normal" thyroid stimulating hormone levels may be higher than thought.

### Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the combined preparation of levothyroxine plus sustained-release liothyronine; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^113NmnjG]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Although serum TSH values are comparable and within normal ranges in LT4-treated patients, LT4 as an exogenous pro-drug cannot simulate serum thyroid hormone profile and circadian rhythm in the native euthyroid state. Serum TSH values in the previous clinical trials varied in patients under LT4 + LT3 combination therapy. In this study, serum TSH levels in the intervention group increased to abnormal levels and after adjusting the dosage restored to normal values, which showed insufficient potency in the combined tablets. As was expected and shown in the literature, we found a decline in serum T4/FT4 values in LT4 + SR-T3 treated patients because of lowering LT4 dosages administered to these patients. We found an increase in serum T3 in those who received CBT with 1:5 ratio (group B) in line with the results of about half of the previous clinical trials involving LT4 + LT3 combination therapy indicating an increase in serum T3 compared to LT4-treated patients; however, most of these studies used a plain form of LT3. T3 to T4 ratio increased in the intervention group, however, the ratio was similar to the control group and lower than those with the native euthyroid states in line with a few previous reports.

Introduction

Levothyroxine monotherapy is considered the standard of care for hypothyroidism by professional organizations, whereby the patients achieve the state of euthyroidism through the normalization of TSH, a reliable proxy of euthyroidism. In euthyroid individuals, 80% of T3 (25 µg) is generated from T4 to T3 conversion in kidney and liver cells and 20% (5 µg) is secreted from the thyroid gland. Using levothyroxine (L-T4) alone is expected to be a suitable strategy owing to the peripheral conversion of the pro-hormone T4 into the hormonally active T3 by the deiodinase. Of interest, while this treatment modality is safe, well-tolerated, and extremely effective in normalizing TSH, it may not be sufficient to account for the normal thyroidal secretion of T3 and T4. Approximately 10% lower serum T3 levels in LT4-treated patients compared to euthyroid individuals with similar serum TSH values have been reported previously, leading to the skewed T3:T4 ratio toward an increase of T4, while serum T3 levels are normal to low. The clinical significance of these deviations in thyroid hormones in LT4-treated patients is not clear.

Clinically, a sizable minority of patients adequately treated with LT4 complain of residual symptoms. Higher T4 and lower T3 serum levels reflect a relative imbalance in the thyroid hormone axis homeostasis may be responsible for the persistence of hypothyroid symptoms in some patients. It is unclear to what extent lower serum T3 levels may contribute to the persistent symptoms in hypothyroid patients; however, in an experimental study on thyroidectomized rats with evident tissue hypothyroidism in peripheral cells, tissue euthyroidism occurred only following normalization of serum T3.

The above-mentioned evidence led to the growing interest in combination therapy with LT4 plus liothyronine(LT3); however, multiple randomized controlled clinical trials addressing objective and subjective clinical outcomes did not provide conclusive results. The non-conclusive results, besides heterogeneity in the study population, design, and dosage, may be attributed to the concerns and challenges regarding available oral T3 preparations stemming from the short half-life of T3 with rapid T3 absorption followed by fast metabolization. Despite the lack of definite evidence for the superiority of combination therapy, this strategy remains a common practice in hypothyroid patients who remained dissatisfied with LT4 monotherapy, while the use of LT4 + SR-T3 was suggested.

Children at risk for hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in children, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.

Pregnancy

Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: THYQUIDITY dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at a minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester- specific range, increase the dose of THYQUIDITY by 12.5 to 25 mcg/day and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable THYQUIDITY dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce THYQUIDITY dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure THYQUIDITY dose is appropriate.

New Onset Hypothyroidism: Normalize thyroid function as rapidly as possible. Evaluate serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust THYQUIDITY dosage until a serum TSH is within the normal trimester specific range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer

Generally, TSH is suppressed to below 0.1 mIU per liter, and this usually requires a THYQUIDITY dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be lower.

### Serum thyrotropin and triiodothyronine levels in levothyroxine-treated patients [^114z2paj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Small adjustments in levothyroxine (LT4) dose do not appear to provide clinical benefit despite changes in thyrotropin (TSH) levels within the reference range. We hypothesize that the accompanying changes in serum total triiodothyronine (T3) levels do not reflect the magnitude of the changes in serum TSH.

Objective

This work aims to characterize the relationships of serum free thyroxine (FT4) vs T3, FT4 vs TSH, and FT4 vs the T3/FT4 ratio.

Methods

This cross-sectional, observational study comprised 9850 participants aged 18 years and older treated with LT4 from a large clinical database from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2019. Patients had been treated with LT4, subdivided by serum FT4 level. Main outcome measures included model fitting of the relationships between serum FT4 vs TSH, FT4 vs T3, and FT4 vs T3/FT4. Mean and median values of TSH, T3, and T3/FT4 were calculated.

Results

The relationships T3 vs FT4 and TSH vs FT4 were both complex and best represented by distinct, segmented regression models. Increasing FT4 levels were linearly associated with T3 levels until an inflection point at an FT4 level of 0.7 ng/dL, after which a flattening of the slope was observed following a convex quadratic curve. In contrast, increasing FT4 levels were associated with steep declines in TSH following 2 negative sigmoid curves. The FT4 vs T3/FT4 relationship was fit to an asymptotic regression curve supporting less T4 to T3 activation at higher FT4 levels.

Conclusion

In LT4-treated patients, the relationships between serum FT4 vs TSH and FT4 vs T3 across a range of FT4 levels are disproportionate. As a result, dose changes in LT4 that robustly modify serum FT4 and TSH values may only minimally affect serum T3 levels and result in no significant clinical benefit.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The initial dose of LEVO-T varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)].

In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue LEVO-T administration for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum T4 and TSH levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessment to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted.

Congenital Hypothyroidism [See Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)]

Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate LEVO-T therapy immediately upon diagnosis. Levothyroxine is generally continued for life in these patients.

Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of LEVO-T therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling.

Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.

Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients

Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.

Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate LEVO-T at less than the full replacement dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with levothyroxine overtreatment in the elderly.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic modeling: a novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^117HLmDY]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: After seven decades of levothyroxine (LT4) replacement therapy, dosage adjustment still takes several months. We have developed a decision aid tool (DAT) that models LT4 pharmacometrics and enables patient-tailored dosage. The aim of this was to speed up dosage adjustments for patients after total thyroidectomy.

Methods: The DAT computer program was developed with a group of 46 patients post-thyroidectomy, and it was then applied in a prospective randomized multicenter validation trial in 145 unselected patients admitted for total thyroidectomy for goiter, differentiated thyroid cancer, or thyrotoxicosis. The LT4 dosage was adjusted after only two weeks, with or without application of the DAT, which calculated individual free thyroxine (fT4) targets based on four repeated measurements of fT4 and thyrotropin (TSH) levels. The individual TSH target was either < 0.1, 0.1–0.5, or 0.5–2.0 mIU/L, depending on the diagnosis. Initial postoperative LT4 dosage was determined according to clinical routine without using algorithms. A simplified DAT with a population-based fT4 target was used for thyrotoxic patients who often went into surgery after prolonged TSH suppression. Subsequent LT4 adjustments were carried out every six weeks until target TSH was achieved.

Results: When clinicians were guided by the DAT, 40% of patients with goiter and 59% of patients with cancer satisfied the narrow TSH targets eight weeks after surgery, as compared with only 0% and 19% of the controls, respectively. The TSH was within the normal range in 80% of DAT/goiter patients eight weeks after surgery as compared with 19% of controls. The DAT shortened the average dosage adjustment period by 58 days in the goiter group and 40 days in the cancer group. For thyrotoxic patients, application of the simplified DAT did not improve the dosage adjustment.

Conclusions: Application of the DAT in combination with early postoperative TSH and fT4 monitoring offers a fast approach to LT4 dosage after total thyroidectomy for patients with goiter or differentiated thyroid cancer. Estimation of individual TSH-fT4 dynamics was crucial for the model to work, as removal of this feature in the applied model for thyrotoxic patients also removed the benefit of the DAT.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism — levothyroxine targeting of triiodothyronine or thyrotropin levels: There is insufficient evidence of benefit to recommend that treatment with levothyroxine be targeted to achieve low-normal thyrotropin values or high-normal triiodothyronine values in patients with hypothyroidism who are overweight, those who have depression or dyslipidemia, or those who are athyreotic. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality of evidence. Supporting data include a 1-year study in which hypothyroid patients maintained low-normal or high-normal triiodothyronine (T3) had resultant T3 levels of 123 and 113 ng/dL with no decrement in cholesterol, BMI, or percentage body fat associated with the higher LT4, and a cross-over trial of 56 patients with primary hypothyroidism treated for 8-week periods with three doses of LT4 that achieved TSH values of 2.8, 1, and 0.3 mIU/L and free T3 values of 2.5, 2.7, and 3.1 pg/mL, in which psychologic well-being, treatment satisfaction, and body weight did not change across the three different groups; although there was progressive lowering of total cholesterol with higher free T3 values, the significance of this reduction seemed to be due to lowering of cholesterol in the group that included many long-term patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, and retrospective data found no significant weight changes after LT4 replacement or suppressive doses in postsurgical hypothyroidism.

LABORATORY TESTS

Laboratory Tests — Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical evaluation. The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid preparation bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of all thyroid medications except T3. When the total serum T4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T4 levels is warranted. Specific measurements of T4 and T3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine.

### Hypothyroidism: diagnosis and treatment… [^112wUhU4]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Some patients with a normal TSH level and symptom resolution may become symptomatic again with or without a change in TSH. When symptoms reappear without a change in TSH level, the physician should consider nonthyroid etiologies. When there is an accompanying change in the TSH level, especially in a patient who has stayed on a stable dosage for some time, other reasons should be explored before adjusting the levothyroxine dosage. Adding T 3 to levothyroxine does not additionally alleviate symptoms of hypothyroidism. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials found no difference in symptoms or quality of life in patients treated with levothyroxine monotherapy vs. levothyroxine plus combination therapy. 32 The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists does not recommend desiccated thyroid hormone and finds insufficient evidence to recommend combination levothyroxine/T 3 therapy over levothyroxine monotherapy. 3, or both.

25 Levothyroxine should be given as a slow intravenous bolus of 200 to 400 mcg initially, followed by 50 to 100 mcg orally per day. Reduce dosing by 75% if it is being administered intravenously. For combination treatment, T 3 is given at the same time as levothyroxine and dosed at 5 to 20 mcg, then 2. 5 to 10 mcg every eight hours until clinical improvement. Lower dosages are appropriate in older adults and patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. Stress-dose glucocorticoids should be administered until adrenal insufficiency is ruled out. Serum FT 4 and T 3 should be monitored every one to two days, with samples drawn at least one hour after dosing T 3. The TSH level should drop by 50% per week on adequate treatment. After clinical improvement, the patient may transition to oral levothyroxine monotherapy. 21, 25.

16 In nonpregnant patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, levothyroxine therapy should be considered when the TSH level is greater than 10 mIU per L or the TPO antibody level is elevated. 16, 17, 34 The benefits of treating women with subclinical hypothyroidism who are pregnant or attempting to conceive are unclear. 17.
