## Question

Prescription for terbinafine for vaginal candidiasis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether terbinafine should be prescribed for vaginal candidiasis and what the appropriate recommendation is instead. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about guideline-recommended therapies for vulvovaginal candidiasis and whether terbinafine appears in those algorithms. Then, I should verify terbinafine's FDA-approved indications and any labeling language about Candida efficacy. Next, I will compare terbinafine's spectrum and mechanism with the pathogens that cause VVC and contrast this with standard agents. After that, I need to check pharmacokinetic, formulation, and safety considerations for vaginal use. Then, I should review evidence-based non-azole alternatives recently approved for VVC or RVVC. Finally, I will synthesize the risk-benefit and provide a clear, actionable recommendation with dosing and special-case considerations [^112xeTif] [^112VL6ed].

> Let me first confirm the standard of care so I don't jump to conclusions: IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend topical azoles as first-line therapy for uncomplicated VVC, with oral fluconazole 150 mg as an accepted alternative, and they escalate to fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 2–3 doses for severe disease and to an induction plus weekly suppressive regimen for recurrent VVC, which sets the benchmark for efficacy and safety in this condition [^112xeTif] [^114ovmXp] [^116Uyo2q] [^116WHsAp].

> Wait, let me verify terbinafine's labeling before assuming it has a role here: the FDA label shows terbinafine is an allylamine indicated for onychomycosis and certain dermatophyte infections, with explicit language that while it has in vitro activity against Candida albicans, its safety and efficacy for clinical Candida infections have not been established in adequate and well-controlled trials, which is a key limitation for VVC use [^112VL6ed] [^113iuy4i] [^1121YbzD] [^113QkESD].

> Hold on, let me consider spectrum and causative organisms because that often clarifies off-label plausibility: VVC is caused by Candida species — most commonly C. albicans — where azoles that target lanosterol demethylase have long-standing clinical efficacy, whereas terbinafine's proven clinical activity is primarily against dermatophytes, not Candida, and the absence of established clinical efficacy against Candida undermines its use here despite in vitro signals [^1132axxq] [^112VL6ed].

> I should double-check pharmacokinetics and safety next because even a theoretically active drug can be wrong for the site: there is no vaginal formulation of terbinafine and no clinical data on achieving therapeutic vaginal tissue concentrations for short-course candidiasis treatment, and given the known systemic adverse effects including hepatotoxicity and other AEs, using oral terbinafine for a condition with safer, proven options would be a poor risk-benefit trade [^112VL6ed] [^116jzyqW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, before concluding "don't use terbinafine", I should review whether validated non-azole options exist for patients who cannot take azoles: ibrexafungerp is FDA-approved for acute VVC with phase 3 data showing superiority to placebo and convenient one-day dosing, and oteseconazole is approved for recurrent VVC with evidence supporting sustained mycologic control, which provides evidence-based alternatives when azoles are unsuitable or resistance is suspected [^112FXk7N] [^112e7Ymv] [^112rc4Hd] [^1159Uf5L] [^114vPKUH] [^1159iYMd].

> Let me reconsider special situations so I don't miss nuance: in azole-refractory C. glabrata vulvovaginitis, intravaginal boric acid is an IDSA-endorsed alternative, and in pregnancy, topical azoles are preferred, so reaching for terbinafine off-label is neither necessary nor advisable given these validated options and safety considerations [^114MYugG] [^1126nLj1].

> I will now synthesize the risk-benefit: there is no established clinical efficacy, no approved indication, and no supportive guideline for terbinafine in VVC, while there are clear, safer, and effective standards of care; using terbinafine risks treatment failure and exposes patients to systemic adverse effects without benefit, so it should not be prescribed for this indication [^112VL6ed] [^112xeTif] [^114ovmXp] [^116jzyqW].

> Final clinical recommendation, after double-checking dosing specifics: do not use terbinafine for vaginal candidiasis; for uncomplicated VVC, use fluconazole 150 mg orally once or a topical azole per IDSA, for severe VVC, use fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 2–3 doses, for recurrent VVC, use induction therapy followed by fluconazole 150 mg weekly for 6 months, consider ibrexafungerp for acute VVC when azoles are inappropriate, consider oteseconazole for RVVC, and for azole-refractory C. glabrata consider intravaginal boric acid, with topical azoles preferred in pregnancy [^114ovmXp] [^116Uyo2q] [^116WHsAp] [^112FXk7N] [^112e7Ymv] [^114vPKUH] [^114MYugG] [^1126nLj1].

Terbinafine is not recommended for **vaginal candidiasis** [^112xeTif] because it lacks clinical efficacy against Candida species [^112VL6ed] and is not included in clinical guidelines for this indication [^114ovmXp]. Standard therapy is a single 150 mg oral dose of fluconazole [^1148SBmz] or a topical azole [^112xeTif]; **terbinafine should not be prescribed for vaginal candidiasis** [^114ovmXp].

---

## Pharmacological properties of terbinafine

Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal that inhibits squalene epoxidase [^112VL6ed], disrupting ergosterol synthesis and leading to fungal cell death via squalene accumulation. It is fungicidal against dermatophytes (e.g. Trichophyton spp.) [^113iuy4i] and has **limited activity against Candida species** [^112VL6ed].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding terbinafine and candida species

Although terbinafine shows some in vitro activity against Candida albicans, **clinical efficacy for Candida infections, including vaginal candidiasis, is not established** [^112VL6ed]. No adequate clinical trials support its use for vaginal candidiasis, and no clinical guidelines recommend it [^112xeTif].

---

## Current clinical guidelines for vaginal candidiasis

Current guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) **recommend azole antifungals as first-line therapy** for vaginal candidiasis, including **Fluconazole** 150 mg orally as a single dose [^114ovmXp] and **Topical azoles** such as clotrimazole, miconazole, terconazole, or butoconazole [^112xeTif] [^116ghHAD], whereas terbinafine is **not mentioned or recommended** in these guidelines.

---

## Clinical studies evaluating terbinafine for vaginal candidiasis

No published clinical studies or randomized controlled trials evaluate terbinafine for vaginal candidiasis, and its use for this indication is **unsupported by clinical evidence**.

---

## Safety profile and potential side effects

Terbinafine is generally well tolerated; common adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, skin rash, and elevated liver enzymes [^116jzyqW]. Rare serious adverse effects include hepatotoxicity and severe skin reactions [^112VL6ed]. These risks are **unjustified given the lack of efficacy** for vaginal candidiasis.

---

## Alternative antifungal treatments

Effective alternatives for vaginal candidiasis include:

- **Fluconazole**: 150 mg orally, single dose [^114ovmXp] [^1148SBmz].
- **Topical azoles**: clotrimazole, miconazole, terconazole, butoconazole [^112xeTif] [^116ghHAD].
- **Ibrexafungerp**: a novel oral antifungal for acute and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112FXk7N] [^114CjtUs].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Terbinafine is not recommended for **vaginal candidiasis** because it lacks clinical evidence and guideline support [^112xeTif]. Azole antifungals remain the standard of care; terbinafine should not be prescribed for this indication.

### Terbinafine hydrochloride [^112VL6ed]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Terbinafine, an allylamine antifungal, inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, via the inhibition of the squalene epoxidase enzyme. This results in fungal cell death primarily due to the increased membrane permeability mediated by the accumulation of high concentrations of squalene, but not due to ergosterol deficiency. Depending on the concentration of the drug and the fungal species tested in vitro, terbinafine hydrochloride may be fungicidal. However, the clinical significance of in vitro data is unknown.

Terbinafine has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: *Trichophyton mentagrophytes* and *Trichophyton rubrum*.

- **In vitro data**: In vitro, terbinafine exhibits satisfactory minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against most strains of the following microorganisms; however, the safety and efficacy of terbinafine in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials: *Candida albicans*, *Epidermophyton floccosum*, and *Scopulariopsis brevicaulis*.

### Vulvovaginal candidosis [^1175cQrP]. Lancet (2007). Low credibility.

Despite therapeutic advances, vulvovaginal candidosis remains a common problem worldwide, affecting all strata of society. Understanding of anti-candida host defense mechanisms in the vagina has developed slowly and, despite a growing list of recognized risk factors, a fundamental grasp of pathogenic mechanisms continues to elude us. The absence of rapid, simple, and inexpensive diagnostic tests continues to result in both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of vulvovaginal candidosis. I review the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this infection, and also discuss management strategies.

### Diflucan [^1148SBmz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Single dose**: For vaginal candidiasis, the recommended dosage of Diflucan is 150 mg as a single oral dose.

- **Multiple dose**: Since oral absorption is rapid and almost complete, the daily dose of Diflucan (fluconazole) is the same for oral (tablets and suspension) and intravenous administration. Generally, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to achieve plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy. The daily dose for the treatment of infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient's response to therapy. Treatment should continue until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.

- **Oropharyngeal candidiasis**: The recommended dosage for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should continue for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.

- **Esophageal candidiasis**: The recommended dosage for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^117PidSY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis affects approximately 75% of women in their lifetime. Approved treatment options are limited to oral or topical azoles. Ibrexafungerp, a novel, first-in-class oral triterpenoid glucan synthase inhibitor, has demonstrated broad fungicidal Candida activity and a favorable tolerability profile. The primary objective of this dose-finding study was to identify the optimal dose of oral ibrexafungerp in patients with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Methods**: Patients with a vulvovaginal signs and symptoms score ≥ 7 were randomized equally into 6 treatment groups comprising 5 treatment doses of oral ibrexafungerp or oral fluconazole 150 mg. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a clinical cure (complete resolution of vulvovaginal signs and symptoms) at the test-of-cure visit (day 10).

- **Results**: Overall, 186 patients were randomized into the 6 treatment groups. Results, using the modified intent-to-treat population (baseline positive culture), are reported for ibrexafungerp 300 mg twice daily (BID) for 1 day (n = 27), which was the dose selected for phase 3 studies, and fluconazole 150 mg for 1 day (n = 24). At day 10, the clinical cure rates for ibrexafungerp and fluconazole were 51.9% and 58.3%, respectively; at day 25, patients with no signs or symptoms were 70.4% and 50.0%, respectively. During the study, ibrexafungerp patients required less antifungal rescue medication compared with fluconazole (3.7% vs. 29.2%, respectively). Ibrexafungerp was well tolerated, with the most common treatment-related adverse events being mild gastrointestinal effects.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^111EcZJ1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

- **Results**

- **Participant demographics and disposition**: Between October 2013 and September 2014, 55 female participants were randomized into the study. Participants were followed for approximately 6 months, including up to 3 days for screening, 3 days for study drug administration, and a final follow-up visit 6 months after starting treatment.

The study had a high rate of completion across all groups: VT-1161 300 mg q.d. 12/14, 85.7%; VT-1161 600 mg q.d. 10/12, 83.3%; VT-1161 600 mg b.i.d. 13/14, 92.9%; and fluconazole 150 mg single dose, 13/15, 86.7%. No participant withdrew from the study due to an adverse event. All protocol deviations were considered minor and did not affect study outcomes.

Overall, the average age of participants was 32.7 years. Baseline characteristics were similar across the groups.

- **Efficacy**: The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of participants with therapeutic cure at the day 28 test-of-cure (TOC) visit. A larger proportion of participants in the per-protocol (PP) population experienced therapeutic cure in the VT-1161 300 mg q.d. (6/8, 75.0%), VT-1161 600 mg q.d. (6/7, 85.7%), and VT-1161 600 mg b.i.d. (11/14, 78.6%) treatment groups compared to the fluconazole 150 mg group (5/8, 62.5%). No statistically significant difference was observed for any of the VT-1161 treatment groups versus the fluconazole group.

Secondary efficacy outcome measures included the proportion of…

### Oral ibrexafungerp for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: An analysis of VANISH 303 and VANISH 306 [^1159Uf5L]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). High credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), the second most common cause of vaginitis, negatively impacts the quality of life of affected women. It has been associated with emotional and psychosocial distress, loss of productivity, and an economic burden on outpatient health care systems. For more than 20 years, treatment options for acute VVC had been limited to short courses of topical azole formulations and oral fluconazole. In June 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first oral nonazole therapy for the treatment of acute VVC — ibrexafungerp, a first-in-class triterpenoid antifungal. Ibrexafungerp exerts fungicidal activity against most Candida isolates by targeting the glucan synthase enzyme responsible for producing glucan polymers, a key component of the fungal cell wall, resulting in fungal cell death. In preclinical studies, ibrexafungerp has demonstrated vaginal tissue concentrations two- to ninefold higher than plasma and retention of its activity in a low pH (4.5) environment, consistent with a vaginal pH commonly seen in patients with VVC.

Approval of ibrexafungerp for the treatment of acute VVC was based, in part, on results from two identical phase three studies (VANISH 303 and VANISH 306). These studies reported oral ibrexafungerp 300 mg twice daily (BID) for 1 day to be well tolerated and statistically superior to placebo in efficacy end points evaluated. The design of both studies was based on FDA guidance released in 2019 for the development of drugs for the treatment of VVC, which included recommendations for trial design and efficacy.

### Diflucan [^1119xY3U]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Diflucan (fluconazole) is indicated for the treatment of several conditions:

- **Vaginal candidiasis**: This includes vaginal yeast infections due to Candida.
- **Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis**: In open non-comparative studies involving relatively small numbers of patients, Diflucan has also proven effective for the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic Candida infections, including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia.
- **Cryptococcal meningitis**: Before prescribing Diflucan for AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis, consult the clinical studies section. It is important to note that studies comparing Diflucan to amphotericin B in non-HIV infected patients have not been conducted.

Diflucan is also indicated for prophylaxis to decrease the incidence of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies, including serology and histopathology, should be obtained before therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may begin before the culture and laboratory study results are known; however, once these results become available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

### Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of oteseconazole in the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and acute vulvovaginal candidiasis infections [^1159iYMd]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis affects nearly 138 million women globally each year. In the United States, fluconazole is considered the standard of care for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis; however, until recently, there was no US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. Oteseconazole is a novel oral selective inhibitor of fungal lanosterol demethylase (sterol 14α-demethylase cytochrome P450, an enzyme required for fungal growth) approved for the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Objective**: This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral oteseconazole (VT-1161) in the prevention of culture-verified acute vulvovaginal candidiasis episodes through 50 weeks in participants with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and to compare the efficacy of oteseconazole and fluconazole in the treatment of the presenting acute vulvovaginal candidiasis episode.

- **Study design**: Women and postmenarcheal girls aged ≥ 12 years with a history of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (N = 219) were enrolled at 38 US sites. Eligible participants presenting with an active vulvovaginal candidiasis infection entered an induction phase in which they were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive 600 mg oral oteseconazole on day 1 and 450 mg on day 2, with matching placebo capsules, or to 3 sequential 150-mg oral doses (once every 72 hours) of fluconazole, with matching placebo capsules. Following the 2-week induction phase, the 185 participants with resolved acute vulvovaginal candidiasis infection (a clinical…

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^114unZvw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is typically treated with a single dose or short treatments of either topical or oral azole antifungals, while recurrent VVC requires treatments that can last ≥ 6 months. Fluconazole remains the standard of care; however, drug resistance and safety liabilities, including hepatic toxicity, drug–drug interactions (DDIs), pregnancy warnings, and miscarriage concerns, are associated with its use.

VT-1161 (oteseconazole) was designed to be highly selective for fungal CYP51, thus avoiding off-target toxicities, including pregnancy and miscarriage concerns often associated with the azole drug class. Moreover, VT-1161 has demonstrated greater potency against Candida species, including azole-resistant species, than fluconazole. Our goal in this phase 2a study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VT-1161 vs. fluconazole in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe acute VVC.

### CD101 topical compared with oral fluconazole for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis: A randomized controlled trial [^1132axxq]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2019). High credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is an infection of the vagina's mucous membranes, caused by *Candida albicans* in more than 90% of acute VVC cases. Several topical and oral azole agents are available in various formulations, and all seem to have similar effectiveness. Azoles are fungistatic, meaning that the fungi are inhibited from growth or replication but are not eradicated. Reinfection and developing azole resistance demonstrate a significant need for alternative treatments.

- **Materials and methods**: One hundred twenty-six women were randomized to 1 of the following 3 treatment cohorts: CD101 3% gel (n = 50) applied intravaginally on days 1 and 2, CD101 6% ointment (n = 50) applied intravaginally on day 1, or oral fluconazole 150 mg (n = 26) on day 1. Primary outcomes of clinical and mycological cure, as demonstrated by changes in the vaginal scores and mycological culture, were assessed on day 7 (± 2 days), day 14 (± 2 days), and day 28 (± 7 days). Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events.

- **Results**: Ninety-nine women with positive *Candida* culture remained in the modified intent-to-treat population with 40 in each CD101 arm and 19 in the fluconazole arm. In the CD101 gel, CD101 ointment, and oral fluconazole groups, 35%, 30%, and 52.6% demonstrated clinical cure, and 45%, 40%, and 57.9% had mycological cure at day 28, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: CD101 3% gel and CD101 6% ointment were well tolerated and produced similar rates of clinical and mycological cure in patients with an acute, moderate-to-severe episode of VVC.

### In vitro activity of ibrexafungerp and comparators against Candida albicans genotypes from vaginal samples and blood cultures [^114fn75Y]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Low credibility.

The emergence of azole resistance may contribute to recurrences of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Thus, new drugs are needed to enhance therapeutic options. This study examined the in vitro activity of ibrexafungerp and comparators against Candida albicans isolates from vaginal samples and blood cultures. Additionally, isolates were genotyped to explore the compartmentalization of genotypes and the relationship between genotype and antifungal susceptibility.

Candida albicans unique patient isolates (n = 144) from individuals with clinical suspicion of vulvovaginal candidiasis (n = 72 isolates) and from patients with candidaemia (n = 72) were analyzed. Antifungal susceptibility to amphotericin B, fluconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, isavuconazole, clotrimazole, miconazole, micafungin, anidulafungin, and ibrexafungerp was tested (EUCAST 7.3.2). Mutations in the erg11 gene were analyzed, and isolates were genotyped.

Ibrexafungerp demonstrated high activity (MICs from 0.03 mg/L to 0.25 mg/L) against isolates, including those with reduced azole susceptibility, irrespective of their clinical source. The fluconazole resistance rate was 7% (n = 5/72) in vaginal isolates and 1.4% (n = 1/72) in blood isolates. Certain amino acid substitutions in the Erg11 protein were noted exclusively in phenotypically fluconazole non-wild-type strains. Population structure analysis suggested two genotype populations: one predominantly comprising blood sample isolates (66.3%) and the other mostly from vaginal samples (69.8%). The latter group included all fluconazole non-wild-type isolates.

### Ibrexafungerp versus placebo for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: A Phase 3, randomized, controlled superiority trial (VANISH 303) [^112rc4Hd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is the second most common cause of vaginitis, attributed to infections caused by Candida albicans in 85%–95% of cases. Fifty percent of all women will experience at least one episode of VVC by the age of 25, and approximately 75% of women will encounter a VVC episode in their lifetime, with two or more episodes occurring in 40%–45% of women. Comorbid conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes, genetic predispositions, immunocompromising conditions, and the use of certain medications, such as antibiotics, have been associated with VVC. The widespread availability of over-the-counter therapies often leads to patient self-treatment, which contributes to the gross underreporting of VVC incidence.

Historically, VVC treatments have been predominantly limited to the azole class of fungistatic agents. Routine treatment includes topical azole formulations with courses lasting up to a week, or oral fluconazole administered as a 150 mg single dose. Limitations of these treatments include possible intolerance to topical formulations, idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity associated with fluconazole, and the risk of fetal harm if fluconazole is taken during pregnancy. The previous lack of approved non-azole therapies has limited treatment options in cases where organisms are azole-resistant, or for patients who have azole intolerance, or for whom its use is otherwise contraindicated. New oral treatments are needed, especially those with broad fungal coverage, a good safety profile — particularly no risk of fetal harm — and limited drug-to-drug interactions.

### Oral ibrexafungerp for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: An analysis of VANISH 303 and VANISH 306 [^111UnKvB]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). Low credibility.

Historical comparisons of ibrexafungerp and fluconazole are challenging due to the varying methodologies of studies. Several pivotal studies evaluating fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) reported that 52%–65% of patients had severe VVC. In a previous study of fluconazole, baseline vulvovaginal symptom scores (VSS) ≥ 7 were associated with reduced response rates to single-dose fluconazole in treating severe VVC compared to mild disease.

In this pooled analysis, we confirm that race (White and Black) did not affect efficacy outcomes with ibrexafungerp. However, analysis of ibrexafungerp in other races is warranted. Additionally, body mass index (BMI) did not appear to predict response to ibrexafungerp, as evident from the fluctuations in relative risk across various BMI categories.

Patients with baseline infections of non-albicans Candida species had lower clinical response rates, indicating the need for further investigation into these cases.

### Amphotericin B [^113VGXzd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Amphotericin B for Injection USP should be administered primarily to patients with progressive, potentially life-threatening fungal infections. This potent drug should not be used to treat noninvasive fungal infections, such as oral thrush, vaginal candidiasis, and esophageal candidiasis in patients with normal neutrophil counts.

Amphotericin B for Injection USP is specifically intended to treat potentially life-threatening fungal infections, including aspergillosis, cryptococcosis (torulosis), North American blastomycosis, systemic candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and zygomycosis. This includes mucormycosis due to susceptible species of the genera Absidia, Mucor, and Rhizopus, and infections due to related susceptible species of Conidiobolus and Basidiobolus, as well as sporotrichosis.

Amphotericin B may be useful in the treatment of American mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, but it is not the drug of choice as primary therapy.

### Farxiga [^1176Sb6A]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform female patients that vaginal yeast infections may occur and provide them with information on the signs and symptoms of these infections. Advise them of treatment options and when to seek medical advice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **Genital mycotic infections in males (e.g. balanitis)**: Inform male patients that yeast infections of the penis (e.g. balanitis or balanoposthitis) may occur, especially in those with a prior history. Provide them with information on the signs and symptoms of balanitis and balanoposthitis, such as rash or redness of the glans or foreskin of the penis. Advise them of treatment options and when to seek medical advice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Inform patients that serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. urticaria, anaphylactic reactions, and angioedema) have been reported with Farxiga.

### Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of treatment of asymptomatic candidiasis for the prevention of preterm birth [^116cnDP5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). High credibility.

Candidiasis, commonly called "yeast infection" or "thrush", is a fungal infection (mycosis) that occurs when there is an overgrowth of any of the Candida species, of which Candida albicans is the most common. Candida is normally found on skin or mucous membranes, including the vagina. However, if the environment becomes imbalanced — such as when the normal acidity of the mucous membrane changes or when the hormonal balance shifts — Candida can multiply. When this occurs, symptomatic candidiasis can develop, ranging from oral thrush and vaginitis to systemic and potentially life-threatening diseases. Candida infections of the latter category are usually confined to severely immunocompromised persons.

Vaginal candidiasis, usually (90%) due to Candida albicans, is often harmless and causes no symptoms. However, it can also cause vaginal soreness, itching, and discharge. Approximately 75% of all healthy women of fertile age experience at least one episode of vaginal candidiasis, with associated physical and psychological morbidity, and approximately half will have a recurrence. Vaginal candidiasis (referred to as 'candidiasis' in this protocol) is not traditionally classified as a sexually transmitted infection since it can occur in celibate women and is considered part of the normal vaginal flora. This does not mean that sexual transmission does not occur, although the contribution of sexual transmission to the pathogenesis of infection is unknown. Importantly, the treatment of male partners has not been effective in reducing the recurrence of vaginal candidiasis.

### Oral ibrexafungerp for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: An analysis of VANISH 303 and VANISH 306 [^115P15ZQ]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). Low credibility.

VVC is a common infection that negatively impacts the quality of life of affected women and is associated with meaningful direct and indirect costs. After more than 20 years without new treatment choices, women and their health care providers now have a new oral therapeutic option. Ibrexafungerp, a first-in-class nonazole triterpenoid, provides a new safe and effective oral treatment for VVC with the convenience of 1-day dosing. This pooled analysis strengthens and confirms the efficacy and safety data presented in VANISH 303 and VANISH 306.

Patient subgroup analyses suggest that race, BMI, baseline VSS scores, and C. albicans infections do not adversely affect ibrexafungerp efficacy, making it an appropriate therapy for patients with acute VVC. Unlike azole treatments for patients with severe VVC (VSS score ≥ 7) at baseline, which usually require more than one day of therapy, ibrexafungerp provides significant clinical cure rates with just one day of treatment.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112yR1jK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Based on patient convenience, efficacy, and safety data in this study, ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day was the dosage selected for further evaluation in phase 3 studies. Our study suggested comparable clinical cure rates between ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day and fluconazole at TOC. In this phase 2 study, we found it encouraging that certain parameters, such as improved and sustained VSS scores, mycological eradication at day 25, and the need for rescue medication appeared to be improved with ibrexafungerp compared with fluconazole. Because our study was not statistically powered, these initial findings will need further study to see if the observed differences are meaningful.

In 2019, the FDA provided pharmaceutical industry guidance for drug development in the treatment of VVC and recommended clinical cure, defined as the complete absence of all VSS, as the primary efficacy endpoint. In our study, a clinical cure was defined as the complete resolution of VSS (VSS score = 0) by the TOC visit without the need for further antifungal treatment. Mycological eradication was not a primary endpoint, as Candida is normally found in the vagina. Given variations in efficacy outcome definitions in previous studies of VVC, historical comparisons are difficult. However, some previous studies have reported a decreased sustained response with azole treatment from day 14 to day 35. In comparison, the percentage of patients receiving ibrexafungerp with no VSS increased from 51.9% at TOC to 70.4% at day 25 in our study, suggesting continued improvement and sustained effectiveness.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^1114K48s]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oral non-azole treatment options available for patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). This absence negatively impacts VVC treatment options for patients with azole-resistant organisms and those not responding to or not tolerating fluconazole, or for whom its use is contraindicated. New agents should ideally have broader fungal coverage, minimal adverse effects, no risk of fetal harm, and limited drug-to-drug interactions.

Ibrexafungerp (formerly SCY-078) is a first-in-class triterpenoid antifungal. Similar to the echinocandins, its mechanism of action targets the glucan synthase enzyme, resulting in decreased (1,3)-β-D-glucan polymers. This weakens the fungal cell wall, leading to fungal cell lysis and death. Due to its unique structure, ibrexafungerp binds to a site on glucan synthase that only partially overlaps with the echinocandin binding site. As a non-azole antifungal, ibrexafungerp exerts broad-spectrum activity against an extensive range of Candida isolates, including many with fks1 and fks2 point mutations that cause echinocandin resistance among C. glabrata and Candida auris. Because glucan synthase is uniquely found in fungal cell walls and not in human cells, there is less chance of off-target effects, such as cytochrome P450 interactions, as observed with azole treatments.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^115p8mCR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Healthy, nonpregnant female participants aged ≥ 18 years and < 65 years with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) were enrolled in the study. Participants had a positive baseline potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount from a vaginal smear revealing filamentous hyphae/pseudohyphae or budding yeast cells, the presence of ≥ 1 vulvovaginal sign, the presence of ≥ 1 vulvovaginal symptom, and a composite severity score of ≥ 6. Vaginal swabs were obtained at the screening visit and at subsequent study visits. Candida species were characterized and stored frozen for susceptibility testing upon study completion. Inclusion criteria required participants to present with a clinical diagnosis of acute VVC and did not differentiate between acute and recurrent VVC (reVVC) participants.

Participants did not have any clinically significant major organ system disease or infection (with the exception of VVC) and were not taking concomitant medications that would have interfered with study assessments. Participants completed a review of pertinent medical history, vital signs, and body measurements, a symptom/sign evaluation, a physical examination including speculum examination of the vagina, and a KOH wet mount test from a vaginal smear.

### Sertaconazole 300 mg versus clotrimazole 500 mg vaginal suppository for treating pregnant women with acute vaginal candidiasis: a double-blinded, randomized trial [^1126nLj1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

Vaginal candidiasis (VC), or vulvovaginal candidosis, presents a significant gynecologic challenge, compelling affected women to seek medical intervention. Symptoms predominantly include altered discharge with curd-like properties, augmented volume, and intense vulvar/vaginal itching. The principal causative agent, Candida albicans, resides within the normal vaginal microbiota. Risk factors include a sedentary lifestyle, elevated estrogen levels, stress, and dietary issues, notably iron deficiency anemia and high sugar intake. These conditions render pregnant women particularly vulnerable to VC, with a noted increase in recurrence as pregnancy progresses. Data on the impact of VC on pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and prelabor membrane rupture, remain contentious; however, treating VC during pregnancy might offer protective benefits.

Oral or vaginal imidazoles serve as the primary treatment for VC, with topical formulations recommended for pregnant women. For over four decades, clotrimazole (CLO) vaginal tablets have been a mainstay for treating VC in pregnant women, with multiple-dose regimens being favored. Nonetheless, recent systematic reviews suggest that a single 500 mg dose of CLO may offer efficacy comparable to that of multiple lower-strength CLO doses. However, the gravid uterus can complicate vaginal insertion, especially in the third trimester, a peak period for VC recurrence. Additionally, a notable drawback of CLO vaginal tablets is their dissolution time. This limitation led to the introduction of sertaconazole.

### Over-the-counter antifungal drug misuse associated with patient-diagnosed vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112bg4hH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the proportion of symptomatic women who purchase over-the-counter antifungal products for immediate treatment of presumed vulvovaginal candidiasis and who actually have vulvovaginal candidiasis or other genitourinary conditions.

- **Methods**: A time-location sample of 95 symptomatic women purchasing and presenting with an over-the-counter antifungal product for immediate and personal treatment of presumed vulvovaginal candidiasis were evaluated through clinical examination and pertinent laboratory tests. The study assessed the percentage of women diagnosed with vulvovaginal candidiasis or other conditions. It compared the proportions of women with vulvovaginal candidiasis between groups with and without a prior diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis and groups that read or did not read the over-the-counter package label.

- **Results**: The actual diagnoses for women who self-diagnosed vulvovaginal candidiasis were as follows: vulvovaginal candidiasis 33.7%, bacterial vaginosis 18.9%, mixed vaginitis 21.1%, normal 13.7%, other diagnoses 10.5%, and trichomonas vaginitis 2.1%. Women with a previous clinically based diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis were not more accurate in diagnosing vulvovaginal candidiasis than women without a prior clinical diagnosis (chi² = 0.27, P = 0.6). Women who read the package label were no more likely to have vulvovaginal candidiasis than were women who did not read the label (Fisher exact test, P = 0.39).

- **Conclusion**: Many women who self-diagnose and use an over-the-counter product for the treatment of presumed vulvovaginal candidiasis do not have vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is largely limited to azole therapy. Ibrexafungerp is a first-in-class triterpenoid antifungal with broad-spectrum anti-Candida fungicidal activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibrexafungerp compared with placebo in patients with acute VVC.

- **Methods**: Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive ibrexafungerp (300 mg twice for 1 day) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a clinical cure (complete resolution of vulvovaginal signs and symptoms [VSS] = 0) at test-of-cure (day 11 ± 3). Secondary endpoints included the percentage of patients with mycological eradication, overall success (clinical cure and mycological eradication), clinical improvement (VSS ≤ 1) at test-of-cure, and symptom resolution at follow-up (day 25 ± 4).

- **Results**: Patients receiving ibrexafungerp had significantly higher rates of clinical cure (50.5% [95/188] vs. 28.6% [28/98]; p = 0.001) and mycological eradication (49.5% [93/188] vs. 19.4% [19/98]; P < .001). Clinical improvement was observed in 54.5% [24/44] and 68.2% [30/44], respectively, compared with the overall study population.

### Treatment for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^114kDkmq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) affects up to 5% of women, yet no comprehensive systematic review of treatments for RVVC has been published.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for RVVC. The secondary objective was to evaluate patient preference for treatment options.

- **Search methods**: We conducted electronic searches of bibliographic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL, as of 6 October 2021. Additionally, we handsearched reference lists of identified trials and contacted authors of these trials, experts in RVVC, and manufacturers of products for vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered all published and unpublished randomized controlled trials evaluating RVVC treatments for at least six months in women with four or more symptomatic episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis in the past year. Women with immunosuppressive disorders or those taking immunosuppressant medication were excluded. Women with diabetes mellitus and pregnant women were included. Diagnosis of RVVC must have been confirmed by symptoms and a positive culture and/or microscopy. We included all drug and non-drug therapies as well as partner treatments, assessing the following primary outcomes: number of clinical recurrences per participant per year (recurrence defined as clinical signs and positive culture/microscopy), the proportion of participants with at least one clinical recurrence during the treatment and follow-up periods, and adverse events.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112dYcBx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Efficacy measurements included the collection of clinical signs (erythema, edema, excoriation) and symptoms (itching, burning, irritation) of vulvovaginitis using a scoring scale of 0–3 (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) for each sign or symptom, resulting in a total severity score ranging from 0 to 18. In addition, a KOH wet mount test and vaginal fungal culture were performed at each visit.

- **Primary efficacy outcome**: The primary outcome was the proportion of participants achieving therapeutic cure, defined as both clinical and mycological cure, at the TOC day 28 visit. Mycological cure was defined as a negative fungal culture for Candida species, while clinical cure was defined as the complete resolution of signs and symptoms related to VVC, with any new sign or symptom observed at the TOC visit being determined by the investigator not to be related to VVC.

- **Secondary efficacy outcome measures**: These included the proportion of participants achieving the following: clinical cure at day 28; mycological cure at days 7, 14, and 28; clinical improvement (where every individual VVC sign and symptom score that was 0, 1, or 2 at baseline was a score of 0 at day 28, and scores of 3 at baseline were reduced to scores of 0 or 1 at day 28); clinical relapse (clinical cure at day 28 followed by a signs and symptoms total severity score > 0 at days 84 or 168); mycological reinfection or recurrence (negative fungal culture at day 28 followed by a positive fungal culture for Candida species at days 84 or 168); modified clinical cure (total VVC severity score of ≤ 1 at day 28); and modified therapeutic cure (both modified clinical cure and mycological cure at day 28).

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^113XR548]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), more commonly known as vaginal yeast infections, is one of the most common causes of vaginitis. In 80%–95% of women, VVC is caused by *Candida albicans*, with fewer remaining infections caused by non-albicans *Candida* species, including *Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei*, or other fungi. Approximately 75% of women will have at least one episode of VVC in their lifetime, and 40%–45% of women will experience two or more episodes. By the age of 25 years, an estimated 50% of women will have experienced at least one episode of VVC after the onset of sexual activity.

Treatment options for VVC are predominantly limited to the azole class of fungistatic agents. They include short courses of topical formulations of various agents or oral fluconazole, given as a 150-mg single or multiple dose regimen. Limitations of available treatments include concerns of intolerance, adverse events (AEs), and, with fluconazole, a potential risk of miscarriage and fetal harm. More recent VVC treatment limitations include an increasing prevalence of fluconazole resistance and intrinsic resistance or low susceptibility of non-albicans *Candida* species to azole antifungals.

### Ibrexafungerp versus placebo for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: A phase 3, randomized, controlled superiority trial (VANISH 303) [^111dCK5q]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

This is the second clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of ibrexafungerp in acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). Our clinical cure rate was similar to that reported with ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day, which was 51.9% (14/27 patients) in the phase 2 DOVE study. Historical comparisons with therapies for VVC are difficult due to differences in study methodology and dosing regimens.

Before the new FDA guidance, study endpoints, including the definition of clinical cure, varied widely. In our study, clinical cure was defined as VSS = 0 using the new FDA guidance, whereas many previous azole studies defined it as VSS ≤ 2. Clinical cure rates (VSS = 0) of 47.4% to 57.9% have been reported on days 7 and 14 in patients receiving single-dose fluconazole, compared to 50.5% with single-day ibrexafungerp in our study. Furthermore, a clinical cure rate (VSS ≤ 2) of 80.9% on day 14 was reported with single-dose fluconazole, versus 70% with ibrexafungerp in our study. However, in our study, an improved and sustained response was observed at the follow-up visit, whereas some previous studies evaluating various regimens of fluconazole reported an 11%–20% decrease in sustained response from days 7–14 to days 28–35.

- **Study design and patients**: Enrolled patients were ≥ 18 years of age with a diagnosis of symptomatic moderate-to-severe acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) determined by a vulvovaginal signs and symptoms (VSS) score of ≥ 7. Other eligibility criteria included a positive microscopic examination with 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) in a vaginal sample revealing yeast forms (hyphae/pseudohyphae) or budding yeasts and a vaginal pH of ≤ 4.5.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Patients with any vaginal condition that would interfere with the diagnosis and evaluation of VVC, such as suspected or confirmed causes of vulvovaginitis and/or cervicitis including bacterial vaginosis, Trichomonas infection, active herpes virus or human papillomavirus infection, positive tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis, or other mixed infections, were excluded. Additionally, the use of antifungal treatments (topical or systemic) within 28 days of the baseline visit, vaginal contraceptives, use of CYP3A4/3A5 inducers and strong time-dependent CYP3A4/3A5 inhibitors 14 days before enrollment and during treatment, strong or moderate reversible CYP3A4/3A5 inhibitors including azoles or grapefruit juice 48 hours before enrollment and during treatment, select CYP2C8 substrates (e.g. amiodarone, amodiaquine, paclitaxel, repaglinide, montelukast, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone) within 48 hours before enrollment and during treatment, or select P-gp substrates (e.g. digoxin, colchicine) 48 hours before enrollment and during treatment, patients menstruating at the baseline visit, and patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, or active cervical or vaginal cancer were also excluded.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^115RDmWf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

At day 28, a larger proportion of participants in the per-protocol (PP) population experienced clinical cure, mycological cure, clinical improvement, and no clinical or mycological relapse in the three VT-1161 treatment groups compared to the fluconazole group. At day 28, a larger proportion of participants in the PP population experienced modified therapeutic cure in the three VT-1161 treatment groups versus the fluconazole group.

- **Modified therapeutic cure**: Total VVC signs and symptoms severity score of ≤ 1 and mycological cure at day 28.
- **Abbreviations**: b.i.d. (twice daily); q.d. (once daily); VT-1161 (oteseconazole).

All participants treated with VT-1161 demonstrated mycological cure at both the day 84 (3-month) and day 168 (6-month) follow-up visits, while almost half of the participants treated with fluconazole showed a mycological recurrence at the 6-month visit. The percentage of participants in the fluconazole-treated group who experienced mycological recurrence increased with time since treatment.

Additional efficacy analyses included the number of participants with a positive culture for Candida species and KOH test evaluated at days 28, 84, and 168. All participants treated with VT-1161 demonstrated mycological cure at both the day 84 (3-month) and day 168 (6-month) follow-up periods.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^114vPKUH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

In this study, acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is common among women, but azole antifungal treatments are often associated with safety and resistance issues. VT-1161 (oteseconazole) is an oral agent with increased selectivity for fungal CYP51. This phase 2 clinical study evaluated the efficacy and safety of VT-1161 versus fluconazole in participants with moderate to severe acute VVC.

- **Methods**: Participants presenting with an acute episode of VVC (n = 55) were randomized to receive VT-1161 300 mg once daily (q.d.) for 3 days, 600 mg q.d. for 3 days, or 600 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) for 3 days, or to receive a single dose of fluconazole 150 mg (FDA-approved dose to treat acute VVC). Participants were followed for 6 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with therapeutic (clinical and mycological) cure at day 28.

- **Results**: A larger proportion of participants in the per-protocol population experienced therapeutic cure in the VT-1161 300 mg q.d. (75.0%), VT-1161 600 mg q.d. (85.7%), and VT-1161 600 mg b.i.d. (78.6%) groups versus the fluconazole group (62.5%); differences were not statistically significant. At 3 and 6 months, no participants in the VT-1161 groups had evidence of mycological recurrence, compared to 28.5% and 46.1% in the fluconazole group, respectively. No serious adverse events or treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported.

Conclusions highlight that the majority of participants across all treatment groups achieved therapeutic cure at day 28, with VT-1161 being well tolerated at all dose levels through 6 months of follow-up.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^11262HXR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

At screening, 41 isolated cultures (89%) were Candida albicans, 9 isolated cultures (7%) were Candida parapsilosis, 1 culture (2%) was Candida tropicalis, and 1 culture (2%) was Candida lusitanea. Candida glabrata was isolated from a single participant while on-study. Based on the MIC susceptibility results, VT-1161 was shown to have potent activity against the Candida strains obtained in the study. When all 60 Candida spp. isolates collected throughout the study were considered, the MIC ranges for VT-1161 and fluconazole were < 0.001–1.0 and < 0.125–64 µg/mL, respectively. The MIC 50 (defined as the minimum concentration to inhibit 50% of the strains tested) was 0.002 µg/mL for VT-1161 and 0.25 µg/mL for fluconazole, whereas the MIC 90 (defined as the minimum concentration to inhibit 90% of the strains tested) was 0.004 µg/mL for VT-1161 and 1.0 µg/mL for fluconazole. Overall, the VT-1161 MIC values were approximately 100-fold lower than those of fluconazole. Importantly, the MIC of VT-1161 against the fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata was 64-fold lower than the fluconazole MIC.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: The median t max of VT-1161 was 4.0 hours (range, 3.1–5.0) and 5.5 hours (range, 4.0–8.0) for the 300- and 600-mg doses, respectively. On day 1, C max was 407 ng/mL for the 300-mg dose and 968 ng/mL for the 600-mg dose. The AUC (0–8) values on day 1 averaged 1870 and 4230 hours × ng/mL for the 300- and 600-mg doses, respectively.

### Oral ibrexafungerp for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: An analysis of VANISH 303 and VANISH 306 [^117VaVXP]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). High credibility.

A total of 376 patients from the United States were randomly assigned to receive ibrexafungerp (n = 249) or placebo (n = 127) in the VANISH 303 study. Of these, 286 patients were included in the mITT population (ibrexafungerp, n = 188; placebo, n = 98). In the VANISH 306 study, 449 patients from Bulgaria or the United States were randomly assigned to receive ibrexafungerp (n = 298) or placebo (n = 151). Of these, 272 patients were included in the mITT population (ibrexafungerp, n = 188; placebo, n = 84). The pooled mITT population included 376 patients who received ibrexafungerp and 182 patients who received placebo. The pooled safety population included 545 patients who received ibrexafungerp and 275 who received placebo.

- **Patient disposition**: Five patients experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) not related to ibrexafungerp that led to study discontinuation, including bacterial vaginosis (n = 4) and diabetes mellitus (n = 1).

Demographics and baseline characteristics of the mITT population are presented in Table 2. Overall, baseline characteristics of the ibrexafungerp and placebo groups were well balanced. Fewer than 8% of patients in each treatment group had diabetes mellitus, and more than 90% of patients had a baseline severity score of ≥ 7. All patients had a positive culture for ≥ 1 Candida species at baseline, with over 85% of patients testing positive for Candida albicans in both treatment groups. Similar baseline severity scores were observed.

### Ibrexafungerp versus placebo for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: A phase 3, randomized, controlled superiority trial (VANISH 303) [^112zwvtH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is largely limited to azole therapy. Ibrexafungerp is a first-in-class triterpenoid antifungal with broad-spectrum anti-Candida fungicidal activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibrexafungerp compared with placebo in patients with acute VVC.

- **Methods**: Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive ibrexafungerp (300 mg twice for one day) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a clinical cure (complete resolution of vulvovaginal signs and symptoms [VSS] = 0) at test-of-cure (day 11 ± 3). Secondary endpoints included the percentage of patients with mycological eradication, overall success (clinical cure and mycological eradication), clinical improvement (VSS ≤ 1) at test-of-cure, and symptom resolution at follow-up (day 25 ± 4).

- **Results**: Patients receiving ibrexafungerp had significantly higher rates of clinical cure (50.5% [95/188] vs. 28.6% [28/98]; p = 0.001) and mycological eradication (49.5% [93/188] vs. 19.4% [19/98]) compared to the placebo group. For patients older than 35, clinical cure and mycological eradication rates were even higher (54.5% [24/44] and 68.2% [30/44], respectively) compared to overall rates.

### Chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis [^113kzSD8]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Frequently ignored by the medical community, chronic vulvovaginal symptoms are relatively common and can be frustrating for both patients and physicians. Establishing a proper diagnosis lays the foundation for an effective therapeutic plan. Fungal cultures are an important component of the work-up as they help in identifying the most common causes of chronic vaginal symptoms, which include recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), vulvar vestibulitis syndrome, and irritant dermatitis.

In patients with RVVC caused by Candida albicans, host factors may play an important role in the recurrence of symptoms. Long-term oral antifungal therapy can effectively break the pattern of recurrence in many patients. However, infections caused by other species of yeast may be more resistant to standard treatment approaches.

### Probiotics for oral and vulvovaginal candidiasis: A review [^116wHzU6]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Dermatologists commonly prescribe medications, such as antibiotics and corticosteroids, which can increase the risk for candidiasis. Although conventional antifungals are often effective against candidiasis, they are not without side effects, and species of Candida are gaining resistance. Probiotics, known to help treat conditions such as post-antibiotic diarrhea and infectious diarrhea, may also have the potential to aid in Candida infections. Therefore, this review provides an overview of therapies prescribed in dermatology that may increase the risk for candidiasis. It also examines the literature on the usefulness of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of oral and vulvovaginal candidiasis to better inform dermatologists about their supplemental use with conventional antifungals.

### Boric acid for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis: the clinical evidence [^111CbeE2]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) remains a challenge to manage in clinical practice. Recent epidemiologic studies indicate that non-albicans Candida spp. are more resistant to conventional antifungal treatment with azoles and are considered causative pathogens of vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed and Scopus for studies that reported clinical evidence on the intravaginal use of boric acid for vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Results**: We identified 14 studies (2 randomized clinical trials [RCTs], 9 case series, and 4 case reports) as eligible for inclusion in this review. Boric acid was compared with nystatin, terconazole, flucytosine, itraconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, buconazole, and miconazole; as monotherapy, boric acid was studied in 7 studies. The mycologic cure rates varied from 40% to 100% in patients treated with boric acid; 4 of the 9 included case series reported statistically significant outcomes regarding cure (both mycologic and clinical) rates. None of the included studies reported statistically significant differences in recurrence rates. Regarding the adverse effects caused by boric acid use, vaginal burning sensation (< 10% of cases), water discharge during treatment, and vaginal erythema were identified in 7 studies.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that boric acid is a safe, alternative, and economic option for women with recurrent and chronic symptoms of vaginitis when conventional treatment fails due to the involvement of non-albicans Candida spp. or azole-resistant strains.

### A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of monthly oral ibrexafungerp to reduce the incidence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis [^114CjtUs]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis develops in 5–9% of people assigned female at birth and has a serious impact on quality of life. Oral ibrexafungerp is a first-in-class, non-azole, triterpenoid antifungal approved in the United States for the treatment of postmenarchal females with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis and for the reduction in the incidence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Objective**: This Phase 3 study (CANDLE) describes the efficacy and safety of monthly oral ibrexafungerp versus placebo for reducing the incidence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Study design**: Participants with a history of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis experiencing an acute infection episode (confirmed by positive potassium hydroxide test) received three doses of oral fluconazole (150 mg once-daily every three days). Those who had a culture-confirmed vulvovaginal candidiasis from the screening sample, achieved significant resolution of signs and symptoms (composite Vulvovaginal Signs and Symptoms score ≤ 2) following fluconazole treatment, and continued to meet all study eligibility criteria entered a maintenance phase. In the maintenance phase, eligible participants were randomized (1:1) to oral ibrexafungerp (300 mg twice-daily for one day) or placebo, repeated once every four weeks for a total of six treatments (until Week 20). Efficacy was assessed by the percentage of participants with no mycologically-proven recurrence and the percentage of participants with clinical success (a participant with a Test-of-Cure [Week 24] evaluation and no recurrence).

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of candidiasis: 2009 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1125tVJZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the management of patients with invasive candidiasis and mucosal candidiasis were prepared by an expert panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. These updated guidelines replace the previous guidelines published in the 15 January 2004 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases and are intended for use by health care providers who care for patients who either have or are at risk of these infections. Since 2004, several new antifungal agents have become available, and several new studies have been published relating to the treatment of candidemia, other forms of invasive candidiasis, and mucosal disease, including oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. There are also recent prospective data on the prevention of invasive candidiasis in high-risk neonates and adults and on the empiric treatment of suspected invasive candidiasis in adults. This new information is incorporated into this revised document.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112bWNDD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The primary efficacy outcome, therapeutic cure at day 28, was observed in the majority of participants across all treatment groups. Secondary outcome analyses showed similar results as the primary efficacy outcome. Generally, there was no statistical difference between VT-1161 and fluconazole treatment groups; however, the study was not prospectively powered for the primary endpoint, and sample sizes were small. While the preliminary study did not differentiate between acute or recurrent VVC participants, requiring only an acute episode at presentation, analyses at the 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits found no indication of mycological recurrence in the VT-1161 groups, while 29% and 46% of participants in the fluconazole group had mycological recurrence at 3 and 6 months, respectively. During the 6-month trial, a higher percentage of fluconazole-treated participants reported TEAEs than VT-1161-treated participants.

### Oral versus intra-vaginal imidazole and triazole anti-fungal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^116ghHAD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective of this review is to assess the relative effectiveness (clinical cure) of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. Secondary objectives include the assessment of the relative effectiveness in terms of mycological cure, in addition to safety, side effects, treatment preference, time to first relief of symptoms, and costs.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers on 29 August 2019, together with reference checking and citation searching.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials published in any language comparing at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal in women (aged 16 years or over) with a mycological diagnosis (positive culture, microscopy for yeast, or both) of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. We excluded trials if they solely involved participants who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breastfeeding, or diabetic.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: This review includes 26 trials (5007 participants). Eight anti-fungals are represented. All but three trials included participants with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis. Trials were conducted in Europe: UK (3), Croatia (2), Finland (2), the Netherlands (2), Germany (1), Italy (1), Sweden (1), and one trial across multiple European countries.

### Topical treatment for vaginal candidiasis (thrush) in pregnancy [^112Ky6Pn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Vaginal candidiasis (moniliasis or thrush) is a common and frequently distressing infection for many women. It is even more common in pregnancy. There is no evidence that thrush in pregnancy is harmful to the baby.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of different methods of treating vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register. In addition, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL/CCTR) was searched. The date of the last search was March 2001.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials of any treatment for vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy were considered.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Ten trials were included. Based on five trials, imidazole drugs were more effective than nystatin when treating vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy (odds ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.29). In turn, nystatin was as effective as hydrargaphen in one trial (odds ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 1.84). A trial of clotrimazole was more effective than placebo (odds ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.31). Single dose treatment was no more or less effective than three or four days of treatment. However, two trials involving 81 women showed that treatment lasting for four days was less effective than treatment for seven days (odds ratio 11.7, 95% confidence interval 4.21 to 29.15). Based on two trials, treatment for seven days was no more or less effective than treatment for 14 days (odds ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval not provided).

### Amphotericin B [^114vYqdn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

This drug should be used primarily for the treatment of patients with progressive and potentially life-threatening fungal infections. It should not be used to treat noninvasive forms of fungal disease such as oral thrush, vaginal candidiasis, and esophageal candidiasis in patients with normal neutrophil counts.

Amphotericin B for injection should not be given in doses greater than 1.5 mg/kg. Exercise caution to prevent inadvertent overdosage, which may result in potentially fatal cardiac or cardiopulmonary arrest. Verify the product name and dosage pre-administration, especially if the dose exceeds 1.5 mg/kg.
