## Question

how to treat ear effusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to treat otitis media with effusion (ear effusion) in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing OME from acute otitis media. Then, I should verify the natural history to anchor the timing of intervention. Next, I will stratify risk and decide on watchful waiting versus expedited evaluation. After that, I need to review what not to use medically and why. Then, I will examine when and how to assess hearing and functional impact. Finally, I will consider surgical indications, options, and follow-up, and close with special populations and a concise decision algorithm, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions, because OME is fluid behind the tympanic membrane without signs of acute infection. Pneumatic otoscopy is the primary bedside tool to verify middle ear effusion and distinguish it from AOM, and tympanometry helps when otoscopy is inconclusive, so I should document effusion confidently before labeling OME and planning management [^111UfCEi] [^112YAxw6].

> Wait, let me verify the natural history before proposing any treatment, because most effusions resolve spontaneously. About 75% resolve by 3 months after AOM, and roughly 56–90% resolve by 3 months depending on whether onset is known, which is why watchful waiting is foundational for children not at risk, and I should communicate this clearly to families to avoid unnecessary interventions [^116JSwVe] [^117M7f33].

> Hold on, I should verify risk stratification next, since at-risk children warrant earlier hearing assessment and may merit expedited surgical consideration. At-risk includes baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors, craniofacial anomalies such as cleft palate or Down syndrome, and children with speech-language delay or learning problems, and for these children I should not wait the full 3 months before arranging hearing testing and considering otolaryngology referral [^1123JZXj] [^114G4Uh5].

> I will now examine the initial management for children not at risk, and I need to ensure I am precise: offer watchful waiting for 3 months from onset or diagnosis, with planned reassessment at 3–6 month intervals until resolution, hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities emerge. I should document laterality, duration, and symptoms at each visit and counsel families about the favorable natural history and the plan for follow-up [^1142nRLf] [^113DZn4h] [^112nBRd5].

> But wait, what if someone suggests antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines, or decongestants? I should double-check the evidence before agreeing, because guidelines strongly recommend against these for routine OME management due to lack of durable benefit and potential harms. Antibiotics show only small short-term resolution benefits without hearing or surgery-sparing effects and increase adverse events, oral and intranasal steroids do not improve meaningful outcomes, and antihistamines/decongestants are ineffective, so I should avoid these unless treating a separate indication [^111eJxRX] [^112EjPNp] [^115cw4ZV] [^111YhnVb] [^112Yd1P4].

> Let me consider autoinflation, because families often ask. The signal is mixed and certainty low, but some trials suggest short-term improvements in tympanometry or quality of life with minimal risk, so if the child can cooperate and there are no contraindications, a trial while awaiting spontaneous resolution is reasonable, while I counsel that benefits are modest and evidence quality is limited [^112hhMdf] [^1165K74n].

> Next, I should review when to assess hearing and functional impact. Obtain age-appropriate hearing testing if OME persists for 3 months or at any duration in at-risk children, and if bilateral OME with documented hearing loss is present, counsel families about potential effects on speech and language and consider earlier surgical referral. I need to ensure I document hearing status because it directly informs management and shared decision-making [^113WF1cB] [^1131Dqsw].

> I need to check surgical indications and options now. Tympanostomy tubes are appropriate for chronic OME of 3 months or more with symptoms attributable to OME such as hearing difficulties, balance problems, behavioral or school performance issues, or reduced quality of life, and for at-risk children with likely persistent effusion. In children under 4 years, tubes alone are preferred and adenoidectomy is not indicated solely for OME, whereas in children 4 years and older, adenoidectomy with or without tubes can be considered based on shared decision-making and individual risk factors [^114r7BTp] [^114VNq7z] [^113QGkvV] [^112EPWma].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought adenoidectomy might be broadly indicated in younger children, but I should correct that. The best evidence shows no clinically important benefit for adenoidectomy in children under 4 years for OME, whereas older children may accrue modest reductions in time with effusion and future surgery, so adenoidectomy should be reserved for those aged 4 years and older or when there is a distinct indication such as nasal obstruction or chronic adenoiditis [^112EPWma] [^113zjiVd].

> I should confirm the expected benefits and trade-offs of tubes. Tubes improve short- to medium-term hearing and reduce time with effusion, but benefits on long-term developmental outcomes are uncertain, and there are potential sequelae such as otorrhea, tympanosclerosis, obstruction, and rarely persistent perforation, so shared decision-making is essential and families should understand both the likely benefits and the possible harms [^111kPfZj] [^115YsAMz].

> Let me verify follow-up and surveillance plans. For children managed conservatively, re-evaluate every 3–6 months until effusion resolves or hearing loss or structural abnormalities are identified, and for children with tympanostomy tubes, arrange otolaryngology follow-up at intervals based on tube type and clinical course, avoid routine postoperative antibiotic ear drops unless there is otorrhea, and treat uncomplicated tube otorrhea with topical antibiotic drops alone without systemic antibiotics [^111Vvt6Y] [^1125FHUH] [^113deHyA].

> I should double-check special populations and edge cases. In children with craniofacial syndromes, cleft palate, or Down syndrome, OME is highly prevalent and persistent, so I should maintain a lower threshold for early hearing assessment and surgical referral, and in children with recurrent AOM, tubes reduce episode frequency when effusion is present at assessment, though benefits are limited when effusion is absent, reinforcing the need to confirm MEE before proceeding [^114G4Uh5] [^1176RR3Y] [^113uEBQr].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision flow to ensure internal consistency: confirm OME with pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry as needed, stratify risk, observe not-at-risk children for 3 months with scheduled follow-up, avoid ineffective medications, assess hearing at 3 months or earlier in at-risk children, and offer tympanostomy tubes for chronic OME with attributable symptoms or in at-risk children, adding adenoidectomy in children aged 4 years and older or when a distinct indication exists, all while documenting outcomes and engaging in shared decision-making with the family [^111UfCEi] [^1142nRLf] [^114r7BTp] [^116dAKSh].

Ear effusion (otitis media with effusion, OME) is managed with **watchful waiting for 3 months** [^1142nRLf] in children not at risk, as most cases resolve spontaneously [^116JSwVe]. Antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines, and decongestants are **not recommended** [^112EjPNp] due to limited benefit and potential harms [^111YhnVb] [^112Yd1P4]. If effusion persists beyond 3 months or hearing loss is present, obtain **hearing testing** [^113WF1cB] and consider **tympanostomy tubes** [^114VNq7z]; reserve adenoidectomy for children aged ≥ 4 years or when indicated [^113zjiVd]. Educate families on the natural history and arrange follow-up every 3–6 months until resolution or intervention [^112nBRd5] [^111Vvt6Y].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation

- **Pneumatic otoscopy**: Primary method to confirm middle ear effusion; look for retracted tympanic membrane, reduced mobility, and air-fluid levels [^111UfCEi].

- **Tympanometry**: Use when pneumatic otoscopy is inconclusive; flat (type B) tympanograms indicate effusion [^111V3q59].

- **Hearing assessment**: Obtain age-appropriate testing if effusion persists ≥ 3 months or at any duration in at-risk children [^113WF1cB].

---

## Initial management: watchful waiting

Watchful waiting entails **observing for 3 months** from onset or diagnosis in children not at risk, as most effusions resolve spontaneously [^1142nRLf] [^116JSwVe]. During this period, **reassess every 3–6 months** until resolution, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities are suspected [^113DZn4h].

---

## Medical therapy

Medical therapy is **generally not recommended** because of limited efficacy and potential adverse effects:

| **Medication** | **Recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Antibiotics | Strongly against | - Small short-term benefit <br/> - No long-term hearing improvement <br/> - Adverse effects and resistance risk [^111eJxRX] [^111YhnVb] |
| Systemic or intranasal steroids | Strongly against | - No sustained benefit <br/> - Potential adverse effects [^113ame9A] [^112Yd1P4] |
| Antihistamines, decongestants | Strongly against | - No proven benefit <br/> - Adverse effects [^112EjPNp] [^117Y9bUu] |

---

## Indications for further intervention

Intervention is indicated when any of the following are present:

- **Persistent effusion**: ≥ 3 months duration with hearing loss or symptoms (balance problems, behavioral issues, poor school performance, ear discomfort) [^114r7BTp].

- **At-risk children**: Speech-language delay, developmental disability, craniofacial anomalies, or persistent effusion with type B tympanogram [^1123JZXj] [^113cejFM].

- **Structural abnormalities**: Suspected tympanic membrane or middle ear structural issues [^1131Dqsw].

---

## Surgical interventions

### Tympanostomy tubes

Tympanostomy tubes are the **preferred initial surgical intervention** for persistent effusion with hearing loss or symptoms [^114VNq7z]. Benefits include improved hearing and reduced time with effusion, though otorrhea and tympanosclerosis may occur [^111kPfZj] [^115YsAMz].

---

### Adenoidectomy

Adenoidectomy is considered in children aged **≥ 4 years** or when a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis) [^1131Dqsw]. It may reduce effusion recurrence and improve hearing, particularly in older children [^112EPWma] [^114P4MXP].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive options include **autoinflation**, which may improve tympanometry and reduce effusion persistence but has uncertain effects on hearing; it is low-risk and may be considered during watchful waiting [^112hhMdf] [^1165K74n]. Hearing aids are an option for persistent effusion with hearing loss when surgery is not feasible or declined.

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Patient education should cover the **natural history of OME**, the importance of follow-up, and potential sequelae [^112nBRd5]. Follow-up should continue every 3–6 months until effusion resolves, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities are suspected [^111Vvt6Y].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry [^111UfCEi] [^111V3q59].

- **Watchful waiting**: 3 months for children not at risk [^1142nRLf].

- **Avoid routine medical therapy**: Antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants [^112EjPNp].

- **Hearing assessment**: If effusion persists ≥ 3 months or child is at risk [^113WF1cB].

- **Surgical intervention**: Tympanostomy tubes for persistent effusion with hearing loss or symptoms [^114VNq7z] [^114r7BTp].

- **Adenoidectomy**: Consider in children ≥ 4 years or with specific indications [^1131Dqsw].

- **Education and follow-up**: Essential components of care [^112nBRd5] [^111Vvt6Y].

---

Ear effusion is managed primarily with **watchful waiting** [^1142nRLf], with medical therapy avoided and surgery reserved for persistent cases with hearing loss or symptoms.

Regarding surgical interventions for otitis media with effusion, more specifically with respect to tympanostomy (AAO-HNSF), AAO-HNS 2022 guidelines recommend to do not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in pediatric patients with a single episode of OME of < 3 months duration, from the date of onset (if known) or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown).

### Otitis media with effusion [^117WBZDL]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline on otitis media with effusion (OME) provides evidence-based recommendations on diagnosing and managing OME in children. This is an update of the 1994 clinical practice guideline "Otitis Media With Effusion in Young Children", which was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). In contrast to the earlier guideline, which was limited to children 1 to 3 years old with no craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities or sensory deficits, the updated guideline applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery selected a subcommittee composed of experts in the fields of primary care, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, hearing, speech and language, and advanced-practice nursing to revise the OME guideline. The subcommittee made a strong recommendation that clinicians use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic method and distinguish OME from acute otitis media. The subcommittee made recommendations that clinicians should 1) document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of the child with OME, 2) distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems from other children with OME and more promptly evaluate hearing, speech, language, and need for intervention in children at risk, and 3) manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or diagnosis (if onset is unknown). The subcommittee also made recommendations that 4) hearing testing be conducted when OME persists for 3 months or longer or at any time that language delay, learning problems, or a significant hearing loss is suspected in a child with OME, 5) children with persistent OME who are not at risk should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected, and 6) when a child becomes a surgical candidate (tympanostomy tube insertion is the preferred initial procedure). Adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); repeat surgery consists of adenoidectomy plus myringotomy with or without tube insertion. Tonsillectomy alone or myringotomy alone should not be used to treat OME. The subcommittee made negative recommendations that 1) population-based screening programs for OME not be performed in healthy, asymptomatic children, and 2) because antihistamines and decongestants are ineffective for OME, they should not be used for treatment; antimicrobials and corticosteroids do not have long-term efficacy and should not be used for routine management. The subcommittee gave as options that 1) tympanometry can be used to confirm the diagnosis of OME and 2) when children with OME are referred by the primary clinician for evaluation by an otolaryngologist, audiologist, or speech-language pathologist, the referring clinician should document the effusion duration and specific reason for referral (evaluation, surgery) and provide additional relevant information such as history of acute otitis media and developmental status of the child. The subcommittee made no recommendations for 1) complementary and alternative medicine as a treatment for OME, based on a lack of scientific evidence documenting efficacy, or 2) allergy management as a treatment for OME, based on insufficient evidence of therapeutic efficacy or a causal relationship between allergy and OME. Last, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed. The purpose of this guideline is to inform clinicians of evidence-based methods to identify, monitor, and manage OME in children aged 2 months through 12 years. The guideline may not apply to children more than 12 years old, because OME is uncommon and the natural history is likely to differ from younger children who experience rapid developmental change. The target population includes children with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for use by providers of health care to children, including primary care and specialist physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and child-development specialists. The guideline is applicable to any setting in which children with OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating children with OME. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care and other clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Recommendations from others… [^112JahRK]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Which treatments for persistent otitis media with effusion are beneficial. Evidence-Based Answer Treatments such as antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines/decongestants, and mucolytics afford no long-term benefit in the treatment of patients with otitis media with effusion. Surgical treatments such as ventilation tubes and adenoidectomy improve hearing. However, surgery has conflicting effects on improving language development and behavior. There is inconclusive evidence that autoinflation of the eustachian tube with a nasal balloon improves resolution of OME. Evidence Summary OME is defined as middle ear effusion without acute inflammation. Many treatments have been recommended, although data supporting them are limited.

The results of three meta-analyses 1–3 showed that antibiotics increased the resolution of OME in the short-term. However, the results of a conflicting meta-analysis 4 of only higher quality, placebo-controlled studies showed that antibiotic therapy resulted in no significant difference compared with placebo. One meta-analysis 3 looked at outcomes beyond one month and showed no significant difference in resolution of OME. 9 of children with OME showed slight improvement in hearing with the use of ventilation tubes or adenoidectomy alone. Combining the procedures offered little additional benefit. There were no data supporting tonsillectomy in the treatment of OME. A subsequent RCT 10 of children with OME confirmed this conclusion, showing a 5 to 6 dB improvement in hearing with ventilation tubes at six and 12 months postprocedure.

Recommendations from Others A recent evidence-based practice guideline 18 from the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery recommends against the use of antibiotics, steroids, antihistamine/decongestants, mucolytics, and autoinflation in the routine treatment of OME. Surgery for persistent OME should be reserved for use in children with significant hearing loss, persistent symptoms, risk factors for developmental difficulties, or structural damage to the tympanic membrane or middle ear. Antibiotics, with or without steroids, can be considered if the parents or caregivers are strongly opposed to surgery.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113uEBQr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) without middle ear effusion (MEE) — evidence and policy emphasize natural improvement without tubes and limited prophylactic benefit, with Policy level: Recommendation. In placebo arms of randomized trials, children entered with a mean baseline rate of 5.5 or more annual episodes but averaged only 2.8 annual episodes while on placebo, and 41% had no additional episodes for a median 6 months while 83% had only 2 or fewer episodes; individual episodes were treated with a 7- to 10-day course of oral antibiotic. Systematic reviews of tympanostomy tube insertion for recurrent AOM have shown a transient benefit of questionable clinical significance with no additional benefit when compared with antibiotic use, and an RCT specifically excluding baseline MEE found no benefit for reducing subsequent AOM, although tubes decreased the mean percentage time with otitis media over the next 2 years by about 8%, or 30 days per year. Another RCT reported significant benefits in children aged 10 months to 2 years, but it included children with persistent MEE with effusions aspirated during surgery. After watchful waiting in recurrent AOM without MEE at assessment, only 34% of 123 children proceeded to tube placement and about two-thirds were managed successfully without tympanostomy tube insertion. Exceptions noted include at-risk children, severe or persistent AOM, immunosuppression, prior complications of otitis media (mastoiditis, meningitis, facial nerve paralysis), or multiple antibiotic allergy or intolerance.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^115U1GS1]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

Childhood hearing screening — otitis media with effusion (OME) diagnosis and natural history are characterized by the statement that the diagnosis of OME is a medical rather than an audiological prerogative and that the asymptomatic nature of the disease contributes to diagnostic difficulty; in 40–60% of cases of OME neither children nor their parents report significant complaints, and parent report is highly inaccurate in identifying non-acute OME; OME often remits but approximately 30–40% of children have recurrent OME and 5–10% of episodes last one year or longer; in one study, 55% of children with OME improved by three months, one third relapsed within the subsequent three months; and if middle ear effusion is present longer than three months, there will be little chance of recovery without medical treatment.

### Autoinflation for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion [^116AKMh9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) or 'glue ear' is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation or infection. It is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and the usual reason for insertion of 'grommets'. Potential treatments include decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines and antibiotics. Autoinflation devices have been proposed as a simple mechanical means of improving 'glue ear'.

Objectives

To determine the effects of autoinflation in adults and children with otitis media with effusion.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1951 to 2006), EMBASE (1974 to 2006) and twelve other databases, using the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group search strategy.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials that compared any form of autoinflation to no autoinflation in individuals with 'glue ear'.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed quality and extracted data from included studies.

Main Results

Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Improvement occurred for the composite measure of tympanogram or audiometry at less than one month (Relative Risk of Improvement (RRI) 2.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 6.58) and at more than one month (RRI 2.20, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.82). Subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a Politzer device under one month (RRI 7.07, 95% CI 3.70 to 13.51) and over one month (RRI 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.04). Pooled estimates showed non-significant change in tympanometry (type C2 and B) at less than one month (RRI 1.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.56) and non-significant improvement in tympanometry at greater than one month (RRI 1.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 4.67). Non-significant improvements occurred for discrete pure tone audiometry (RRI 0.80, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.88) and non-discrete audiometry (WMD 6.95 dB, 95% CI 21.03 to 7.13). None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

All of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and short follow up. However, because of the low cost and absence of adverse effects it is reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion. Further research should consider the duration of treatment and the long-term impact of autoinflation on developmental outcomes in children.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^111V3q59]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis media with effusion (OME) — strong recommendations state that the update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child and should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both. Clinicians should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy and should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Clinicians should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME, should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME, and should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^113zjiVd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for otitis media with effusion, more specifically with respect to adenoidectomy, AAO-HNSF, AAO-HNS 2016 guidelines recommend to offer adenoidectomy when surgery is performed for OME in ≥ 4 years old patients.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^117M7f33]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) follow-up and middle ear effusion (MEE): There is little scientific evidence for a routine 10- to 14-day reevaluation visit for all children with an episode of AOM. Persistent MEE is common and can be detected by pneumatic otoscopy (with or without verification by tympanometry) after resolution of acute symptoms, with 60% to 70% of children having MEE at two weeks after successful antibiotic treatment, decreasing to 40% at 1 month and 10% to 25% at 3 months. The presence of MEE without clinical symptoms is defined as otitis media with effusion (OME), which must be differentiated clinically from AOM and requires infrequent additional monitoring but not antibiotic therapy.

### Panel 7: otitis media: treatment and complications [^114WLTvd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice. Data Sources PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). Review Methods All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary. Conclusions Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments. Implications for Practice Emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, is important to reduce overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and antibiotic resistance. Children at risk for otitis media and its complications deserve special attention.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^112HLd2i]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy, safety, and microbiology of a thermosensitive otic suspension of ciprofloxacin (OTO-201) in children with bilateral middle ear effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement.

Study Design

Two randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled phase 3 trials. Patients were randomized to intratympanic OTO-201 or sham.

Setting

Children with bilateral middle ear effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement.

Subjects/Methods

Studies evaluated 532 patients (6 months to 17 years old) in a combined analysis of efficacy (treatment failure: presence of otorrhea, otic or systemic antibiotic use, lost to follow-up, missed visits), safety (audiometry, otoscopy, tympanometry), and microbiology.

Results

There was a lower cumulative proportion of treatment failures in patients receiving OTO-201 vs tympanostomy tubes alone (1) on days 4, 8, 15, and 29; (2) on day 15, primary end point (23.0% vs 45.1%; age-adjusted odds ratio, 0.341; P < .001; reduction in relative risk, 49%); and (3) on day 15, blinded-assessor otorrhea treatment failure (7.0% vs 19.4%; age-adjusted odds ratio, 0.303; P < .001; reduction in relative risk, 64%). Per-protocol and subgroup analyses (baseline demographics, pathogen type, culture status, effusion type, microbiologic response) supported these findings. There were no drug-related serious adverse events; the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events in both groups were pyrexia, postoperative pain, nasopharyngitis, cough, and upper respiratory tract infection. OTO-201 administration had no evidence of increased tube occlusion and no negative effect on audiometry, tympanometry, or otoscopy.

Conclusions

Combined analysis of 2 phase 3 trials demonstrated a lower cumulative proportion of treatment failures through day 15 compared with TT alone when OTO-201 was administered intratympanically for otitis media with bilateral middle ear effusion at time of tympanostomy tube placement.

### Diagnosis and treatment of otitis media [^111nc5aK]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media include rapid onset of symptoms, middle ear effusion, and signs and symptoms of middle ear inflammation. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial isolates from the middle ear fluid of children with acute otitis media. Fever, otalgia, headache, irritability, cough, rhinitis, listlessness, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and pulling at the ears are common, but nonspecific symptoms. Detection of middle ear effusion by pneumatic otoscopy is key in establishing the diagnosis. Observation is an acceptable option in healthy children with mild symptoms. Antibiotics are recommended in all children younger than six months, in those between six months and two years if the diagnosis is certain, and in children with severe infection. High-dosage amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is recommended as first-line therapy. Macrolide antibiotics, clindamycin, and cephalosporins are alternatives in penicillin-sensitive children and in those with resistant infections. Patients who do not respond to treatment should be reassessed. Hearing and language testing is recommended in children with suspected hearing loss or persistent effusion for at least three months, and in those with developmental problems.

### Otitis media [^11378QAH]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media (OM) or middle ear inflammation is a spectrum of diseases, including acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME; 'glue ear') and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). OM is among the most common diseases in young children worldwide. Although OM may resolve spontaneously without complications, it can be associated with hearing loss and life-long sequelae. In developing countries, CSOM is a leading cause of hearing loss. OM can be of bacterial or viral origin; during 'colds', viruses can ascend through the Eustachian tube to the middle ear and pave the way for bacterial otopathogens that reside in the nasopharynx. Diagnosis depends on typical signs and symptoms, such as acute ear pain and bulging of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) for AOM and hearing loss for OME; diagnostic modalities include (pneumatic) otoscopy, tympanometry and audiometry. Symptomatic management of ear pain and fever is the mainstay of AOM treatment, reserving antibiotics for children with severe, persistent or recurrent infections. Management of OME largely consists of watchful waiting, with ventilation (tympanostomy) tubes primarily for children with chronic effusions and hearing loss, developmental delays or learning difficulties. The role of hearing aids to alleviate symptoms of hearing loss in the management of OME needs further study. Insertion of ventilation tubes and adenoidectomy are common operations for recurrent AOM to prevent recurrences, but their effectiveness is still debated. Despite reports of a decline in the incidence of OM over the past decade, attributed to the implementation of clinical guidelines that promote accurate diagnosis and judicious use of antibiotics and to pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, OM continues to be a leading cause for medical consultation, antibiotic prescription and surgery in high-income countries.

### Adenoidectomy for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children [^114P4MXP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity, common amongst young children. The fluid may cause hearing loss. When persistent, it may lead to developmental delay, social difficulty and poor quality of life. Management of OME includes watchful waiting, autoinflation, medical and surgical treatment. Adenoidectomy has often been used as a potential treatment for this condition.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of adenoidectomy, either alone or in combination with ventilation tubes (grommets), for OME in children.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 20 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials in children aged 6 months to 12 years with unilateral or bilateral OME. We included studies that compared adenoidectomy (alone, or in combination with ventilation tubes) with either no treatment or non-surgical treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes (determined following a multi-stakeholder prioritisation exercise): 1) hearing, 2) otitis media-specific quality of life, 3) haemorrhage.

Secondary Outcomes

1) persistence of OME, 2) adverse effects, 3) receptive language skills, 4) speech development, 5) cognitive development, 6) psychosocial skills, 7) listening skills, 8) generic health-related quality of life, 9) parental stress, 10) vestibular function, 11) episodes of acute otitis media. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Although we included all measures of hearing assessment, the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing was our preferred method to assess hearing, due to challenges in interpreting the results of mean hearing thresholds.

Main Results

We included 10 studies (1785 children). Many of the studies used concomitant interventions for all participants, including insertion of ventilation tubes or myringotomy. All included studies had at least some concerns regarding the risk of bias. We report results for our main outcome measures at the longest available follow-up. We did not identify any data on disease-specific quality of life for any of the comparisons. Further details of additional outcomes and time points are reported in the review. 1) Adenoidectomy (with or without myringotomy) versus no treatment/watchful waiting (three studies) After 12 months there was little difference in the proportion of children whose hearing had returned to normal, but the evidence was very uncertain (adenoidectomy 68%, no treatment 70%; risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.46; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 50; 1 study, 42 participants). There is a risk of haemorrhage from adenoidectomy, but the absolute risk appears small (1/251 receiving adenoidectomy compared to 0/229, Peto odds ratio (OR) 6.77, 95% CI 0.13 to 342.54; 1 study, 480 participants; moderate certainty evidence). The risk of persistent OME may be slightly lower after two years in those receiving adenoidectomy (65% versus 73%), but again the difference was small (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.00; NNTB 13; 3 studies, 354 participants; very low-certainty evidence). 2) Adenoidectomy (with or without myringotomy) versus non-surgical treatment No studies were identified for this comparison. 3) Adenoidectomy and bilateral ventilation tubes versus bilateral ventilation tubes (four studies) There was a slight increase in the proportion of ears with a return to normal hearing after six to nine months (57% adenoidectomy versus 42% without, RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.89; NNTB 7; 1 study, 127 participants (213 ears); very low-certainty evidence). Adenoidectomy may give an increased risk of haemorrhage, but the absolute risk appears small, and the evidence was uncertain (2/416 with adenoidectomy compared to 0/375 in the control group, Peto OR 6.68, 95% CI 0.42 to 107.18; 2 studies, 791 participants). The risk of persistent OME was similar for both groups (82% adenoidectomy and ventilation tubes compared to 85% ventilation tubes alone, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07; very low-certainty evidence). 4) Adenoidectomy and unilateral ventilation tube versus unilateral ventilation tube (two studies) Slightly more children returned to normal hearing after adenoidectomy, but the confidence intervals were wide (57% versus 46%, RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.96; NNTB 9; 1 study, 72 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Fewer children may have persistent OME after 12 months, but again the confidence intervals were wide (27.2% compared to 40.5%, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.29; NNTB 8; 1 study, 74 participants). We did not identify any data on haemorrhage. 5) Adenoidectomy and ventilation tubes versus no treatment/watchful waiting (two studies) We did not identify data on the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing. However, after two years, the mean difference in hearing threshold for those allocated to adenoidectomy was -3.40 dB (95% CI -5.54 to -1.26; 1 study, 211 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There may be a small reduction in the proportion of children with persistent OME after two years, but the evidence was very uncertain (82% compared to 90%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.01; NNTB 13; 1 study, 232 participants). We noted that many children in the watchful waiting group had also received surgery by this time point. 6) Adenoidectomy and ventilation tubes versus non-surgical treatment No studies were identified for this comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

When assessed with the GRADE approach, the evidence for adenoidectomy in children with OME is very uncertain. Adenoidectomy may reduce the persistence of OME, although evidence about the effect of this on hearing is unclear. For patients and carers, a return to normal hearing is likely to be important, but few studies measured this outcome. We did not identify any evidence on disease-specific quality of life. There were few data on adverse effects, in particular postoperative bleeding. The risk of haemorrhage appears to be small, but should be considered when choosing a treatment strategy for children with OME. Future studies should aim to determine which children are most likely to benefit from treatment, rather than offering interventions to all children.

### Antibiotics for otitis media with effusion in children [^116ut4Jd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is characterised by an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear behind an intact tympanic membrane, without the symptoms or signs of acute infection. Since most cases of OME will resolve spontaneously, only children with persistent middle ear effusion and associated hearing loss potentially require treatment. Previous Cochrane reviews have focused on the effectiveness of ventilation tube insertion, adenoidectomy, nasal autoinflation, antihistamines, decongestants and corticosteroids in OME. This review, focusing on the effectiveness of antibiotics in children with OME, is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of oral antibiotics in children up to 18 years with OME.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 3); PubMed; Ovid EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 April 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing oral antibiotics with placebo, no treatment or therapy of unproven effectiveness in children with OME.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Twenty-five trials (3663 children) were eligible for inclusion. Two trials did not report on any of the outcomes of interest, leaving 23 trials (3258 children) covering a range of antibiotics, participants, outcome measures and time points for evaluation. Overall, we assessed most studies as being at low to moderate risk of bias. We found moderate quality evidence (six trials including 484 children) that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to have complete resolution at two to three months post-randomisation (primary outcome) than those allocated to the control treatment (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58 to 2.53; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 5). However, there is evidence (albeit of low quality; five trials, 742 children) indicating that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to experience diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rash (primary outcome) than those allocated to control treatment (RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.60; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 20). In respect of the secondary outcome of complete resolution at any time point, we found low to moderate quality evidence from five meta-analyses, including between two and 14 trials, of a beneficial effect of antibiotics, with a NNTB ranging from 3 to 7. Time periods ranged from 10 to 14 days to six months. In terms of other secondary outcomes, only two trials (849 children) reported on hearing levels at two to four weeks and found conflicting results. None of the trials reported data on speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life. Low quality evidence did not show that oral antibiotics were associated with a decrease in the rate of ventilation tube insertion (two trials, 121 children) or in tympanic membrane sequelae (one trial, 103 children), while low quality evidence indicated that children treated with antibiotics were less likely to have acute otitis media episodes within four to eight weeks (five trials, 1086 children; NNTB 18) and within six months post-randomisation (two trials, 199 children; NNTB 5). It should, however, be noted that the beneficial effect of oral antibiotics on acute otitis media episodes within four to eight weeks was no longer significant when we excluded studies with high risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

This review presents evidence of both benefits and harms associated with the use of oral antibiotics to treat children up to 16 years with OME. Although evidence indicates that oral antibiotics are associated with an increased chance of complete resolution of OME at various time points, we also found evidence that these children are more likely to experience diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rash. The impact of antibiotics on short-term hearing is uncertain and low quality evidence did not show that oral antibiotics were associated with fewer ventilation tube insertions. Furthermore, we found no data on the impact of antibiotics on other important outcomes such as speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life. Even in situations where clear and relevant benefits of oral antibiotics have been demonstrated, these must always be carefully balanced against adverse effects and the emergence of bacterial resistance. This has specifically been linked to the widespread use of antibiotics for common conditions such as otitis media.

Complementary and alternative medicine for OME: There remains insufficient evidence from which to formulate a recommendation on their use in children, and randomized controlled studies are necessary but do not exist; such studies will necessarily have to be large given the high rate of spontaneous resolution of OME in children and may be difficult to perform.

### A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of montelukast's effect on persistent middle ear effusion [^114Cw1ui]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2010). Low credibility.

We conducted a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to determine if the leukotriene inhibitor montelukast is effective in eliminating persistent middle ear drainage in patients with otitis media with effusion (OME). Our study population was made up of patients aged 2 to 6 years who had had confirmed OME in one or both ears for at least 2 months. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo or 4 mg of montelukast daily for 1 month. The main outcome measure was clearance of middle ear effusion as demonstrated by otoscopy and tympanometry 1 month after the initiation of treatment. Our goal was to recruit 120 patients; however, an interim analysis was conducted after 38 patients had completed their regimen (19 patients in each group) when it became apparent that montelukast was not having any effect in clearing the effusions. Indeed, the OME had cleared in only 3 montelukast patients (15.8%) and 4 controls (21.1%); the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.90). Based on this early trend, the study was terminated at this point. We conclude that montelukast appears to be no more effective than placebo in eliminating persistent middle ear effusion.

### Panel 7: treatment and comparative effectiveness research [^11774gMz]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Otitis media (OM) is one of the most common reasons for antibiotic treatment in children. Controversies regarding antibiotic treatment for OM have accumulated in the past decade, and there seem to be more dilemmas than certainties. The objectives of this article are to provide the state-of-the art review on achievements in treatment of all different stages of OM, including acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), and chronic suppurative otitis media, and to outline the future research areas.

Data Sources

PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Database, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing).

Review Methods

All types of articles related to OM treatment published in English between January 2007 and June 2011 were identified. A total of 286 articles related to OM treatment were reviewed by the panel members; 114 relevant quality articles were identified and summarized.

Results

New evidence emerged on beneficial results of antibiotic treatment, compared with observation of AOM in young children who were diagnosed based on stringent criteria. In OME, the main results were related to a nonsignificant benefit of adenoidectomy versus tympanostomy tube placement alone in the treatment of chronic OME in younger children. Other modalities of OM treatment were studied and described herein.

Conclusions and Implications For Practice

Significant progress has been made in advancing the knowledge on the treatment of OM. Areas of potential future research have been identified and outlined.

### Autoinflation for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion [^1165K74n]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2006. Otitis media with effusion (OME) or 'glue ear' is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation or infection. It is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and the usual reason for insertion of 'grommets'. Potential treatments include decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines and antibiotics. Autoinflation devices have been proposed as a simple mechanical means of improving 'glue ear'.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of autoinflation compared with no treatment in children and adults with otitis media with effusion.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 12 April 2013.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials that compared any form of autoinflation to no autoinflation in individuals with 'glue ear'.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from included studies.

Main Results

Eight studies, with a total of 702 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the studies were predominantly assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias; unclear risk was mainly due lack of information. There was no evidence of selective reporting. Pooled estimates favoured the intervention, but did not show a significant effect on tympanometry (type C2 and B) at less than one month, nor at more than one month. Similarly, there were no significant changes for discrete pure-tone audiometry and non-discrete audiometry. Pooled estimates favoured, but not significantly, the intervention for the composite measure of tympanogram or audiometry at less than one month; at more than one month the result became significant (RRI 1.74, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.50). Subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a Politzer device under one month (RRI 7.07, 95% CI 3.70 to 13.51) and over one month (RRI 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.04). None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

All of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow-up. However, because of the low cost and absence of adverse effects it is reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion. Primary care could prove a beneficial place to evaluate such interventions and there is ongoing research in this area. Further research should also consider the duration of treatment, the long-term impact on developmental outcomes in children and additional quality of life outcome measures for children and families.

### Otitis media: diagnosis and treatment [^114DqTAM]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is diagnosed in patients with acute onset, presence of middle ear effusion, physical evidence of middle ear inflammation, and symptoms such as pain, irritability, or fever. Acute otitis media is usually a complication of eustachian tube dysfunction that occurs during a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common organisms isolated from middle ear fluid. Management of acute otitis media should begin with adequate analgesia. Antibiotic therapy can be deferred in children two years or older with mild symptoms. High-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is the antibiotic of choice for treating acute otitis media in patients who are not allergic to penicillin. Children with persistent symptoms despite 48 to 72 hours of antibiotic therapy should be reexamined, and a second-line agent, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, should be used if appropriate. Otitis media with effusion is defined as middle ear effusion in the absence of acute symptoms. Antibiotics, decongestants, or nasal steroids do not hasten the clearance of middle ear fluid and are not recommended. Children with evidence of anatomic damage, hearing loss, or language delay should be referred to an otolaryngologist.

The "Cochrane Corner" is a quarterly section in the journal that highlights systematic reviews relevant to otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, with invited commentary to aid clinical decision making. This installment features a Cochrane Review, "Antibiotics for Otitis Media with Effusion in Children", that does not support the routine use of antibiotics for treating otitis media with effusion in children. Although children treated with antibiotics had higher rates of effusion resolution, there was no impact on hearing levels or the need for tympanostomy tubes.

### Antibiotics for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children [^111YhnVb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity, common amongst young children. The fluid may cause hearing loss. When persistent, it may lead to developmental delay, social difficulty and poor quality of life. Management of OME includes watchful waiting, autoinflation, medical and surgical treatment. Antibiotics are sometimes used to treat any bacteria present in the effusion, or associated biofilms.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of oral antibiotics for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished studies to 20 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials in children aged 6 months to 12 years with unilateral or bilateral OME. We included studies that compared oral antibiotics with either placebo or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were determined following a multi-stakeholder prioritisation exercise and were: 1) hearing, 2) otitis media-specific quality of life and 3) anaphylaxis. Secondary outcomes were: 1) persistence of OME, 2) adverse effects, 3) receptive language skills, 4) speech development, 5) cognitive development, 6) psychosocial skills, 7) listening skills, 8) generic health-related quality of life, 9) parental stress, 10) vestibular function and 11) episodes of acute otitis media. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Although we included all measures of hearing assessment, the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing was our preferred method to assess hearing, due to challenges in interpreting the results of mean hearing thresholds.

Main Results

We identified 19 completed studies that met our inclusion criteria (2581 participants). They assessed a variety of oral antibiotics (including penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides and trimethoprim), with most studies using a 10- to 14-day treatment course. We had some concerns about the risk of bias in all studies included in this review. Here we report our primary outcomes and main secondary outcome, at the longest reported follow-up time. Antibiotics versus placebo We included 11 studies for this comparison, but none reported all of our outcomes of interest and limited meta-analysis was possible. Hearing One study found that more children may return to normal hearing by two months (resolution of the air-bone gap) after receiving antibiotics as compared with placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (Peto odds ratio (OR) 9.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.51 to 26.18; 20/49 children who received antibiotics returned to normal hearing versus 0/37 who received placebo; 1 study, 86 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Disease-specific quality of life No studies assessed this outcome. Presence/persistence of OME At 6 to 12 months of follow-up, the use of antibiotics compared with placebo may slightly reduce the number of children with persistent OME, but the confidence intervals were wide, and the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.17; 48% versus 54%; number needed to treat (NNT) 17; 2 studies, 324 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse event: anaphylaxis No studies provided specific data on anaphylaxis. Three of the included studies (448 children) did report adverse events in sufficient detail to assume that no anaphylactic reactions occurred, but the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Antibiotics versus no treatment We included eight studies for this comparison, but very limited meta-analysis was possible. Hearing One study found that the use of antibiotics compared to no treatment may result in little to no difference in final hearing threshold at three months (mean difference (MD) -5.38 dB HL, 95% CI -9.12 to -1.64; 1 study, 73 participants; low-certainty evidence). The only data identified on the return to normal hearing were reported at 10 days of follow-up, which we considered to be too short to accurately reflect the efficacy of antibiotics. Disease-specific quality of life No studies assessed this outcome. Presence/persistence of OME Antibiotics may reduce the proportion of children who have persistent OME at up to three months of follow-up, when compared with no treatment (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.80; 6 studies, 542 participants; low-certainty evidence). Adverse event: anaphylaxis No studies provided specific data on anaphylaxis. Two of the included studies (180 children) did report adverse events in sufficient detail to assume that no anaphylactic reactions occurred, but the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the use of antibiotics for OME is of low to very low certainty. Although the use of antibiotics compared to no treatment may have a slight beneficial effect on the resolution of OME at up to three months, the overall impact on hearing is very uncertain. The long-term effects of antibiotics are unclear and few of the studies included in this review reported on potential harms. These important endpoints should be considered when weighing up the potential short- and long-term benefits and harms of antibiotic treatment in a condition with a high spontaneous resolution rate.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116JSwVe]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Natural history of otitis media with effusion (OME) — the spontaneous resolution of OME is likely but depends on the cause and onset; about 75% of children with OME resolve by 3 months when it follows an episode of acute otitis media (AOM). If the OME is spontaneous and the date of onset is unknown, the 3-month resolution rate is lower, at 56%; when the date of onset is known, this rate increases to 90%. Resolution rates also depend on how a successful outcome is defined; in the preceding paragraph, resolution is defined broadly as any improvement in tympanogram curve.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is diagnosed based on visualization of a full or bulging tympanic membrane with middle ear effusion. The distribution of bacteria causing AOM in North America under the influence of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination and antibiotic selection pressure has resulted in a predominance of β-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae followed by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although guidelines continue to endorse amoxicillin as the preferred treatment, amoxicillin/clavulanate in high dosage would be the preferred treatment based on the otopathogen mix currently. Antibiotic prophylaxis has fallen into disfavor as a preventative strategy for AOM recurrences.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113NRANZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children with frequent ear infections without persistent middle ear fluid — middle ear effusion after infection often resolves; within 3 months about 90% of children no longer have middle ear fluid. Children may still meet a recurrent infection definition (3 or more in the past 6 months, or 4 in the past 12 months) but, when no effusion is present at the specialty visit, research notes that nearly half will not have more ear infections and only about 1 in 3 children continue to have recurrent ear infections, and Other research shows that 2 out of every 3 children who see an otolaryngologist for repeated ear infections, but who have a normal examination (no middle ear fluid) in the office, do not require ear tubes in the future. The best research evidence we have suggests that inserting tubes will not reduce future ear infections when there is no persistent effusion, but the procedure does involve some minor risks related to the ear tube and general anesthesia. Waiting a bit more time to see how your child does on their own does not carry any risk or harm, since many children will not have any further ear infections at all and most will never need tubes. Exceptions are acknowledged; If any of the following apply to your child, you should discuss with your doctor whether ear tubes may still be of benefit, including weak immune system or other problems putting them at higher risk for infections; prior complications of ear infections; adverse antibiotic reactions, allergies, or inability to take oral antibiotics that make it difficult to treat ear infections when antibiotics are needed; and high risk of developmental problems including permanent hearing loss, delays in speech or language, delays in learning, autism-spectrum disorder, syndromes (e.g. Down) or structural problems with the face and head (e.g., cleft palate), or severe vision loss.

### Oral steroids for resolution of otitis media with effusion in children (OSTRICH): a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^116A5vEK]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

We recruited within our target sample size and achieved close to 90% follow-up over 12 months, including hearing and functional health status and quality-of-life assessments. We recruited children from 20 routine secondary care clinics across a wide geographical area, social deprivation, and age categories, which facilitate judgments about applicability. The study groups were well balanced for children's characteristics. A high proportion of children adhered fully to the study interventions. More children than we anticipated recovered spontaneously, raising the possibility that we might not have had sufficient power to detect a real (but smaller than anticipated) difference in our primary outcome. However, although we did find differences in tympanometry findings at 5 weeks, we found no differences in functional health status and quality-of-life measures at any timepoint, suggesting that even with a larger sample size the difference in hearing outcomes would not have translated into meaningful advantages on these measures. A large proportion of participants (68% in the steroid group and 61% in the placebo group) reported having symptoms attributable to otitis media with effusion for 12 months or more. Although these are only self-reported data, and the duration of actual effusions might have been substantially shorter, it is possible that we included a large proportion of children with more prolonged otitis media with effusion and viscous middle ear fluid. However, our subgroup analysis did not find a significant differential treatment effect by duration of symptoms and the point estimates suggested reduced benefit for those with a shorter duration of symptoms (< 12 months).

### Otitis media with effusion in children [^1138hp8V]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 80% of children have been affected by otitis media with effusion (OME) by the age of 4 years, but prevalence declines beyond 6 years of age. Non-purulent middle-ear infections can occur in children or adults after upper respiratory tract infection or acute otitis media. Half or more of cases resolve within 3 months and 95% within a year, but complications such as tympanic membrane perforation, tympanosclerosis, otorrhoea, and cholesteatoma can occur.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent OME; and of pharmacological, mechanical, and surgical interventions to treat OME? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to March 2006. (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 22 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adenoidectomy, antibiotics, antihistamines, autoinflation, bottle feeding, decongestants, exposure to other children, intranasal corticosteroids, mucolytics, oral corticosteroids, passive smoking, ventilation tubes.

### Autoinflation for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children [^112hhMdf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity, common amongst young children. The fluid may cause hearing loss. When persistent, it may lead to behavioural problems and a delay in expressive language skills. Management of OME includes watchful waiting, medical, surgical and mechanical treatment. Autoinflation is a self-administered technique, which aims to ventilate the middle ear and encourage middle ear fluid clearance by providing a positive pressure of air in the nose and nasopharynx (using a nasal balloon or other handheld device). This positive pressure (sometimes combined with simultaneous swallow) encourages opening of the Eustachian tube and may help ventilate the middle ear.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy (benefits and harms) of autoinflation for the treatment of otitis media with effusion in children.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 20 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials in children aged 6 months to 12 years with unilateral or bilateral OME. We included studies that compared autoinflation with either watchful waiting (no treatment), non-surgical treatment or ventilation tubes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were determined following a multi-stakeholder prioritisation exercise and were: 1) hearing, 2) OME-specific quality of life and 3) pain and distress. Secondary outcomes were: 1) persistence of OME, 2) other adverse effects (including eardrum perforation), 3) compliance or adherence to treatment, 4) receptive language skills, 5) speech development, 6) cognitive development, 7) psychosocial skills, 8) listening skills, 9) generic health-related quality of life, 10) parental stress, 11) vestibular function and 12) episodes of acute otitis media. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Although we included all measures of hearing assessment, the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing was our preferred method to assess hearing, due to challenges in interpreting the results of mean hearing thresholds.

Main Results

We identified 11 completed studies that met our inclusion criteria (1036 participants). The majority of studies included children aged between 3 and 11 years. Most were carried out in Europe or North America, and they were conducted in both hospital and community settings. All compared autoinflation (using a variety of different methods and devices) to no treatment. Most studies required children to carry out autoinflation two to three times per day, for between 2 and 12 weeks. The outcomes were predominantly assessed just after the treatment phase had been completed. Here we report the effects at the longest follow-up for our main outcome measures. Return to normal hearing The evidence was very uncertain regarding the effect of autoinflation on the return to normal hearing. The longest duration of follow-up was 11 weeks. At this time point, the risk ratio was 2.67 in favour of autoinflation (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.73 to 4.12; 85% versus 32%; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 2; 1 study, 94 participants), but the certainty of the evidence was very low. Disease-specific quality of life Autoinflation may result in a moderate improvement in quality of life (related to otitis media) after short-term follow-up. One study assessed quality of life using the Otitis Media Questionnaire-14 (OMQ-14) at three months of follow-up. Results were reported as the number of standard deviations above or below zero difference, with a range from -3 (better) to +3 (worse). The mean difference was -0.42 lower (better) for those who received autoinflation (95% CI -0.62 to -0.22; 1 study, 247 participants; low-certainty evidence; the authors report a change of 0.3 as clinically meaningful). Pain and distress caused by the procedure Autoinflation may result in an increased risk of ear pain, but the evidence was very uncertain. One study assessed this outcome, and identified a risk ratio of 3.50 for otalgia in those who received autoinflation, although the overall occurrence of pain was low (95% CI 0.74 to 16.59; 4.4% versus 1.3%; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 32; 1 study, 320 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Persistence of OME The evidence suggests that autoinflation may slightly reduce the persistence of OME at three months. Four studies were included, and the risk ratio for persistence of OME was 0.88 for those receiving autoinflation (95% CI 0.80 to 0.97; 4 studies, 483 participants; absolute reduction of 89 people per 1000 with persistent OME; NNTB 12; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

All the evidence we identified was of low or very low certainty, meaning that we have little confidence in the estimated effects. However, the data suggest that autoinflation may have a beneficial effect on OME-specific quality of life and persistence of OME in the short term, but the effect is uncertain for return to normal hearing and adverse effects. The potential benefits should be weighed against the inconvenience of regularly carrying out autoinflation, and the possible risk of ear pain.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — guideline scope and target population includes children aged 2 through 12 years and applies to any setting where OME is identified, monitored, or managed; however, it does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years of age. The document does not explicitly discuss indications for tympanostomy tubes, despite OME being the leading indication for tube insertion, because those indications are covered in a companion guideline; instead, surgical discussions focus on adjuvant procedures (eg, adenoidectomy, myringotomy) and sequelae of OME. It also aims to educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME, the lack of clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants), and includes goals for OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion [^114EDL2Q]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline on otitis media with effusion (OME) provides evidence-based recommendations on diagnosing and managing OME in children. This is an update of the 1994 clinical practice guideline "Otitis Media With Effusion in Young Children", which was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). In contrast to the earlier guideline, which was limited to children aged 1 to 3 years with no craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities or sensory deficits, the updated guideline applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery selected a subcommittee composed of experts in the fields of primary care, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, hearing, speech and language, and advanced practice nursing to revise the OME guideline. The subcommittee made a strong recommendation that clinicians use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic method and distinguish OME from acute otitis media (AOM). The subcommittee made recommendations that clinicians should (1) document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of the child with OME; (2) distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems from other children with OME and more promptly evaluate hearing, speech, language, and need for intervention in children at risk; and (3) manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known), or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). The subcommittee also made recommendations that (4) hearing testing be conducted when OME persists for 3 months or longer, or at any time that language delay, learning problems, or a significant hearing loss is suspected in a child with OME; (5) children with persistent OME who are not at risk should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; and (6) when a child becomes a surgical candidate, tympanostomy tube insertion is the preferred initial procedure. Adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); repeat surgery consists of adenoidectomy plus myringotomy, with or without tube insertion. Tonsillectomy alone or myringotomy alone should not be used to treat OME. The subcommittee made negative recommendations that (1) population-based screening programs for OME not be performed in healthy, asymptomatic children and (2) antihistamines and decongestants are ineffective for OME and should not be used for treatment; antimicrobials and corticosteroids do not have long-term efficacy and should not be used for routine management. The subcommittee gave as options that (1) tympanometry can be used to confirm the diagnosis of OME and (2) when children with OME are referred by the primary clinician for evaluation by an otolaryngologist, audiologist, or speech-language pathologist, the referring clinician should document the effusion duration and specific reason for referral (evaluation, surgery), and provide additional relevant information such as history of AOM and developmental status of the child. The subcommittee made no recommendations for (1) complementary and alternative medicine as a treatment for OME based on a lack of scientific evidence documenting efficacy and (2) allergy management as a treatment for OME based on insufficient evidence of therapeutic efficacy or a causal relationship between allergy and OME. Last, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed. The purpose of this guideline is to inform clinicians of evidence-based methods to identify methods to identify, monitor, and manage OME in children aged 2 months through 12 years. The guideline may not apply to children older than 12 years because OME is uncommon and the natural history is likely to differ from younger children who experience rapid developmental change. The target population includes children with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for use by providers of health care to children, including primary care and specialist physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and child development specialists. The guideline is applicable to any setting in which children with OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating children with OME. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care and other clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

The cumulative proportion of treatment failures through day 15 was analyzed for the per-protocol population as a sensitivity analysis of the primary end point. Additional sensitivity analyses included the number and percentage of patients in the intent-to-treat population with treatment failures through day 15, summarized by subgroup according to sex, race, ethnicity, age stratum, baseline culture status, baseline effusion type and microbiology culture positivity.

Secondary efficacy end points included cumulative proportions of treatment failures (full analysis and per protocol), including by defined cause of treatment failure (full analysis), at days 4, 8, and 29; the cumulative proportion otorrhea-only treatment failures (ie, otorrhea as identified by the blinded assessor) at day 15; and microbiologic response at days 15 and 29 with presumption (patients with positive baseline cultures and without postbaseline cultures who were not treatment failures) or without presumption (patients with positive baseline cultures and negative postbaseline cultures).

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion executive summary (update) [^117Y9bUu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery featuring the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis Media with Effusion". To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 18 recommendations developed emphasize diagnostic accuracy, identification of children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from otitis media with effusion, and education of clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most otitis media with effusion and the lack of efficacy for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Otitis media: to treat, to refer, to Do nothing: a review for the practitioner [^113LZphu]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility. On the basis of research evidence, a recommended strategy for improving the care of middle ear infections is to identify the subset of patients least likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy. They include children ages 6 months to 23 months with unilateral disease without severe signs and symptoms (moderate or severe otalgia, otalgia lasting more than 48 hours, or temperature of 39°C [102.2°F]), and those older than 2 years ofage with unilateral or bilateral disease who have mild signs andsymptoms.(9) On the basis of research evidence, the initial treatment of otitis media with effusion is watchful observation. There is little harm in observing a child who is not at risk for speech, language, or learning difficulties compared to medical or surgical intervention.(4) On the basis of research evidence, administration of the annual influenza vaccine and the conjugated pneumococcal vaccination has been shown to have a small but statistically significant impact on the frequency of middle ear disease. (7)(8) On the basis of expert opinion, optimal outcomes depend oncommunication between clinicians and parents. At a minimum, primary care clinicians should state their reasons for their own clinical judgment about appropriate management and for referral to otolaryngology if necessary.

Efficacy assessments

The primary efficacy end point in both trials was assessed by the cumulative proportion of treatment failures (days 4–15), defined as one of the following, which ever occurred first: (1) otorrhea treatment failure — the presence of TT otorrhea in one or both ears, as noted by a blinded assessor (a medical professional who was not present during surgery nor involved in the preparation of the study drug) during the visual external ear examination on or after 3 days postsurgery (day 4); (2) otic treatment failure — patient received otic antibiotic drops any time postsurgery through day 15 prior to otorrhea confirmation by the blinded assessor; (3) systemic antibiotic treatment failure — patient received a systemic antibiotic any time postsurgery through day 15 prior to otorrhea confirmation by the blinded assessor; (4) loss to follow-up; or (5) missed visit treatment failure — patient not lost to follow-up who had a missing treatment failure status at a visit through day 15.

An effusion sample taken at the time of surgery was taken for microbiologic culture, sensitivity, and exploratory microbiologic testing. In addition to the otoscopic examination performed by the unblinded investigator, the assessment of TT otorrhea (a visual external ear examination) for the efficacy end point occurred on days 4, 8, 15, and 29 by the blinded assessor.

If the blinded assessor confirmed otorrhea in either ear on or after 3 days postsurgery (day 4), a specimen for culture was obtained, and the patient was eligible to receive ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone,4 drops twice a day in both ears for 7 days. All patients were asked to continue all trial assessments, regardless of otorrhea status, including continued assessment by the blinded assessor. Effusion type for each ear was categorized as absent, serous, purulent, sanguineous, or mucoid. Positive microbiology cultures were analyzed by the number of ears positive overall and the number of ears positive for each of the 5 organisms.

### Topical and oral steroids for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children [^112Yd1P4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity, common amongst young children. The fluid may cause hearing loss. Although most episodes of OME in children resolve spontaneously within a few months, when persistent it may lead to behavioural problems and a delay in expressive language skills. Management of OME includes watchful waiting, medical, surgical and other treatments, such as autoinflation. Oral or topical steroids are sometimes used to reduce inflammation in the middle ear.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of topical and oral steroids for OME in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished studies on 20 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials in children aged 6 months to 12 years with unilateral or bilateral OME. We included studies that compared topical or oral steroids with either placebo or watchful waiting (no treatment).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes, determined by a multi-stakeholder prioritisation exercise, were: 1) hearing, 2) OME-specific quality of life and 3) systemic corticosteroid side effects. Secondary outcomes were: 1) presence/persistence of OME, 2) other adverse effects (including local nasal effects), 3) receptive language skills, 4) speech development, 5) cognitive development, 6) psychosocial outcomes, 7) listening skills, 8) generic health-related quality of life, 9) parental stress, 10) vestibular function and 11) episodes of acute otitis media. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Although we included all measures of hearing assessment, the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing was our preferred method to assess hearing, due to challenges in interpreting the results of mean hearing thresholds.

Main Results

We included 26 studies in this review (2770 children). Most studies of oral steroids used prednisolone for 7 to 14 days. Studies of topical (nasal) steroids used various preparations (beclomethasone, fluticasone and mometasone) for between two weeks and three months. All studies had at least some concerns regarding risk of bias. Here we report our primary outcomes and main secondary outcome, at the longest reported follow-up. Oral steroids compared to placebo Oral steroids probably result in little or no difference in the proportion of children with normal hearing after 12 months (69.7% of children with steroids, compared to 61.1% of children receiving placebo, risk ratio (RR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.33; 1 study, 332 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference in OME-related quality of life (mean difference (MD) in OM8–30 score 0.07, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.34; 1 study, 304 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Oral steroids may reduce the number of children with persistent OME at 6 to 12 months, but the size of the effect was uncertain (absolute risk reduction ranging from 13.3% to 45%, number needed to treat (NNT) of between 3 and 8; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain regarding the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects, and we were unable to conduct any meta-analysis for this outcome. Oral steroids compared to no treatment Oral steroids may result in little or no difference in the persistence of OME after three to nine months (74.5% children receiving steroids versus 73% of those receiving placebo; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; 2 studies, 258 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence on adverse effects was very uncertain. We did not identify any evidence on hearing or disease-related quality of life. Topical (intranasal) steroids compared to placebo We did not identify data on the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing. However, the mean change in hearing threshold after two months was -0.3 dB lower (95% CI -6.05 to 5.45; 1 study, 78 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that nasal steroids make little or no difference to disease-specific quality of life after nine months (OM8–30 score, MD 0.05 higher, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.46; 1 study, 82 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of nasal steroids on persistence of OME at up to one year. Two studies reported this: one showed a potential benefit for nasal steroids, the other showed a benefit with placebo (2 studies, 206 participants). The evidence was also very uncertain regarding the risk of corticosteroid-related side effects, as we were unable to provide a pooled effect estimate. Topical (intranasal) steroids compared to no treatment We did not identify data on the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing. However, the mean difference in final hearing threshold after four weeks was 1.95 dB lower (95% CI -3.85 to -0.05; 1 study, 168 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nasal steroids may reduce the persistence of OME after eight weeks, but the evidence was very uncertain (58.5% of children receiving steroids, compared to 81.3% of children without treatment, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91; 2 studies, 134 participants). We did not identify any evidence on disease-related quality of life or adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, oral steroids may have little effect in the treatment of OME, with little improvement in the number of children with normal hearing and no effect on quality of life. There may be a reduction in the proportion of children with persistent disease after 12 months. However, this benefit may be small and must be weighed against the potential for adverse effects associated with oral steroid use. The evidence for nasal steroids was all low- or very low-certainty. It is therefore less clear if nasal steroids have any impact on hearing, quality of life or persistence of OME. Evidence on adverse effects was very limited. OME is likely to resolve spontaneously for most children. The potential benefit of treatment may therefore be small and should be balanced with the risk of adverse effects. Future studies should aim to determine which children are most likely to benefit from treatment, rather than offering interventions to all children.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^1132DX9C]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) with middle ear effusion (MEE): Clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent AOM who have unilateral or bilateral MEE at the time of assessment for tube candidacy, with a Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with minimal limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm; the aggregate evidence quality is Grade B, based on RCTs with minor limitations, and the level of confidence in evidence is Medium. Benefits include a mean decrease of approximately 3 episodes of AOM per year, ability to treat future episodes of AOM with topical antibiotics instead of systemic antibiotics, reduced pain with future AOM episodes, and improved hearing during AOM episodes, while risks are described as risks from anesthesia, sequelae of the indwelling tympanostomy tubes (otorrhea, granulation tissue, obstruction), complications after tube extrusion (myringosclerosis, retraction pocket, persistent perforation), tube medialization, procedural anxiety and discomfort, and direct procedural costs; overall, the benefit–harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. The method of confirming the presence of MEE should be based on clinician experience and may include tympanometry, simple otoscopy, and/or pneumatic otoscopy, and there is a substantial role for shared decision making regarding the decision to proceed with or decline tympanostomy tube insertion. Bilateral insertion of tympanostomy tubes is recommended even if only unilateral effusion is present, because more than 70% of children have similar eustachian tube function on the both sides.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^113oVfNp]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) referral guidance — treatment and monitoring indicates that clinical practice guidelines concluded that OME medical therapies should only be used if OME is persistent or provides significant benefit beyond the natural course of OME, and it was further recommended that children with OME without risk factors should be monitored for three months from the date of onset or diagnosis; when a referral is made, the following information should be included if known: duration and laterality of OME, results of prior hearing evaluations or tympanometry, evidence or concern of speech/language difficulties, and conditions that would exacerbate the impact of OME.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^1176RR3Y]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) with persistent middle ear effusion (MEE) — tympanostomy tube evidence and guidance: Tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent AOM decreased the average number of AOM episodes by about 2.5 per child-year in 2 RCTs; an RCT of children younger than 2 years reported a significant but modest reduction of 0.55 per child-year, and when otitis media with effusion (OME) lasts 2 months or longer, reductions of 0.20–0.72 per child-year are reported, whereas one trial in children with recurrent AOM but without MEE found no reduction. Additional benefits include decreased pain and the ability to manage AOM with topical antibiotic eardrops, and eardrops alone are highly effective for AOM with tubes; audiometric benefits are noted but are no longer present after 2 years. Clinicians should offer tympanostomy tubes to children with recurrent AOM and MEE with shared decisions with the child's caregiver, and a period of surveillance with reassessment at 3- to 6-month intervals can be used when there is uncertainty about surgery appropriateness.

### Nonsurgical home treatment of middle ear effusion and associated hearing loss in children. part I: clinical trial [^1174L3jJ]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2005). Low credibility.

We conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of treatment of persistent middle ear effusion (MEE) and associated hearing loss with a modified Politzer device used in the home setting over a 7-week period. Efficacy was determined by comparing pre-and posttherapy air-conduction thresholds, tympanometric peak pressures, and otoscopic findings. The study group was made up of 94 children (174 ears), aged 4 to 11 years, who had at least a 2-month history of MEE and associated hearing loss. At study's end, patients in the treatment group experienced statistically significant improvements in all measured outcomes; no significant improvements were seen in the control group in all measured outcomes. At study's end, the hearing sensitivity of 73.9% of the treated ears was within normal limits, compared with only 26.7% of the control ears. These findings demonstrate that home treatment of children with persistent MEE and associated hearing loss with the modified Politzer device is highly efficacious.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112YAxw6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2004 guideline codeveloped by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials, enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and it applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years old.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME; (6) should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME; and (7) should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME, need for follow-up, and the possible sequelae; (6) should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old; adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); (10) should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥ 4 years old; and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

Antibiotics for OME: A 2012 Cochrane review of 23 studies showed a small benefit for complete resolution of the effusion, but antibiotic therapy did not have any significant impact on hearing levels or the rate of subsequent tympanostomy tube insertion; the authors concluded that antibiotic therapy should not be used to treat OME because small benefits are offset by adverse events, bacterial resistance, and no impact on hearing levels or future surgery, although these findings would not preclude using antibiotics when associated illnesses are present that would benefit from antibiotics, such as acute bacterial sinusitis or group A streptococcal infection.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^114G4Uh5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion — at-risk infants and children: At-risk children with OME require more frequent hearing assessment and prompt management to prevent additional impact on developmental outcomes. This category includes children with speech-language or academic delay and those with developmental disability of any cause, especially Down syndrome and other craniofacial anomalies in which OME is very common and persistent. Children in these categories should receive otologic and hearing screening or assessment when speech-language delay is identified to allow prompt treatment for OME, and hearing should be reassessed following medical or surgical treatment, at ongoing intervals (at least annually), or as recommended in relevant clinical practice guidelines.

### Otitis media with effusion… [^1165G9qK]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

What is otitis media with effusion. Otitis media with effusion is an ear infection with fluid in the middle ear. This fluid usually doesn't bother children. It almost always goes away on its own. So, this kind of ear infection doesn't have to be treated with antibiotics, unless the fluid doesn't go away. What causes this kind of ear infection. Fluid may build up in the middle ear for two reasons. First, when a child has a cold, the middle ear may produce fluid just like the nose does, but the fluid doesn't drain out of the middle ear as easily as it does from the nose. Second, children who have a "regular" ear infection could have otitis media with effusion the next time, if the fluid stays in the middle ear for a long time. How is this kind of ear infection treated. The best treatment is to let the fluid go away by itself. Are antibiotics ever needed for an ear infection with fluid. Yes.

If the fluid is still there after a few months and is causing hearing loss or problems in both ears, antibiotics may help some children. For this reason, your child's ears should be checked a few months after an ear infection. If the fluid is still there, a hearing test may be the next step. Why not just try antibiotics right now. Giving your child unnecessary antibiotics can be harmful. After each course of antibiotics, the germs in the nose and throat are more likely to become resistant. Resistant germs can't be killed by the usual antibiotics. More expensive and powerful antibiotics have to be used. Some of these antibiotics must be given in the hospital. Since fluid in the ears doesn't usually bother children, it's better to wait and only give antibiotics when they're necessary.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^114KbQJ2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) frequently asked questions — ear fluid is described as "a buildup of mucus or liquid behind the eardrum, without symptoms of an ear infection", and ear infections (acute otitis media [AOM]) "cause fever, ear pain, and active (acute) inflammation"; in OME the fluid "is not actively infected, and pain may be absent or minimal". The page notes that "Nearly all children get ear fluid at least once by school age". Children may have "no symptoms at all or more subtle findings", and clinicians can detect fluid "by looking in the ear canal (otoscopy) or by measuring the movement of the eardrum (tympanometry or pneumatic otoscopy)". Causes listed include "a cold, an ear infection (AOM), or the normal congestion (negative pressure)", and most fluid "goes away on its own in weeks or months". OME "is of more concern if it lasts > 3 mo", and "Your doctor should check the ears periodically until the fluid is gone"; management advice notes that the "best advice can be found in clinical practice guidelines" based on evidence and consideration of benefits and harms.

### Plain language summary: otitis media with effusion [^112z1Txc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This plain language summary serves as an overview in explaining otitis media with effusion (pronounced Oh-TIE-tis ME-dee-uh with Ef-YOO-zhun), abbreviated "OME" and often called "ear fluid". The summary applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years with OME and is based on the 2015 "Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis Media with Effusion (Update)". The evidence-based guideline includes research to support more effective diagnosis and treatment of OME in children. The guideline was developed as a quality improvement opportunity for managing OME by creating clear recommendations to use in medical practice.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^117Kyqvf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) patient management and follow-up — ear fluid is a buildup of mucus or liquid behind the ear drum without symptoms of infection, and fluid often goes away on its own, so your doctor will often recommend watchful waiting for the first 3 mo; it is most likely to go away quickly if it has been there < 3 mo or has a known start time, while it is much more likely to persist when it has been there for at least 3 mo or when the start date is unknown. Home measures include keeping the child away from secondhand smoke and, if the child is > 12 mo and still uses a pacifier, stopping the pacifier in the daytime may help the fluid go away. Medical treatment does not work well; you should not give your child antibiotics, antihistamines, decongestants, steroids (by mouth or in the nose), or drugs to reduce acid reflux, and no benefits have ever been shown for chiropractic therapy, special diets, herbal remedies, complementary medicine, or alternative (natural) therapies. Ongoing monitoring is advised — the best way to prevent problems is to see the doctor every 3 to 6 mo until the fluid goes away. The fluid cannot directly turn into an ear infection, but during a cold it increases a child's risk of getting an ear infection.

### Antibiotics for otitis media with effusion in children [^115hg79k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is characterised by an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear behind an intact tympanic membrane, without the symptoms or signs of acute infection. In approximately one in three children with OME, however, a bacterial pathogen is identified in the middle ear fluid. In most cases, OME causes mild hearing impairment of short duration. When experienced in early life and when episodes of (bilateral) OME persist or recur, the associated hearing loss may be significant and have a negative impact on speech development and behaviour. Since most cases of OME will resolve spontaneously, only children with persistent middle ear effusion and associated hearing loss potentially require treatment. Previous Cochrane reviews have focused on the effectiveness of ventilation tube insertion, adenoidectomy, autoinflation, antihistamines, decongestants, and oral and topical intranasal steroids in OME. This review focuses on the effectiveness of antibiotics in children with OME.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in children up to 18 years with OME.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 22 February 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing oral antibiotics with placebo, no treatment or therapy of unproven effectiveness. Our primary outcome was complete resolution of OME at two to three months. Secondary outcomes included resolution of OME at other time points, hearing, language and speech, ventilation tube insertion and adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data using standardised data extraction forms and assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We presented dichotomous results as risk differences as well as risk ratios, with their 95% confidence intervals. If heterogeneity was greater than 75% we did not pool data.

Main Results

We included 23 studies (3027 children) covering a range of antibiotics, participants, outcome measures and time points of evaluation. Overall, we assessed the studies as generally being at low risk of bias. Our primary outcome was complete resolution of OME at two to three months. The differences (improvement) in the proportion of children having such resolution (risk difference (RD)) in the five individual included studies ranged from 1% (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.12; not significant) to 45% (RD 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.65). Results from these studies could not be pooled due to clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Pooled analysis of data for complete resolution at more than six months was possible, with an increase in resolution of 13% (RD 0.13, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.19). Pooled analysis was also possible for complete resolution at the end of treatment, with the following increases in resolution rates: 17% (RD 0.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.24) for treatment for 10 days to two weeks, 34% (RD 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.50) for treatment for four weeks, 32% (RD 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.47) for treatment for three months, and 14% (RD 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.24) for treatment continuously for at least six months. We were unable to find evidence of a substantial improvement in hearing as a result of the use of antibiotics for otitis media with effusion; nor did we find an effect on the rate of ventilation tube insertion. We did not identify any trials that looked at speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life. Data on the adverse effects of antibiotic treatment reported in six studies could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity. Increases in the occurrence of adverse events varied from 3% (RD 0.03, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.07; not significant) to 33% (RD 0.33, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.44) in the individual studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of our review do not support the routine use of antibiotics for children up to 18 years with otitis media with effusion. The largest effects of antibiotics were seen in children treated continuously for four weeks and three months. Even when clear and relevant benefits of antibiotics have been demonstrated, these must be balanced against the potential adverse effects when making treatment decisions. Immediate adverse effects of antibiotics are common and the emergence of bacterial resistance has been causally linked to the widespread use of antibiotics for common conditions such as otitis media.

### Ventilation tubes (grommets) for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children [^111kPfZj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity, common amongst young children. It may cause hearing loss which, when persistent, may lead to developmental delay, social difficulty and poor quality of life. Management includes watchful waiting, autoinflation, medical and surgical treatment. Insertion of ventilation tubes has often been used as the preferred treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects (benefits and harms) of ventilation tubes (grommets) for OME in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials on 20 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in children (6 months to 12 years) with OME for ≥ 3 months. We included studies that compared ventilation tube (VT) insertion with five comparators: no treatment, watchful waiting (ventilation tubes inserted later, if required), myringotomy, hearing aids and other non-surgical treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were determined following a multi-stakeholder prioritisation exercise and were: 1) hearing; 2) OME-specific quality of life; 3) persistent tympanic membrane perforation (as a severe adverse effect of the surgery). Secondary outcomes were: 1) persistence of OME; 2) other adverse effects (including tympanosclerosis, VT blockage and pain); 3) receptive language skills; 4) speech development; 5) cognitive development; 6) psychosocial skills; 7) listening skills; 8) generic health-related quality of life; 9) parental stress; 10) vestibular function; 11) episodes of acute otitis media. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for key outcomes. Although we included all measures of hearing assessment, the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing was our preferred method, due to challenges in interpreting the results of mean hearing thresholds.

Main Results

We included 19 RCTs (2888 children). We considered most of the evidence to be very uncertain, due to wide confidence intervals for the effect estimates, few participants, and a risk of performance and detection bias. Here we report our key outcomes at the longest reported follow-up. There were some limitations to the evidence. No studies investigated the comparison of ventilation tubes versus hearing aids. We did not identify any data on disease-specific quality of life; however, many studies were conducted before the development of specific tools to assess this in otitis media. Short-acting ventilation tubes were used in most studies and thus specific data on the use of long-acting VTs is limited. Finally, we did not identify specific data on the effects of VTs in children at increased risk of OME (e.g. with craniofacial syndromes). Ventilation tubes versus no treatment (four studies) The odds ratio (OR) for a return to normal hearing after 12 months was 1.13 with VTs (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 2.74; 54% versus 51%; 1 study, 72 participants; very low-certainty evidence). At six months, VTs may lead to a large reduction in persistent OME (risk ratio (RR) 0.30, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.65; 20.4% versus 68.0%; 1 study, 54 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the chance of persistent tympanic membrane perforation with VTs at 12 months (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.91; 8.3% versus 9.7%; 1 RCT, 144 participants). Early ventilation tubes versus watchful waiting (six studies) There was little to no difference in the proportion of children whose hearing returned to normal after 8 to 10 years (i.e. by the age of 9 to 13 years) (RR for VTs 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.03; 93% versus 95%; 1 study, 391 participants; very low-certainty evidence). VTs may also result in little to no difference in the risk of persistent OME after 18 months to 6 years (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.74; 15% versus 12%; 3 studies, 584 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We were unable to pool data on persistent perforation. One study showed that VTs may increase the risk of perforation after a follow-up duration of 3.75 years (RR 3.65, 95% CI 0.41 to 32.38; 1 study, 391 participants; very low-certainty evidence) but the actual number of children who develop persistent perforation may be low, as demonstrated by another study (1.26%; 1 study, 635 ears; very low-certainty evidence). Ventilation tubes versus non-surgical treatment (one study) One study compared VTs to six months of antibiotics (sulphisoxazole). No data were available on return to normal hearing, but final hearing thresholds were reported. At four months, the mean difference was -5.98 dB HL lower (better) for those receiving VTs, but the evidence is very uncertain (95% CI -9.21 to -2.75; 1 study, 125 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No evidence was identified regarding persistent OME. VTs may result in a low risk of persistent perforation at 18 months of follow-up (no events reported; narrative synthesis of 1 study, 60 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ventilation tubes versus myringotomy (nine studies) We are uncertain whether VTs may slightly increase the likelihood of returning to normal hearing at 6 to 12 months, since the confidence intervals were wide and included the possibility of no effect (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.53; 74% versus 64%; 2 studies, 132 participants; very low-certainty evidence). After six months, persistent OME may be reduced for those who receive VTs compared to laser myringotomy, but the evidence is very uncertain (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.38; 1 study, 272 participants; very low-certainty evidence). At six months, the risk of persistent perforation is probably similar with the use of VTs or laser myringotomy (narrative synthesis of 6 studies, 581 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There may be small short- and medium-term improvements in hearing and persistence of OME with VTs, but it is unclear whether these persist after longer follow-up. The RCTs included do not allow us to say when (or how much) VTs improve hearing in any specific child. However, interpretation of the evidence is difficult: many children in the control groups recover spontaneously or receive VTs during follow-up, VTs may block or extrude, and OME may recur. The limited evidence in this review also affects the generalisability/applicability of our findings to situations involving children with underlying conditions (e.g. craniofacial syndromes) or the use of long-acting tubes. Consequently, RCTs may not be the best way to determine whether an intervention is likely to be effective in any individual child. Instead, we must better understand the different OME phenotypes to target interventions to children who will benefit most, and avoid over-treating when spontaneous resolution is likely.

### Identification of children in the first four years of life for early treatment for otitis media with effusion [^113LmV47]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is the most common cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and has been associated with delayed language development and behavioural problems. This condition has a point-prevalence of about 20% at the age of two years, a time of rapid language development. It is most often asymptomatic. Effective treatment exists for clearing effusions. Some have argued, therefore, that children should be screened and treated early if found to have clinically important OME. However, there is a high rate of spontaneous resolution of effusions and, for some children, effusions may represent a physiological response that does not reduce hearing significantly or impact negatively on language development or behaviour. Previous reviews of the effect of screening and treatment have included studies using non-randomised designs.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess evidence from randomised controlled trials about the effect, on language and behavioural outcomes, of screening and treating children with clinically important OME in the first four years of their life. The focus was on the first four years of life because this is the time of most rapid language development. The consequences of hearing loss are likely to be most serious during this time. In addition, children of this age are least likely to be able to report or seek help for impaired hearing, particularly if these problems have a slow onset and are subtle.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2006), MEDLINE (1950 to 2006) and EMBASE (1974 to 2006) in February 2002, and again in January 2006, and the reference lists of all studies. We also contacted the first authors of the studies we included in the original review.

Selection Criteria

1. Randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions for OME among children with OME identified through screening.2. Comparison of outcomes for children randomised to be screened for OME and outcomes for children who were not randomised to be screened for OME.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality, two in the original review and two for the update.

Main Results

We identified no trials comparing outcomes for children randomised to be screened for OME with outcomes for children who were not randomised to be screened for OME. We identified three trials evaluating interventions for OME among children with OME identified through screening, one of which generated three published studies. These were trials of treatment in children identified through screening rather than trials of treatment programs. From these trials, we found no evidence of clinically important benefit in language development from screening and treating children with clinically important OME.

Authors' Conclusions

The identified randomised trials do not show an important benefit on language development and behaviour from screening of the general population of asymptomatic children in the first four years of life for OME. However, these trials were all conducted in developed countries. Evidence generated in the developed world, where children may enjoy better nutrition, better living conditions and less severe and different infections may not be applicable to children in developing countries. The screening aspect of some of these studies was aimed primarily at identifying suitable children in whom to evaluate the effects of treatment, rather than to evaluate the effects of screening programs. Younger children and children with milder disease may have been included in these treatment trials compared to children who are offered treatment in pragmatic settings.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^115Ssjx4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion guideline — evidence-based statements and clinical judgment state that guidelines are intended to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, produce optimal health outcomes for patients, and minimize harm; the evidence-based approach requires that evidence be identified, appraised, and summarized with an explicit link between evidence and statements, and statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm. Guidelines are never intended to supplant professional judgment; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than with a recommendation, options offer the most opportunity for practice variability, and Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations.

### Surgical treatments for otitis media with effusion: a systematic review [^115YsAMz]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The near universality of otitis media with effusion (OME) in children makes a comparative review of treatment modalities important. This study's objective was to compare the effectiveness of surgical strategies currently used for managing OME.

Methods

We identified 3 recent systematic reviews and searched 4 major electronic databases. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized trials, and cohort studies that compared myringotomy, adenoidectomy, tympanostomy tubes (tubes), and watchful waiting. Using established criteria, pairs of reviewers independently selected, extracted data, rated risk of bias, and graded strength of evidence of relevant studies. We incorporated meta-analyses from the earlier reviews and synthesized additional evidence qualitatively.

Results

We identified 41 unique studies through the earlier reviews and our independent searches. In comparison with watchful waiting or myringotomy (or both), tubes decreased time with OME and improved hearing; no specific tube type was superior. Adenoidectomy alone, as an adjunct to myringotomy, or combined with tubes, reduced OME and improved hearing in comparison with either myringotomy or watchful waiting. Tubes and watchful waiting did not differ in language, cognitive, or academic outcomes. Otorrhea and tympanosclerosis were more common in ears with tubes. Adenoidectomy increased the risk of postsurgical hemorrhage.

Conclusions

Tubes and adenoidectomy reduce time with OME and improve hearing in the short-term. Both treatments have associated harms. Large, well-controlled studies could help resolve the risk-benefit ratio by measuring acute otitis media recurrence, functional outcomes, quality of life, and long-term outcomes. Research is needed to support treatment decisions in subpopulations, particularly in patients with comorbidities.

Chronic OME — natural history and predictors of persistence: The natural history of OME is favorable and intervention is usually unnecessary even if OME persists for > 3 months, but the longer the effusion is present the more the rate of resolution decreases and relapse becomes more common; risk factors associated with reduced likelihood of spontaneous resolution include onset of OME in summer or fall season, history of prior tympanostomy tubes, and not having a prior adenoidectomy.

Surgery for children aged ≥ 4 years with OME — if a decision is reached to manage OME in a child aged ≥ 4 years with surgical intervention, adenoidectomy, tympanostomy tube insertion, or both can be recommended, and the availability of at least 3 surgical options (tubes alone, adenoidectomy alone, or adenoidectomy plus tubes) creates an opportunity for shared decision making with caregivers; evidence from an individual patient data meta-analysis based on 1761 children from 10 randomized trials (9 comparisons of adenoidectomy with or without tubes vs no surgery or tubes alone) found no clinically important benefits for adenoidectomy in children < 4 years old, whereas children aged ≥ 4 years old spent 50 fewer days with OME over the next 12 months, had lower failure rates (51% vs 70%), and a lower rate of future surgery (2% vs 19%); in that study, failure at 12 months was defined as additional surgery, recurrent AOM, middle ear effusion at least 50% of the time, or average hearing improvement < 10-dB HL; additionally, a review of 15 randomized trials and observational studies evaluated tympanostomy tubes with or without adenoidectomy as primary therapy for OM.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) medical therapy — For purposes of counseling parents, the clinician should convey that drugs and medications are not recommended for managing OME. Antihistamines, decongestants, antireflux therapy, and topical nasal steroids are ineffective. Orally administered steroids have short-term efficacy, but after 1 or 2 months the benefit is no longer significant. Antibiotics have a small benefit in resolving OME, but they have significant adverse effects and do not improve HLs or reduce the need for future surgery. Last, despite the popularity of complementary and alternative therapy, there are no RCTs to show benefits in managing OME.

### The role of allergy in otitis media with effusion [^1125kdnS]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The role of allergy in chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) is controversial. New evidence from cellular biology and immunology explain the basics of allergic reactions and allow more accurate diagnosis of allergies and inflammatory disease throughout the unified airway. This article examines the epidemiologic, methodological, and immunologic studies of allergic causes of OME, including (1) evidence for and against OME as an allergic disease, (2) allergy as a cause for eustachian tube obstruction, (3) examination of the most sensitive diagnostic tests for allergy, and (4) the effect of treatment of underlying allergies in improving and resolving middle ear disease.
