## Question

A 28-year-old primigravid woman comes to the emergency department because of a 12-hour history of lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. She also had nausea and fatigue for the past 3 weeks. Her last menstrual period was 8 weeks ago. Prior to that, her menses occurred regularly at 30-day intervals and lasted for 4 days. There is no history of medical illness, and she takes no medications. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. Pelvic examination is painful and shows a uterus consistent in size with a 13-week gestation. A urine pregnancy test is positive. β-HCG level is 106,000 mIU/mL (N < 5 mIU/mL). Transvaginal ultrasonography shows unclear, amorphous fetal parts and a large placenta with multiple cystic spaces. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?
A. Placenta implantation into myometrium
B. Malignant transformation of trophoblastic tissue
C. Trophoblastic proliferation with chorionic villi distention
D. Malpositioned placenta overlying the cervix

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pathophysiologic mechanism best explains a 28-year-old with 8-week amenorrhea, markedly elevated β-hCG, uterine size larger than dates, and ultrasound showing a large placenta with multiple cystic spaces and amorphous fetal parts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it fits gestational trophoblastic disease. Then, I should verify the ultrasound features and what they imply histologically. Next, I will review the differential diagnoses and eliminate alternatives like ectopic pregnancy, placenta previa, and invasive placentation. Finally, I will match the most accurate pathophysiologic description to the correct option and confirm it aligns with authoritative guidance and pathology.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. The combination of vaginal bleeding, uterine enlargement beyond gestational age, and markedly elevated β-hCG strongly suggests gestational trophoblastic disease, particularly a hydatidiform mole, which classically presents with bleeding and uterine size greater than expected for dates, often with hyperemesis and high hCG levels due to trophoblastic proliferation [^ed0967ac] [^85d56e7a] [^ecfa88fa].

> Wait, let me verify the ultrasound findings. A large placenta with multiple cystic spaces and amorphous or unclear fetal parts is characteristic of a complete hydatidiform mole, where villous edema produces the "snowstorm" or "grape-like" appearance and no viable fetus is present; this pattern is well described in imaging and pathology summaries of molar pregnancy and is distinct from a normal placenta or other first-trimester pathologies [^85d56e7a] [^16d654d5] [^4baa3da3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the differential and actively exclude alternatives. Ectopic pregnancy would show an extrauterine gestational sac or adnexal mass rather than an enlarged uterus with cystic placental changes, and the β-hCG discriminatory zone logic does not fit this scenario where an intrauterine process is clearly seen on ultrasound, making ectopic unlikely here [^7d4d8f1f] [^068ad0d5]. Placenta previa presents in the second or third trimester with painless bleeding and a placenta covering the cervix, which does not match this first-trimester presentation or sonographic pattern, so I can rule that out [^8240382a]. Placenta accreta spectrum implies abnormal invasion into the myometrium and is typically a third-trimester concern with prior uterine surgery; it does not explain cystic placental changes or the first-trimester mole phenotype, so this is not the best fit either.

> I need to ensure the pathophysiology I select matches the disease process. The correct mechanism in complete hydatidiform mole is trophoblastic proliferation with edematous, distended chorionic villi forming cystic spaces and producing excessive hCG; this is precisely why the uterus is large for dates and why ultrasound shows a placenta with multiple cystic spaces and absent or amorphous fetal parts, reflecting androgenetic paternal origin and absent fetal development in complete moles [^85d56e7a] [^ed0967ac].

> Let me consider the options carefully. Option A, placenta implantation into myometrium, describes placenta accreta, which is not the pathophysiology of molar pregnancy and does not account for cystic villi or the classic mole ultrasound, so I should reject it. Option B, malignant transformation, is a potential complication after molar evacuation and requires persistent hCG, but it is not the primary pathophysiology of the initial molar gestation itself, so this is not the best answer to "cause of this patient's condition". Option D, malpositioned placenta overlying the cervix, is placenta previa, which again is temporally and sonographically inconsistent with this case. Option C, trophoblastic proliferation with chorionic villi distention, accurately captures the histopathology and explains the clinical and ultrasound features, making it the most likely cause here [^85d56e7a] [^ed0967ac].

> I should double-check that my choice aligns with guidelines and teaching. Authoritative sources describe hydatidiform mole as abnormal trophoblastic proliferation with edematous villi and absent or nonviable fetal tissue, producing uterine enlargement and high hCG, which matches this presentation and supports Option C as the correct mechanism [^85d56e7a] [^ed0967ac].

---

The most likely cause is **trophoblastic proliferation with chorionic villi distention** (option C), which defines a **complete hydatidiform mole**. This diagnosis is supported by the markedly elevated β-hCG (106,000 mIU/mL), uterine size larger than expected for gestational age, and ultrasound showing a large placenta with multiple cystic spaces and amorphous fetal parts. These features reflect abnormal trophoblastic growth with edematous, cystic villi and absent or nonviable fetal tissue, which is pathognomonic for a complete mole [^85d56e7a] [^ed0967ac].

---

## Clinical features supporting the diagnosis

- **Markedly elevated β-hCG**: β-hCG of 106,000 mIU/mL is far above the normal range for 8 weeks' gestation, consistent with trophoblastic overgrowth in complete moles [^85d56e7a].

- **Uterine enlargement**: The uterus is larger than expected for 8 weeks, a classic sign of a complete mole due to trophoblastic proliferation and edematous villi [^85d56e7a].

- **Ultrasound findings**: A large placenta with multiple cystic spaces and amorphous fetal parts is characteristic of a complete mole, reflecting hydropic villi and absent or nonviable fetal tissue [^85d56e7a].

- **Symptoms**: Nausea, fatigue, and vaginal bleeding are common in complete moles, driven by high hCG and trophoblastic proliferation [^85d56e7a].

---

## Pathophysiology of complete hydatidiform mole

Complete moles result from **fertilization of an empty ovum by two sperm**, yielding a 46, XX or 46, XY genome that is entirely paternal. This drives **trophoblastic proliferation** with edematous, cystic villi and no viable fetal tissue, explaining the ultrasound and clinical findings [^85d56e7a].

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other options

| **Option** | **Condition** | **Reason for exclusion** |
|-|-|-|
| A | Placenta implantation into myometrium (placenta accreta) | - Occurs in late pregnancy <br/> - Not associated with markedly elevated β-hCG or cystic placental changes [^notfound] |
| B | Malignant transformation of trophoblastic tissue (gestational trophoblastic neoplasia) | - A complication after molar pregnancy <br/> - Not the initial pathophysiology [^86e4cf50] |
| D | Malpositioned placenta overlying the cervix (placenta previa) | - Presents in late pregnancy <br/> - Not associated with markedly elevated β-hCG or cystic placental changes [^8240382a] |

---

## Conclusion

The most likely cause is **trophoblastic proliferation with chorionic villi distention** (option C), which is the hallmark of a complete hydatidiform mole. This diagnosis is supported by the markedly elevated β-hCG, uterine enlargement, and characteristic ultrasound findings, and it aligns with the pathophysiology of paternally derived trophoblastic overgrowth with hydropic villi and absent viable fetal tissue [^85d56e7a] [^ed0967ac].

American College of Emergency Physicians clinical policy — early pregnancy in the emergency department — revises the 2003 policy and frames evidence-based recommendations through three critical questions. It asks whether the emergency physician should obtain a pelvic ultrasound in a clinically stable pregnant patient with abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding and a beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level below a discriminatory threshold; in patients with an indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound, what is the diagnostic utility of β-hCG for predicting possible ectopic pregnancy; and, in patients receiving methotrexate for confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy, what are the implications for emergency department management. Evidence was graded and recommendations were developed.

Molar pregnancy is a rare complication of pregnancy and the diagnosis is usually confirmed with a markedly elevated beta-hCG and a "snowstorm" appearance on pelvic ultrasound. Patients frequently present with a positive pregnancy test, vaginal bleeding, nausea and vomiting. A 23-year-old woman presented to our Emergency Department with a history of 7 weeks of intermittent vaginal bleeding and 1 h of peri-umbilical abdominal pain. She reported that 7 weeks before this visit she was diagnosed with a miscarriage. The bedside qualitative urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test that we performed was negative, but the quantitative serum hCG was markedly elevated. Ultrasound and operative findings confirmed the diagnosis of molar pregnancy. We conclude that rapid urine qualitative hCG assays may not be reliable in the presence of markedly elevated hCG levels found in molar pregnancy.

β-hCG discriminatory threshold and ultrasound decision-making in early pregnancy — concepts and risks: Algorithms guiding the evaluation of abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy generally incorporate the results of quantitative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) measurements and pelvic ultrasonography. Many algorithms apply the principle of the discriminatory threshold, historically defined as the level at which the sensitivity of ultrasound was thought to approach 100% for the detection of intrauterine pregnancy; the commonly reported range for radiologist-performed transvaginal sonography is 1,000 to 2,000 mIU/mL. The text notes that ectopic pregnancies can present at almost any β-hCG level, high or low, and that rupture has been documented at very low β-hCG levels; an indeterminate study is also called "nondiagnostic" or a "pregnancy of unknown location".

Fetal death early in gestation is common. Patients in the first trimester of pregnancy with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding often present to the emergency department for care. Over the past 20 years, the technology available to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of a nonviable pregnancy has improved dramatically. These improvements have altered the diagnostic approach to these patients and have lead to a change in the terminology used to categorize the pregnancy status. In addition, the therapeutic options available to manage patients with a confirmed nonviable pregnancy have expanded greatly. In this article, we re-evaluate the classification scheme used to categorize patients with first trimester pain or bleeding given the improved technology that is available to the emergency physician today. We discuss the role of ultrasound and biochemical markers in confirming or excluding the diagnosis of a nonviable pregnancy. Finally, we review the therapeutic options, including expectant, surgical as well as medical management that are available once the diagnosis of a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy has been confirmed.

Hydatidiform mole (HM) presentation and workup — patients commonly present with vaginal bleeding, typically around 6 to 16 weeks of gestation. Due to widespread ultrasound screening during early pregnancy and accurate hCG testing, most cases are detected before additional signs such as uterine enlargement beyond that expected for gestation date, preeclampsia, hyperemesis, anemia, and theca lutein ovarian cysts. Partial HMs tend to grow more slowly and may present later in the first or early second trimester, often with symptoms of incomplete or missed abortion with diagnosis on histologic examination of the curettage specimen.

### Diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy [^19cd9387]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Ectopic pregnancy is a high-risk condition that occurs in 1.9 percent of reported pregnancies. The condition is the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in the first trimester. If a woman of reproductive age presents with abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, syncope, or hypotension, the physician should perform a pregnancy test. If the patient is pregnant, the physician should perform a work-up to detect possible ectopic or ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Prompt ultrasound evaluation is key in diagnosing ectopic pregnancy. Equivocal ultrasound results should be combined with quantitative beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin levels. If a patient has a beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin level of 1,500 mIU per mL or greater, but the transvaginal ultrasonography does not show an intrauterine gestational sac, ectopic pregnancy should be suspected. Diagnostic uterine curettage may be appropriate in patients who are hemodynamically stable and whose beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin levels are not increasing as expected. Appropriate treatment for patients with nonruptured ectopic pregnancy may include expectant management, medical management with methotrexate, or surgery. Expectant management is appropriate only when beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin levels are low and declining. Initial levels determine the success of medical treatment. Surgical treatment is appropriate if ruptured ectopic pregnancy is suspected and if the patient is hemodynamically unstable.

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a condition that can occur after ovarian stimulation, often in the context of fertility treatments. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing and assessing the severity of OHSS. Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality used to evaluate the ovaries, where findings typically include enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled cysts, ranging from small to large, representing enlarged follicles or corpus luteum cysts (Fig. 5). In severe cases, free fluid may be seen in the pelvis or abdomen due to capillary leakage. In more advanced stages, CT or MRI scans may be employed to assess complications such as ovarian torsion, ascites, pleural effusions or other signs of severe OHSS. Particularly, MRI is very helpful in differentiating OHSS from ovarian tumours, including choriocarcinoma, which can also produce high hCG levels, by demonstrating markedly bilateral symmetrically enlarged ovaries with simple cysts of different size, separated by thin septa and lacking inhomogeneous solid tissue consistent with malignancy (Fig. 5).

Emergency department early pregnancy — Dart et al. conducted a prospective, observational study including pregnant patients with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding who presented to an ED and had an indeterminate ultrasound result, aiming to determine whether indeterminate comprehensive ultrasound results could be subclassified to risk‑stratify patients and to examine the predictive value of β-hCG level for ectopic pregnancy; ultrasound was diagnostic of IUP if a gestational sac with yolk sac or fetal pole was seen, considered diagnostic or suggestive of ectopic pregnancy if an extrauterine sac, a complex mass discrete from the ovary, or a large amount of fluid in the cul-de-sac was present, and all other results were indeterminate with subclassifications; 780 were identified but 145 were lost to follow-up, with 635 patients included, and the overall incidence of ectopic pregnancy was 7% (46 of 635), with ectopic pregnancy rate 15% (95% CI 11% to 20%) when β-hCG level < 1,000 mIU/mL and 2% (95% CI 1% to 4%) when β-hCG level > 1,000 mIU/mL; limitation: Large number lost to follow-up.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^8240382a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Obstetrical and gynecological conditions — differential diagnosis outlines hallmark presentations and timing for abruptio placenta, placenta previa, ectopic pregnancy, and spontaneous abortion. Abruptio placenta "Most frequently occurs in third trimester of pregnancy; placenta prematurely separates from the uterus causing intrauterine bleeding", with features including "Lower abdominal pain, uterine rigidity (often not present until abruption is advanced)", that "Vaginal bleeding – this symptom may not occur in cases of concealed abruption", and possible "Shock, with minimal or no vaginal bleeding". Placenta previa is described as "placenta covers part or all of the cervical opening", occurring "Generally, late second or third trimester" with "Painless vaginal bleeding, unless in active labor". Ectopic pregnancy is "First trimester" with "Abdominal/pelvic pain with or without minimal bleeding" and that "Shock is possible even with minimal or no vaginal bleeding". Spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) is "Generally, first trimester" with "Intermittent pelvic pain (uterine contractions) with vaginal bleeding/passage of clots or tissue".

Case presentation

A 33-year-old nulliparous divorced PCOS woman was admitted to the surgical emergency department complaining of 15 days of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting that had worsened within the 3 h prior to presentation. An appointment for a gastroenteroscopy was made a week ago complaining of digestive symptoms. The patient was admitted to the gynecological department for multidisciplinary consultation.

The woman reported that her last menstrual period occurred 37 days ago lasting 8 days long. Her next most recent menstrual period occurred 3 months more ago, presenting as a small amount of brown vaginal bleeding over the course of 1 month. She was diagnosed as PCOS 8 years ago. Her menstrual history had been significant for bleeding that lasted for 8–20 days, with irregular periods, 30–90 days apart.

She revealed a 4-year history of primary infertility with her ex-husband for which she had undergone IVF and failed to obtain a clinical pregnancy after three times of freeze–thaw embryo transfers in total with six good quality embryos on day 3, which could be diagnosed as repeated implantation failure (RIF).

The patient denied the possibility of pregnancy. As a "self-identified" infertile woman, she divorced with her ex-husband one year ago, and started intercourse with her new boyfriend six month ago without contraception.

Her pulse rate was125 bpm/min and blood pressure indicated 99/50 mmHg. She was pale, lethargic, and demonstrated abdominal tenderness.

A rapid urine pregnancy test was administered, and the positive result was unexpected. Other significant laboratory values included those for hemoglobin (59 g/L) and beta-hCG was more than 10,000 m-international units per milliliter. Sonogram findings were significant for the absence of intrauterine gestation; a placenta and well-formed living fetus were seen in the abdomen, to the upper right of the uterus, accompanied by moderate free fluid within the abdomen (Fig. 1). The fetus had a crown-rump length of 6.1 cm, corresponding to 12 weeks and 4 days of gestation, the fetal heart rate was176 bpm. A spontaneous conceived AP was ensured.

### Ectopic pregnancy: diagnosis and management [^7d4d8f1f]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized ovum implants outside of the uterine cavity. In the United States, the estimated prevalence of ectopic pregnancy is 1% to 2%, and ruptured ectopic pregnancy accounts for 2.7% of pregnancy-related deaths. Risk factors include a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, cigarette smoking, fallopian tube surgery, previous ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Ectopic pregnancy should be considered in any patient presenting early in pregnancy with vaginal bleeding or lower abdominal pain in whom intrauterine pregnancy has not yet been established. The definitive diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy can be made with ultrasound visualization of a yolk sac and/or embryo in the adnexa. However, most ectopic pregnancies do not reach this stage. More often, patient symptoms combined with serial ultrasonography and trends in beta human chorionic gonadotropin levels are used to make the diagnosis. Pregnancy of unknown location refers to a transient state in which a pregnancy test is positive but ultrasonography shows neither intrauterine nor ectopic pregnancy. Serial beta human chorionic gonadotropin levels, serial ultrasonography, and, at times, uterine aspiration can be used to arrive at a definitive diagnosis. Treatment of diagnosed ectopic pregnancy includes medical management with intramuscular methotrexate, surgical management via salpingostomy or salpingectomy, and, in rare cases, expectant management. A patient with diagnosed ectopic pregnancy should be immediately transferred for surgery if she has peritoneal signs or hemodynamic instability, if the initial beta human chorionic gonadotropin level is high, if fetal cardiac activity is detected outside of the uterus on ultrasonography, or if there is a contraindication to medical management.

### A case of intrauterine molar pregnancy with coexistent ectopic pregnancy [^31e3709d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

We describe a woman who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. She was initially diagnosed by the emergency physician with a molar pregnancy by transvaginal ultrasound, which was confirmed and treated by the consulting obstetrical service with a dilatation and curettage the following day. The patient was discharged home later that same day and subsequently returned to the ED after several hours complaining of an acute worsening of her abdominal pain with associated fatigue and lightheadedness. Transabdominal ultrasound performed by the emergency physician demonstrated intra-abdominal free fluid, and the obstetrical service was immediately contacted. Subsequent operative management identified a separate ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the fallopian tube that was confirmed by pathologic analysis after laparoscopic removal.

### Live birth in a twin pregnancy with a complete hydatidiform mole and a coexisting normal fetus [^cf908e09]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Co-presentation of complete mole with live pregnancy is very rare, few cases with live birth were reported. The diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, which is important to set the management plan antenatal, intrapartum, postnatal and neonatal. Our patient conceived during follow-up for previous partial molar pregnancy. Early pregnancy scan showed a gestational sac with cystic spaces. Ultrasound scans by fetal medicine specialists revealed a normally developing fetus with partly multicystic placenta. She was delivered by caesarean section at 31 weeks due to abdominal pain and increasing size of the theca lutein cysts. Placental histology and cytogenetics confirmed the diagnosis. Further course of care was uneventful. Incidence of the above-mentioned condition is 1 in 20 000 to 100 000. This is a high-risk pregnancy with multiple maternal, fetal and neonatal complications. The suggested management plan involves a multidisciplinary team and individualised care with close maternal and fetal monitoring.

### Atypical presentation of molar pregnancy [^a57c982b]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The classic features of molar pregnancy are irregular vaginal bleeding, hyperemesis, enlarged uterus for gestational age and early failed pregnancy. Less common presentations include hyperthyroidism, early onset pre-eclampsia or abdominal distension due to theca lutein cysts. Here, we present a case of molar pregnancy where a woman presented to the emergency department with symptoms of acute abdomen and was treated as ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The woman underwent laparoscopy and evacuation of retained products of conception. Histological examination of uterine curettage confirmed the diagnosis of a complete hydatidiform mole. The woman was discharged home in good general condition with a plan for serial beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) follow-up. Complete follow-up includes use of contraception and follow-up after beta-hCG is negative for a year.

### Retroperitoneal ectopic pregnancy: a case report and review of the literature [^41ebe903]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 32-year-old woman, gravida 5, para 1 (12 years ago by Cesarean section) with 4 induced abortions (the last one 2 years ago), was admitted due to amenorrhea for 38 days and left lower abdominal pain for 2 days accompanied with mild nausea, tender breasts, and rectal pressure. Eight days prior to admission, her urine human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test was positive and blood HCG level was 1880 m-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). There was no vaginal bleeding. Color TVS showed no intrauterine gestational sac, but there was a left adnexal heterogeneous mass approximately 21 mm × 14 mm × 20 mm in size with signs of blood supply. The right adnexa appeared normal. There was free fluid 38 mm in depth within the pouch of Douglas. The past and family histories were unremarkable. General physical examination revealed nothing remarkable and the vital signs were normal. Gynecological examination found that the uterine cervix was smooth with tenderness upon palpation and movement; the uterine body was enlarged equivalent to the size of 40-day-gestation, soft, and with smooth surfaces; the left adnexa was slightly thickened with tenderness; and the right adnexa was unremarkable. The patient was diagnosed as ectopic pregnancy and was prepared for emergent laparoscopy. Under laparoscopy, the uterus appeared enlarged equivalent to the size of 40-day-gestation, with smooth surfaces, but without bleeding; the right uterine tube and ovary appeared normal; the left uterine tube was normal (Fig. 1a); the left ovary was slightly enlarged, partly covered by a blood clot (Fig. 1a - 1b), but had no rupture or bleeding after the clot was removed; there was a small amount of unclotted blood in the pouch of Douglas; there were no abnormal findings in the greater omentum, small intestines, colons, and mesenteries. After removing the blood clot and free blood, a circular peritoneal defect of approximately 10 mm in diameter was found lateral to the left sacrocervical ligament, anterior to the left ovarian fossa, and next to the lower edge of the left broad ligament (Fig. 1c). The surrounding peritoneum appeared bluish in color (Fig. 1c) and bled when pressured with a probe. A 10-mm cut was made medial to the defect to open into the retroperitoneal space (Fig. 1d). The blood clot with gestational tissues was pulled out of the retroperitoneal space (Fig. 1e). The retroperitoneal space was cleaned and irrigated with saline, where part of the left ureter was seen with edema. Bleeding was stopped by bipolar coagulation (Fig. 1f). Absorbable hemostatic cellulose (Surgicel® Fibrillar™ Hemostat, Ethicon, LLC, San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico, USA) was inserted into the retroperitoneal space to prevent further bleeding (Fig. 1g). Pathological examination of the gestational tissues found chorionic villi (Fig. 1h). The patient lost about 300 mL of blood during the surgery, but did not need any blood transfusion. She recovered smoothly and was discharged on the next day after surgery. The patient's blood HCG level decreased to 320 mIU/mL 1 week after surgery and returned to normal range 29 days after surgery.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^6d40331d]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Emergency department early pregnancy evaluation — prospective observational study in patients with first-trimester abdominal pain or bleeding presenting to the ED assessed the utility of comprehensive ultrasound, β-hCG, and history and physical for ectopic pregnancy diagnosis, defined ultrasound categories for IUP and ectopic findings, and reported diagnostic outcomes. Indeterminate ultrasound occurred in 72 of 403 (18%) with overall ectopic pregnancy incidence 13%; among indeterminate scans, 15 (21%) had ectopic pregnancy, with risk 10/25 (40%) for β-hCG ≤ 1,000 mIU/mL and 5/47 (11%) for β-hCG > 1,000 mIU/mL. Follow-up limitations included 9% lost to follow-up and a small sample size of patients with β-hCG < 1,000 mIU/mL or indeterminate ultrasound.

### Use of point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome [^fb6ba7c9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) occurs when ovaries are overstimulated and enlarged due to fertility treatments resulting in a shift of serum from the intravascular space to the third space, mainly the abdominal cavity. It is the most serious complication of ovarian hyperstimulation for assisted reproduction.

Case Report

We present the case of a 40-year-old woman who presented with abdominal bloating and nausea 2 weeks after undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF); she was diagnosed by an outside radiology ultrasound as having a ruptured ovarian cyst. A point-of-care emergency ultrasound performed by the emergency physician made the diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. This led to more expedient management and obstetrical consultation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Abdominal bloating and nausea are common presenting complaints in pregnant women. OHSS is a rare but potentially fatal complication of IVF. Recognition and early diagnosis by the emergency physician can lead to appropriate intervention and consultation.

### Accuracy of single progesterone test to predict early pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding: meta-analysis of cohort studies [^322a241a]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain are the most common causes of consultation in early pregnancy; 30% of women will experience pain or bleeding in their first trimester. These symptoms lead to anxiety and can be the first signs of a possible miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. Miscarriage occurs in 10–20% of all recognised pregnancies, and the prevalence of ectopic pregnancies in the United Kingdom is 1.6%, which is raised to 3% in women with symptoms. Most women seeking medical advice have a transvaginal ultrasound scan to confirm a viable pregnancy, a miscarriage, or an ectopic pregnancy. However, even with expert use of transvaginal ultrasound, confirming if a pregnancy is intrauterine or extrauterine may not be possible in 8–31% of cases at the first visit. An observational study of pregnancies with inconclusive ultrasound results has shown that 50% spontaneously resolve (decreasing concentrations of β human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG)), 27% are subsequently diagnosed as viable, and 14% are diagnosed as ectopic pregnancies. The high incidence of miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies in women with inconclusive ultrasound results warrants further tests to reach a diagnosis. Measurement of serum β-hCG can be useful, but often more than one β-hCG measurements is needed to make a diagnosis.

Serum progesterone has been proposed as a useful test to distinguish a viable pregnancy from a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. Low progesterone values are associated with miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies, both considered non-viable pregnancies, and high progesterone concentrations with viable pregnancies. Knowledge about the diagnostic accuracy of a single serum progesterone measurement to determine the viability of the pregnancy may accelerate diagnosis, avoiding further tests and unnecessary interventions, and improve outcomes. National recommendations refrain from defining how this test should be used in diagnostic algorithms. The reason for this is that clinical practice is informed by individual small studies with unstable inferences and conflicting results on the accuracy of a single serum progesterone measurement in determining the viability of the pregnancy. A meta-analysis in 1998 did not take into account the recent widespread use of transvaginal ultrasound, which may improve the accuracy of this test. The aim of our review was to evaluate the accuracy of a single progesterone measurement, by a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies, to predict pregnancy outcome in women with pain or bleeding in early pregnancy with or without an inconclusive ultrasound diagnosis.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^206c52e7]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Transvaginal ultrasound and β-hCG in proven ectopic pregnancy — A secondary analysis from a prior cohort of 380 pregnant patients with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding with ultrasound within 48 h of surgery correlated transvaginal ultrasound findings with β-hCG in patients with proven ectopic pregnancy. Ultrasound was considered diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy if a complex adnexal mass or gestational saclike adnexal ring was seen and "nondiagnostic" if pelvic fluid alone was seen; absence of intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) with β-hCG level > 1,000 mIU/mL was considered suggestive of ectopic pregnancy. Results reported that 120 patients were included, 38 had β-hCG level < 1,000 mIU/mL; the original cohort had a 32% incidence of ectopic pregnancy; transvaginal ultrasound was diagnostic in 92% (95% CI 79% to 97%) with β-hCG level < 1,000 mIU/mL.

### Ultrasound assessment of premenopausal bleeding [^32f8dd01]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is the most common cause of emergency care in the first trimester of pregnancy and accounts for the majority of premenopausal bleeding cases. Ultrasound evaluation combined with a quantitative beta human chorionic gonadotropin test is an established diagnostic tool to assess these patients. Spontaneous abortion because of genetic abnormalities is the most common cause of vaginal bleeding; ectopic pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease are other important causes and in all patients presenting with first trimester bleeding, ectopic pregnancy should be suspected and excluded, as it is associated with significant maternal morbidity and mortality. A thorough knowledge of the normal sonographic appearance of intrauterine gestation is essential to understand the manifestations of an abnormal gestation. Arteriovenous malformation of the uterus is a rare but important cause of vaginal bleeding in the first trimester, as it has to be differentiated from the more common retained products of conception, with which it is often mistaken.

### A painless pelvic wall ectopic pregnancy [^b8f4b019]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 38-year-old woman presented with light vaginal bleeding at approximately 8weeks gestation. Although she initially presented to accident and emergency with vaginal bleeding and menstrual-like pain, this rapidly settled and both symptoms resolved over the following days. An initial ultrasound scan revealed an empty uterus, with no adnexal masses or free fluid. Miscarriage was presumed. However, following suboptimal β-human chorionic gonadotropin decline, further ultrasonography noted a mass next to the right ovary. The patient underwent laparoscopy, revealing an ectopic pregnancy closely adherent to the peritoneum of the right pelvic wall. The patient was treated with systemic methotrexate and responded well. This rare form of ectopic pregnancy has a high maternal morbidity and mortality, and its optimal management is not definitively decided, due to the scarcity of the condition and subsequent lack of high-powered data. We present a case of successful medical management.

### Magnitude and predictors of gestational trophoblastic disease in east Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3903916c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) represents a spectrum of pregnancy-related disorders originating from the abnormal proliferation of trophoblastic tissue, encompassing benign hydatidiform moles (complete and partial) and malignant gestational trophoblastic neoplasms. Characterized by elevated β-hCG secretion, GTD presents clinically with vaginal bleeding, uterine enlargement disproportionate to gestational age, and the absence of fetal heart tones. While highly curable with proper management, particularly in developed nations, GTD remains a significant contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality in resource-limited settings, such as East Africa, where delayed diagnosis and limited access to specialized care are major challenges.

Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is characterized by the secretion of a specific tumor marker, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG). This condition is highly treatable, even in cases of metastasis. Common clinical manifestations include amenorrhea, vaginal bleeding in the early trimester, spontaneous passage of grape-like vesicles, an enlarged uterus compared to the gestational age, and absence of fetal parts after 20 weeks of gestation. Ultrasonography is a reliable, noninvasive diagnostic tool for GTD in clinical practice.

The global epidemiology of GTD reveals striking geographical variations, with incidence rates in East Africa ranging from 2.8 to 11.4 cases per 1,000 deliveries, which is markedly higher than the 0.6–2.6 per 1,000 pregnancies reported in Western countries. This disparity likely reflects differences in the prevalence of risk factors, diagnostic capabilities and healthcare infrastructure.

Extensive research has identified several well-established predictors of GTD, including extremes of maternal age (< 15 or > 45 years), prior molar pregnancy (10–20 × increased risk), multiparity, and nutritional deficiencies (particularly carotene and folic acid deficiency). Emerging evidence also suggests the involvement of genetic factors and environmental exposure).

Despite this growing understanding of GTD risk factors, critical gaps remain in the East African context. Existing studies from the region show concerning inconsistencies in reported prevalence estimates and risk factor associations in the region. For instance, hospital-based studies in Ethiopia report a prevalence ranging from 1.8 to 11.4 per 1,000 deliveries, whereas data from Tanzania and Kenya show similarly wide variations.

### Does this woman have an ectopic pregnancy? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^068ad0d5]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The rapid identification and accurate diagnosis of women who may have an ectopic pregnancy is critically important for reducing the maternal morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy and precision of the patient history, clinical examination, readily available laboratory values, and sonography in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy in women with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding during early pregnancy.

Data Sources

We conducted MEDLINE and EMBASE searches for English-language articles from 1965 to December 2012 reporting on the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.

Study Selection

The analysis included prospective studies of 100 or more pregnant women with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding that evaluated patient history, physical examination, laboratory values, and sonography compared with a reference standard of either (1) direct surgical visualization of ectopic pregnancy or (2) clinical follow-up for all pregnancies to prove that ectopic pregnancy was not missed. Of 10,890 articles identified by the search, 14 studies with 12,101 patients met the inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors (J.R.C. and M.V.C.) independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each study. A third author (L. A.B.) resolved any discrepancies.

Results

All components of the patient history had a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) less than 1.5. The presence of an adnexal mass in the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy on transvaginal sonography (LR+ 111; 95% CI, 12–1028; n = 6885), and the physical examination findings of cervical motion tenderness (LR+ 4.9; 95% CI, 1.7–14; n = 1435), an adnexal mass (LR+ 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6–3.7; n = 1378), and adnexal tenderness (LR+ 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0–3.5; n = 1435) all increase the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy. A lack of adnexal abnormalities on transvaginal sonography (negative LR [LR-] 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03–0.55; n = 6885) decreases the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy. Existing studies do not establish a single serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level that is diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Transvaginal sonography is the single best diagnostic modality for evaluating women with suspected ectopic pregnancy. The presence of abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding during early pregnancy should prompt a transvaginal sonogram and quantitative serum hCG testing.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® first trimester vaginal bleeding: 2025 update [^2bdcd54a]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is a relatively common occurrence in the first trimester of pregnancy, but can be distressing for both patients and clinicians. Differential considerations include normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), a nonviable IUP, an ectopic pregnancy (EP), or much less commonly gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). Although the diagnosis of EP, nonviable IUP, and GTD is important, it is also crucial to avoid harming potentially normal pregnancies through early medical or surgical treatment. Fortunately, most diagnoses can be made using a combination of ultrasound (US), serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels, and physical examination. When a diagnosis is in question, serial examinations and close clinical evaluation is paramount. Occasionally, MRI of the pelvis without contrast may be helpful in problem-solving for challenging cases, where grayscale US is limited or when there is high concern for nontubal EP. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Uterine torsion complicated by severe placental abruption in the second trimester: a case report and literature review [^8e55458c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The patient was a pregnant woman (gravida 1, para 0) aged 33 years with a singleton pregnancy at 30 + 5 weeks of gestation. The pregnancy course, including fetal growth, and prenatal examination were regular. Except for a small amount of vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy and treatment with progesterone treatment, there were no prenatal abnormalities, and the patient denied any trauma or sexual history.

On the afternoon of the day before this visit, obstetric examination and ultrasonography were performed in our hospital to evaluate the condition of the fetus and placenta. Ultrasonography showed a single fetus and umbilical cord around the neck, a normal amniotic fluid volume, and fetal biological measurements that were appropriate for 32 weeks of gestation. The placenta was attached to the uterine anterior wall, with a placental thickness of 23 mm (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
On the afternoon of the day before this visit, The placenta was attached to the uterine anterior wall, with a placental thickness of 23 mm

The patient was admitted to the emergency department due to persistent severe pain in the lower abdomen. Abdominal pain began two hours before admission and was accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. The physical examination showed a T of 36.5 °C, P of 100 beats per minute, R of 20 beats per minute, BP of 112/70 mmHg, clear consciousness, and a pale complexion. Obstetric examination showed that uterine growth was suitable for gestational age, abdominal tenderness was positive, uterine tension was high, uterine contractions were not significantly intermittent, and the fetal heart rate was 60 beats per minute, as detected in a nonstress test. Therefore, placental abruption was highly suspected. An emergency cesarean section was subsequently performed under general anesthesia.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^b9c27699]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Ectopic pregnancy ultrasound in early ED evaluation — Counselman et al. multicenter retrospective chart review included patients with a final diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy who had an ultrasound and β-hCG testing at initial ED presentation and did not exclude unstable patients if stable enough for ultrasound, and assessed whether patients with an initial β-hCG level < 1,000 mIU/mL had evidence of ectopic pregnancy on comprehensive ultrasound during their initial visit; ultrasound was considered diagnostic if an extrauterine fetal pole with cardiac activity was identified and suggestive if there was an empty uterus plus a complex adnexal mass and/or a moderate to large amount of pelvic fluid. Results reported that 64 patients with ectopic pregnancy were included, of whom 18 had a β-hCG level < 1,000 mIU/mL; of these 18 patients, 16 had findings suggestive of ectopic pregnancy, including 4 with vital sign abnormalities, and 12 of 14 stable patients with β-hCG level < 1,000 mIU/mL had evidence of ectopic pregnancy on ultrasound. Limitations noted were that presenting symptoms were not abstracted and there was likely selection bias for higher-risk patients because there was no protocol to guide who was getting ultrasound on the initial visit.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^58fde8b8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Emergency department early pregnancy — β-hCG discriminatory zone after indeterminate bedside pelvic ultrasonography — A cross-sectional study of stable first-trimester pregnant patients presenting to the ED with abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, or syncope assessed the discriminatory zone of β-hCG level 3,000 mIU/mL after indeterminate bedside pelvic ultrasonography. Bedside ultrasounds were categorized as intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), no IUP, or indeterminate, and final diagnosis of IUP was determined by radiology ultrasound visualization or at 8-week follow-up interview. Results reported that 141 of 256 (55%) did not have an IUP diagnosed on bedside ultrasound and overall ectopic incidence was 11% (29/256). Using the β-hCG 3,000 mIU/mL threshold, sensitivity was 35% (95% CI 18% to 54%), specificity was 58% (95% CI 48% to 67%), positive LR 0.82 (95% CI 0.48 to 1.40), and negative LR 1.13 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.50). Authors found there was no cutoff at which 100% of the intrauterine pregnancies were visualized; using a cutoff of more than 25,000 mIU/mL identified 87 of 99 (88%).

### Idiopathic spontaneous haemoperitoneum at 4 weeks gestation [^2aa883a5]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 20-year-old nulliparous patient with acute-onset abdominal pain and imaging suggestive of haemoperitoneum was admitted for observation. Though, initially, haemodynamically stable, her clinical picture worsened throughout her hospitalisation and warranted two separate laparoscopies that revealed 1200mL and 50mL of haemoperitoneum, respectively, without an identifiable bleeding source. After serial β-human chorionic gonadotropin levels and ultrasound confirmation of a viable pregnancy 23 days later, the patient underwent a normal antenatal course and delivered a healthy infant at 37 weeks gestation. This unusual case highlights the need to consider spontaneous haemoperitoneum in pregnancy as a diagnosis, particularly in the setting of pregnancy of unknown location, even at an early stage of pregnancy.

### Partial hydatidiform mole with false-negative urine human chorionic gonadatropin test in the emergency department [^f2e7707e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hydatidiform mole (molar pregnancy) is a benign tumor of placental trophoblastic cells, which release human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Several case reports have described complete hydatidiform moles with false-negative urine qualitative hCG tests. These negative pregnancy tests have been attributed to the hook effect. We report an unusual presentation of a partial mole and review an alternative explanation for the negative hCG test. As partial moles are usually not associated with a large proliferation of trophoblastic cells, levels of hCG are commonly < 100,000 mIU/mL. The most common presentation of a hydatidiform mole is vaginal bleeding. Hydatidiform mole is associated with a risk of malignant transformation and disseminated disease.

Objective

In a pregnant patient, vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain are common presentations. Molar pregnancy is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding that should be considered.

Case Report

A 47-year-old female presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Urine qualitative hCG was negative and serum quantitative hCG was 1,094,950 mIU/mL. Pelvic ultrasonography showed a uterine cavity containing a soft-tissue mass with multiple cystic lesions and the hydatidiform mole was extracted with suction curettage. Tissue pathology confirmed partial hydatidiform mole.

Conclusions

In addition to the hook effect, we present another possible explanation for the false-negative test; namely the inability of some assays to detect hCG-degradation products, which may be higher in clinical samples from patients with hydatidiform mole. This case underscores the importance of knowing the limitations of the commonly used hCG assays.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^775b843f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum — fetal effects — are influenced by severity; with mild or moderate vomiting there is little apparent effect on pregnancy outcome, studies have documented a lower rate of miscarriage compared with controls, no significant association with congenital anomalies has been demonstrated, and findings for low birth weight (LBW) are mixed with some studies showing no increase and a systematic review and meta-analysis showing higher incidence of LBW, small-for-gestational-age, and premature infants; no association with perinatal or neonatal mortality has been demonstrated in large retrospective cohorts, and it is appropriate to reassure patients that these conditions most often portend well for pregnancy outcome.

### Late abdominal pregnancy in a post-conflict context: case of a mistaken acute abdomen-a case report [^467c1d16]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Our patient presented with severe abdominal pain during fetal movements. The fetal presentation was not well defined on exam. Although easy palpation of fetal parts has been reported as a sign of abdominal pregnancy, this was not possible in the current case because the patient had a tense abdomen. Complaint of painful fetal movements noted in this case is consistent with findings noted in earlier case series. For instance, in a report by Bohiltea et al. painful fetal movements were noted in 40% of abdominal pregnancies.

Making the diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy is challenging. While in more developed settings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the diagnostic method of choice for abdominal pregnancy, particularly in the more advanced stages, in low- and middle-income countries, clinicians must rely on good clinical judgement, and where available, on ultrasound. When performed in the first trimester, ultrasound will show an empty uterus with a separate gestational sac, or with a mass separated from the uterus, adnexa, and ovaries. Suspicion of abdominal pregnancy is increased by the presence of symptoms like abdominal pain with a positive pregnancy test. In the second and third trimesters, ultrasound usually shows no uterine wall surrounding the fetus, fetal parts that are very close to the abdominal wall, abnormal lie and/or no amniotic fluid between the placenta and the fetus. Unfortunately, ultrasound may not be as helpful at more advanced gestational ages like in the current case, where neither clinical assessment nor ultrasound made the diagnosis. It is also noted that transvaginal ultrasound in the first trimester of pregnancy may improve the diagnosis of extrauterine pregnancy. Importantly, in patients with previous major uterine surgery, differential diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy must include a uterine rupture with extrusion of the products of conception into the peritoneal cavity. Our patient had not had an ultrasound in either the first or second trimesters. We therefore propose that in resource-limited settings, where ultrasound is not always available, painful fetal movements may be an important sign of abdominal pregnancy and should raise the index of suspicion for health care providers.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^92d2d6f9]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Emergency department early pregnancy — outcomes after indeterminate bedside transvaginal ultrasound are reported from a prospective observational study of consecutive ED patients with first-trimester abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding who had an indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound; among 1,490 patients with transvaginal ultrasound, 300 (20%) had indeterminate findings and overall ectopic pregnancy incidence was 4.5%. In the indeterminate group there was no difference in β-hCG level by final diagnosis with levels: IUP 1,304 mIU/mL, embryonic demise 1,572 mIU/mL, and ectopic pregnancy 1,147 mIU/mL (P = 0.748). Final diagnoses in patients with indeterminate ultrasound were IUP 29% (95% CI 24% to 34%), embryonic demise 53% (95% CI 47% to 58%), ectopic pregnancy 15% (95% CI 11% to 19%), and unknown 3% (95% CI 1% to 5%); limitations note it may have included some patients with abnormal vital signs or peritoneal signs.

### Management of early pregnancy loss [^7abd5efc]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on early pregnancy:

- **Definition**: Early pregnancy is a normal physiological event for a woman with a mean gestation period < 15 weeks (range of 6 to 24 weeks).
- **Pathophysiology**: Early pregnancy is a result of conception either naturally or following medical intervention.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of early pregnancy include nausea, vomiting, back pain, pelvic girdle pain, pelvic cavity pain, vulvar itching, varicose veins, pruritus, leg cramp, exhaustion, frequent coughs and colds, migraines, constipation, hemorrhoids, depression, anxiety, and vaginal bleeding. Vaginal bleeding may lead to spontaneous abortion.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In the US, mortality associated with legal induced abortion is < 1 per 100,000 procedures.

### Rare case of haemoperitoneum secondary to a ruptured ovarian ectopic pregnancy superimposed by a bleeding corpus luteum cyst [^8cc9b376]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

An adolescent female presented with an acute abdomen and elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels and underwent a laparoscopy for a suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Intraoperatively, a ruptured haemorrhagic corpus luteal cyst and tissues suggestive of products of conception were noted in the same ovary. Histology confirmed an ovarian ectopic pregnancy. Haemorrhagic ovarian cysts, and ectopic pregnancies, can cause acute pelvic pain in women of childbearing age. Their similar clinical signs and symptoms pose a diagnostic dilemma for any gynaecologist. Ruptured corpus luteal cysts, as well as ruptured ovarian ectopic pregnancies, should be considered rare but differential diagnoses in women presenting with acute abdominal pain, an adnexal mass and ultrasound features of haemoperitoneum. The mainstay of treatment is a diagnostic laparoscopy, which is a safe and feasible management strategy without compromising patient safety or ovarian function in the long run.

Symptom patterns refine the differential: the potential for pregnancy should be evaluated in all women of reproductive age because ectopic pregnancy is in the differential; unilateral, intermittent, and then acutely worsening pelvic pain may indicate ovarian torsion; indolent progressive pelvic pain with fevers, chills, vomiting, and vaginal discharge may indicate an infectious etiology such as a tubo-ovarian abscess; women with acute or chronic dysmenorrhea or pain with intercourse may have an endometrioma; persistent bloating, generalized abdominal pain, and early satiety may be signs of malignancy; and abnormal or postmenopausal bleeding may be caused by estrogen produced by sex cord-stromal tumors.

### Gestational trophoblastic disease in a greenlandic inuit: diagnosis and treatment in a remote area [^a5a0aeea]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

We report on a 21-year-old pregnant Greenlandic Inuit woman, who presented at a small local hospital in Northern Greenland. The patient suffered from lower abdominal pain, irregular bleeding and vomiting. urine-human chorionic gonadotropin (U-hCG) was positive. Ultrasonography showed the typical 'snow-storm' images of a mole pregnancy. Owing to the fact that local physicians were able to perform an ultrasound, proper diagnosis could be established, and the patient was transferred to the regional hospital, located nearly 1200km away. At the regional hospital, uterine evacuation was performed under general anaesthesia. Blood analysis showed that serum hCG returned to undetectable levels, and the patient recovered uneventfully. Our case shows that ultrasonography is a valuable diagnostic tool also in remote areas. In Greenland, geographical distances are large and weather conditions can be extreme, and in this report, we discuss how healthcare can be optimised in remote areas.

### Placental site trophoblastic tumor: a case report and review of the literature [^9abeb03d]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

We present a case of a gravida 1 para 1 woman, who presented with an 11-month history of amenorrhea after cesarean delivery. The patient was taking birth control pills at the time of presentation. She was observed with a slight elevation of serum β-hCG level, an enlarged heterogeneous uterus and hematometra. A biopsy was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with placental site trophoblastic tumor; the patient then underwent surgery. Placental site trophoblastic tumor is the rarest form of gestational trophoblastic disease, derived from intermediate trophoblast cells. It does not have a pathognomonic appearance; therefore, correlation with medical history, as well as results of laboratory tests and pathological analysis is mandatory. It is a relatively chemoresistant tumor, posing considerable therapeutic challenges; patients with localized disease are managed with surgery and those with metastatic disease require additional chemotherapy. Herein, we review the main features of this entity and top differential diagnosis, as the rarity of this tumor is associated with imaging and pathological pitfalls, reinforcing the need for further experience in this field.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^9e63c9a8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Early pregnancy evaluation in the emergency department (ED) — Mateer et al prospective observational study evaluated bedside transvaginal ultrasound by emergency physicians and reported ectopic pregnancy risk among patients with indeterminate scans by beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level. A convenience sample of stable patients > 18 y of age presenting to the ED with abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, orthostasis, adnexal tenderness, and/or risk factors for ectopic pregnancy was included, excluding patients beyond 16 weeks of gestation. Ultrasound criteria specified definite intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) as gestational sac plus yolk sac or fetal pole or double decidual sign plus thick concentric echogenic ring; ectopic pregnancy required extrauterine gestational sac with yolk sac or fetal pole; and "no definite IUP" was none of the above; final diagnosis was determined by clinic follow-up records, surgical records, pathology report, subsequent ultrasound, or labor and delivery records. Among 95 patients with indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound ("no definite IUP"), rates of ectopic pregnancy by β-hCG level were 16/28 (57%) with β-hCG level > 2,000 mIU/mL and 19/67 (28%) with β-hCG level < 2,000 mIU/mL; in the "no definite IUP" subgroup diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy, 18 (51%) had an abnormal adnexal mass or free fluid.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® second and third trimester vaginal bleeding [^e94bddc9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vaginal bleeding can occur throughout pregnancy with varied etiologies. Although history and physical examination can identify many etiologies, imaging, in particular ultrasound (US), is the backbone of current medical practice. US pregnant uterus transabdominal, US pregnant uterus transvaginal, and US duplex Doppler velocimetry are usually appropriate for the evaluation of women with painless vaginal bleeding, those with painful vaginal bleeding, and also for those with second or third trimester vaginal bleeding with suspicion of or known placenta previa, low-lying placenta, or vasa previa. US cervix transperineal may be appropriate for those with painless or painful vaginal bleeding but is usually not appropriate for second or third trimester vaginal bleeding with suspicion of or known placenta previa, low-lying placenta, or vasa previa. Because the outcome of pregnancies is unequivocally related to the specific etiology of the vaginal bleeding, knowledge of imaging results directly informs patient management to optimize the outcome for mother and fetus. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) clinical definitions clarify management and what is not an abortion. A persisting PUL is described as an abnormal pregnancy not visualized on transvaginal ultrasonography that neither progresses nor spontaneously resolves over time, with serum quantitative hCG remaining elevated, and evacuating the uterus with mifepristone and misoprostol or uterine aspiration in this circumstance does not meet the clinical definition of abortion. Without intervention at initial presentation, approximately one-quarter of patients with PUL will go on to experience early pregnancy loss (EPL) or ectopic pregnancy (EP).

### Primary omental pregnancy after in vitro fertilization complicated by hemoperitoneum-how to manage it laparoscopically [^448cef5f]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To report an uncommon case of primary OP treated laparoscopically. Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is the leading cause of maternal mortality during the first trimester and the incidence increases with assisted reproductive techniques, occurring in approximately 1.5%-2.1% of patients undergoing in vitro fertilization. 1 Omental pregnancy (OP) is an extremely rare form of EP accounting for less than 1% of all EPs. OP can be classified as primary or secondary on the basis of Studdiford's criteria 2. The preoperative diagnosis of OP is complex and usually occur in acute circumstances during a throughout intraoperative evaluation of the abdomen. 3–5 A delayed diagnosis poses a serious threat to the survival of the patient; therefore, it is important to remark that EP can exist in unusual locations and prompt surgical intervention may be necessary.

Design

A step-by-step narrated video of a rare clinical case and description of the surgical procedure.

Setting

Tertiary Level Academic Hospital "IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero - Universitaria di Bologna" Bologna, Italy.

Patient

A 36-year-old woman was referred to our emergency room because of acute abdominal pain and nausea for 2 hours with no signs of hemodynamic instability. The patient also complained that poor vaginal bleeding appeared during the last 24 hours. The patient has undergone a cycle of in vitro fertilization with an elective single frozen embryo transfer of a blastocyst on day 5, 2 months before. She had no relevant clinical or surgical history. Diffuse abdominal tenderness and a painful uterus at mobilization were appreciated at clinical examination. A massive hemoperitoneum was diagnosed using transvaginal-transabdominal ultrasound, and no uterine or adnexal lesions were identified. The β-human chronic gonadotropin level was 43.861 mIU/mL, and the hemoglobin value was 10.5 g/dL.

Interventions

On suspicion of a ruptured EP, after detailed counseling and the acquisition of informed consent, a laparoscopic exploration was planned. First, the hemoperitoneum was evacuated to allow visualization of the abdominal cavity. At pelvic inspection, no EP was found. Throughout the exploration of the abdominal cavity, a 4-cm bluish cystic mass of friable consistency was detected infiltrating the omentum and the mesentery. According to Studdiford's criteria, the diagnosis of a primary OP was established. A careful and complete excision of the ectopic implant was performed with an ultrasonic system and required a considerable hemostatic effort using bipolar energy, endoscopic clips, and mechanical compression. The postoperative course was uneventful. The β-human chronic gonadotropin levels gradually decreased to negative values within 29 days after surgery.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Omental ectopic pregnancy can be successfully managed with a laparoscopic approach even in an emergency setting.

Conclusion

Omental pregnancy can easily be overlooked, even by skilled surgeons, during laparoscopic exploration. It is mandatory that all peritoneal surfaces and the omentum be carefully inspected during surgery in patients without other signs of pelvic EP. We confirm that the patient included in this video gave consent for publication of the video and posting of the video online, including on social media, the journal website, scientific literature websites, and other applicable sites.

### Is the pelvic examination still crucial in patients presenting to the emergency department with Vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain when an intrauterine pregnancy is identified on ultrasonography? A randomized controlled trial [^0428c67d]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We determine whether omitting the pelvic examination in emergency department (ED) evaluation of vaginal bleeding or lower abdominal pain in ultrasonographically confirmed early intrauterine pregnancy is equivalent to performing the examination.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, open-label, randomized, equivalence trial in pregnant patients presenting to the ED from February 2011 to November 2015. Patients were randomized to no pelvic examination versus pelvic examination. Inclusion criteria were aged 18 years or older, English speaking, vaginal bleeding or lower abdominal pain, positive β-human chorionic gonadotropin result, and less than 16-week intrauterine pregnancy by ultrasonography. Thirty-day record review and follow-up call assessed for composite morbidity endpoints (unscheduled return, subsequent admission, emergency procedure, transfusion, infection, and alternate source of symptoms). Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to assess patient satisfaction and throughput times.

Results

Only 202 (of a planned 720) patients were enrolled, despite extension of the study enrollment period. The composite morbidity outcome was experienced at similar rates in the intervention (no pelvic examination) and control (pelvic examination) groups (19.6% versus 22.0%; difference -2.4%; 90% confidence interval [CI] -11.8% to 7.1%). Patients in the intervention group were less likely to report feeling uncomfortable or very uncomfortable during the visit (11.2% versus 23.7%; difference -12.5; 95% CI -23.0% to -2.0%).

Conclusion

Although there was only a small difference between the percentage of patients experiencing the composite morbidity endpoint in the 2 study groups (2.4%), the resulting 90% CI was too wide to conclude equivalence. This may have been due to insufficient power. Patients assigned to the pelvic examination group reported feeling uncomfortable more frequently.

### Genitourinary emergencies in the nonpregnant woman [^2663dbe5]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Lower abdominal and pelvic pains are common symptoms in women who present to the emergency department (ED). Once pregnancy has been ruled out, attention should focus on other potential life or fertility threats. Ultrasound remains the most helpful initial diagnostic modality. Time-sensitive and serious conditions, such as large ovarian masses or abnormal vaginal bleeding, need gynecologic consultation. Because many patients do not have access to primary care, ED physicians should be familiar with the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. However, most nonpregnant women with pelvic complaints can safely be managed in the outpatient setting after ED evaluation.

Fig. 7
Ectopic pregnancies in three different patients. a – c Teenager with intense abdominal pain and persistent vaginal bleeding. Grey-scale US images show a large amount of partially echogenic abdominal fluid (asterisk) and a pelvic haematoma (star) surrounding the uterus (U). A round, thick-walled para-uterine cystic mass (arrow) with vascularised wall and a fetal pole was noted with Colour Doppler (d). No gestational sac was identified within the endometrial cavity. Laparoscopic surgery confirmed a ruptured ectopic tubal pregnancy with extensive hemoperitoneum. e – g Axial post-contrast CT images in a different patient with a ruptured tubal EP. Normal right adnexa is noted (black arrow), separate from a ring-enhancing right para-uterine cystic mass (dotted arrow) which increases the likelihood that the cystic mass represents an ectopic pregnancy. Active bleeding from the ruptured tubal pregnancy is visible during the arterial phase (arrowhead). h Woman in her 20's presenting in the emergency department with acute pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding. Coronal T2 WI shows an eccentric gestational sac (arrow) with a fetal pole (arrowhead) located in the interstitial segment of the right Fallopian tube, next to the uterus (U). MRI is more helpful in evaluating ectopic interstitial pregnancy, which is a diagnostic challenge on ultrasound

Haemoperitoneum in EP is not necessarily indicative of tubal rupture but the larger the amount of fluid, the higher the likelihood of such.

CT is now increasingly performed on pregnant women either because pregnancy status is unknown, there is clinical deterioration before serum β-hCG is available, or the early urine pregnancy test is false-negative. On CT, an adnexal area of low attenuation with a dramatic enhanced ring adjacent to the ipsilateral ovary and associated haemoperitoneum suggests EP. In EP rupture, active bleeding can be seen (Fig. 7). The main CT differential diagnosis of EP is a CL cyst because (1) the wall of a CL may show strong enhancement, (2) a CL cyst may rupture in the peritoneum, and (3) a CL cyst may occur in the setting of early pregnancy. If clinical symptoms and serum β-hCG levels do not allow differentiation of these two entities, the site of the adnexal cystic mass may be a clue: a CL cyst is intraovarian, unlike an EP.

### First trimester bleeding: evaluation and management [^bae013dc]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Approximately one-fourth of pregnant women will experience bleeding in the first trimester. The differential diagnosis includes threatened abortion, early pregnancy loss, and ectopic pregnancy. Pain and heavy bleeding are associated with an increased risk of early pregnancy loss. Treatment of threatened abortion is expectant management. Bed rest does not improve outcomes, and there is insufficient evidence supporting the use of progestins. Trends in quantitative ß subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (ß-hCG) levels provide useful information when distinguishing normal from abnormal early pregnancy. The discriminatory level (1,500 to 3,000 mIU per mL) is the ß-hCG level above which an intrauterine pregnancy should be visible on transvaginal ultrasonography. Failure to detect an intrauterine pregnancy, combined with ß-hCG levels higher than the discriminatory level, should raise concern for early pregnancy loss or ectopic pregnancy. Ultrasound findings diagnostic of early pregnancy loss include a mean gestational sac diameter of 25 mm or greater with no embryo and no fetal cardiac activity when the crown-rump length is 7 mm or more. Treatment options for early pregnancy loss include expectant management, medical management with mifepristone and misoprostol, or uterine aspiration. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy is 1% to 2% in the United States and accounts for 6% of all maternal deaths. Established criteria should be used to determine treatment options for ectopic pregnancy, including expectant management, medical management with methotrexate, or surgical intervention.

HYDATIDIFORM MOLE

Hydatidiform moles are usually diagnosed during the first half of pregnancy. The most common presenting symptom is abnormal bleeding, occasionally with passage of hydropic villi. Other classic signs and symptoms include uterine enlargement greater than expected for gestational dates, absent fetal heart tones, cystic enlargement of the ovaries (theca lutein cysts), hyperemesis, pregnancy-induced hypertension in the first trimester, and an abnormally high level of hCG for gestational dates. As discussed later, the incidence of these presenting symptoms has decreased significantly because of the more frequent use of ultrasonography in early pregnancy, with an early diagnosis of "abnormal" pregnancy.

Classification of Hydatidiform Moles

Partial and complete hydatidiform moles are distinct diseases (Table 1). In both conditions, through a defect in gametogenesis or fertilization, the placental villi become edematous, forming small grape-like (hydatidiform) structures. Despite the cytogenetic, pathologic, and clinical differences, the management of patients with complete and partial moles is similar.

Table 1.
Features of Complete and Partial Moles

Complete moles almost always have a chromosomal complement totally derived from the paternal genome. The 46, XX karyotype is most common, representing reduplication of the haploid genome of the sperm and exclusion of the maternal chromosomal complement. Approximately 5–10% of complete moles have a Y chromosome consistent with dispermic fertilization causing about 10–20% of complete moles. Fetal development, vessels, or red blood cells are not observed in complete moles because the fetus resorbs before the development of the circulatory system.

5.6	Multi-fetal Gestation and Birth

Multi-fetal gestation and births have been reported with all gonadotropin therapy, including therapy with GONAL-f.

During clinical trials with GONAL-f, multiple births occurred in 20% of live births in women receiving therapy for ovulation induction and 35.1% of live births in women undergoing ART. Advise the woman and her partner of the potential risk of multi-fetal gestation and birth before beginning therapy with GONAL-f.

5.7	Embryofetal toxicity

The incidence of congenital malformations after some ART [specifically in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)] may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conception. This slightly higher incidence is thought to be related to differences in parental characteristics (e.g., maternal age, maternal and paternal genetic background, sperm characteristics) and to the higher incidence of multi-fetal gestations after IVF or ICSI. There are no indications that the use of gonadotropins during IVF or ICSI is associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations.

5.8	Ectopic Pregnancy

Since infertile women undergoing ART often have tubal abnormalities, the incidence of ectopic pregnancy may be increased in women who become pregnant as a result of ART. Advise women who become pregnant following ART and have: abdominal/pelvic pain (particularly on one side); shoulder, neck or rectal pain; and nausea and vomiting to seek immediate medical attention. Confirm the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy early by β-hCG testing and transvaginal ultrasound.

5.9	Spontaneous Abortion

The risk of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) is increased with gonadotropin products, including GONAL-f. However, causality has not been established. The increased risk may be a factor of the underlying infertility.

5.10	Ovarian Neoplasms

There have been infrequent reports of ovarian neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have had multiple drug therapy for controlled ovarian stimulation, however, a causal relationship has not been established.

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia — presentation and workup involves pelvic imaging, laboratory evaluation, biopsy cautions, and staging. Pelvic ultrasound or MRI with or without contrast should also be performed. Visible lesions in the lower genital tract should not be biopsied due to hemorrhage risk. Additionally, the NCCN Panel recommends repeat CBC differential with platelets; liver, renal, and thyroid function testing; and hCG assay. If hCG is elevated with no evidence of disease on imaging, consider the possibility of LH crossover or phantom hCG. If hCG is elevated, although at a low level that is stable over time (and false positive hCG ruled out), quiescent GTN is possible, and close follow-up, rather than immediate treatment may be considered. Based on these findings, GTN should be staged and scored according to the current FIGO staging and prognostic scoring system, and GTN staging is based on tumor location and extent: stage I disease is uterine-confined, stage II involves direct extension or metastasis to other genital structures, stage III disease is determined by lung metastasis, and stage IV disease includes non-pulmonary distant metastases.

Early pregnancy emergency department evaluation — Barnhart et al prospective observational study evaluated a β-hCG–guided diagnostic algorithm and its outcomes. Pregnant patients with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding were included, while those with hemodynamic instability, peritonitis, an open os suggestive of incomplete abortion, or a recent termination of pregnancy were excluded. The algorithm specified that patients with β-hCG level > 1,500 mIU/mL had transvaginal ultrasound; if no intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) was seen, laparoscopy or uterine curettage was performed, whereas patients with β-hCG level < 1,500 mIU/mL did not have transvaginal ultrasound and were discharged with 48-h follow-up. Final diagnoses were categorized as normal IUP, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, or lost to follow-up. The discriminatory zone, based on 68 consecutive transvaginal ultrasounds, was established to be 1,500–2,000 mIU/mL; 167 stable patients received a final diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Of these, 69 (41%) had a β-hCG level < 1,500 mIU/mL with ultrasound deferred, and in this group the mean time to diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was 5.2 days. Transvaginal ultrasounds were performed by radiologists, and 5 of 85 patients not initially receiving a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy had evidence of rupture at the time of diagnosis at follow-up; it was not reported whether these patients had ultrasound deferred because of an initial β-hCG level < 1,500 mIU/mL.

Her obstetrical history began with two preterm spontaneous vaginal delivery (one at 28 weeks' gestation; one at 30 weeks' gestation) at the age of 18 and 19, respectively. Her third, fourth, and fifth pregnancies ended in abortion at early gestation with dilation & curettage treatment. In her previous pregnancy at 36 years of age, she received laparoscopic left salpingectomy and methotrexate (MTX) treatment due to ectopic pregnancy. No other surgeries on the pelvis or abdomen has been performed.

Her general condition was stable. Physical examination showed normal secretions, no vaginal bleeding or fluid, no cervical dilation, but irregular preterm contractions with a shortened cervical length. Ultrasonography revealed a decreased amniotic fluid index (AFI 4.0 cm) and a single intrauterine pregnancy with breech presentation and positive fetal heart activity. The placenta was located on the anterior wall of the uterus. Laboratory tests were performed at the time of admission and did not show any significant findings, and hemoglobin level was 120 g/L. Due to the risk of premature birth, dydrogesterone was used to relieve uterine contraction and dexamethasone was administered to accelerate fetal lung maturation. Over 2 days following admission, her symptoms gradually worsened. She presented with diffuse abdominal pain and distension. She also reported nausea and had problem in defecating. Ultrasonography of the abdomen represented intestinal dilatation and multiple intestinal contents and air-fluid levels in the colon. Therefore, an intestinal obstruction was suspected. Enema was used to help intestinal peristalsis.

Case presentation

A 35-year-old pregnant woman at 33 +1 weeks of gestation presented to the emergency department of our hospital with complaints of irregular abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. An abdominal color Doppler ultrasound revealed a large sacrococcygeal mass (Fig. 1). Consequently, the patient was admitted to the obstetrics department for antenatal monitoring and delivery preparation.

The patient reported irregular menstruation with a cycle ranging from 30 to 45 days and lasting 5–6 days. She had no fever, no history of viral infection, and no exposure to toxic, harmful, or radioactive substances during pregnancy. A first-trimester abdominal ultrasound confirmed an intrauterine early pregnancy consistent with gestational age, with no other abnormalities detected. At 10 weeks of gestation, the patient experienced mild vaginal bleeding, which was managed with oral progesterone capsules for one week as part of fetal preservation therapy, the bleeding subsequently resolved. At 20 weeks of gestation, a sacrococcygeal mass was identified via four-dimensional (4D) color Doppler ultrasound, with teratoma considered as a possible diagnosis. Throughout the mid-to-late stages of pregnancy, the patient remained asymptomatic with respect to dizziness, headache, blurred vision, palpitations, or dyspnea. This was the couple's second pregnancy; their first child is a healthy boy, and there is no family history of abnormal births on the maternal side.

On the first day of hospitalization, relevant examinations were conducted. The fetal electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Fetal cardiac color Doppler ultrasonography revealed no significant abnormalities in cardiac morphology, structure, or function. Fetal heart monitoring suggested possible fetal distress. Abdominal color Doppler ultrasound demonstrated a large sacrococcygeal mass (Fig. 1), polyhydramnios, placental engorgement, and breech presentation.

On the second day of hospitalization, a lower uterine segment cesarean section was performed due to preterm labor, fetal distress, polyhydramnios, worsening abdominal pain, and vaginal bleeding. Intraoperatively, hemorrhagic amniotic fluid (2500 ml) was noted, along with bilateral ovarian polycystic changes and marked placental enlargement.

A female fetus was successfully delivered via lower uterine segment cesarean section. The newborn exhibited signs of severe asphyxia and prematurity. Neonatal Apgar scores were 3 at 1 min, 7 at 5 min, and 7 at 10 min.

Retrospective analysis and follow-up of the patient

This case is worthy of a retrospective analysis. The primary reason for the nonsimultaneous diagnosis of the two intramural pregnancies was the "masking effect of a dominant lesion overshadowing a covert lesion". Initially, one pregnancy site on the uterine serosa presented as a surgical emergency due to acute rupture and hemorrhage, causing classic acute abdomen symptoms. This became the immediate focus of clinical attention. The emergency laparoscopy was rightly directed at controlling this active bleeding. In contrast, the second pregnancy, which was embedded deep within the myometrium, was clinically occult, being small, nonruptured, and asymptomatic, making it easy to miss during both the initial surgery and ultrasonography. The pivotal clue was the suboptimal decline in HCG levels postoperatively, which indicated the presence of residual viable trophoblastic tissue. This prompted further investigation with more sophisticated imaging, MRI, which ultimately localized the second lesion. This case highlights the critical importance of serial HCG monitoring in the management of ectopic pregnancies following ART to rule out rare cases of multiple and cryptic ectopic gestations.

After discharge, the patient was followed up at our hospital. On July 3rd, the serum HCG level had decreased to 6.8 IU/L, and the patient had mild anemia. There was no postoperative discomfort, such as abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding, and no abnormalities were found on the rechecked ultrasound. The patient resumed normal menstruation on August 17th. Currently, the patient is taking medication to correct anemia and is taking care of her health. In the future, she plans to continue with IVF for assisted pregnancy.

In conclusion, the diagnosis of IMP is very difficult; this condition is sometimes misdiagnosed, leading to incorrect treatment, such as repeated uterine cavity operations or chemotherapy, for example, which can cause uterine rupture or uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock requiring life-threatening surgery. Early recognition and diagnosis of IMP are particularly important; therefore, we need to increase awareness of this condition among gynecologists, fertility physicians, and imaging physicians. Atypical clinical symptoms, when considered in combination with a patient's medical history and imaging data, are important for correct and timely diagnosis. In ART, the risk of IMP can be somewhat reduced by closely monitoring endometrial thickness and morphology via ultrasound, optimizing embryo transfer techniques (e.g. precise positioning and controlled fluid volume and pressure) and evaluating the patient's previous uterine surgical history.

### GTN diagnosis and staging [^86e4cf50]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Majority of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) follows molar pregnancies where diagnosis is mostly based on persistent or rising serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). Diagnosis of GTN could be based on clinical presentation, serum hCG measurement, imaging, histology, and genotyping. A high index of suspicion in women of reproductive age presenting with abnormal vaginal bleeding or unusual systematic presentation is important. An accurate staging and classification system for GTN is crucial to evaluate the risk and the prognosis of patients, and to optimize treatment. GTN is staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 2000 staging and the modified World Health Organization prognostic scoring system.
