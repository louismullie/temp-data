## Question

Pediatric medialsternal
mass

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating a pediatric mediastinal mass. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the anatomic location and compartmental classification. Then, I should verify the initial imaging strategy and when to escalate to cross-sectional imaging. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis by compartment and age, followed by the critical assessment of airway and vascular compromise. After that, I need to outline a safe diagnostic pathway for tissue diagnosis, including anesthesia precautions and alternatives to general anesthesia. Finally, I should review tumor markers, special etiologies, and a practical algorithm that integrates all of this into a coherent plan [^114TYcL2].

> Let me first confirm the anatomic terminology, because "medial sternal mass" is imprecise; I should clarify whether this refers to a midline anterior mediastinal mass abutting the sternum versus a chest wall lesion of the sternum or sternoclavicular joint, as this distinction drives the differential and management. The modern ITMIG classification divides the mediastinum into prevascular (anterior), visceral (middle), and paravertebral (posterior) compartments on cross-sectional imaging, which is more reliable than the legacy lateral-chest-radiograph compartments and is the framework I should apply here [^115QxrMZ] [^1169RJKm].

> Wait, let me verify the initial imaging approach before jumping to CT. In children, I should start with a chest radiograph to screen for mediastinal widening, tracheal deviation, or calcifications, but I need to remember that the normal thymus can mimic a mass on CXR, so I should not overcall a thymic silhouette as disease without correlation. If the CXR is abnormal or suspicion remains high, contrast-enhanced CT of the chest is the next step to localize the mass by compartment, assess size, composition, calcification, fat, cystic change, vascular involvement, and airway or vessel compression; MRI can be reserved for problem-solving, particularly for neurogenic tumors, vascular anomalies, or when I need to avoid radiation, and ultrasound can help in infants or for cystic lesions and neck extension. I should double-check that I am aligning with appropriateness criteria and pediatric-specific guidance to minimize unnecessary CT while ensuring diagnostic clarity [^111gYHN5] [^112uk3Te] [^116ki8LU] [^112JoUno] [^114PKeuD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without compartment-based thinking. In the prevascular compartment, I should prioritize lymphoma, germ cell tumors, thymic lesions, and thyroid-related masses; in the visceral compartment, foregut cysts and lymphadenopathy are common; in the paravertebral compartment, neurogenic tumors predominate. I should confirm that lymphoma is indeed the most common pediatric anterior mediastinal malignancy, while mature teratomas are frequent benign anterior masses with fat, fluid, calcification, and sometimes teeth; thymic hyperplasia can mimic disease but is benign and often regresses, and thymomas are rare in children. Let me reconsider: I initially thought thymoma was the most common anterior mass overall, but that applies to adults; in children, lymphoma and germ cell tumors are more likely, so I need to correct that assumption here [^115QxrMZ] [^1158GfwF] [^112jao8K] [^113S1EWH].

> I need to check for age-specific nuances because the differential shifts with development. In infants and toddlers, benign thymic hyperplasia and congenital lesions like bronchogenic or enteric cysts are more prominent, whereas in adolescents, lymphoma, germ cell tumors, and neurogenic tumors rise in frequency. Let me verify that mediastinal tuberculosis, while uncommon, can present as an isolated anterior mass even in immunocompetent children, particularly in endemic settings, so I should keep it on the list when imaging and clinical context fit [^115QxrMZ] [^113HEVPn] [^114dK4tA].

> Next, I should review the immediate risk assessment for airway and vascular compromise, because this dictates whether I can proceed safely to biopsy or need temporizing measures. I will now examine for orthopnea, stridor, wheeze, accessory muscle use, cyanosis, syncope, facial plethora/edema, and distended neck veins; on imaging, I should quantify tracheal/bronchial compression and look for SVC compression or pericardial effusion. But wait, what if symptoms are minimal — does that mean anesthesia is safe? No, even asymptomatic children can precipitously collapse after induction due to loss of spontaneous ventilation and loss of transpulmonary pressure, so I must risk-stratify and plan for spontaneous breathing techniques or alternatives to general anesthesia if high risk [^113iSpU4] [^11281SeY] [^113HDH5q].

> I should confirm the anesthesia strategy and procedural safety plan before any tissue diagnosis. If general anesthesia is unavoidable, spontaneous ventilation with inhalational induction and avoidance of muscle relaxants is preferred; rigid bronchoscopy must be immediately available, and in select high-risk cases, pre-positioned femoral cannulation for ECMO or bypass may be warranted. Hold on, I should verify alternatives: many centers safely obtain tissue using local anesthesia with sedation, image-guided core needle biopsy, or sampling of less compressed sites such as peripheral lymph nodes, bone marrow, or pleural fluid, which avoids positive-pressure ventilation. Let me double-check that multidisciplinary coordination among anesthesia, surgery, oncology, and interventional radiology is essential to mitigate risk and expedite diagnosis [^113iSpU4] [^117NtY6U] [^114fCTpm] [^113HDH5q].

> Let me think about the safest diagnostic pathway tailored to compartment and presentation. For an anterior mediastinal mass with high compression risk, I should avoid routine intubation and favor awake or sedated techniques; if lymphoma is suspected, bone marrow and peripheral nodes may obviate mediastinal biopsy, and pleural effusion can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. For posterior mediastinal neurogenic tumors, MRI helps define foraminal extension and surgical planning, and tissue is often obtained surgically. I should confirm that emergent steroids or radiation can cloud histopathology and should be avoided until a diagnosis is secured unless there is impending airway loss, reinforcing the need for a standardized algorithm to reduce delays and inappropriate pretreatment [^113vGN8F] [^116ki8LU] [^114TYcL2].

> Next, I should review laboratory adjuncts that narrow the differential and guide urgency. A CBC with differential, LDH, uric acid, electrolytes, calcium, and phosphate help screen for tumor lysis risk in aggressive lymphomas; AFP and beta-hCG are critical for suspected germ cell tumors; thyroid function tests are indicated if a thyroid goiter or ectopic thyroid is suspected. I need to ensure I add tuberculosis testing when epidemiology or imaging suggests granulomatous disease, and I should remember that normal tumor markers do not exclude malignancy, so they complement but do not replace tissue diagnosis [^113vGN8F] [^112vEeA8] [^114dK4tA].

> But wait, what if the mass is not mediastinal at all and instead represents a chest wall lesion abutting the sternum? I should consider sternoclavicular joint infection or clavicular osteomyelitis, which can present with chest pain and systemic symptoms and may extend into the mediastinum with serious complications; early recognition, aspiration or bone culture, and surgical drainage when indicated are key. I also need to keep congenital sternal anomalies like sternal cleft in mind, particularly in neonates with respiratory compromise or chest wall deformity, as these alter airway and ventilatory management considerations [^117SzXri] [^115mdhPx] [^1129tCBu].

> I will now synthesize a practical algorithm while checking for gaps. Start with history, exam, and CXR; if abnormal or suspicion persists, obtain contrast-enhanced chest CT to classify by compartment and assess compression; if CT is indeterminate or neurogenic/vascular features are suspected, add MRI; concurrently obtain labs including CBC, LDH, TLS panel, and markers as indicated; risk-stratify for airway/vascular compromise; engage multidisciplinary teams; and select the lowest-risk tissue acquisition strategy, prioritizing peripheral sites or awake techniques to avoid general anesthesia when high risk. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with pediatric quality initiatives showing reduced time to biopsy and fewer unnecessary pretreatments when such pathways are standardized [^111gYHN5] [^115QxrMZ] [^114TYcL2].

> Finally, I should double-check special scenarios that change management. In T-lymphoblastic lymphoma with a large mediastinal mass, early chemotherapy is the treatment, and tissue may come from bone marrow, pleural fluid, or peripheral nodes; emergent radiation or steroids before diagnosis can impede accurate classification. In mature teratomas, complete surgical excision is both diagnostic and curative. In suspected tuberculosis, histologic confirmation and appropriate antimicrobials are essential before oncologic therapy. And in all cases, I need to ensure that anesthesia plans are individualized and that the team is prepared for airway collapse with rescue strategies, including rigid bronchoscopy and, in select cases, preemptive airway stenting as a bridge to definitive therapy [^113vGN8F] [^112vEeA8] [^111s2PPc].

A pediatric medial sternal mass is most often due to **congenital anomalies** (sternal cleft, ectopia cordis, dermoid/epidermoid cysts), **infectious/inflammatory lesions** (sternoclavicular osteomyelitis, abscess, chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis), or **neoplastic processes** (leukemia/lymphoma, germ cell tumors, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis) [^112uk3Te]. Evaluation should start with a **focused history and exam**, then **plain radiography** and **ultrasound** for initial characterization [^112JoUno], followed by **contrast-enhanced CT** or **MRI** for detailed anatomy and tissue characterization [^111gYHN5] [^116ki8LU]. Management is diagnosis-specific: surgical excision for solid or symptomatic lesions, antibiotics for infection, and oncology referral for malignancy. Airway or vascular compromise requires urgent multidisciplinary care and anesthesia precautions [^113iSpU4] [^11281SeY].

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Congenital and developmental anomalies

- **Sternal cleft**: Midline sternal defect with respiratory compromise; surgical repair is standard [^notfound].
- **Ectopia cordis**: Sternum absent with heart protruding; neonatal emergency [^notfound].
- **Dermoid/epidermoid cysts**: Midline cystic masses; excise for diagnosis and treatment.
- **Congenital sternal agenesis**: Partial/complete sternal absence; airway and ventilatory issues [^1129tCBu].

---

### Infectious and inflammatory lesions

Infectious and inflammatory lesions include **sternoclavicular joint infection/osteomyelitis**, which is rare in children and often delayed; management includes antibiotics and surgical drainage when indicated [^117SzXri]. Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (**CNO/CRMO**) is an autoimmune inflammatory bone disease that may involve the sternum and is diagnosed by imaging and clinical correlation [^114oWYHX].

---

### Neoplastic processes

- **Leukemia/lymphoma**: Anterior mediastinal masses (T-ALL, Hodgkin) with sternal involvement [^112jao8K].
- **Germ cell tumors**: Anterior mediastinal teratomas; mixed solid/cystic with calcification/fat [^1152qLv9].
- **Neuroblastoma**: Posterior mediastinal but can extend anteriorly [^113wTgMB].
- **Rhabdomyosarcoma**: Malignant soft tissue sarcoma of chest wall [^notfound].
- **Langerhans cell histiocytosis**: Lytic bone lesions including sternum [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

Clinical features vary by **etiology** and include:

| **Symptom/sign** | **Common etiologies** |
|-|-|
| Respiratory distress | - Sternal cleft <br/> - Ectopia cordis <br/> - Large anterior masses [^1129tCBu] [^113iSpU4] |
| Chest pain | - Osteomyelitis <br/> - CNO/CRMO <br/> - Malignancy [^117SzXri] [^113S1EWH] |
| Fever | - Infection <br/> - Inflammatory disease [^11759YAn] [^113S1EWH] |
| Palpable mass | - Teratoma <br/> - Dermoid cyst <br/> - Solid tumors [^116dFmtA] |
| Systemic symptoms | - Leukemia/lymphoma <br/> - LCH [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Initial assessment

During the initial assessment, obtain a **history** covering onset, duration, systemic symptoms, trauma, infection, and family history, and perform a **physical examination** to assess respiratory compromise, palpation of the mass, and signs of infection or malignancy [^11281SeY].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging should begin with **plain radiography** to define bony involvement and mediastinal extent, followed by **ultrasound** for cystic characterization and vascular assessment [^112JoUno]. Contrast-enhanced **CT** is the mainstay for detailed bony and soft-tissue evaluation and surgical planning, while **MRI** provides superior soft-tissue contrast and is radiation-free, aiding tissue characterization and problem-solving [^116ki8LU].

---

### Laboratory tests

Laboratory evaluation should include a **complete blood count** to assess for infection, anemia, or leukemia, and **inflammatory markers** (ESR/CRP) to support infection or inflammation. Tumor markers (**AFP, β-hCG, LDH**) are indicated when a germ cell tumor or leukemia/lymphoma is suspected [^113vGN8F].

---

### Biopsy

Biopsy is indicated for **solid, enhancing, or suspicious lesions**; use image-guided core needle biopsy when feasible to minimize risk [^114fCTpm].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on **etiology**:

- **Congenital anomalies**: Surgical repair (e.g. sternal cleft, ectopia cordis) [^115mdhPx].
- **Infectious lesions**: Antibiotics; surgical drainage for abscess or refractory osteomyelitis [^117SzXri].
- **Inflammatory disease**: NSAIDs, bisphosphonates, immunomodulators for CNO/CRMO [^114oWYHX].
- **Malignancy**: Oncology referral; chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy per protocol [^1111eU2C].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **etiology-dependent**: congenital anomalies have excellent outcomes after repair, infectious/inflammatory lesions generally resolve with targeted therapy, and malignancy outcomes vary by type and stage, with pediatric lymphomas and solid tumors having improving survival with modern therapy [^113vGN8F].

---

## Complications

Complications include **airway compromise** from mass effect or sternal defects, vascular compression (SVC syndrome), and neurologic deficits from cord compression. Delayed diagnosis can worsen outcomes, and anesthesia for anterior mediastinal masses carries significant risk and requires specialized planning [^113iSpU4] [^114TYcL2].

---

A pediatric medial sternal mass spans congenital, infectious/inflammatory, and neoplastic etiologies; a **structured approach** with history/exam, radiographs, ultrasound, CT/MRI, and selective biopsy guides diagnosis and management, with **multidisciplinary care** for complex or high-risk cases [^114TYcL2].

### Imaging evaluation of pediatric mediastinal masses [^112uk3Te]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Mediastinal masses in children are a heterogeneous group of asymptomatic to potentially life-threatening congenital, infectious, or neoplastic lesions that can present complex diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. This article presents the imaging features of the common mediastinal masses seen in the pediatric population. Classification of the masses is performed according to the traditional mediastinal compartment model, consisting of the anterior, middle, and posterior mediastinum. This scheme facilitates differentiation of the variety of disorders.

### Pediatric mediastinal masses [^115QxrMZ]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Mediastinal masses are categorized based on the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group (ITMIG) classification into prevascular, visceral and paravertebral compartments. The schema is based on cross-sectional imaging, mainly CT, and helps with generating a differential diagnosis based on location of the mass. Up to half of all pediatric mediastinal tumors are malignant. In this review we describe mediastinal masses that are relevant to the pediatric population, as well as the role of MR imaging of mediastinal masses and its advantages.

Mediastinal masses are relatively uncommon, yet include a large variety of entities. Some tumors can be diagnosed with confidence based on imaging alone; others when a typical appearance is combined with the right clinical presentation. A structured approach for radiologists is presented to facilitate evaluation of patients with anterior mediastinal tumors. The approach focuses first on the more common tumors and on imaging features that strongly suggest a particular diagnosis. Discussion with the clinician can be very helpful in formulating a presumptive diagnosis. This article also discusses that confirmatory imaging or biopsy tests are most beneficial in particular situations.

### A diagnostic approach to the mediastinal masses [^113oj3fv]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Tumours of the mediastinum represent a wide diversity of disease state. The location and composition of a mass is critical to narrowing the differential diagnosis. The clinical spectrum of mediastinal masses can range from being asymptomatic to producing compressive symptoms. Although many of these masses have similar imaging appearances, clinical history, anatomical position and certain details seen at CT and MRI imaging allow correct diagnosis in many cases.

### A pediatric patient with a mediastinal mass and pulmonary embolus [^115xMc2Q]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

When anesthetizing a patient with an anterior mediastinal mass, sudden hypoxaemia and cardiovascular collapse may result from compression of a large airway or vascular structure in the mediastinum. We report the case of a pediatric cancer patient with an anterior mediastinal mass, who developed sudden and fatal hypoxaemia and cardiovascular collapse in the hours following sedation. A massive pulmonary thromboembolism was diagnosed at autopsy. We suggest that pulmonary embolism should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a patient with a mediastinal mass develops perioperative hypoxaemia, cardiovascular collapse, or both.

### A diagnostic approach to the mediastinal masses [^116EPGFN]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple different types of mediastinal masses may be encountered on imaging techniques in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. The location and composition of these lesions are critical to narrowing the differential diagnosis.

Methods

Radiological compartmentalisation of the mediastinum helps in focusing the diagnosis of masses on the basis of their site. Some diseases, however, do not occur exclusively in any specific compartment and can spread from one compartment to another.

Results

Tissular components of the mass, the degree of vascularisation and the relationships with mediastinal structures assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are a leading edge of the radiological diagnosis. Special applications at MRI have been developed over the recent years in order to identify accurately tissular components of the mediastinal masses. The likelihood of malignancy of the mediastinal masses is influenced by the symptomatology and the age of the patient. This article reviews the most commonly encountered mediastinal masses considering clinical history and manifestations, anatomical position and certain details seen on different imaging modalities that allow correct diagnosis in many cases.

Conclusion

Familiarity with the radiological features of mediastinal masses facilitates accurate diagnosis, differentiation from other mediastinic processes and, thus, optimal patient treatment.

Teaching Points

- CT and MRI are important for the diagnosis of mediastinal masses.
- The location and tissue characteristics on imaging studies are critical to narrow down the differential diagnosis of mediastinal masses.
- Symptomatology and patient age affect the likelihood of malignancy.

### Imaging of paediatric mediastinal abnormalities [^114Jc6v7]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

The mediastinum in children can be a difficult area to assess on the chest radiograph: even the normal thymus can give the impression of a mediastinal mass lesion. When there is suspicion of a mediastinal mass, its location within the mediastinum helps to limit the differential diagnosis. Further imaging with ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging helps to characterise the lesion, define its extent and detect complications. Abnormal mediastinal contours may also be caused by congenital anomalies of the mediastinal vessels, which can be demonstrated non-invasively using magnetic resonance imaging. The main purpose of this article is to review the anatomy of the mediastinum and imaging of mediastinal mass lesions in children together with some vascular anomalies that can simulate a mediastinal mass.

### Pediatric mediastinal masses:: role of MR imaging as a problem-solving tool [^116ki8LU]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating mediastinal masses detected by radiography or clinical presentation. However, CT results can often be indeterminate. Thoracic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a noninvasive way to characterize mediastinal lesions, site of origin, and involvement of adjacent structures by providing higher soft tissue contrast than CT, with superior tissue characterization and higher diagnostic specificity. Thoracic MR imaging of mediastinal masses can increase diagnostic certainty, reduce the number of surgical interventions, and improve clinical decision making. In this review article, current imaging techniques and clinical applications of MR imaging as a problem-solving tool for assessing mediastinal masses in pediatric patients are discussed.

### Point-of-care ultrasound of a pediatric mediastinal mass: a case report [^113ekkPq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Point-of-care ultrasound may be used for identification of thoracic pathology, including mediastinal masses. In this case report, we describe the case of an otherwise healthy 17-year-old boy who presented with generalized pruritis. Point-of-care ultrasound was useful in identifying a complex cystic and solid mediastinal mass extending into the thoracic cavities as well as an associated pericardial effusion.

### Anesthetizing a child for a large compressive mediastinal mass with distraction techniques and music therapies as the sole agents [^111dTvqx]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Anesthetic management of the child with an anterior mediastinal mass is challenging. The surgical/procedural goal typically is to obtain a definitive tissue diagnosis to guide treatment; the safest approach to anesthesia is often one that alters cardiorespiratory physiology the least. In severe cases, this may translate to little or no systemic sedatives/analgesics. Distraction techniques, designed to shift attention away from procedure-related pain (such as counting, listening to music, non-procedure-related talk), may be of great benefit, allowing for avoidance of pharmaceuticals. In this report, we present an approach in children where the anesthetic risk is deemed excessive.

### Mediastinal tumors [^117MNeZ8]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Mediastinal tumors are comprised of various benign and malignant neoplasms that share the same anatomic location within the thorax. The mediastinum is traditionally divided into three compartments: the anterior, middle, and posterior mediastinum. This division, based on lateral chest radiographs, helps clinicians establish appropriate differential diagnoses and plan further imaging, diagnostic, and treatment strategies. With the continued and complex advances in imaging, medical treatment, and surgery, we recommend a multidisciplinary approach to the management of mediastinal tumors. This discussion is intended to guide the pulmonary specialist through this potentially complex approach.

### Airway collapse with an anterior mediastinal mass despite spontaneous ventilation in an adult [^114TcTr6]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with anterior mediastinal masses are at increased risk for perioperative complications. Our case demonstrates that airway collapse and inability to ventilate may occur in the asymptomatic adult despite spontaneous ventilation with inhaled anesthesia and an endotracheal tube. Given the sudden and profound presentation of cardiopulmonary collapse, rigid bronchoscopy should be immediately available to facilitate life-saving ventilation. Though repositioning the pediatric patient lateral or prone has been reported to reestablish airway patency, this maneuver may be of limited benefit in the adult population because of a more ossified and developed chest wall. Lastly, if a high-risk patient requires a general anesthetic, strong consideration should be given to preinduction placement of femoral cardiopulmonary bypass cannulae and the availability to immediately initiate cardiopulmonary bypass.

### Imaging evaluation of the pediatric mediastinum: new international thymic malignancy interest group classification system for children [^1169RJKm]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Mediastinal masses are commonly identified in the pediatric population with cross-sectional imaging central to the diagnosis and management of these lesions. With greater anatomical definition afforded by cross-sectional imaging, classification of mediastinal masses into the traditional anterior, middle and posterior mediastinal compartments - as based on the lateral chest radiograph - has diminishing application. In recent years, the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group (ITMIG) classification system of mediastinal masses, which is cross-sectionally based, has garnered acceptance by multiple thoracic societies and been applied in adults. Therefore, there is a need for pediatric radiologists to clearly understand the ITMIG classification system and how it applies to the pediatric population. The main purpose of this article is to provide an updated review of common pediatric mediastinal masses and mediastinal manifestations of systemic disease processes in the pediatric population based on the new ITMIG classification system.

### Anesthesia for children with anterior mediastinal masses [^113iSpU4]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Children with an anterior mediastinal mass may have cardiopulmonary compromise that can be exacerbated under general anesthesia. Signs and symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, stridor, orthopnea, accessory muscle use, a history of respiratory arrest, and the presence of a pleural effusion and upper body edema are predictive of perioperative complications. A larger mediastinal mass on imaging is predictive of perioperative complications. Risk stratification of patients, together with an individualized plan, will best guide operative management for patients with an anterior mediastinal mass. General anesthesia (GA) should be avoided if possible, but a spontaneous breathing technique is recommended if GA is required.

### Tumors of the mediastinum [^113S1EWH]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Tumors of the mediastinum represent a wide diversity of disease states. The location and composition of a mass is critical to narrowing the differential diagnosis. The most common causes of an anterior mediastinal mass include the following: thymoma; teratoma; thyroid disease; and lymphoma. Masses of the middle mediastinum are typically congenital cysts, including foregut and pericardial cysts, while those that arise in the posterior mediastinum are often neurogenic tumors. The clinical sequelae of mediastinal masses can range from being asymptomatic to producing symptoms of cough, chest pain, and dyspnea. This article will review the anatomy of the mediastinum as well as the different clinical, radiographic, and prognostic features, and therapeutic options of the most commonly encountered masses.

### Resection of large mediastinal germ cell tumor in an adolescent [^112vEeA8]. JTCVS Techniques (2025). Medium credibility.

Preoperative biopsy remains crucial in confirming the diagnosis of GCT and distinguishing it from other mediastinal masses, particularly lymphoma. Radiologic imaging plays a critical role in localizing the tumor and guiding biopsy procedures. Fine-needle aspiration or core biopsy, under imaging guidance, allows for tissue confirmation of the tumor type and ensures that treatment decisions are determined on the basis of accurate pathology.

Tumor markers are instrumental in diagnosing GCTs and assessing their response to chemotherapy. In particular, AFP and β-HCG are commonly elevated in nonseminomatous GCTs and serve as vital indicators of disease activity and treatment response. In our case, there was no marked reduction in AFP and β-HCG levels after chemotherapy, and therefore the patient had to undergo surgical removal.

Surgical management of GCTs, especially those located in the mediastinum, often requires a tailored approach depending on the tumor's size and extent. Although minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopy have been successfully used for smaller tumors, large mediastinal masses necessitate more invasive approaches, such as median sternotomy or clamshell incisions. The choice of surgical approach is guided by the need for optimal exposure, as well as the tumor's proximity to critical structures such as the heart, lungs, and great vessels. In some cases, lower sternotomy or anterior thoracotomy can be chosen to provide better cosmetic results. However, in this case of tumor located high on the superior vena cava, we had to perform a full sternotomy to ensure adequate access and tumor removal, as it provides better exposure compared with other methods for large tumors.

In a review of the literature, Huang and colleaguesreported a successful en bloc resection of a mediastinal tumor in an adult patient in their article. Our case presentation shows that total en bloc resection is possible for tumors occupying the entire mediastinum and hemithorax even in pediatric patients.

### Management of mediastinal syndromes in pediatrics: a new challenge of ultrasound guidance to avoid high-risk general anesthesia [^111qHVEw]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Adverse events associated with anesthetic management of anterior mediastinal masses in pediatrics are common. To avoid an extremely hazardous general anesthesia, the use of real-time ultrasonography offers an effective alternative in high-risk cases. We report the anesthetic management including a light sedation and ultrasound guidance for regional anesthesia, surgical node biopsy, and placement of a central venous line in two children with an anterior symptomatic mediastinal mass. For pediatric patients with clinical and/or radiologic signs of airway compression, ultrasound guidance provides safety technical assistance to avoid general anesthesia and should be performed for the initial diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

### Isolated anterior mediastinal tuberculosis in an immunocompetent patient [^113HEVPn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

There are few documented cases of tuberculosis presenting as an isolated anterior mediastinal mass in an immunocompetent patient. Comprehensive review of the literature reveals ten similarly described cases with the majority occurring in the pediatric population aged 2 years or younger. Of the published cases on adults all three patients were male with age ranging from 32 to 76 years. The masses varied in composition and behavior, with one case describing a cystic mass and another a mass infiltrating the right atrium. Similar to this case all three patients were treated with medical therapy. The limited published data on adult presentations of mediastinal tuberculosis in immunocompetent patients does reveal that presentation is usually associated with mass effect symptoms and that a diagnosis was only revealed following histological confirmation, both features observed in this case.

In summary, while the aetiology of a mediastinal mass can be difficult to establish because of the wide differential, it is imperative that a through and logical scheme of investigation including tissue diagnosis is pursued. This case aims to highlight the importance of considering tuberculosis in the differential even in immunocompetent patients presenting with an isolated mediastinal mass that cannot otherwise be explained.

### Diagnostic approach for mediastinal masses with radiopathological correlation [^113Cz4Da]. European Journal of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Mediastinal masses have various histopathological and radiological findings. Although lymphoma is the most common type of tumor, thymic epithelial and neurogenic tumors are common in adults and children, respectively, but several other types are difficult to distinguish. No previous review has simply and clearly shown how to differentiate mediastinal masses.

Method

We conducted a review of the latest mediastinal classifications and mass differentiation methods, with a focus on neoplastic lesions. Both older and recent studies were searched, and imaging and histopathological findings of mediastinal masses were reviewed. Original simple-to-use differentiation flowcharts are presented.

Results

Assessing localizations and internal characteristics is very important for mediastinal mass differentiation. The mass location and affected organ/tissue should be accurately assessed first, followed by more qualitative diagnosis, and optimization of the treatment strategy. In 2014, the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group presented a new mediastinal clinical classification. In this classification, mediastinal masses are categorized into three groups according to location: prevascular (anterior)-, visceral (middle)-, and paravertebral (posterior)-compartment masses. Then, the internal characteristics and functional images are evaluated.

Conclusions

Differentiation of mediastinal masses is very difficult. However, if typical imaging findings and clinical characteristics are combined, reasonable differentiation is possible. In each patient, proper differential diagnosis may contribute to better treatment selection.

Key points

Pneumomediastinum requires exclusion of tracheobronchial injury.
Mediastinal post-operative changes are indistinguishable from acute mediastinitis during the first weeks following surgery.
CT, 18F-FDG PET/CT, and diffusion-weighted or dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI may help to narrow the differential diagnosis and may guide tissue sampling.

Case Presentation

A 6-year-old boy was referred to our hospital with an anterior mediastinal mass. This was discovered by chest radiography performed when the boy was examined after being caught by an elevator door about 2 weeks earlier. The patient had been born full term without any complications during pregnancy or delivery. No clinical symptoms were observed during this presentation, and he had no history of previous infections.

### Mediastinal masses in children: radiologic-pathologic correlation [^1158GfwF]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Most pediatric masses in the chest are located in the mediastinum. These masses are often initially detected incidentally on chest radiographs in asymptomatic children, although some patients may present with respiratory symptoms. At chest radiography, the mediastinum has been anatomically divided into anterior, middle, and posterior compartments. However, with the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group classification scheme, which is based on cross-sectional imaging findings, the mediastinum is divided into prevascular, visceral, and paravertebral compartments. In the prevascular compartment, tumors of thymic origin, lymphomas, germ cell tumors, and vascular tumors are encountered. In the visceral compartment, lymphadenopathy and masses related to the foregut are seen. In the paravertebral compartment, neurogenic tumors are most common. Using the anatomic location in combination with knowledge of the imaging and pathologic features of pediatric mediastinal masses aids in accurate diagnosis of these masses to guide treatment and management decisions.

### Tracheal diverticulum with decompensation after 8 years of conservative therapy requiring surgical solution [^115BiPVY]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

Tracheal diverticulum is a benign cystic mass in the cervical and mediastinal regions, with an incidence of 1% in post-mortem findings, and 2% in CT findings. The lesion is in most cases completely asymptomatic and is most commonly incidentally detected during a CT examination. We present the case of a young female patient with a tracheal diverticulum who has been followed up for 8 years by pediatric pneumologist. Patient health state deteriorated and she developed stress-induced dyspnea requiring surgical resection. Moreover, we mention differential diagnosis of other mediastinal cystic lesions.

### Anaesthetic management for the child with a mediastinal mass [^117NtY6U]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Administering anaesthesia to a child with an anterior mediastinal mass may lead to respiratory or circulatory collapse, even in those without symptoms. Institutions should have algorithms to manage children with mediastinal masses. Preoperative evaluations should include computed tomography, echocardiography and flow-volume studies. Anaesthesia may be induced with inhalation agents and maintained with spontaneous respiration via facemask or laryngeal mask airway. Alternatively, positive-pressure ventilation may be used, including tracheal intubation without muscle relaxants. Rigid bronchoscopy may be life-saving in the event of tracheal or bronchial collapse under anaesthesia.

### Hodgkin lymphoma presenting with chest wall involvement: a case series [^116dFmtA]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Chest wall tumors in the pediatric population can have a variety of etiologies, malignancy being the most worrisome. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) rarely presents as a chest wall mass in the pediatric population. In this report, we describe 3 male pediatric patients, all of whom had chest wall masses present at the initial diagnosis of HL. We also discuss the literature on this topic. We conclude that malignancy and, more specifically, HL should always be considered when evaluating a pediatric patient who presents with a chest wall mass.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the pediatric mediastinum: updates, tips and tricks [^117JDsVw]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pediatric mediastinum is challenging for the practicing radiologist. Many confounding factors add to the complexity of pediatric mediastinal MRI including small patient size, broad spectrum of mediastinal pathologies, motion artifacts and the need for sedation in a significant portion of children. However, with special attention to motion-reduction techniques and knowledge of pediatric-specific considerations, pediatric radiologists can help to provide accurate and timely diagnosis and also prevent multimodality imaging where MRI might be all that is needed. The purpose of this paper was present a practical review of pediatric mediastinal MRI with particular emphasis on diseases where MRI is the primary imaging modality of choice. Additionally, the author addresses those mediastinal processes for which MRI serves as a secondary problem-solving imaging tool.

Conclusion

In conclusion, non-malignant diffuse mediastinal disease presents with various characteristics, depending on the mechanism involved. The differential diagnosis calls for a systematic approach that includes the patient's history and habits, excludes a tracheobronchial or esophageal injury in acute conditions, and requires a careful and precise histological examination in diffuse mediastinal tissue infiltration.

Conclusions

In conclusion, mediastinal GCTs present unique diagnostic, and therapeutic challenges. Although chemotherapy remains the primary treatment modality, surgery plays a crucial role in managing large, residual tumors. En bloc removal is possible even in pediatric patient and this technique may contribute to the prevention of residual tumor. Given the complex nature of these tumors, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to optimize patient outcomes and address the wide range of potential complications associated with both the tumor and its treatment.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^114PKeuD]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric considerations — chest computed tomography (CT): For pediatric patients, use chest CT more selectively to reduce unnecessary imaging. For the child with no, or only minor abnormalities on chest radiograph (for example, simple pneumothorax or hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, or isolated rib fractures), chest CT is reported to have no impact on subsequent management. A chest CT is recommended for children with an abnormal mediastinal contour to an age-appropriate shaped chest.

### Mediastinal masses in children [^112jao8K]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

A variety of mediastinal masses may present in children. Imaging is generally confined to chest radiograph and CAT scan of the chest, although other studies may prove helpful depending upon the circumstances. MRI is particularly helpful for neurogenic tumors in the posterior mediastinum. The most common tumor in the anterior mediastinum is lymphoma with germ cell tumors second. In general, lymph nodes in areas outside the mediastinum provide access for tissue diagnosis when lymphoma is present. Germ cell tumors are generally benign, but surgical excision is indicated to rule out malignant elements and to treat symptoms which are often present through compression of nearby structures. Neurogenic tumors are the most common lesions in the posterior mediastinum.

### A giant anterior mediastinal thymolipoma mimicking dextrocardia with cardiomegaly: a case report and review of literature [^1111Kuw8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

It is worth noting the association of thymolipoma with certain systemic conditions. Approximately 50% of thymomas are associated with myasthenia gravis, but thymolipomas have a much weaker association with paraneoplastic syndromes. Occasionally, thymolipomas have been reported in patients with autoimmune or haematologic abnormalities such as hyperthyroidism, aplastic anaemia, or red cell aplasia. Our patient did not have any such associated disorders. The occurrence of thyrotoxicosis in some reported thymolipoma cases is likely incidental. There have also been rare reports of thymolipoma causing immunological abnormalities like hypogammaglobulinemia or, as in one pediatric case, extreme T-cell lymphocytosis. None of these abnormalities were identified in our patient. The management of thymolipoma is straightforward once the diagnosis is made. Complete surgical excision serves both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Given the benign nature of the tumour, surgery results in a cure, and recurrence is exceptionally rare when resection is complete. In our patient, a full resection was achieved, and the encapsulated nature of the tumour made removal relatively uncomplicated despite its size. Careful surgical planning is required for large mediastinal tumours to ensure minimal complications; in this case, a right mini-thoracotomy provided adequate exposure. However, an open approach with midline sternotomy may be necessary for a mass of this size. Postoperatively, patients should be followed up with periodic clinical exams and imaging. The long-term prognosis is excellent because thymolipomas do not recur when fully excised. In contrast, had this mass been a malignant tumour (like lymphoma or thymic carcinoma), treatment would have included chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, and the prognosis and follow-up strategy would have differed greatly. This case underscores the importance of accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

### Mediastinal mass obscured by a large pericardial effusion in a child: a potential cause of serious anaesthetic morbidity [^111ps1NR]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Anaesthesia in the presence of a mediastinal mass is known to be hazardous. We report a case of a 5-year-old boy with a presumed postviral pericardial effusion presenting for pericardiocentesis under general anaesthesia. Cardiorespiratory collapse following induction of anaesthesia occurred due to an undiagnosed mediastinal tumour. The reasons for misdiagnosis, mechanisms for perioperative complications and optimal management are discussed. Mediastinal masses and underlying malignancy should always be considered in patients with large pericardial effusions.

### Pediatric mediastinal lymphatic malformation: misdiagnosis analysis and literature review [^115UzkWk]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the absence of internal fat or irregular morphology with minimal CT difference value suggests a diagnosis of MCLM. Children with anterior mediastinal diseases often extend towards the neck, which complicates component analysis, resulting in misdiagnoses. The contrast-enhanced CT examination and certain quantitative indicators contribute to the clinical diagnosis and surgical decision-making process in pediatric MCLM.

### Life-threatening airway obstruction secondary to mass in children-a preventable event? [^1136DoSE]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the management of children with life-threatening airway obstruction from large mediastinal masses.

Methods

Review of the medical records of children with mediastinal masses and severe airway obstruction who were admitted to a multidisciplinary pediatric intensive care unit.

Results

Eight patients with 12 life-threatening events were identified. Five events (in 4 patients) occurred before hospital admission, and 3 patients had more than 1 choking episode. Five patients underwent cardiorespiratory resuscitation (2 before admission), and 2 underwent emergency endotracheal intubation because of severe airway obstruction; the eighth patient could not be weaned off the ventilator until the mediastinal mass was resected. Median time from appearance of the initial symptoms to diagnosis was 8.5 days, and median time from the onset of alarming signs to admission was 2 days.

Conclusions

Severe airway obstruction in children with an anterior mediastinal mass is not rare and can lead to complete obstruction, requiring cardiorespiratory resuscitation. Physician awareness and preparedness for respiratory complications are essential for proper management of children with mediastinal masses.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the mediastinum, chest wall and pleura in children [^115SxsSw]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The acceptance of applications for the use of chest MRI in children has been somewhat slow and selective. The use of MRI to image chest wall lesions is likely the most common and widely used indication, aside from the widespread and somewhat sophisticated use of MRI in imaging the cardiovascular structures of the chest. In this respect, fairly standard variations of T1-W, T2-W and contrast-enhanced imaging can be used, similar to the sequences used for musculoskeletal lesions elsewhere in the body. Imaging of the anterior mediastinal masses should be performed in conjunction with a detailed pre-test clinical examination to determine potential cardiovascular compromise. MRI in the setting of middle mediastinal adenopathy, congenital mediastinal cysts or posterior mediastinal masses, however, has been shown to be more effective and more comprehensive than multidetector CT. Although sonographic imaging is the initial modality of choice for pleural abnormalities, MR imaging is extremely effective and clinically useful in the setting of a potentially ambiguous sonographic examination. Faster imaging protocols are likely to increase the acceptance of MRI to replace multidetector CT for many pediatric chest lesions.

### Perioperative management of an anterior mediastinal teratoma in an infant: one more tool in the toolbox [^1178u4Gh]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Anterior mediastinal masses present a significant challenge in the perioperative period. Standard anaesthetic induction and airway management are often not feasible due to the risk of complete respiratory and/or cardiovascular collapse. Invasive manoeuvres, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, cardiac bypass, or tracheal or bronchial stenting, are sometimes not applicable due to significant anatomic aberration. We present a case of anterior mediastinal mass in a 5-month-old infant where typical management techniques in the treatment algorithm were not possible.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® imaging of mediastinal masses [^111gYHN5]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Mediastinal masses can present with symptoms, signs, and syndromes or incidentally. Selecting the appropriate diagnostic imaging study for mediastinal mass evaluation requires awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of the various imaging modalities with regard to tissue characterization, soft tissue contrast, and surveillance. This publication expounds on the differences between chest radiography, CT, PET/CT, ultrasound, and MRI in terms of their ability to decipher and surveil mediastinal masses. Making the optimal imaging choice can yield diagnostic specificity, avert unnecessary biopsy and surgery, guide the interventionist when necessary, and serve as a means of surveillance for probably benign, but indeterminate mediastinal masses. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Anesthesia for patients with a mediastinal mass [^116fM23T]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Anesthesia for patients with mediastinal masses carries a significant risk for fatal or near-fatal cardiorespiratory events. Careful history taking and thorough preoperative investigation, including CT, identify most susceptible patients. Preoperative fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed by or involving the anesthesiologist is invaluable for determining the plan for intubation and ventilation. A coordinated approach involving anesthesiologists and surgeons is essential.

### Thoracic epidural catheter in the management of a child with an anterior mediastinal mass: a case report and literature review [^112piFWd]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

We describe a case of an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the right main bronchus that required a biopsy through a thoracotomy incision. The anesthetic management of these patients is associated with several risks and challenges, including potential airway compression and cardiovascular collapse. Inhalation induction and maintenance of spontaneous respiration is recommended to preserve normal transpulmonary pressure gradient and improve flow through conducting airways. We placed a thoracic epidural catheter under general anesthesia as the main analgesic technique in order to maintain spontaneous breathing. The use of regional anesthesia, especially continuous epidurals in pediatric cardiothoracic anesthesia have many theoretical advantages including attenuation of the neuroendocrine response, facilitation of rapid extubation and improved ventilatory mechanics secondary to decreased narcotic requirements. The absolute risk of nerve injury and epidural hematoma for this procedure is unknown and hard to define in this patient population. We reviewed multiple studies and case reports addressing its safety and reported side effects. Finally, we emphasize that a thoracic epidural anesthesia is a reasonable choice that can be applied carefully in special situations even for children under general anesthesia.

### Watchful waiting for some children with a mediastinal mass: the potential role for ¹ ⁸ F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography: a case report and review of the literature [^114n5Lca]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

However, the inhomogeneous area within the mass on CT imaging is not a typical finding of BHT and raised concern for a malignancy such as teratoma or lymphoma, which may present with such features (Table 1). PET-CT scan of the large anterior mediastinal mass showedareas of low-intensity, and diffuse, homogeneous FDG avidity, similar to the normal thymus (Figure 1 B). Central low-attenuation areas by CT within the mass lacked FDG activity and are suggestive of necrosis (Figure 1 C). The standardized uptake value of the lesions ranged from 2.3 to 2.5 MBq/kg, except for the cystic area, which had values less than 2 MBq/kg.

Table 1
Differential diagnosis of mediastinal masses in children

The diagnosis of BHT was made based on histology and lack of FDG avidity on PET scan. The patient continues routine follow up almost a year after original diagnosis with stable mediastinal mass and no further problems or complaints.

### Delayed diagnosis of pediatric sternoclavicular joint infections and clavicular osteomyelitis during the COVID-19 pandemic: a report of 3 cases [^117SzXri]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Sternoclavicular joint infections (SCJIs) and clavicular osteomyelitis are rare in the pediatric population and account for less than 1% of pediatric joint infections. Definitive diagnosis is with sternoclavicular joint (SCJ) aspiration or bone culture. Severe cases and cases refractory to antibiotics often require surgical irrigation and débridement (I&D).

The most common presentation of SCJI is nonspecific chest pain, which can be mistaken for a cardiac or respiratory etiology. Early diagnosis and treatment of SCJIs is very important because of their proximity to vital structures of the mediastinum. Complications from SCJI can include mediastinitis, recurrent osteomyelitis, chest wall abscess, and death. It is critical to have a high index of suspicion for SCJI in a patient presenting with new-onset shoulder or chest pain even in the absence of overt signs of infection.

In this case report, we present three pediatric cases of SCJI, an exceedingly rare condition with only a handful of studies pertaining to children. All three cases share the common theme of delayed diagnosis, and all three patients presented during the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 has had a notable effect on the diagnosis and treatment of serious non–COVID-19 conditions such as acute myocardial infarction and acute appendicitis. The combination of the pandemic with this elusive condition creates a precarious situation. This report is intended to share our approach for the surgical management of SCJI in pediatric patients and to demonstrate the potentially dangerous effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has on its prompt recognition and treatment.

### Isolated anterior mediastinal tuberculosis in an immunocompetent patient [^112KSpRG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass is a common challenge in clinical practice, with a wide range of differential diagnosis to be considered. One of the rarer causes is tuberculosis. Atypical presentations of tuberculosis are well documented in immunocompromised patients, but should also be considered in the immunocompetent.

Case presentation

This case outlines a previously healthy 22 year-old immunocompetent male presenting with worsening chest pain, positional dyspnea, dry cough and dysphagia. Chest x-ray showed evidence of an isolated anterior mediastinal mass, which was confirmed on computed tomography. A mediastinoscopy was diagnostic as histology revealed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and the presence of acid-fast bacilli, indicating mediastinal tuberculosis.

Conclusion

Typically the underlying presentation of mediastinal tuberculosis is mediastinal lymphadenitis. This case was unusual in that we detected an isolated large anterior mediastinal mass accompanied by a relatively small burden of mediastinal lymphadenitis. Cases similar to this have been documented in immunosuppressed patients however in our case no evidence of immunosuppression was found. This case report emphasizes the importance that a detailed and logical pathway of investigation is pursued when encountering a mediastinal mass.

### Watchful waiting for some children with a mediastinal mass: the potential role for ¹ ⁸ F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography: a case report and review of the literature [^1135WhUW]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Potential etiologies of anterior mediastinal masses in children include benign and malignant tumors whose incidences vary by patient age and symptoms at presentation. Benign hyperplastic thymus (BHT) is a rare condition that occurs mainly in infants and usually resolves spontaneously by 3 years of age, while it seldom occurs in older children and never in adults. BHT is characterized by an increase in size of the thymus with normal histological architecture. Hence, BHT must be distinguished from follicular hyperplasia in association with Graves' disease, rebound thymus hyperplasia in cancer patients after chemotherapy, or thymoma and thymolipoma, which do not meet histological criteria for BHT and are mainly seen in adolescents and adults, respectively.

Diagnoses such as germ cell tumor, thyroid cancer, and lymphomas (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin) must be ruled out during diagnostic workup. BHT spontaneously resolves over time, without specific treatment or surveillance; thus, prognosis and management differ from that of malignant etiologies. Fine-needle aspiration cytology and imaging studies (e.g. chest radiograph, ultrasound, and computed tomography [CT]) are used to diagnose BHT in a minimally invasive manner but may result in inadequate biopsy specimens or inconclusive radiologic findings, requiring more invasive and potentially dangerous procedures. In one study of 54 children and adults who underwent mediastinal biopsy, the procedure-related morbidity was 6%, and fatalities have been reported.

Here we describe a child whose diagnosis of BHT was based on CT-guided core needle biopsy and supported by conventional imaging and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan. PET can help differentiate BHT from other conditions associated with an anterior mediastinal mass.

### Anterior mediastinal masses – A multidisciplinary pathway for safe diagnostic procedures [^114fCTpm]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to report our multidisciplinary diagnostic approach for patients with anterior mediastinal masses (AMM).

Methods

A retrospective review of patients with AMM at a tertiary pediatric surgical oncology centre (January 2011-December 2016) was performed. We analyzed data on clinical presentation, mode of tissue diagnosis, anesthetic techniques, and complications.

Results

Of the 44 patients admitted with AMM (median age 11 years, 27 males and 17 females), 22 had respiratory symptoms. Imaging revealed tracheobronchial compression in 26 children. Twenty patients had a lymph node biopsy. Ten patients had image-guided core biopsy of the mediastinal mass, and 2 had mediastinoscopic biopsy of a paratracheal lymph node. One patient with likely recurrence of a relapsed metastatic ethmoid carcinoma did not have a biopsy. The diagnosis was made from alternative tissues, such as pleural fluid in 4 and peripheral blood in 7 patients. Twenty-five anesthetics were assessed, as 14 patients required no or only local anesthesia, and 5 had unavailable anesthetic notes. Eighteen of 25 patients were anesthetized maintaining spontaneous breathing, mostly by means of ketamine sedation. There were no major anesthetic complications.

Conclusion

Safe tissue diagnosis of anterior mediastinal masses can be obtained by a personalized multidisciplinary approach. Use of alternative tissues, local anesthesia, and ketamine sedation help minimize the need for general anesthesia, muscle paralysis, and controlled ventilation.

### Imaging of mediastinal masses [^111fmeb9]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

A diverse group of conditions can present as a mediastinal mass, posing a diagnostic challenge for radiologists. As a first step toward an accurate diagnosis, precise localization of the mass to the appropriate compartment, followed by the assessment of its internal characteristics is important. The classification proposed by the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group is the current practice standard for localizing mediastinal masses. Computed tomography remains the most widely used imaging modality for their diagnosis with an increasing use of MR imaging to problem solve owing to its superior tissue contrast and ability to characterize different tissue types.

### Thyroglossal duct cyst: an infrequently considered diagnosis in pediatric patients with anterior neck masses [^114hfHje]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a pediatric patient with an anterior neck mass and discuss the evaluation and treatment.

Methods

We present a case report and a discussion of the differential diagnosis of anterior cervical masses. The workup and therapy for an anterior neck mass, which was a thyroglossal duct cyst, are reviewed.

Results

A thyroglossal duct cyst in pediatric patients is an uncommon finding. For establishing a correct diagnosis, surgical confirmation is necessary. Identification is important because of the high incidence of misdiagnosis, recurrent infections, inadequate treatment, and possible neoplastic change.

Conclusion

A thyroglossal duct cyst should be included in the differential diagnosis of an anterior neck mass. Recommended treatment consists of surgical removal of the cyst, the entire thyroglossal duct tract, and the central portion of the hyoid bone.

### Rigid bronchoscopy and Y-stent for severe central malignant airway obstruction as a bridge to surgery requiring general anaesthesia [^111s2PPc]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

In this case report, we present airway stenting as an alternative pretreatment option for patients with a high risk of airway collapse.

Patient's perspective

Knowing that my airway was 90% closed, it was definitely a comfort to learn of the plan of using the y-shaped stent to hold my airway open so that it didn't collapse while receiving anaesthesia for the biopsy surgery, as this was a very real possibility. The various doctors involved all communicated well so that I was not put into a high-risk situation when I went under anaesthesia. Having the stent in for a couple of months after the surgery and anaesthesia provided further comfort, knowing that it would help keep my airway open until my chemotherapy treatment began to shrink the mass, reducing the risk of my airway closing. This was definitely a vital step in the process of keeping me safe, while restoring me to health.

Learning points

Differentials for anterior mediastinal mass can be categorised by age group, and together with the 4 Ts, mnemonic is a practical diagnostic aid.
Central airway obstruction secondary to anterior mediastinal mass can complicate undergoing general anaesthesia.
A multidisciplinary approach between anaesthesia, general surgery and interventional pulmonology was needed to facilitate biopsy for this high-risk patient.

### Watchful waiting for some children with a mediastinal mass: the potential role for ¹ ⁸ F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography: a case report and review of the literature [^116mSqef]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

As the scope of diagnostic imaging broadens, there is greater likelihood of incidental detection of anterior mediastinal masses. Lymphomas and germ cell tumors are the most common malignant tumors of the anterior mediastinum in children; whereas, thymomas seldom occur in this age group. Thymolipomas may occur in young adolescents and adults and occasionally children. Although their radiographic appearance may resemble BHT, thymolipomas present on MRI as mainly fatty masses with inhomogeneous areas that represent thymus tissue. BHT is a rare but important benign condition and must be differentiated from malignant and other benign tumors.

To date, 53 patients with BHT have been reported (Table 2); 34 (64%) of them had respiratory symptoms, and imaging studies revealed a mediastinal mass. In the remaining 19 (36%) patients, the mediastinal lesion was an incidental finding. In either scenario, further diagnostic workup was warranted to rule out a malignancy; however, the implication of malignancy together with imaging findings and parental fear may have led to use of invasive interventions for diagnostic confirmation. Indeed, 79% (15/19) of asymptomatic patients underwent open biopsy and only 26% (9/34) of symptomatic patients were observed clinically without biopsy. In symptomatic patients, open biopsy can be diagnostic and therapeutic, but less invasive procedures are preferred.

The primary goal while assessing a mediastinal mass is to rule out oncologic emergencies (anatomic, metabolic, or hematologic) that require immediate medical attention. Workup includes patient's history, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, and anatomic imaging (Figure 2). After excluding oncologic emergencies, further tests are needed to diagnose the mediastinal lesion.

Physiologic imaging, most often PET-CT, is recommended in the diagnostic process when uncertainty about the malignant versus benign nature of the mass persists (Figure 2).

Pediatric cervical masses can present a diagnostic dilemma given their broad differential diagnosis. We present a 3-year-old girl with a midline anterior neck mass found to have histopathologic findings consistent with a bronchogenic cyst. Although rare, bronchogenic cysts should be considered in the differential diagnosis in both lateral and anterior pediatric cervical masses as their pathophysiology and embryogenesis differ considerably from more common cervical masses. Imaging is an important aspect in the pre-operative work-up, although diagnosis is only made after histopathologic analysis. Complete surgical excision is the definitive treatment.

### Imaging features of posterior mediastinal chordoma in a child [^113pPmLD]. Pediatric Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

A 5 1/2-year-old boy presented with repeated episodes of stridor and cough. Chest radiography demonstrated a widened mediastinum. Evaluation by CT revealed a low-density posterior mediastinal mass initially diagnosed as benign tumor. Histopathological analysis of the resected mass disclosed a malignant chordoma. Our radiological results are described with an analysis of the imaging findings in the medical literature. We present our suggestions for preoperative evaluation of posterior mediastinal tumors.

This article focuses on commonly encountered primary lung, airway, mediastinal, and chest wall neoplasms that occur in the pediatric population. Although primary pediatric thoracic neoplasms are rare, imaging is critical in their diagnostic work-up. An overview of the latest imaging techniques specific to evaluate these pediatric thoracic neoplasms is presented across the spectrum of modalities from radiography to PET/MR imaging. In addition, the characteristic imaging appearances of these pediatric primary thoracic neoplasms are discussed with an emphasis on what the radiologist needs to know in routine clinical practice.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

As certain genetic syndromes are also associated with cardiac tumors, CMR is especially useful in establishing the diagnosis when cardiac masses are noted on echocardiography in that patient population.

Given the overall low incidence of cardiac tumors and the varied types of tumors in pediatrics, relevant published CMR experience includes case reports as well as relatively small case series. – Other publications – have provided reviews and experiences of various centers of the utility and approach to CMR imaging for pediatric masses and how the findings may direct care.

As noted in a prior consensus statement, the utility of CMR is its ability to describe location, size, hemodynamic effects, and tissue type of cardiac masses (thrombus, benign or malignant tumor)upon which clinical decisions are often based. Various publications have described tissue characterization techniques for differentiating benign tumors such as rhabdomyomasmost commonly or myxomas, from others such as osteoscarcoma, highly vascularized tumors such as hemanginomas, or adipose tissue such as lipoma.

In the one published multicenter study comparing pediatric CMR to histologic diagnoses in a blinded fashion to demonstrate the ability of CMR ability to accurately differentiate cardiac masses,97% of tumors were correctly identified compared to histologic diagnosis. Of these, a single correct diagnosis was made in 55% and a limited differential diagnosis which included the correct diagnosis was made in 42% (21% with 2 diagnoses and 23% with 3 or more diagnoses). There were only 2 cases of incorrect diagnoses, both having an atypical appearance on CMR. Generally, incorrect or incomplete diagnoses related either to atypical features of the mass, such as unusual location, or to technical imaging issues such as incomplete image acquisition or poor quality. This multicenter experience demonstrated the clinical utility of CMR in differentiating masses non-invasively, and thus its role in clinical management of affected patients (Table 7).

### Invasive mediastinal aspergillosis presenting as superior vena cava syndrome in an immunocompetent patient [^111bGZQR]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a disease of the immunocompromised with a predilection for the lungs, although dissemination to all organs is possible. Its diagnosis remains a challenge due to the absence of specific clinical manifestations and laboratory findings. In most cases, diagnosis is eventually made via invasive methods. It carries with it a high mortality due to late diagnosis and delayed treatment. Here, we report a fascinating case of a young, otherwise healthy, immunocompetent patient that presented to us with superior vena cava syndrome and a mediastinal mass. It was anticipated that a malignancy would be found on further workup but, in fact, what was eventually discovered was a case of IA. Our report accentuates the significance of including IA as a differential while diagnosing a mediastinal mass in an immunocompetent host as patient outcome is determined by timely diagnosis and treatment.

### A review of literature of a functional, congenital intrathoracic kidney [^1145bjjF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis and functional considerations

Accurately differentiating CITK from other posterior mediastinal masses is essential for appropriate management. Conditions such as congenital diaphragmatic hernias, neurogenic tumors, and other mediastinal anomalies must be considered in the differential. Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scan, urography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have developed as an indispensable means of correct localization and characterization of CITK. These help distinguish the mediastinal or diaphragmatic abnormalities from those of other diseases.

The diagnosis of CITK requires a comprehensive approach. The following imaging modalities further help to confirm its presence and evaluate anatomic and functional status:

Radiography and ultrasound

Initial chest radiography may frequently reveal a smooth cylindrical mass with obvious suggestions of CITK. Ultrasound, on the other hand, may have to be secondarily confirmed with more definitive imaging modalities due to the limited penetration of the lung by the ultrasound.

Computed tomography (CT)

CT imaging provides much detail about renal size, shape, and volume and thus allows differentiation of CITK from all other pulmonary structures and with thickened, soft flesh, characteristic of renal tissue.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Because MRI has high resolution, it is useful for observing mediastinal or diaphragmatic abnormalities of CITK. It complements CT and ultrasonography, especially in situations where these may be limited in the information.

Static renal scintigraphy (DMSA)

Static renal scintigraphy with technetium-99 m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) plays a vital role in assessing the functional capacity of the ectopic kidney. This modality details differential renal function, helping to determine whether the ectopic kidney is contributing effectively to overall renal activity. This especially is valuable for planning treatment strategies. Functional compromise in the ectopic kidney may require surgical intervention or other targeted management approaches.

Integration of these diagnostic tools enables health care providers to make informed patient management decisions. The following sections now will delve deeper into strategies tailored for CITK based on documented case studies and clinical outcomes.

### Lymphangiomatosis with pulmonary, mediastinal, and spinal involvement in a pediatric patient: a case report [^112Guo9y]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lymphangiomatosis is a rare disorder characterized by the abnormal proliferation and dilation of lymphatic vessels, typically presenting with diffuse or multifocal distributions within tissues. The condition predominantly involves the lungs, mediastinum, liver, spleen, and bones. Lymphangiomatosis lacks specific clinical symptoms, leading to a high risk of underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis. This report describes a patient with lymphangiomatosis involving the lungs, mediastinum, and spine who was treated at our institution. The relevant literature is also reviewed and the diagnostic challenges and therapeutic approaches for this disease are discussed.

### Watchful waiting for some children with a mediastinal mass: the potential role for ¹ ⁸ F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography: a case report and review of the literature [^113CKSHA]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Benign hyperplastic thymus is a rare but important differential diagnosis of anterior mediastinal lesions. Histological and radiological criteria are used to distinguish this benign condition from other malignant diseases but have their limitations, and biopsy of mediastinal masses can be risky. We report for the first time the diagnostic value of fluorodeoxyglucose 18 F positron emission tomography for patients with incidentally identified anterior mediastinal masses to avoid biopsy in some cases.

Case presentation

A 2 year old girl presented with new onset of emesis and constipation leading to the incidental discovery of an anterior mediastinal mass on radiograph. Chest computed tomography revealed cystic components within the mass concerning for a malignancy. Biopsy of the lesion and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were negative but there was concern that the mediastinal biopsy may have missed the malignant component of the lesion. Hence, a positron emission tomography scan was obtained that showed mild homogeneous fluorodeoxyglucose 18 F avidity within the mass similar to that of normal thymus. The diagnosis of benign hyperplastic thymus was made.

Conclusion

The differential diagnosis of an incidentally found anterior mediastinal mass includes malignancy, but benign lesions such as benign hyperplastic thymus must also be considered, particularly when the complete blood count and biochemical profile are normal. Fluorodeoxyglucose 18 F positron emission tomography can help guide a clinician's decision for further interventions and treatment.

### Incidence, outcome and risk factors of perioperative pulmonary complications in pediatric patients with mediastinal mass [^1149jWdp]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Intraoperative or postoperative pulmonary complications are common in children with mediastinal mass, which can prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and hospital stay, and affect postoperative recovery. For mediastinal tumors in children, attention should be paid to preoperative evaluation and intraoperative management, and detailed anesthesia plans and protocols should be developed. Preoperative cardiopulmonary compression symptoms, malignant tumor, anterior mediastinum, standardized tumor volume ≥ 0.65, intraoperative blood transfusion, and longer operation time were associated with the occurrence of perioperative pulmonary complications.

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia — essential workup calls for a thorough medical history and physical examination with laboratory and imaging studies, including chest x-ray, and, if LL is suspected, CT or PET/CT; laboratory studies should include a complete blood count (CBC) with platelets and differential, a blood chemistry profile, and liver function tests, and the blood chemistry panel should include a tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) panel with serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, potassium, phosphates, and calcium. Patients of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing, and patients with testes should be evaluated for testicular involvement of disease, including a scrotal ultrasound as indicated. Testicular involvement is rare in ALL, with a prevalence of 1% to 2% in males with ALL, and is slightly more common in T-ALL than B-ALL. For patients with T-LL and mediastinal mass, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary for obtaining biopsy specimen if peripheral blood and bone marrow are negative for blasts, and thoracentesis of pleural fluid, if present, can be diagnostic and also alleviate respiratory symptoms.

### A diagnostic approach to the mediastinal masses [^1169dNeG]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Thymoma is the most common primary neoplasm of the anterior mediastinum but accounts for less than 1% of all adult malignancies. Thymomas typically occur in patients older than 40 years of age, being rare in children, and affecting men and women equally. Between 20% and 30% of patients with thymoma have pressure-induced symptoms. Myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma occurs most frequently in women. Between 30% and 50% of patients with a thymoma have myasthenia gravis, whereas 10–15% of patients with myasthenia gravis have a thymoma.

The updated histological classification elaborated by WHO in 2004 classified different types of thymomas (Table 1) on the basis of the morphology of the neoplastic epithelial cells together with the lymphocyte-epithelial cell ratio. In contrast to histological classification, the stage of thymoma has clinical implications and it is a useful tool for management decisions. The Masaoka-Koga staging system is the most commonly used and describes thymomas in terms of the local extension of the tumour (Table 2). The Masaoka staging system is one of the two factors, including completeness of surgical resection, that most strongly correlates with prognosis of thymomas. The role of imaging is to initially diagnose and properly stage thymoma, with emphasis on the detection of local invasion and distant spread of disease. Between 45 and 80% of thymomas are visible by chest radiography. On CT scans, thymomas usually appear as homogeneous solid masses with soft-tissue attenuation and well-demarcated borders, located anywhere from the thoracic inlet to the cardiophrenic angle. Thymomas may be oval, round or lobulated and when they are large, cystic or necrotic degeneration may be shown (Fig. 18). Calcification may be present in the capsule or throughout the mass. Certain findings, such as encasement of mediastinal structures, infiltration of fat planes, irregular interface between the mass and lung parenchyma, and direct signs of vascular involvement are highly suggestive of invasion (Fig. 19). Pleural dissemination ("drop metastases") manifests as one or more pleural nodules or masses, and they are almost always ipsilateral to the tumour (Fig. 20). Thymoma rarely presents with metastatic lymphadenopathy, metastatic pulmonary nodules or pleural effusion. At MRI, thymomas commonly appear as homogeneous or heterogeneous masses with low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images (Fig. 21). MRI can prove useful in identifying the nodular wall thickening detected in cystic thymomas, absent from congenital cysts.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^116n5ALu]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Chest imaging — key points in trauma care emphasize that the AP chest radiograph is the single most valuable diagnostic study in the management of chest trauma performed in the trauma receiving area. A chest CT is warranted in all adult patients with high-energy torso trauma, a positive chest radiograph, or positive findings on physical examination, and chest CT has low sensitivity for detection of blunt cardiac injury. In pediatrics, for the pediatric patient with minor abnormalities on chest radiograph, chest CT is reported to have no impact on subsequent management, whereas a chest CT is recommended for children with an abnormal contour of the mediastinum to an age-appropriate shaped chest.

### Ultrasound body applications in children [^112JoUno]. Pediatric Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

A major goal of imaging is to obtain the correct examination to answer the clinical questions with the lowest possible radiation exposure. While CT examination provides essential information in many cases, other modalities that do not entail ionizing radiation exposure may be appropriate substitutes either as an initial screening study or as an alternative to CT. US has become a valuable imaging tool in children encompassing many different clinical scenarios. This manuscript highlights some of the less well-accepted applications of US as the first imaging study in pediatric patients, especially in the emergency room environment. These include evaluation of suspected appendicitis, abdominal mass, pleural effusion/empyema, thymic abnormality vs. mediastinal mass and extremity soft-tissue mass or vessel patency. Adoption of US imaging as a problem-solving tool for issues such as these requires appropriate allocation of resources to ensure high-quality performance and interpretation of pediatric US studies around the clock.

Conclusions

Pediatric patients may present with locally advanced heterogenous neoplasms. Thorough familiarity with the anatomy of the mediastinum, thoracic hilum, and great vessels can facilitate safe and complete resection in all cases. The creation of a multidisciplinary team ensured that optimal resections were performed in these complex patients. These cases demonstrate the value of cardiothoracic surgery consultation in the management of complex oncologic tumor resection of the chest.

The high soft tissue contrast of MR imaging enables superior tissue characterization of mediastinal masses, adding diagnostic specificity and often changing and benefiting clinical management. MR imaging can better discern cystic from solid content and can detect microscopic fat, hemorrhage, and fibrous content within lesions. In many cases, mediastinal MR imaging may prevent unnecessary diagnostic intervention. In other cases, MR imaging may indicate the optimal site for biopsy or the correct compartment for resection. Awareness of the efficacy of MR imaging with regard to mediastinal mass characterization and judicious MR imaging utilization should further improve patient care.

Endobronchial tumors in children: radiological findings and differential diagnosis

Anna Coma, Verónica Del Prete, Pilar García-Peña, Joan-Carles Carreño, Joaquim Piqueras, Goya Enríquez

Pediatric Radiology Dept. – University Hosp. Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona (Spain)

Purpose-Objective. Endobronchial tumors are rare in children and often misdiagnosed. This study illustrates radiologic findings in 7 patients with endoluminal tumors.

Material and methods. Retrospective chart review of children with endobronchial tumors diagnosed in 2000–2012. Chest plain films and CT were performed in all cases, and MRI in one patient.

Results. Seven patients with endobronchial lesions (5 girls, 2 boys, mean age 9.7 years). Six primary tumors (all but 1 malignant) and one secondary to an invasive mediastinal tumor (teratoma). Chest plain film findings: unilateral obstructive emphysema in two patients with tumors in mainstem bronchi, and consolidation with airway bronchograms in five patients with tumors in segmental bronchi. Helical CT with MIP reconstructions identified the lesion.

Discussion and conclusions. Bronchial tumors generally arise in a mainstem bronchus or proximal portion of lobar bronchi. Most are malignant, and they can be primary or secondary. Pediatric radiologists should be familiar with plain film features of chronic bronchial obstruction (recurrent consolidation or atelectasis with airway bronchograms) and indicate appropriate examinations to achieve a prompt diagnosis. CT is the reference standard. Differential diagnosis: chronic foreign body aspiration, endoluminal tuberculoma, and mucus plug in patients with cystic fibrosis. Endobronchial lesions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of airway obstruction. Recurrent pneumonia and atelectasis despite adequate treatment should alert to endobronchial tumors.

### Isolated anterior mediastinal tuberculosis in an immunocompetent patient [^114dK4tA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass is a common challenge in clinical practice (Table 1). Patients with these lesions are typically asymptomatic until they develop mass effects, such as chest pain, dyspnea or cough due to compression of local structures. Such symptoms prompted this patient's presentation. Investigation of such lesions must consider the wide range of differentials. As part of the initial evaluation, a detailed history and physical examination should be performed, looking specifically for lymphadenopathy, thyroid enlargement, testicular masses or evidence of immunosuppression. None of these features were present in this patient. A full haematological screen should be performed including relevant tumor markers including beta hCG and alpha-fetoprotein. Gene Xpert analysis is another well-recognized modality in rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis and should be considered in the work up of a mediastinal mass. Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the thorax is useful to further characterize a mediastinal mass. Radiographic findings suggestive of tuberculosis are a ghost like ring enhancement within a matted mass of nodes. Importantly, tuberculosis has been shown to mimic malignancy both radiologically and clinically hence diagnostic confirmation by histology is imperative prior to therapeutic intervention. This can be obtained by bronchoscopy or endoscopic bronchial ultrasound allowing for fine needle aspirate cytology or transbronchial needle aspirate to obtain a diagnostic pathological specimen.

Table 1
Differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass

There are several and varied presentations of mediastinal tuberculosis including lymph node calcification, oesophagomediastinal fistula, pericardial TB and fibrosing mediastinitis. The underlying cause of these lesions is mediastinal lymphadenitis, which extends to involve surrounding structures creating strictures and fistulation. This case was unusual in that we detected an isolated large anterior mediastinal mass accompanied by a relatively small burden of mediastinal lymphadenitis. Prior cases similar to this have been noted to occur in immunosuppressed individuals such as those with seropositive HIV with a CD4 T lymphocyte count < 200/mm³ but are even more rarely found in HIV positive patients with a CD4 T lymphocyte count > 200/mm³. Such a presentation is unusual in immunocompetent patients, although has been shown to occur more frequently in patients from countries where TB is endemic.

Supra-aortic trunks are almost completely surrounded by the lesion and trachea (T) is displaced to the contralateral side by the lesion. Pathological analysis demonstrated a T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma

Fig. 25
Primary mediastinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in a 19-year-old man. Contrast-enhanced CT scan shows a bulky soft tissue mass in the anterior mediastinum (arrows in a), which shows heterogeneous CT-attenuation values with cystic changes within (*). Pericardial effusion is also observed (open arrow in b)

Germ cell tumours (GCTs) mainly arise in gonads and in the midline of the body as well, the mediastinum being the most common extragonadal site. GCTs account for 10–15% of anterior mediastinal masses in adults and 25% in children. Only 3% of them arise in the posterior mediastinum. Pathological classifications include teratomas and non-teratomatous germ cell tumours.

Teratoma is the most common mediastinal GCT. Mature teratomas are usually asymptomatic and represent 60–70% of all mediastinal GCTs. They are composed of well-differentiated benign tissues with predominant ectodermal element. If a teratoma contains fetal tissue or neuroendocrine tissue, it is defined as immature and malignant with a poor prognosis. On CT, teratoma most commonly appears as a well-defined unilocular or multilocular cystic lesion containing fluid, soft tissue and fat attenuation (Fig. 26). Calcifications may be focal, rim-like or, in rare cases, representative of teeth or bone. Common combinations of internal components of mature teratomas include soft tissue, fluid, fat and calcification in 39%; soft tissue, fluid and fat in 24%; and soft tissue and fluid in 15%. In 15% of the cases, mature teratomas appear as non-specific cystic lesions without fat or calcium. On MRI, teratomas typically demonstrate heterogeneous signal intensity, representing various internal elements. Fat-fluid levels within the lesion are virtually diagnostic of teratoma. Ruptured teratomas show an adjacent consolidation, atelectasis and pleural or pericardial effusion than do unruptured teratomas.

### Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis: a comparative study between children and adults [^114oWYHX]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

To compare clinical presentation, diagnostic and treatment strategies, and outcome between pediatric and adult patients with chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO).

Methods

Retrospective single-centre comparative study of pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO)/CNO or synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome treated at the Medical University of Graz.

Results

24 pediatric patients diagnosed with CRMO/CNO and 10 adult patients diagnosed with SAPHO syndrome were compared. Median age at diagnosis was 12.3 years (range 7.9–18.9) in the pediatric group and 32.5 years (range 22–56) in the adult group. Median time to diagnosis was shorter in children than in adults (0.3 vs. 1.0 years). Initial clinical presentation, laboratory and histopathological findings were similar in children and adults. Mean numbers of bone lesions were comparable between pediatric and adult patients (3.1 vs. 3.0), as were rates of skin involvement (33% vs. 30%). Sternal involvement was more frequent in adults whereas involvement of clavicle and long bones was more frequent in children (41.7% vs.10, 33% vs. 10%). Computerized tomography (CT) was used more often in adults, whereas whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used only in children. Bisphosphonates were applied more often in children and outcome was better in children than in adults (62.5% vs.30%).

Conclusion

Results of our study suggest that CNO/CRMO and SAPHO syndrome in children and adults might represent a single clinical syndrome that needs a similar diagnostic and therapeutic approach.

### The ABCs (airway, blood vessels, and compartments) of pediatric neck infections and masses [^112gm8dD]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The radiologist plays several important roles in the diagnosis and management of pediatric neck infections and masses. Although the clinical diagnosis of an infection is often clear, the radiologist should evaluate for an underlying cause and for drainable collections. With neck masses, the radiologist's role is to form a differential diagnosis and evaluate for biopsy of a potentially neoplastic lesion. With both clinical scenarios, the radiologist should also evaluate for complications.

Conclusion

The mnemonic device ABCs (airway, blood vessels, and compartments) serves as a useful reminder for potentially critical complications of pediatric neck infections and masses.

Boys with Klinefelter's syndrome are at an increased risk of precocious puberty. Most cases are either idiopathic or due to a mediastinal tumor. Patients with Klinefelter's syndrome are at a high risk of primary, extragonadal germ cell tumors, which are usually nonseminomatous, but can be a mixed type with seminomatous elements. The differential diagnosis of precocious puberty includes mediastinal tumors, especially in boys with Klinefelter's syndrome.

### Airway implications of congenital sternal agenesis [^1129tCBu]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2009). Low credibility.

Congenital agenesis of the sternum is an extremely unusual malformation rarely encountered by the practicing Otolaryngologist. It typically arises in conjunction with other midline ventral congenital anomalies, including abdominal, diaphragmatic, and cardiac malformations. We report a case series of two patients managed with tracheotomy placement due to prolonged intubation. The first patient was a 63-day-old infant born at 34 weeks gestation with dysmorphic features, cleft lip and palate, and skeletal dysplasia, including absence of the sternum. The second patient was a 31-day-old infant born with ectopic cordis and diaphragmatic hernia. The inadequate closure of the anterior chest wall secondary to manubrium malformation or a variant contributes significantly to a child's inability to generate adequate ventilatory pressures. As a result, airway management must be considered not only to ensure airway patency but also an appropriate physiological environment to allow for adequate air exchange in the lungs.

### Resection of large mediastinal germ cell tumor in an adolescent [^116MUg7V]. JTCVS Techniques (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

GCTs are a heterogeneous group of tumors that primarily arise from the gonads. However, extragonadal GCTs, which account for approximately 5% of all GCT cases, are increasingly recognized in clinical practice. These tumors can occur at a variety of extragonadal sites, including the mediastinum, retroperitoneum, brain, and less commonly in the lungs, liver, prostate, and omentum. Although the origins of extragonadal GCTs remain incompletely understood, it is hypothesized that abnormal migration of germ cells during embryogenesis may contribute to their ectopic presence in these sites. These tumors can act as reservoirs for significant genetic, hematologic, and immunologic functions, potentially impacting surrounding organs as well. Despite their low frequency, their clinical implications are profound, often leading to significant diagnostic challenges and requiring an individualized therapeutic approach.

The clinical manifestations of extragonadal GCTs vary considerably, depending on tumor size, location, and organ involvement. Symptoms often arise from the compressive effects of large tumors, which can cause respiratory or cardiovascular compromise, including cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Rupture of the tumor can lead to pleural or pericardial effusions, further complicating the clinical picture. These tumors can grow to enormous sizes, exacerbating symptoms and requiring urgent medical intervention. Konstantinov and Frickepresented an intrathoracic mass occupying the mediastinum and compressing the superior vena cava, causing facial edema in their study. In our case, the tumor's large size and mediastinal location posed a unique set of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges; however, it did not cause clinical facial edema.

### Safe diagnostic management of malignant mediastinal tumors in the presence of respiratory distress: a 10-year experience [^113HDH5q]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The fundamental treatment for patients with pediatric malignant mediastinal tumors is chemotherapy. Therefore, accurate diagnosis is essential for selecting the appropriate chemotherapeutic regimen. However, malignant mediastinal tumors occasionally cause respiratory distress, and biopsies under general anesthesia are dangerous for such patients as invasive mechanical ventilation can aggravate airway obstruction caused by mass effect. In this study, we reviewed our 10-year diagnostic experience to evaluate the efficacy of our practices and confirm a safe diagnostic protocol for future patients.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed medical records of children with malignant mediastinal tumors diagnosed at Nagoya University Hospital from 2007 to 2018 who demonstrated respiratory distress. Respiratory distress included dyspnea, massive pleural effusion, wheezing, and hypoxemia owing to tumors. Data on sex, age at onset, primary symptoms, location of tumor, management strategy (especially the method of diagnosis and definitive diagnosis), clinical course, prognosis during the acute phase (within 3 months from the onset of respiratory symptoms), and long-term outcome were collected.

Results

Twelve pediatric patients met the review criteria. There were seven anterior mediastinal tumors and five posterior mediastinal tumors. All anterior mediastinal tumors were diagnosed via bone marrow smear, thoracentesis, or core needle biopsy while maintaining spontaneous breathing. Regarding posterior tumors, two patients were diagnosed via a core needle biopsy and lymph node excisional biopsy under spontaneous breathing. Two cases were initially diagnosed solely using tumor markers. One patient with severe tracheal compression underwent tumor resection with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation stand-by. No patient died of diagnostic procedure-related complications.

Conclusions

In 11 of the 12 cases reviewed, safe and accurate tumor diagnosis was accomplished without general anesthesia. A diagnostic strategy without general anesthesia considering the tumor location proved to be useful.

### Pediatric mediastinal lymphatic malformation: misdiagnosis analysis and literature review [^115ZPr9Y]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

MCLM is a rare benign disease of the lymphatic system that primarily affects the configuration and function of lymphatic vessels. The development of lymphangiomas is associated with abnormal proliferation of lymphatic tissue, leading to the expansion of lymphatic vessels and local tumor formation. Among primary mediastinal tumors in children, distinguishing teratomas undergoing cystic transformation from solitary MCLMs can be challenging. Enhanced CT is the preferred imaging modality for assessing and characterizing most mediastinal lesions. While the definitive clinical diagnosis depends on pathological findings or interventional diagnostic procedures, enhanced CT is essential for analyzing lesion characteristics and evaluating the relationship with adjacent vascular structures.

Statistical analysis of clinical data reveals that patients with MCLM tend to present at a younger age compared to those with teratomas. This outcome may be attributed to the greater propensity of MCLM to infiltrate and grow, potentially invading adjacent blood vessels and thereby increasing the likelihood of clinical symptoms.

The literature review revealed that eight studies reported anterior mediastinal masses, while four described lesions in both the anterior and middle mediastinum, consistent with our findings. In terms of staging, MCLM typically exhibits perfusion-type growths, spreading through the lax interstitial spaces with a "creeping" pattern and causing plastic changes in the surrounding tissue. In contrast, teratomas usually present as protruding masses that compress adjacent tissues inwardly. Previous research indicated that convex MLCMs were more common in children (3/5), whereas flattened MLCMs were more prevalent in adults (4/11). Our results suggest the trend was notably pronounced in teratomas, implying that a single morphological analysis might not always be sufficient for accurate cancer differentiation. The imaging features of MLCM varied significantly with age, further complicating diagnosis. In children, it extends to the neck or anterior mediastinum with vascular malformations, while in adults, it is typically confined to the middle or posterior mediastinum with fluid cysts.

### A diagnostic approach to the mediastinal masses [^11759YAn]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mediastinal masses span a wide histopathological and radiological spectrum. The most frequent lesions encountered in the mediastinum are thymoma, neurogenic tumours and benign cysts, altogether representing 60% of patients with mediastinal masses. Neurogenic tumours, germ cell neoplasms and foregut cysts represent 80% of childhood lesions, whereas primary thymic neoplasms, thyroid masses and lymphomas are the most common in adults.

The mediastinum is demarcated by the pleural cavities laterally, the thoracic inlet superiorly and the diaphragm inferiorly. It is further divided into anterior, middle and posterior compartments by many anatomists. Anterior mediastinal tumours account for 50% of all mediastinal masses, including thymoma, teratoma, thyroid disease and lymphoma. Masses of the middle mediastinum are typically congenital cysts while those arising in the posterior mediastinum are often neurogenic tumours.

Usual symptoms at presentation are cough, chest pain, fever/chills and dyspnea. Localising symptoms are secondary to tumour invasion (respiratory compromise; paralysis of the limbs, diaphragm and vocal cords; Horner syndrome; superior vena cava syndrome), while systemic symptoms are typically due to the release of excess hormones, antibodies or cytokines.

### Incidence, outcome and risk factors of perioperative pulmonary complications in pediatric patients with mediastinal mass [^1156rBs7]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mediastinal masses in children are abnormal tissues formed by residual embryonic tissue in the mediastinum or primary or metastatic tumors derived from mediastinal tissue, which can occur in all age groups. Mediastinal masses may compress important structures such as the trachea, heart or large blood vessels in the mediastinum, leading to complications such as airway obstruction, decreased cardiac function and decreased blood pressure, and the risk of anesthesia surgery is high. Many of the available reviews of the anesthetic-related complications of pediatric patients with a mediastinal mass have been limited to patients with an anterior mediastinal mass, thus missing complications in patients with either a middle or a posterior mediastinal mass. Surgery is the most common strategy to treat mediastinal mass at present. Compared with adults, the difficulty of mediastinal mass anesthesia in children is related to young age, poor tolerance, low body weight and underdeveloped chest respiratory muscles. Most patients were initially diagnosed by chest radiography. With the introduction of CT and MRI, detailed structural images were revealed. The study of Azizkhan et al. proposed that CT could be used to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) at the narrowest part of the trachea, and suggested that patients with reduced CSA had an increased risk of pulmonary complications during anesthesia. However, in the study by Shamberger et al. the presence or absence of respiratory symptoms was not well correlated with CSA. Therefore, it is necessary to find more convincing relevant indicators.

Pulmonary complications are one of the main risks in the perioperative period of thoracic surgery, with high incidence and great harm, which can increase the mortality of perioperative patients, prolong the length of hospital stay of patients, and hinder the promotion of ERAS. Therefore, our retrospective study aims to identify the incidence, outcome and risk factors of perioperative pulmonary complications in children with mediastinal mass, so as to select the appropriate anesthetic management plan for children with risk factors, reduce or avoid the occurrence of pulmonary complications, and achieve ERAS.

Molecular tumor board

The differential diagnosis for a mediastinal mass depends on the anatomical compartment involved — anterior/middle/posterior. Anterior compartment masses typically include thymic neoplasms, germ cell tumors, or thyroid-related masses. Middle compartment masses involve lymphadenopathy (reactive/infectious/metastatic) or foregut cysts, while posterior compartment masses are predominantly neurogenic tumors. Given our patient's presentation with a large infiltrative anterior mediastinal mass and necrotic neck metastasis, the differential initially included thymic carcinoma, germ cell tumors, lung malignancies, or other metastatic cancers.

Pathological findings can narrow the differentials. In this case, the initial biopsy showed poorly differentiated epithelioid cells with a non-specific IHC profile. Tumor cells were weakly positive for synaptophysin and PAX8 but negative for markers commonly used to distinguish thymic, germ cell, and metastatic carcinomas. A second specimen initially suggested germ cell malignancy based on morphology, but germ cell stains and tumor markers were negative.

Tumors arising in midline locations should raise suspicion for NUT-rearranged, SMARCB1-deficient, or SMARCA4-deficient tumors. These tumors, traditionally associated with squamous histology, can mimic poorly differentiated or dedifferentiated tumors, such as germ cell tumors with IHC and NGS necessary for differentiation. NUT-rearranged tumors show positive NUT protein IHC and rearrangements like BRD4-NUT. SMARCB1-deficient tumors demonstrate loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression, while SMARCA4-UT shows SMARCA4/BRG1 loss with retained SMARCB1/INI1 expression. Germ cell tumors express markers such as SALL4, OCT4, and PLAP, often along with isochromosome 12p[i(12p)]. Poorly differentiated carcinomas of head/neck origin, which typically express cytokeratin markers, p40, p63, p16 (HPV-related), or EBER (EBV-related), also need to be considered.

In our case, multidisciplinary discussion led to IHC and NGS testing, which confirmed SMARCA4/BRG1 loss, preserved SMARCB1/INI1 expression, and the absence of other pathognomonic markers, establishing the diagnosis of SMARCA4-UT (Figure 2).

### Posterior mediastinal hemangioma [^113wTgMB]. Pediatric Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

We report posterior mediastinal hemangiomas in a 4-month-old and a 6-month-old girl. The masses were identified on radiographs of the chest followed by contrast-enhanced CT. Histological evaluation of the surgical specimens established the final diagnosis. Although mediastinal hemangiomas have been described, they remain a rare entity. A diagnosis can be suggested by relatively high attenuating masses on contrast-enhanced CT. Posterior mediastinal hemangiomas sometimes mimic neuroblastomas, which is the most common posterior mediastinal in this age group.

### Pediatric mediastinal mass algorithm: a quality improvement initiative to reduce time from presentation to biopsy [^114TYcL2]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Mediastinal masses in children may present with compression of the great vessels and airway. An interdisciplinary plan for rapid diagnosis, acute management, and treatment prevents devastating outcomes and optimizes care. Emergency pretreatment with steroids or radiation is more likely to be administered when care is variable, which may delay and complicate diagnosis and treatment. Strategies to standardize care and expedite diagnosis may improve acute patient safety and long-term outcomes.

Aims

The aim of this quality improvement project was to decrease time from presentation to diagnostic biopsy for children with an anterior mediastinal mass by 50% over 3 years within a tertiary healthcare system.

Methods

This quality improvement project involved a single center with data collected and analyzed retrospectively and prospectively for 71 patients presenting with anterior mediastinal mass between February 2008 and January 2018. The Model for Improvement was utilized for project design and development of a driver diagram and smart aim. An algorithm was implemented to facilitate communication between teams and standardize initial care of patients with mediastinal masses. The algorithm underwent multiple Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. Data were collected before and after algorithm implementation and between each PDSA cycle. The primary outcome measure included time from presentation to biopsy, which was monitored with a statistical process control chart. Several process measures were evaluated with Student's t-tests including administration of emergency pretreatment.

Results

Nineteen patients preintervention and 52 patients postintervention were included in the analysis. Time from presentation to biopsy significantly decreased from 48 h at baseline to 24 h postimplementation. Although not statistically significant, emergency pretreatment decreased from a baseline of 26.3% to 6.7% postimplementation.

Conclusion

Implementation of a diagnostic and management algorithm coordinating care among multidisciplinary teams significantly reduced time to biopsy for children presenting with mediastinal mass and may result in decreased use of emergent pretreatment.

### Cervical mediastinoscopy for paratracheal masses in pediatric patients [^111jqLx4]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

A cytological diagnosis is essential for a definitive diagnosis in children who have paratracheal lesions. Thirteen pediatric patients were biopsied using cervical mediastinoscopy. Age, gender, preoperative diagnosis, and postoperative biopsy results and complications were reviewed. Five patients had mediastinal lesions residuing or recurring after chemotherapy for either Hodgkin disease or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In 2 of these patients, the diagnosis was recurrent disease. Among the 8 patients presenting with a paratracheal mass or enlarged lymph nodes, histopathologic diagnosis showed tuberculosis in 3 children, Hodgkin disease in 2 children, and histiocytosis X and non-Hodgkin lymphoma 1 patient in each. This study shows that cervical mediastinoscopy gave 100% correct diagnosis for mediastinal residual malignancies or uncommon forms of mycobacterium tuberculosis with paratracheal masses.

### Imaging of pediatric head and neck masses [^113qjbNn]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Medical imaging is an important tool in the evaluation and classification of pediatric head and neck masses. Such lesions may include congenital, inflammatory, infectious, vascular, or neoplastic processes. Ultrasound is often the first line modality in the workup of a neck mass in a child, followed by MRI or CT depending on the scenario. This information must be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical history, physical examination, and demographics. The medical imaging workup of a neck mass in a child must be focused to yield the maximum information possible while minimizing the risks of radiation and sedation.

### Mediastinal mass with unusual etiology… [^115fuKxy]. publications.aap.org (2021). Medium credibility.

A 15-year-old previously healthy female presents to an emergency department with chest pain. The chest pain developed acutely 1 day prior to presentation without an identifiable trigger. It was initially mild but progressed to a level of 7 out of 10 over 24 hours and radiated to her shoulders. She further developed associated dyspnea with deep inspiration, prompting her to seek care. She reports no history of fever, cough, headache, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. She has had no recent illness or known sick contacts. She moved from northern California to Ohio 2 years prior but reports no other recent travel. Her immunizations are up to date. Her past medical history is significant for 2 previous episodes of community-acquired pneumonia of unknown etiology. These infections occurred when she was a young child, but neither required hospitalization. She is not on any medications and has no known allergies. She reports.

### An approach to renal masses in pediatrics… [^116Ve6u1]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Renal masses in children may be discovered during routine clinical examination or incidentally during the course of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures for other causes. Renal cancers are rare in the pediatric population and include a spectrum of pathologies that may challenge the clinician in choosing the optimal treatment. Correct identification of the lesion may be difficult, and the appropriate surgical procedure is paramount for lesions suspected to be malignant. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview regarding the spectrum of renal tumors in the pediatric population, both benign and malignant, and their surgical management.
