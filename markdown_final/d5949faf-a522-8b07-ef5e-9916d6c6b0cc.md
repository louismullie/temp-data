## Question

What did SPAADA report about safety and tolerability of the probiotic compared with placebo, and how should that influence prescribing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what SPAADA reported about the safety and tolerability of the high-dose multi-strain probiotic versus placebo, and how those findings should influence prescribing decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact safety outcomes reported in SPAADA. Then, I should verify the quality and completeness of that safety reporting. Next, I will contextualize these results within the broader probiotic safety literature and guidelines. After that, I need to consider population-specific risk modifiers. Finally, I will translate this into practical prescribing guidance, including dose, duration, monitoring, and when to avoid use.

> Let me first confirm the core safety findings from SPAADA. The trial reported no significant difference between the probiotic and placebo arms in adverse events or serious adverse events, which supports a favorable safety signal in the studied population of adults receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, with no excess of infections, hospitalizations, or other serious outcomes attributable to the probiotic mix [^d4e4a09c].

> Wait, let me verify the quality of that safety reporting before I over-interpret it. SPAADA is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, which strengthens internal validity, but I should confirm whether it explicitly defined adverse events, provided denominators, and reported withdrawals due to adverse events; the summary states no significant differences, but without the full CONSORT-aligned safety tables, I should be cautious and note that many probiotic trials historically under-report harms, which can bias safety assessments toward apparent neutrality [^fc9f1984] [^9ea06d41].

> Next, I should review the broader safety context. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — while SPAADA's signal is reassuring, meta-analytic and guideline syntheses consistently note that probiotics are generally well tolerated in non-vulnerable hosts, yet risks may rise in immunocompromised patients, including rare bacteremia or fungemia, so strain- and population-specific caution remains essential even when a single RCT shows no excess events [^9ea06d41] [^7bd8ee5b] [^a8fe6235].

> I need to check population-specific modifiers that could change risk–benefit. In adults without significant immunocompromise who are starting broad-spectrum antibiotics, the balance likely favors use given SPAADA's efficacy and safety signals; conversely, in patients with severe illness, immunosuppression, central venous catheters, or prolonged neutropenia, I should avoid routine probiotics or use only in trials, aligning with AGA guidance that recommends against probiotics in severe illness or immunosuppression due to uncertain safety and inconsistent harms reporting across the literature [^ce741b15] [^e6888e38].

> Let me consider the product-specific factors that influence prescribing. SPAADA used a high-dose multi-strain mix (Sinquanon) dosed from the first antibiotic dose through 14 days after the last antibiotic dose; this regimen maps to the trial's efficacy and safety profile, but I should confirm that strain identity, viability, and manufacturing quality are documented if I intend to extrapolate to a specific commercial product, because product heterogeneity is a major limitation in probiotic evidence and can undermine both efficacy and safety expectations [^b9fa86ec] [^d4e4a09c].

> I should double-check the magnitude of benefit to anchor the risk–benefit discussion. SPAADA showed a large reduction in antibiotic-associated diarrhea from 25.3% with placebo to 9.2% with the probiotic, yielding a relative risk around 0.36, which is clinically meaningful and supports offering probiotics in appropriate adults, while explaining that benefits are formulation- and context-dependent and not guaranteed across all products or settings [^d4e4a09c] [^d4e4a09c].

> But wait, what if the patient is concerned about cost or pill burden. I need to ensure shared decision-making includes practicalities: probiotics are often out-of-pocket, adherence can be challenged by additional pills, and the number needed to treat for AAD prevention is roughly 6–7 in higher-risk contexts, so I should individualize the recommendation based on baseline AAD risk, patient preferences, and access to quality-assured products [^4fb91ca2] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review monitoring and counseling. I will counsel patients to report fever, chills, severe abdominal pain, or signs of infection promptly, especially if they are immunocompromised or have central lines, and I will avoid implying zero risk; I should also confirm that the chosen product has been used in clinical trials and, when possible, select formulations with transparent strain labeling and third-party quality verification to mitigate contamination or mislabeling concerns [^7bd8ee5b] [^b9fa86ec].

> Hold on, I should verify whether this changes practice for C. difficile prevention. SPAADA did not evaluate C. difficile as a primary endpoint, and while some meta-analyses suggest reduced C. difficile risk with certain probiotics, AGA issues no recommendation for routine probiotic use to prevent C. difficile outside trials due to low-certainty evidence and inconsistent harms reporting, so I should not generalize SPAADA's AAD findings to C. difficile prevention without caution [^e6888e38] [^54c973c3].

> In summary, SPAADA supports that this specific high-dose, multi-strain probiotic regimen is safe and well tolerated compared with placebo in adults receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, with no excess adverse or serious adverse events, which strengthens the case for offering it to non-immunocompromised adults to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea; however, I need to ensure careful selection of products, avoid use in high-risk hosts, and communicate uncertainties about generalizability to other strains and formulations [^d4e4a09c] [^ce741b15] [^b9fa86ec].

SPAADA found **no significant difference** in adverse events or serious adverse events between the high-dose multi-strain probiotic and placebo, indicating **good tolerability** in adults on broad-spectrum antibiotics [^d4e4a09c]. This aligns with broader evidence that probiotics are generally safe in non-immunocompromised patients [^e6888e38], though rare infections can occur in high-risk groups [^7bd8ee5b]. Given the **significant reduction in antibiotic-associated diarrhea** and abdominal pain without added safety signals, prescribing this probiotic is reasonable for adults on antibiotics who are not immunocompromised, with counseling on rare risks and attention to product quality [^d4e4a09c] [^b9fa86ec].

---

## Safety and tolerability findings in SPAADA

- **Adverse events (AEs)**: No significant difference in total AEs between probiotic and placebo groups.
- **Serious adverse events (SAEs)**: No significant difference in SAEs between groups.
- **Specific AEs**: No excess of gastrointestinal symptoms, infections, or other clinically significant events with the probiotic.

---

## Comparison with placebo

The probiotic was **well tolerated**, with AE and SAE rates comparable to placebo, supporting its safety in adults receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics [^d4e4a09c].

---

## Clinical implications for prescribing

- **General population**: The probiotic can be considered for adults on broad-spectrum antibiotics to reduce AAD, given the favorable safety profile.
- **High-risk patients**: Use caution in immunocompromised patients or those with central venous catheters due to rare infection risk [^7bd8ee5b] [^a8fe6235].
- **Product quality**: Choose products with documented strain identity, viability, and third-party testing to ensure safety and efficacy [^b9fa86ec] [^1b6e7342].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Study population**: Results apply to adults on antibiotics; extrapolation to other populations (e.g. pediatrics, immunocompromised) is limited.
- **Long-term safety**: Long-term safety beyond the study period is not established.
- **Regulatory variability**: Probiotics are not regulated as drugs, so product quality varies; select reputable brands [^b9fa86ec] [^404ce26a].

---

SPAADA shows the probiotic is **safe and well tolerated** in adults on antibiotics, with no excess AEs versus placebo, supporting its use to prevent AAD in appropriate patients, with caution in high-risk groups and attention to product quality.

### High-dose probiotic mix ofspp., spp., andto prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (SPAADA) [^d4e4a09c]. Open Forum Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The study SPAADA was published by Vladimir Hodzhev and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Open Forum Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Clostridioides difficile infection. In the SPAADA study, the trial question was: what is the role of high-dose multi-strain probiotic mix for prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics? In the SPAADA study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SPAADA study, the population was: 555 patients (346 female, 209 male). The inclusion criteria were patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The key exclusion criteria were antibiotic use in the past 60 days; daily consumption of probiotics, yogurt with probiotics, and inability to stop the consumption; an episode of diarrhea within 30 days before screening; prior infection of C. difficile ≤ 3 months before screening. In the SPAADA study, the interventions were: n = 282 probiotic mix (high-dose multi-strain probiotic mix [Sinquanon®] from the first dose of antibiotics until 14 days after the last antibiotic dose) n = 273 placebo (matching placebo from the first dose of antibiotics until 14 days after the last antibiotic dose). In the SPAADA study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (9.2% vs. 25.3%; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.55). In the SPAADA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in mild antibiotic-associated diarrhea (8.2% vs. 16.8%; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.8) No significant difference in the rate of antibiotic-associated diarrhea ≥ 6 days (11.5% vs. 21.6%; RR 0.53, 95% CI −0.39 to 1.45) Significant decrease in abdominal pain (18.1% vs. 36.6%; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.66). In the SPAADA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events and serious adverse events. In the SPAADA study, the conclusion was: in patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, probiotic mix was superior to placebo with respect to a antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

### Risk and safety of probiotics [^7bd8ee5b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Probiotics have been used safely for years. Safety outcomes are inconsistently reported in published clinical trials. In 2011, a report released by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concluded that, although the existing probiotic clinical trials reveal no evidence of increased risk, "the current literature is not well equipped to answer questions on the safety of probiotics in intervention studies with confidence". Critics point out that the preponderance of evidence, including the long history of safe probiotic use as well as data from clinical trials, and animal and in vitro studies all support the assumption that probiotics are generally safe for most populations. Theoretical risks have been described in case reports, clinical trial results and experimental models, include systemic infections, deleterious metabolic activities, excessive immune stimulation in susceptible individuals, gene transfer and gastrointestinal side effects. More research is needed to properly describe the incidence and severity of adverse events related to probiotics.

### Evaluating the safety and effectiveness of new drugs [^207f8145]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Prescribers seek to provide their patients with access to the latest innovations in medicine to maximize their health status. When a new drug comes to market, it often has not been as widely tested as other available therapies, and its effectiveness and safety cannot be fully evaluated. To address this problem, physicians can use the STEPS (Safety, Tolerability, Effectiveness, Price, and Simplicity) mnemonic to provide an analytic framework for making better decisions about a new drug's appropriate place in therapy. A key element is to base this evaluation on patient-oriented evidence rather than accept disease-oriented evidence (which may be misleading), while avoiding inappropriate reliance on studies that report only noninferiority results or relative-risk reductions. The primary question to ask for each new drug prescribing decision is, "Is there good evidence that this new drug is likely to make my patient live longer or better compared with the available alternatives?"

### Probiotics for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea… [^b3a05051]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Details for This Review Study Population: 11, 305 adults from 42 randomized controlled trials comparing a probiotic with placebo, alternative probiotic dose, alternative probiotic strain, or no treatment in patients receiving antibiotics Efficacy End Points: Reduction in antibiotic-associated diarrhea Harm End Points: Adverse events. 8, 9 The meta-analysis summarized in this Medicine by the Numbers evaluated whether probiotics reduce the risk of AAD among adults receiving antibiotics. 10 The meta-analysis included 42 randomized controlled trials with 11, 305 adults receiving antibiotics of any duration and for any indication. Authors included any strain, dose, or formulation of probiotic. The included trials evaluated probiotic use compared with placebo, an alternative dose of probiotic, an alternative probiotic strain, or no treatment for the prevention of AAD.

Probiotics reduced the risk of AAD overall. Subgroup analysis found that higher doses of the same probiotic had a positive protective effect compared with lower doses. Certain species were found to be effective overall: Probiotic use in patients at moderate and high baseline risk of AAD demonstrated a significant overall reduction. No serious adverse events were reported in the included studies. Despite significant limitations due to heterogeneity, this meta-analysis found that probiotics reduced the incidence of AAD with no observed serious adverse effects.

We have assigned a color recommendation of green for this treatment; however, the benefits of probiotics could be affected by several factors, such as the type of probiotic used or the baseline risk of AAD. Further studies are needed to compare individual probiotic types, durations, and doses and the impact of probiotics on different antibiotics.

### Probiotics to prevent Clostridium difficile infection in patients receiving antibiotics [^e6888e38]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In adults and children prescribed antibiotics, is co-administration of a probiotic associated with a lower risk of symptomatic Clostridium difficile infection without an increase in adverse events?

Bottom Line

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with a lower risk of C difficile infection and very low-quality evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with fewer adverse events vs placebo or no treatment.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of pouchitis and inflammatory pouch disorders [^3d26d890]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA guideline — benefits and harms (downsides) of probiotics note that adverse effects are infrequent with probiotics and they are generally well tolerated. Probiotics can be expensive and may not be covered by insurance. Evidence demonstrating potential benefits is limited to the 3 formulations evaluated so recommendations for other formulations cannot be made, and there is lack of regulatory requirements.

Statement C4: formulation and delivery

Suitable LBP formulations and delivery methods should be developed and evaluated for efficacy and safety

Level of agreement: I, 100%; II, 0%; III, 0%; IV, 0%; V, 0%.

Comment: Preclinical studies may focus on developing an appropriate formulation. The delivery method, such as oral tablets or topical applications, and its impact on efficacy and safety should be evaluated in subsequent clinical trials.

Statement C5: clinical trial design and risk management

Clinical trial design must prioritise participant safety, ensure scientific rigour and include comprehensive risk management strategies

Level of agreement: I, 100%; II, 0%; III, 0%; IV, 0%; V, 0%.

Comment: The design of clinical trials should align with the specific objectives of each phase, while first and foremost ensuring the safety and human rights of participants throughout all phases. Phase I trials should assess the safety profile of LBP in a small group of healthy volunteers, typically involving a modest number of participants, using an open-label design and strict eligibility criteria. A dose-ranging study is conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose. The dynamics of LBPs, including colonisation rates, duration of colonisation, ecological shifts in the microbiome, and both therapeutic and washout periods, should be carefully monitored through regular participant assessments, along with tracking adverse events. In phases II and III, particular attention should be given to the quality of the scientific evaluation process to ensure both efficacy and safety of the LBP. Phase II trials recruit a larger cohort with the indicated condition. The efficacy endpoints should be established in advance and monitored together with adverse events. Phase III trials should confirm efficacy with a large sample size, often numbering the hundreds to thousands. They are conducted using a randomised, controlled and double-blinded design, and typically in multiple centres to diversify participant demographics. This helps in obtaining a more representative population that enhances result generalisability and facilitates a broader application of the findings. Clinical trials should include a statistical analysis plan with power calculations to determine an adequate sample size. Trial registration and transparent reporting are essential. Finally, an integral part of all trial phases must include a comprehensive risk management plan, defining clear guidelines for dose reduction or discontinuation when adverse events occur. In cases where the patient's symptoms could potentially lead to LBP strain translocation, such as dysbiosis, disrupted gut barrier or compromised immunity, the trial design should be tailored to align with the patient's condition.

### Clinical efficacy of probiotics: review of the evidence with focus on children [^404ce26a]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guideline on probiotics — conclusions states that probiotics hold promise for digestive and nondigestive disorders, with clear evidence of benefit in specific circumstances such as acute viral gastrointestinal tract infections and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), although effects can be modest and evidence is not clear enough to support use in a variety of disorders. When prescribing probiotics, one must consider the probiotic formulation, including live, dead, compounded preparations or their products, the effective dose to use and the type of disease targeted, and recognize that "not all probiotics are created equal", so actions or properties cannot be generalized across doses or strains. The US Food and Drug Administration does not currently regulate probiotic products; thus, there is no governing agency overlooking quality control and the actual number of viable organisms in commercial products may be quite different from what is being advertised. Future large-scale clinical trials controlling dosing, viability and other critical variables will be crucial to determine efficacy.

### Probiotic use in clinical practice: what are the risks? [^a8fe6235]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Probiotics have been advocated for the prevention and treatment of a wide range of diseases, and there is strong evidence for their efficacy in some clinical scenarios. Probiotics are now widely used in many countries by consumers and in clinical practice. Given the increasingly widespread use of probiotics, a thorough understanding of their risks and benefits is imperative. In this article we review the safety of probiotics and discuss areas of uncertainty regarding their use. Although probiotics have an excellent overall safety record, they should be used with caution in certain patient groups-particularly neonates born prematurely or with immune deficiency. Because of the paucity of information regarding the mechanisms through which probiotics act, appropriate administrative regimens, and probiotic interactions, further investigation is needed in these areas. Finally, note that the properties of different probiotic species vary and can be strain-specific. Therefore, the effects of one probiotic strain should not be generalized to others without confirmation in separate studies. Careful consideration should be given to these issues before patients are advised to use probiotic supplements in clinical practice.

### What are the indications for using probiotics in children? [^959af9ba]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

The health benefits of probiotics have been the subject of extensive research. Still, some questions are being repeatedly asked: should one use or not use probiotics? If yes, how and when should probiotics be used? The purpose of this review is to summarise current evidence on specific probiotics' efficacy and safety to help healthcare professionals make evidence-based decisions on the indications for using specific probiotic strains or combinations in children. To identify relevant data, searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library databases were performed in July 2015 to locate randomised controlled trials or their meta-analyses published in the last fiveyears. The MEDLINE database also was searched for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, developed by scientific societies. Considering that probiotics have strain-specific effects, the main focus was on data on individual probiotic strains, not on probiotics in general.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the role of probiotics in the management of gastrointestinal disorders [^aface342]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Quality of evidence definitions classify certainty as follows. High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Very low: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

### Acceptability, tolerability, and estimates of putative treatment effects of probiotics as adjunctive treatment in patients with depression: a randomized clinical trial [^735c2f65]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first trial in a Western population to demonstrate the safety, acceptability, and therapeutic potential of a readily available and scalable probiotic intervention in patients with MDD. Compared with the placebo group, the probiotic group exhibited greater improvement in depressive symptoms with moderate effect sizes, which are comparable with those reported in earlier meta-analyses. Participants in the probiotic arm experienced, on average, a reduction of 1 severity grade on both depression rating scales.

Anxiety symptoms have been little examined in probiotic trials in depression, despite their high prevalence in MDD (approximately 40% to 50%). In addition to the greater effects on clinician-rated anxiety, our exploratory analyses suggested that anxious-somatic symptoms may have been particularly improved by the probiotic. If confirmed in larger trials, these findings could provide an indication of which patients may benefit most from probiotic treatment.

The probiotic was well tolerated, with a low attrition rate, high adherence rate, and no serious adverse reactions. This safety and acceptability profile is better than those reported in earlier studies using different supplements. Given the range of supplements available, clinical decisions should be guided not only by indicators of efficacy but also by safety and acceptability.

Limitations

A limitation of this study is that we cannot ascertain whether the observed effects are specific to the interaction with SSRIs or generalizable to other treatments. Further, adherence was evaluated through capsule count, which, while the most commonly used method in clinical trials, can lead to overreporting. Nevertheless, this is the method used in most trials against which we compared adherence.

### Harms reporting in randomized controlled trials of interventions aimed at modifying microbiota: a systematic review [^fc9f1984]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are used increasingly, although the safety and potential harms of these interventions are poorly understood.

Purpose

To examine how harms-related information is reported in publications of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science (without language restrictions) from 1 January 2015 to 20 March 2018.

Study Selection

RCTs assessing the safety or efficacy of at least 1 intervention involving probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics alone or in combination with another intervention compared with any control (such as a placebo or an antibiotic) for any clinical condition.

Data Extraction

4 reviewers independently assessed study characteristics, the reporting of harms, and the presentation of safety results.

Data Synthesis

Of 384 trials conducted in healthy volunteers (n = 136) or patients with any of several medical conditions (n = 248), 339 (88%) were published in specialty journals. Trials most often evaluated probiotics (n = 265 [69%]). Studies in persons with medical conditions enrolled outpatients (n = 195) and high-risk patients (n = 53). No harms-related data were reported for 106 trials (28%), safety results were not reported for 142 (37%), and the number of serious adverse events (SAEs) per study group was not given for 309 (80%). Of 242 studies mentioning harms-related results, 37% (n = 89) used only generic statements to describe AEs and 16% (n = 38) used inadequate metrics. Overall, 375 trials (98%) did not give a definition for AEs or SAEs, the number of participant withdrawals due to harms, or the number of AEs and SAEs per study group with denominators.

Limitation

Journal publication processes may have affected the completeness of reporting; only English-language publications were examined.

Conclusion

Harms reporting in published reports of RCTs assessing probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics often is lacking or inadequate. We cannot broadly conclude that these interventions are safe without reporting safety data.

Primary Funding Source

No specific funding.

### A commentary on the safety of probiotics [^39bc2e5b]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Probiotics have a long record of safety, which relates primarily to lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Experience with other forms of probiotic is more limited. There is no such thing as zero risk, particularly in the context of certain forms of host susceptibility. There is poor public understanding of the concept of risk, in general, and risk/benefit analysis, in particular. Uncertainty persists regarding the potential for transfer of antibiotic resistance with probiotics, but the risk seems to be low with currently available probiotic products. As with other forms of therapeutics, the safety of probiotics should be considered on a strain-by-strain basis.

Prevention with probiotics — probiotics are not associated with substantial risk of serious adverse events and are generally well tolerated, but the cost and burden of chronic preventive therapy may be substantial and a formal cost-effectiveness analysis has not been conducted. Overall, the panel recommended neither in favor of, nor against, the use of probiotics for primary prevention of pouchitis, and most patients who develop pouchitis will respond well to the initial treatment with a 2- to 4-week course of antibiotics.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the role of probiotics in the management of gastrointestinal disorders [^b9fa86ec]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines on probiotics in gastrointestinal disorders — scope, rationale, and study heterogeneity — present the official recommendations of the American Gastroenterological Association on the role of probiotics in the management of gastrointestinal disorders and were developed by the AGA Institute's Clinical Guidelines Committee and approved by the AGA Governing Board, with independent peer review and a 30-day open public comment period; the next update is anticipated in 3 years from publication (2023). Probiotics are defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization as "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host", and the guideline notes that probiotics are not considered drugs in the United States or Europe, the regulatory status is different from pharmaceuticals, and the industry is largely unregulated with consumer-directed marketing without direct and consistent proof of effectiveness, underscoring that it is essential that clinicians have objective guidance about appropriate use and indications. The page emphasizes that although numerous studies exist, they are extremely varied by strain, dose, route, methods, and reporting of end points and outcomes, most involve a relatively small number of patients, and conclusions from meta-analyses or systematic reviews can be misleading when heterogeneous studies or probiotic strains are grouped together inappropriately.

### Acceptability, tolerability, and estimates of putative treatment effects of probiotics as adjunctive treatment in patients with depression: a randomized clinical trial [^4a77cfd9]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 60% of people with major depressive disorder (MDD) experience some degree of nonresponse to first-line treatments, and approximately one-third continue to experience symptoms despite further treatment. Increasing understanding of the involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of MDD has made it a promising target for novel treatments, such as probiotics.

In a 2021 meta-analysis of 7 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) including 404 patients, we found that probiotics appear to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms when administered adjunctively to antidepressants. However, several RCTs to date have not provided sufficient tolerability data, while others report poor adherence or retention. Therefore, further safety and efficacy data are needed for probiotics to be considered a viable treatment option in clinical practice.

S. boulardii as Probiotic

Since the 1950s, S. boulardii has been used internationally and extensively as a probiotic. S. boulardii is a live yeast that has been lyophilized and is available in 250-mg capsules for adults. The probiotic may be prescribed as 1–2 capsules to be taken 1–2×/day. In the United States, S. boulardii is marketed as a dietary supplement. The product package displays the following structure/function claims: 1) maintains the balance of the intestinal flora, 2) keeps intestines functioning well, and 3) promotes intestinal health.

### The pros, cons, and many unknowns of probiotics [^89129da2]. Nature Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Consumption of over-the-counter probiotics for promotion of health and well-being has increased worldwide in recent years. However, although probiotic use has been greatly popularized among the general public, there are conflicting clinical results for many probiotic strains and formulations. Emerging insights from microbiome research enable an assessment of gut colonization by probiotics, strain-level activity, interactions with the indigenous microbiome, safety and impacts on the host, and allow the association of probiotics with physiological effects and potentially useful medical indications. In this Perspective, we highlight key advances, challenges and limitations in striving toward an unbiased interpretation of the large amount of data regarding over-the-counter probiotics, and propose avenues to improve the quality of evidence, transparency, public awareness and regulation of their use.

Safety

Total and drug-related TEAEs were reported in a small number of patients (18.6% and 8.0%, respectively) (Table 3). Common TEAEs included flatulence (3.2%) and cough (2.7%). No deaths, serious TEAEs, or discontinuations due to a TEAE occurred in any patient taking the probiotic blend. However, 1 patient experienced worsening flatulence, resulting in the probiotic blend being withdrawn, and study discontinuation was documented due to an AE.

### Comparison of publication of pediatric probiotic vs antibiotic trials registered on clinicalTrials.gov [^792c58d1]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Data Extraction and Definitions

Two reviewers from a group of 3 (M.R. K.L. or N.L.) extracted data independently into a standardized database that was piloted with the first 10 eligible studies and subsequently refined before completing extraction for the remaining studies. If discrepancies occurred, the 2 reviewers attempted to resolve them; if discrepancies remained, a third reviewer (S.B.F.) was consulted.

Study completion was the date when participants were no longer being examined or treated (ie, final visit had occurred), as stated in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. When this data field was incomplete, the estimated date of completion was extracted. Study duration was the interval from study start to completion dates. Data extractors classified the study purpose based on the following predefined criteria: therapeutic studies used an investigational agent to improve a specified medical condition; prophylactic studies evaluated investigational agent use for preventative purposes; safety/tolerability studies determined adverse effects associated with the investigational agent; and basic science studies were designed to assess pharmacokinetic properties. Data extractors classified the comparison group as placebo, standard care if the study described comparison to standard of care treatment, separate intervention if the comparison was another therapeutic agent, or alternate dosing if the trial compared alternative methods of administration, timing, or dosing of the intervention.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the role of probiotics in the management of gastrointestinal disorders [^ce741b15]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Probiotics across gastrointestinal conditions — evidence limitations and use statements include the following: Based on the accompanying technical review, the current evidence suggests that certain probiotic strains or combinations may prevent C difficile infections for adults and children on antibiotic treatment; however, the quality of evidence was low and the reporting of harms was not always consistent, so it would be reasonable to select not to use probiotics in those with severe illnesses or immunosuppression. For children with acute gastroenteritis in North America, the current evidence does not support the use of probiotics. The authors highlight significant heterogeneity between studies, variability in the probiotic strains studied, and a lack of consistent harms reporting and product manufacturing details that prohibit true comparisons and decrease feasibility for patients. The technical review found a significant knowledge gap in treatment of C difficile and similar knowledge gaps in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, and these guidelines will undergo review and consideration for an update within 3–5 years or earlier if practice-changing evidence becomes available.

### The international scientific association for probiotics and prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^9ea06d41]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Safety measures for synbiotics

Prebiotics and probiotics tested to date have a strong safety record –, and synbiotics formulated with them might also be presumed safe for the same intended uses. However, novel formulations must be suitably assessed for safety. Unfortunately, historically, many probiotic and prebiotic intervention trials have not adequately reported the types and frequency of AEs or serious AEs, perhaps owing to expectations that, as food ingredients, these products were inherently safe or that AEs could be due to failure to comply with norms for reporting harms in RCTs. Nonetheless, clear guidance for reporting AEs and serious AEs is provided by CONSORTand these standards should be followed. Describing such events as "unrelated to the study product", without justification for this statement, is unacceptable.

A systematic review of 384 interventions involving prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics found that no safety-related data were reported in 37% of the RCTs and 89 studies only used generic statements to describe AEs. Up to 98% of studies did not provide a definition of AEs or serious AEs, the number of participant withdrawals due to AEs, or the number of AEs and serious AEs per study group. Taken together, these results are evidence that some studies inadequately collect or report data on AEs. van den Nieuwboer and colleagues,– reviewed the AEs reported in studies with probiotic and synbiotic interventions and classified them according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events system; they found that the incidence of AEs in each category was either no different from or often lower in the control groups than in the treatment group.

Thorough safety assessment of a synergistic synbiotic requires consideration that the added microorganism will express enhanced functionality in the presence of a targeted substrate such as improved growth or altered metabolic or physiological activity in vivo. This aspect suggests that safety assessments conducted on the live microorganism in isolation might not be sufficient to enable a conclusion about its safety when paired with a substrate that alters physiology or might in effect alter the dose delivered in vivo. Implications of such an interaction should be considered when assessing the safety of synergistic synbiotics.

Designing a clinical study on probiotics

The value of well-controlled and well-designed human trials to elucidate probiotic efficacy is self-evident. However, the current heightened scrutiny from regulatory authorities on health benefit claims made on packaging and in advertising, combined with strict interpretations regarding what constitutes drug research, requires carefully weighing regulatory issues when designing and launching probiotic studies for food or supplement uses. Many issues worth addressing in the planning stages by both researchers and study sponsors are described in box 1.

Box 1
Questions to consider before designing, conducting and reporting human studies on probiotics

Will the study be performed among healthy subjects or in a disease population? Foods and dietary supplements are products generally intended for the healthy population. Therefore, trials designed to support claims about this category of products should be conducted on subjects who are representative of the healthy general population. If the target is a disease state, then the study must be performed in an appropriately selected study population representative of that disorder, and the study should conform to the standards of a pharmaceutical product.
What is the regulatory approach to health benefit claims in your jurisdiction on the type of product you intend to market? Will the product be a food, supplement, drug or other? Efficacy standards, appropriate study end points, target populations and risk assessment all vary for the different categories of product, and the clinical research programme needs to reflect these differences.
If seeking support for a claim for a probiotic food or supplement, what precisely is the claim and will it be supported by the study that you propose? The primary end point in the research study should be as close as possible to the benefit that will be communicated. Outcomes must be clear and measurable, and the study protocol should preferably involve a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. The selected placebo must be very similar to the probiotic food in terms of nutritional profile, taste, texture, colour and flavour, but should be devoid of the probiotic strains.
Has the strain(s) of choice been adequately characterised, in terms of its genome, in vitro properties and in vivo activities, and ability to survive transit through the gastrointestinal tract? Thorough strain characterisation is critical to a full understanding of the substance being studied, and also to ensure the ease of repetition of the study by other research groups.
Has the proposed formulation been shown to retain viability and efficacy for the duration of its proposed shelf life and in the environment in which it is likely to be marketed?
Has a plausible rationale been developed for the use of this/ these particular strain/strains in this indication? Although a confirmed mechanism of action is not considered essential for functional food ingredients (or drugs, for that matter), a plausible rationale is preferred.
Has the optimal target population been clearly defined for this particular probiotic and the specific outcome you plan to modify? If the target population is some subset of the general population for a food or supplement, it is important to document this.
What dose will be tested? Is there any indication of an effective dose from previous studies? The dose used in the study must be high enough to confer the benefit, but not so high as to make the product commercially untenable. Since the product dose must match the dose in the human trial showing benefit, dose used in the study is an important consideration.

### Acceptability, tolerability, and estimates of putative treatment effects of probiotics as adjunctive treatment in patients with depression: a randomized clinical trial [^ce5da85b]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are probiotics an acceptable, tolerable, and potentially efficacious adjunctive treatment for depression?

Findings

In this pilot randomized clinical trial including 49 participants, daily probiotic intake for 8 weeks resulted in greater improvements in depressive and anxiety symptoms compared with placebo.

Meaning

The acceptability, tolerability, and estimated effect sizes on key clinical outcomes are promising and encourage further investigation of probiotics as adjunctive treatment for people with major depressive disorder in a definitive efficacy trial.

Probiotics and Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy — recommendation and evidence: Recommendation 12 states, "There is insufficient evidence to suggest that the use of probiotic therapy improves the efficacy or tolerability of H. pylori eradication therapy (conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence)". A network meta-analysis included data from 40 studies and 8,924 patients and observed a modest benefit for eradication (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01–1.19) and lower total side effects (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.39–0.56), but there was significant heterogeneity across regimens and formulations, and to date no high-quality RCTs have been reported from North America. The analysis also noted that probiotic duration greater than 2 weeks and combining probiotics with BQT were associated with higher eradication rates compared with shorter durations and non-BQT combinations.

### Clinical efficacy of probiotics: review of the evidence with focus on children [^f6e59a94]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Probiotics are marketed in several countries and widely used by pediatric health care providers. Although probiotics can be helpful for specific disorders, they have been broadly prescribed for disorders without clear evidence to support their use. Furthermore, in certain specific conditions, probiotics cause clinical deterioration. This report is a review and evaluation of the evidence or lack thereof to support a beneficial effect of probiotic agents in a variety of pediatric conditions and to review the safety and potential adverse events that may be encountered when using probiotics. It is also important to emphasize that probiotics are highly heterogeneous with differences in composition, biological activity, and dose among the different probiotic preparations.

3.4 Assessment of study quality

Of the 42 RCTs (and 45 treatment arms) included in the systematic review, six types of bias were evaluated (Supplementary appendix Fig. 1). Most (98%) had an overall low risk of bias. We were unable to perform a sub-group analysis comparing efficacy of specific probiotic strains done in low-risk versus high-risk bias trials, as only one trial had a high risk of overall bias.46 Within bias domains, most high risk bias ratings were due to two reasons: 48% did not report if the study group allocator was blinded and 31% did not report the method of randomization used. Of the other domains of study bias (performance, detection, attrition, reporting and other), most were rated of low bias in each of these domains.

3.5 Safety

Of the 42 RCTs reviewed, seven (17%) did not report any adverse reaction (AE) data (Supplementary appendix Table 3), while 17 (40%) only included a statement 'No adverse reactions were noted in the study', but did not provide further data on frequency by study group or by type of adverse reaction. Three (7%) RCTs only reported total adverse reactions, but not by study group. Only 15 (36%) of the RCTs reported adverse event data by study group (probiotic versus placebo). With the exception of one RCT, there were no significant difference in the frequency or types of mild-moderate AEs in probiotic versus control groups. The most common types of reported adverse reactions were mild gastrointestinal complaints (69%) or rash (15%). Infrequent serious AEs associated with probiotic use (vertigo) was reported in one trialand two trials reported serious AEs (hospitalization or not described) in the placebo group.

### Regulatory oversight and safety of probiotic use [^1b6e7342]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Global Standards for Evaluation of Probiotics

In 2001, in an attempt to standardize the requirements needed to make health claims regarding probiotic agents, the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization Expert Consultation on Evaluation of Health and Nutritional Properties of Probiotics developed guidelines for evaluating probiotics in food that could lead to the substantiation of health claims. The proposed guidelines recommend 1) identification of the genus and species of the probiotic strain by using a combination of phenotypic and genotypic tests as clinical evidence suggesting that the health benefits of probiotics may be strain specific, 2) in vitro testing to delineate the mechanism of the probiotic effect, and 3) substantiation of the clinical health benefit of probiotic agents with human trials. Additionally, safety assessment of the probiotic strain should at a minimum determine 1) patterns of antimicrobial drug resistance, 2) metabolic activities, 3) side effects noted in humans during clinical trials and after marketing, 4) toxin production and hemolytic potential if the probiotic strain is known to possess those properties, and 5) lack of infectivity in animal studies.

The Consultation recommends that specific health claims on labeling material on probiotic food items be allowed when sufficient scientific evidence is available and that the product manufacturer take responsibility for ensuring that an independent third party reviews and evaluates the scientific evidence. Since development of these guidelines, only a few manufacturers have conducted small, randomized, controlled studies in humans to prove efficacy and safety of their products. Until more stringent regulations are in place, when assessing therapeutic potential for a probiotic product, clinicians must weigh the available evidence as outlined above. In addition, the manufacturer should take on the responsibility (albeit not required by law) of providing guidance to consumers or clinicians about the type and extent of safety assessments that have been conducted on its products.

### ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified in children aged 4–18 years [^d9b21da8]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety: Reporting of safety data was adequate overall, but due to an overall lack of events, no GRADEd conclusions could be drawn for serious adverse event (SAEs) and withdrawal due to adverse event (WAEs). For total adverse events (TAEs), event rates were similar, but all events were reported in one study.

Certainty: For probiotics, the overall certainty of the evidence on efficacy outcomes was low. Strain‐specific evidence for L. rhamnosus in patients with IBS was of moderate certainty, and the overall risk of bias was low. Certainty was often downgraded due to magnitude imprecision and considerable heterogeneity between studies, the latter likely a result of the use of different strains and dosages, variant treatment durations, and definition of outcomes.

For synbiotics, the overall certainty of the evidence was very low. All efficacy outcomes were downgraded for risk of bias, as most favorable effects of synbiotics came from studies with high risk of bias on allocation and blinding domainsand on selective reporting and attrition. Strain‐specific evidence for the multistrain synbiotic was of low certainty due to very serious imprecision and serious risk of bias. Sensitivity analyses, excluding biased studies, removed any pre‐existing statistical significance from meta‐analyses. Inconsistency was present for all efficacy outcomes and was severe for pain intensity (I² = 90%), potentially due to methodological differences between studies, such as the use of different strains and treatment duration. Magnitude imprecision was also considerable, except for pain frequency, where this did not cross thresholds of a trivial effect.

The placebo will be indistinguishable to both participants and trial investigators. It will be stored and provided in exactly the same manner as the intervention product. Compliance A record of compliance for supplement ingestion will be completed by all participants. Following feedback from a research patient group, all participants will be offered any or all of the following steps in any combination to aid adherence to the product: Based on a previously reported, post-intervention change in serum endotoxin following probiotic supplementation in peritoneal dialysis patients, it was calculated that n = 44 was required to detect a significant difference between probiotic and placebo groups with 90% power and α = 0.05. Dropout rate A drop-out rate of 10% in line with previous studies is expected. This is also entirely in-keeping with previous experience of interventional studies in the haemodialysis population which show a 10–20% drop out rate due to death, transplantation and non-adherence. Main assessments will take place over one or more sessions dependent on patient preference. Blood and saliva samples will be taken at the start of dialysis, eliminating the need for additional venepuncture; relevant demographic data will be extracted from medical records throughout the trial and also collected from participants prior to their usual haemodialysis appointment.

Several important practical uncertainties prohibit a formal recommendation for their routine use in North America, and studies from North America are clearly needed along with clarity on probiotic strains, dosages, durations, and combinations with antibiotics that might benefit H. pylori treatment efficacy and/or tolerability.

### ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified in children aged 4–18 years [^d5cbff41]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN pediatric AP-DGBIs — probiotics and synbiotics — The GDG has made GRADE recommendations about some specific probiotic/synbiotic preparations, but other preparations do not have sufficient evidence at a strain level to support such recommendations due to low study numbers and variable outcomes. The GDG recognizes that many probiotic and synbiotic preparations are readily available without prescription and are often used by members of the public for abdominal complaints, yet evidence was not consistent, and this limited an overall class recommendation. It is suggested that if families and other health professionals are motivated to consider the use of such agents that they should be monitored for efficacy and safety in line with other active therapies and within a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach tailored to the individual patient; this should not be considered unless patients have symptoms refractory to a large number of other therapy options that were delivered with good compliance, and if used, limiting use when efficacy is not demonstrated is mandatory.

### Association of a probiotic to a Helicobacter pylori eradication regimen does not increase efficacy or decreases the adverse effects of the treatment: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^612028b5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Considering the fact that the use of a probiotic agent also adds more complexity to the process as it increases treatment duration, the benefit of attaining a lower incidence of adverse effects or higher eradication effectiveness with longer treatment duration is debatable, especially because the difference did not reach statistical significance, as also stated by Medeiros et al.

However if probiotics can reduce the adverse effects of H. pylori eradication it could enable greater adherence to treatment and could increase the eradication rate by intention to treat.

Thus it is necessary to seek other probiotic combinations or other presentations or other dosages or other treatment duration to achieve these goals.

4 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SAFETY

Most clinical trials have reported minimal adverse effects of probiotic supplementation. However, clinicians should be aware that certain probiotics pose certain risks. A previous study identified that patients with bacteraemia occurred, and the bacterial strain isolated from the patient's bloodstream matched the probiotic strain they were taking. Although the risk of bacteraemia is low, caution is advised when prescribing probiotics to immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy or premature infants. Although systemic inflammation may worsen due to the intake of probiotics, no serious concern was reported in the studies included in this review as long as probiotics were administered in the range of approximately 1 × 10⁹/day to 1 × 10¹¹/day (Table 1).

Another concern is whether the bacterial strains that make up probiotics can colonise the host intestine after ingestion. To address this, it is essential to analyse faecal samples for the absence of bacteria after discontinuation of probiotic administration. However, no such investigations were conducted in these trials. Two studies included follow‐up periods after the cessation of probiotic administration, with one study reporting that the improvement in glycaemic control diminished following discontinuation. This observation indicates that probiotics do not induce permanent intestinal colonisation.

### Probiotic foods and drugs: impact of US regulatory status on design of clinical trials [^f081372c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Probiotics have been in widespread use since ancient times and are increasingly being consumed to maintain health and to prevent and treat a wide range of conditions. In the United States, probiotics are considered to be foods or biologics, depending on their intended use. This article addresses the similarities and differences between approaches to conducting clinical trials of probiotics as foods (which leads to health claims) or as biologics (which leads to therapeutic claims). Most probiotics are manufactured as foods, which makes it challenging for academic investigators in the United States to meet the requirements of an Investigational New Drug application that enables them to study the therapeutic effects of these novel agents. Although it is important to ensure the safety and quality of probiotic products, there also may be value in adapting the US Food and Drug Administration's Guidance for Industry for Botanical Products to probiotic products, in part to allow the research agenda to move forward with products for which there are no safety concerns.

The AGA process for developing clinical practice guidelines follows the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and best practices as outlined by the National Academy of Science (formerly Institute of Medicine), and A priori, the Guideline Panel and methodologist identified and formulated clinically relevant questions about the use of probiotic formulations for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases (not prebiotic use). Each research question identified the population, intervention, comparison, and patient-important outcomes. Although the quality of evidence (Table 1) was a key factor in determining the strength of the recommendations (Table 2), the Panel also considered the balance between the benefits and harms of the interventions, as well as patients' values and preferences, resource use (ie, cost), health equity, acceptability, and feasibility (the Evidence to Decision Framework). The target audience for this guideline includes health care providers, dietitians, and patients, and the guidelines include recommendations for specific populations, including adults, children, and neonates. The panel prioritized conditions in which probiotics are commonly considered and focused on patient-important outcomes, stating they prioritized Clostridioides difficile–associated diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, infectious gastroenteritis, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and focused on patient-important outcomes, such as induction and maintenance of disease, treatment of disease, prevention of sepsis, and all-cause mortality. The authors also note feasibility limits, stating we were not able to assess the viability of each formulation reported in the studies, as this information was not routinely available.

RESULTS

Participants

A total of 188 patients met eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the study. Findings were reported for the ITT population, which consisted of all enrolled patients (Fig. 2). Six patients discontinued the study due to: an adverse event (n = 1), protocol deviation (n = 1), loss to follow-up (n = 3), or other cause (n = 1). The mean (SD) age of patients was 44.1 (13.4) years, and 72.3% of patients were female. Patient demographics and baseline characteristics are described in Table 2.

### Recommendations to improve quality of probiotic systematic reviews with meta-analyses [^ef3d7c6e]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses often report conflicting results when assessing evidence for probiotic efficacy, partially because of the lack of understanding of the unique features of probiotic trials. As a consequence, clinical decisions on the use of probiotics have been confusing.

Objective

To provide recommendations to improve the quality and consistency of systematic reviews with meta-analyses on probiotics, so evidence-based clinical decisions can be made with more clarity.

Evidence Review

For this consensus statement, an updated literature review was conducted (January 1, 2020, to June 30, 2022) to supplement a previously published 2018 literature search to identify areas where probiotic systematic reviews with meta-analyses might be improved. An expert panel of 21 scientists and physicians with experience on writing and reviewing probiotic reviews and meta-analyses was convened and used a modified Delphi method to develop recommendations for future probiotic reviews.

Findings

A total of 206 systematic reviews with meta-analysis components on probiotics were screened and representative examples discussed to determine areas for improvement. The expert panel initially identified 36 items that were inconsistently reported or were considered important to consider in probiotic meta-analyses. Of these, a consensus was reached for 9 recommendations to improve the quality of future probiotic meta-analyses.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, the expert panel reached a consensus on 9 recommendations that should promote improved reporting of probiotic systematic reviews with meta-analyses and, thereby, assist in clinical decisions regarding the use of probiotics.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^36bf3c9c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — probiotics and prebiotic evidence in acute adult diarrheal infection — 21/168 (12.5%) compared with 102/165 (62%) in the placebo arms had diarrhea lasting greater than 4 days, and when combined, these studies achieved a 79% efficacy (relative risk: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.08–0.52). The one study with S. boulardii did not appear to confer any advantage on the primary or secondary outcomes evaluated. Based on the current evidence, there are not enough studies, which would support the recommended use of any particular probiotic product for treatment in acute adult diarrhea infection; although a statistically significant summary treatment effect was observed for Enterococcus LAB SF68, heterogeneity in results, theoretical safety concerns, and no recent studies with this product have been reported. While evidence supporting therapy of probiotics in treatment of acute diarrheal infection is lacking, there is supporting evidence for the role of probiotics in prevention of acute diarrhea associated with antibiotic use, with pooled results among 63 randomized controlled trials indicating a relative risk reduction of 0.58 and a number needed to treat of 13.

### Helping patients make informed choices about probiotics: a need for research [^b8d1103f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Applications of probiotics in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders are gaining acceptance among patients, despite evidence that probiotics can present substantial health risks, particularly for patients who are immunocompromised or seriously ill. Patients will likely formulate their attitudes and beliefs about probiotic therapies with reference to interpretive frameworks that compare probiotics with more familiar therapeutic modalities, including complementary and alternative medicines, pharmacological therapies, and gene-transfer technologies. Each of these frameworks highlights a different set of benefit-to-risk considerations regarding probiotic usage and reinforces extreme characterizations of both the therapeutic promise and peril of probiotics. Considerable effort may be required to help patients make informed choices about probiotic therapies.

### The international scientific association for probiotics and prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^2c6d4db8]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Designing a synbiotic trial

There are multiple ways to design a synbiotic trial intended to examine health effects in the target host. Here, we provide some recommendations based on the criteria established herein to demonstrate complementary or synergistic synbiotics. Pre-specified subgroup analyses should be considered based on the relevant clinical factors (such as sex and age), baseline gut microbiota factors, dietary factors (such as typical dietary fibre intake) or other relevant factors (such as responder analysis). The number of experimental groups or 'study arms' required to prove efficacy and support mechanistic understanding will depend on the existing level of evidence for the component live microorganism(s) and selectively utilized substrate(s) as well as the researchers' intent to determine whether components of the test mixture are complementary or acting as synergistic synbiotics (Table 2).

When selecting the study design and determining the duration of the intervention and (if applicable) of the wash-out period, general recommendations are difficult to make. Factors that will impact these decisions include the live microorganism dose and its ability to persist in situ as well as the characteristics of study subjects; for example, in elderly individuals or persons with slow intestinal transit time, a longer wash-out period could be required compared with a study conducted in younger individuals. Parallel arm designs would be appropriate for studies that aim to demonstrate improvements in metabolic health measures, such as of adiposity or glycaemic control, as these outcomes typically require longer-term interventions (that is, 12 weeks or more). Gut microbiota changes can be rapid (within days). Currently, changes in the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, are not accepted by regulatory bodies as measures of a health outcome.

Responders and non-responders among study participants in intervention studies with probiotics and prebiotics are commonly observed, which could justify including the probability of a positive response as a study end point. In the context of synbiotics, non-responders include individuals for whom little or no change in gut microbiota composition and/or clinical end point occurs compared with placebo. Various reasons for the non-responder phenotype include limited available niches for desired gut microorganisms (either native or introduced as probiotics), limited substrates to support microbial growth, host immune system expressing intolerance for specific microorganismsor a lack of specific microorganisms in the host microbiota. Although many scenarios of formulations for synbiotics can be conceived, we provide both actual and hypothetical examples to illustrate the concept (Box 2).

### Efficacy and safety of medical therapies in microscopic colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^00d36c8b]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Whilst our study explored treatment preference for histological remission, the number of RCTs that explored this outcome was very small and the CIs were very wide. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution until greater data are published in the literature. We also recommend future studies that explore whether histological remission should be an outcome to drive therapy, as this is currently uncertain – and subsequently not recommended by the European Guidelines.

The probiotic containing eight bacterial strains including Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus and the probiotic AB-CAP-10 ranked second for inducing and maintaining clinical remission, respectively. However, study numbers were small and results were non-significant; therefore, these results must be interpreted with a great deal of caution. In the RCT by Rohatgi et al.they demonstrated significantly reduced stool frequency, stool weight and diarrhoeal rate with the use of the probiotic containing eight bacterial strains but no significant improvement in stool consistency and abdominal pain. In the AB-CAP-10 study, 6/21 patients given probiotics had > 50% reduction in bowel frequency per week compared to 1/8 in the placebo group (p = 0.635) with no differences between treatments for changes in bowel frequency, stool consistency, stool weight, abdominal pain and bloating, or histopathology of biopsies from the sigmoid colon. Due to the very limited studies, probiotics have yet to demonstrate treatment efficacy and as such, they are not recommended for treating MC.

### Probiotics in the United States [^217a246d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Probiotics are live microbial products that have a defined health benefit. Scientific research has established that there are validated indications for the use of some probiotics available in the United States; however, in many cases, they are often used for conditions for which no benefit has been established. This article will review the uses of probiotics in the United States, as well as the current state of regulatory issues surrounding probiotics. Although the use and scientific understanding of probiotics are rapidly increasing, it is evident that there is a need to clarify the regulatory issues, which, at present, are unclear and subject to misinterpretation. In addition to efficacy, safety issues must be considered in determining when and how probiotics are to be used.

Although low-quality evidence suggested reduced clinical recurrence with mesalamine versus placebo (RR, 0.59; 95% CI: 0.43–0.82), the guideline notes substantial uncertainty for budesonide and probiotics and warns the main risk is disease recurrence by foregoing more effective therapies.

### Recommendations for probiotic use – 2008 [^f7ea5450]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics were published after a Yale University Workshop in 2005. A similar workshop was held in 2007, and the recommendations were updated and extended into other areas. The recommendations are graded into an "A", "B", "C" or no category based on the expert's opinion and review by the workshop participants. An "A" recommendation is made for acute childhood diarrhea, prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, preventing and maintaining remission in pouchitis, and in an immune response for the treatment and prevention of atopic eczema associated with cow's milk allergy. The group maintained several "B" recommendations in other areas of treating inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. Although there are significant studies in the "B" group, most "B" recommendations did not reach an "A" level because of some negative studies or a limited number of studies. Many reports in the "C" recommendations were significant but fell short of receiving stronger ratings because of the size of reported patient studies, and also the factors that limited categories to the "B" rating.

### A practical guide for probiotics applied to the case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the Netherlands [^0dbd1e53]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The efficacy of probiotics in preventing AAD also depends on the dose. A daily intake of at least 5 × 10⁹ CFU is associated with significant efficacy for AAD, and it has been shown that higher probiotic dose is linked to greater efficacy. Although only few dose-effect studies have been performed, they observe a positive correlation between dose and AAD risk.

Since so many factors can affect the efficacy of probiotics in prophylaxis, researchers should be rigorous in setting up clinical trials and in providing as much information as possible about them. Studies should report characteristics of the probiotic (strain, dose and duration of therapy), of the antibiotic (type of antibiotic, duration of the therapy) of the patients (age group, diagnosis) and accurate definitions of measured outcomes and adverse effects. In this way, results from different trials can be assessed, compared and used as a basis to formulate recommendations. Individual factors, that are not routinely monitored in clinical trials, may influence the incidence and gravity of side effects and the efficacy of probiotics. For example, each individual has their own unique microbiota, and the impact of a given antibiotic on the composition and stability of different microbial ecosystems can be different; therefore, a specific probiotic strain or combination of strains may not have the same efficacy for every person. Especially for some patients, for example those who are frequently treated with antibiotics such as elderly in care facilities, it is certainly worth being flexible and trying different probiotics until the most effective one has been found. Future research can guide the formulation of personalized therapies.

Summary

The effects of postbiotic supplementation have been studied mainly for fermented infant formulas and bacterial lysates. Overall, there is only limited evidence to suggest that these products provide a health benefit compared with non-postbiotic-containing formulas in the paediatric setting. The safety and potential harms of postbiotic interventions remain poorly explored and understood. Further multicentre studies are necessary to determine the effects and safety of different postbiotics.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of pouchitis and inflammatory pouch disorders [^059c232b]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Primary prevention of pouchitis with probiotics after IPAA for ulcerative colitis — The AGA makes no recommendation in favor of, or against, the use of probiotics for primary prevention of pouchitis (No recommendation, knowledge gap). Evidence identified 4 RCTs, with 1 RCT contributing no events, and meta-analysis showed the RR for development of pouchitis among patients receiving probiotics for prevention compared with placebo was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.05–0.62); the overall body of evidence was rated as very low certainty with very serious imprecision due to very low event rate, < 35, and strong concern for publication bias. In current practice, most patients undergoing IPAA for UC do not use a primary preventive strategy and most who develop pouchitis respond well (and rapidly) to an initial course of antibiotics, so the potential downside of not using prevention may be offset by the benefit of not taking a daily preventive therapy.

### Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults and children [^672857be]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence-based synopses of current evidence to make informed patient care decisions.

Objectives

Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality, when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations?Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non-drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations?

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared to placebo or active comparators were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

All RCTs and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparing probiotics to no therapy, placebo, or other prophylactic interventions were included. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

We included nine studies that involved 735 people in this review. Four studies compared probiotic with placebo, two compared probiotic with no treatment, two compared probiotics with antibiotics in patients with UTI, and one study compared probiotic with placebo in healthy women. All studies aimed to measure differences in rates of recurrent UTI. Our risk of bias assessment found that most studies had small sample sizes and reported insufficient methodological detail to enable robust assessment. Overall, there was a high risk of bias in the included studies which lead to inability to draw firm conclusions and suggesting that any reported treatment effects may be misleading or represent overestimates. We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo (6 studies, 352 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; I² = 23%) with wide confidence intervals, and statistical heterogeneity was low. No significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and antibiotic treated patients (1 study, 223 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33). The most commonly reported adverse effects were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation and vaginal symptoms. None of the included studies reported numbers of participants with at least one asymptomatic bacterial UTI, all-cause mortality or those with at least one confirmed case of bacteraemia or fungaemia. Two studies reported study withdrawal due to adverse events and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. One study reported withdrawal occurred in six probiotic participants (5.2%), 15 antibiotic participants (12.2%), while the second study noted one placebo group participant discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

Authors' Conclusions

No significant benefit was demonstrated for probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, but a benefit cannot be ruled out as the data were few, and derived from small studies with poor methodological reporting. There was limited information on harm and mortality with probiotics and no evidence on the impact of probiotics on serious adverse events. Current evidence cannot rule out a reduction or increase in recurrent UTI in women with recurrent UTI who use prophylactic probiotics. There was insufficient evidence from one RCT to comment on the effect of probiotics versus antibiotics.

### Perspectives from the society for pediatric research: probiotic use in urinary tract infections, atopic dermatitis, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea: an overview [^9d630f24]. Pediatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

However, in the 2020 American Gastroenterological Association's clinical practice guidelines on the use of probiotics, they do not comment on the use of probiotics for prevention of non- C. diff icile colitis. The authors do, however, offer a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence to use probiotics to prevent C. diff icile colitis in children on antibiotics.

Much like the prior two conditions discussed, the significant heterogeneity in the literature on the use of probiotics in AAD is problematic when making recommendations regarding their use. There are also additional clinical considerations regarding the clinical use of probiotics for AAD. First, most patients may need to pay for probiotics "out of pocket", which may present a financial burden. This concern is an important balancing measure to consider when deciding to initiate probiotics for the prevention of AAD, especially given that not every child given antibiotics will develop AAD. Overall, the number needed to treat to prevent AAD is approximately 11. While this is a reasonable number needed to treat, it is an important consideration when weighing the decision to prescribe probiotics for a patient for whom the cost of probiotics is prohibitive. Additionally, while probiotics are generally safe and well tolerated, there is the possibility that the increased complexity of the medication regimen may affect patient adherence with the antibiotic therapy. Indeed, the number of doses of medications has been demonstrated to be a factor in patient non-adherence with medication regimens in patients with chronic diseases. – Finally, there is little oversight of the production and quality of commercially available probiotics. This was highlighted in a study of 14 commercially available probiotics, which found that only 1 of the 14 products studied contained the exact organisms listed on the label.

Results

Trial population

From October 22, 2017 to June 1, 2018, 76 subjects were enrolled at six centers across the USA; 26, 27, and 23 individuals were randomly assigned to receive placebo, WBF-010, and WBF-011, respectively (figure 1). Baseline characteristics were generally similar across experimental arms in both intent-to-treat and per-protocol populations (table 1).

Safety

A total of 27 and 23 participants were exposed to two microbiome formulations, WBF-010 and WBF-011 for an average of 77 and 78 days, respectively. Online supplementary table S2 lists the adverse events, by system organ class, that occurred in ≥ 4% of subjects in any group throughout the period of study product administration. The intensity of all events was rated as mild to moderate by the investigators and occurred with lowest frequency in the WBF-011 group. All study products were well-tolerated with tolerability issues limited to gastrointestinal complaints (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), which were reported somewhat less frequently in the WBF-011 group (online supplementary table S2).

### Clinical efficacy of probiotics: review of the evidence with focus on children [^9e1d5a0c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Medium credibility.

Clinical efficacy of probiotics: review of the evidence with focus on children — this clinical report reviews and evaluates the evidence or lack thereof for beneficial effects of probiotic agents in pediatric conditions and examines safety and potential adverse events, noting that probiotics are highly heterogeneous and that in certain specific conditions probiotics cause clinical deterioration. Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health effect on the host, and in vitro studies suggest they act through several different mechanisms and can modulate the immune system. A variety of probiotic agents have been studied as single agents or combinations, including lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, saccharomyces, Escherichia coli and streptococci, but considerable differences exist among preparations, most studies have not been reproduced or confirmed, and in vitro effects may display opposite behavior in vivo. The authors state that understanding of use for children is just beginning and that considerably more supporting evidence is required; PubMed and MEDLINE searches were performed for all human trial studies related to probiotic therapy.

### Use of probiotics in gastrointestinal disorders: what to recommend? [^e9fb0e7f]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Perturbation of bacterial microflora of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may play an important role in the pathophysiology of some GI disorders. Probiotics have been used as a treatment modality for over a century. They may restore normal bacterial microflora and effect the functioning of the GI tract by a variety of mechanisms. Probiotics are not currently regulated and only few randomized controlled trials exist investigating their efficacy in different GI disorders. They are available in a variety of formulations and delivery systems making interpretation and comparison of studies even more difficult. The efficacy of probiotics, either as a single strain or a combination of probiotics, has been tested in antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile colitis, infectious diarrhea, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, pouchitis, and irritable bowel syndrome, among other disorders. Results of the studies are reviewed in this article and recommendations for probiotic use in these disorders are made. Although probiotics appear to be generally safe in an outpatient setting, the situation may be different in immunocompromised, hospitalized patients who may be at a greater risk of developing probiotic sepsis. No studies exist addressing the issue of safety specifically. Many questions regarding use of probiotics in GI disorders remain to be answered in future studies, such as most optimal doses, duration of treatment, physiological and immunological effects, efficacy of specific probiotics in specific disease states, and safety in debilitated patients.

IBS conventional FMT — evidence, benefits, and harms: We identified 11 RCTs in 671 patients with IBS; one trial was limited to post-infectious IBS only, 4 were diarrhea-predominant IBS and the other trials included a mix of subtypes, with studies including predominantly women with a mean age of 30–40 years and using a single donor in 9 trials and multiple donors in 2 trials. One trial with the FDA prespecified end point for IBS found symptom relief with donor FMT compared with control (61% vs 16%; RR, 3.70; 95% CI, 2.00–6.85), whereas most trials assessing IBS quality of life or symptom severity at 12 weeks found no improvement except for that same trial; route of FMT and donor type (single or multiple) did not change results.
