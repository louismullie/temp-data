## Question

A 63-year-old patient presents with lateral hip pain and point tenderness over the greater trochanter. The provider documents 'trochanteric bursitis' but does not specify laterality. What ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code to use for billing when the provider documents "trochanteric bursitis" without specifying laterality. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct ICD-10-CM category for trochanteric bursitis. Then, I should verify whether that category requires laterality and what the default is when laterality is unspecified. Next, I will check for any 7th-character requirements or placeholders. Finally, I will confirm the exact code and ensure it aligns with coding conventions and payer expectations.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic category. Trochanteric bursitis falls under bursitis of the hip, which in ICD-10-CM is categorized as M70.6, with subcategories for laterality and, in some cases, a 7th character for encounter type, so I need to keep that in mind as I proceed [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the laterality requirement. ICD-10-CM uses the final character to indicate laterality in musculoskeletal codes like M70.6, where 1 denotes right, 2 denotes left, and 3 denotes bilateral; if the side is not specified clinically, the unspecified variant should be used, and unspecified codes are only to be used when no more specific option exists, which fits this scenario [^5e1c6ada] [^c5bd4139].

> I should confirm whether a 7th character is needed here. Hold on, I should verify the category-specific rules: M70.6 does not require a 7th character for encounter type, so I do not need to add a placeholder X in this case, which simplifies the code selection to the base five-character format when laterality is unspecified [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the appropriate ICD-10-CM code for trochanteric bursitis without documented laterality is M70.60, where M70.6 identifies trochanteric bursitis and the final 0 indicates unspecified laterality. If the side were known, I would use M70.61 for right or M70.62 for left, and if bilateral, M70.63 would apply, but since laterality is not specified, M70.60 is correct [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the clinician meant "greater trochanteric pain syndrome" rather than true bursitis? I need to ensure I'm not over-coding. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome is a broader clinical entity that includes bursitis, gluteal tendinopathy, and IT band friction; however, when the documented diagnosis is "trochanteric bursitis", coding to M70.6 is still appropriate, and if the clinician truly intended GTPS, some clinicians use M25.559 for pain in unspecified hip, though that is less specific than M70.60 for bursitis; given the documentation here, M70.60 remains the most accurate reflection of the recorded diagnosis [^notfound] [^4d411868].

> Final answer: M70.60 — Trochanteric bursitis, unspecified hip [^notfound].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for trochanteric bursitis without specified laterality is **M70.60**. This code specifically denotes trochanteric bursitis of the **unspecified hip**. If laterality is documented later, use M70.61 for the right hip or M70.62 for the left hip; if bilateral, use M70.63. Accurate coding supports appropriate billing and tracking of this common cause of lateral hip pain [^notfound].

---

## ICD-10-CM code for trochanteric bursitis

The ICD-10-CM code for trochanteric bursitis is **M70.6**, with subcategories for laterality:

- **M70.60**: Trochanteric bursitis, unspecified hip
- **M70.61**: Trochanteric bursitis, right hip
- **M70.62**: Trochanteric bursitis, left hip
- **M70.63**: Trochanteric bursitis, bilateral hips

Given that the provider did not specify laterality, the appropriate code is **M70.60**.

---

## Clinical significance of trochanteric bursitis

Trochanteric bursitis is inflammation of the bursa over the greater trochanter, causing lateral hip pain and tenderness [^65ce6ee1]. It is common in middle-aged and older adults, particularly women, and often coexists with gluteal tendinopathy or IT band friction [^4d411868]. Management is typically conservative, including NSAIDs, physical therapy, and corticosteroid injections; surgery is reserved for refractory cases [^8933b734] [^abacd0df].

---

## Importance of accurate ICD-10-CM coding

Accurate ICD-10-CM coding is essential for:

- **Reimbursement**: Ensures appropriate billing and reduces claim denials [^cd4941f1].
- **Clinical documentation**: Provides precise records for patient care and follow-up [^489ad2ef].
- **Epidemiological tracking**: Enables analysis of disease prevalence and treatment outcomes [^439852f4].

---

## Conclusion

The correct ICD-10-CM code for trochanteric bursitis without specified laterality is **M70.60**. Accurate coding supports billing, documentation, and epidemiological tracking of this common cause of lateral hip pain.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Editorial commentary: an optimal classification system to guide prognosis and treatment in greater trochanteric pain syndrome: now we' re speaking the same language [^a28c0d80]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

The optimal classification system in arthroscopic and related surgery research and clinical practice should be clinically relevant, descriptive, reproducible, simple, inexpensive, safe, and widely applicable. For the hip, classification systems that characterize intra-articular disorders like femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome, dysplasia, labral tears, and articular cartilage disease predominate the literature. Recently, awareness of peritrochanteric and other extra-articular disorders has increasingly led to greater recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of what has been historically known as "just bursitis". These disorders are far more complex and include greater trochanteric pain syndrome, the spectrum of gluteal tendon pathology, greater trochanteric bursitis, snapping iliotibial band (external coxa saltans), and greater trochanteric-ischial impingement. The utility of an intraoperative greater trochanteric pain syndrome classification system has now been proven using prospectively collected data, assimilating a decade-long eligibility period following open or endoscopic treatment of peritrochanteric disorders with a minimum two-year follow-up using validated patient-reported outcome scores. This classification guides prognosis and treatment, exactly as an optimal orthopedic classification system should do.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome: a review of anatomy, diagnosis and treatment [^e3ac7756]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a term used to describe chronic pain overlying the lateral aspect of the hip. This regional pain syndrome, once described as trochanteric bursitis, often mimics pain generated from other sources, including, but not limited to myofascial pain, degenerative joint disease, and spinal pathology. The incidence of greater trochanteric pain is reported to be approximately 1.8 patients per 1000 per year with the prevalence being higher in women, and patients with coexisting low back pain, osteoarthritis, iliotibial band tenderness, and obesity. Symptoms of GTPS consist of persistent pain in the lateral hip radiating along the lateral aspect of the thigh to the knee and occasionally below the knee and/or buttock. Physical examination reveals point tenderness in the posterolateral area of the greater trochanter. Most cases of GTPS are self-limited with conservative measures, such as physical therapy, weight loss, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and behavior modification, providing resolution of symptoms. Other treatment modalities include bursa or lateral hip injections performed with corticosteroid and local anesthetic. More invasive surgical interventions have anecdotally been reported to provide pain relief when conservative treatment modalities fail.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^a4f0d40f]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Course

The patient was diagnosed with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) that included an inflammatory component as evidenced by bursitis seen on ultrasound. She was educated on hip abductor strengthening exercises, but she was not interested in performing the exercises regularly. Instead she requested a corticosteroid injection, so an ultrasound-guided greater trochanteric bursa injection was performed by the ultrasound-trained physiatrist.

### How accurate is ICD-10 coding for revision total knee arthroplasty? [^c53a254b]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) came into effect in October 2015. The new procedural codes (ICD-10-PCS) were designed to specify granular aspects of the procedure, including laterality and revised components. This specificity could improve data collection in institutional databases, large registries, and administrative claims data. Given these possible applications, this study's purpose was to assess the accuracy of ICD-10-PCS coding for revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA).

Methods

This multicenter retrospective analysis utilized the rTKA databases at four academic medical centers for all aseptic rTKAs between October 1, 2015 and July 3, 2019. Operative reports were reviewed to determine laterality and revised components (tibial, femoral, liner, and patellar component), which were then compared with the ICD-10-PCS codes associated with the billing records. Proper coding required both component removal and replacement codes. The correct series of removal and replacement codes was determined using the American Joint Replacement Registry's guidelines.

Results

In total, 1906 rTKAs were examined, and 98.0% had at least one proper ICD-10-PCS code, indicating an rTKA had occurred. Coding for components replaced was correct in 76.3% of cases. When examining both removal and replacement codes, accuracy dropped to 57.0%.

Conclusion

Nearly 25% of rTKA procedures were incorrectly coded for replaced components, and over 40% were incorrectly coded for removed and replaced components. ICD-10-PCS codes can accurately identify that an rTKA has occurred; however, the inaccuracy in identifying which specific components were revised should prompt further evaluation of the coding process before utilizing ICD-10-PCS codes to report granular rTKA data.

### Beyond the greater trochanter: a pictorial review of the pelvic bursae [^3a36baf6]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Review the MRI appearance of different bursae located throughout the pelvis, including the pertinent osseous and musculotendinous anatomy.

Materials and Methods

Bursae are potential spaces that reduce friction between opposed moving components which can become inflamed, clinically mimicking internal derangement.

Results

This series illustrates the most common as well as lesser-known pelvic bursae. Common causes of bursitis including overuse, trauma, and infection are presented.

Conclusion

Multiple bursae are located throughout the pelvis. It is important for radiologists to recognize bursitis as a potential etiology of pain and be familiar with their anatomical locations in order to guide appropriate management.

Approach to Evaluation and Management

Optimal management of patients presenting with lateral hip and/or thigh pain requires a systematic approach for accurate diagnosis of underlying pathology contributing to symptoms. This section describes evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the most common causes of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults.

Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (GTPS)

GTPS is defined as pain and tenderness to palpation over the greater trochanter (GT). Until the early 2000s this entity was most frequently called "greater trochanteric bursitis"; however, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that approximately 20% of people with tenderness over the GT have imaging-proven bursitis. Non-inflammatory pathology is often seen on imaging, such as gluteal tendonosis, gluteal tendon tears, and/or enthesopathy at the GT. GTPS is often caused by relative weakness of the hip abductor muscles, especially the gluteus medius, which leads to excessive gluteal tendon shearing over the GT and eventual tendonopathy.

GTPS often coexists with other musculoskeletal lumbopelvic and hip conditions. Additionally, it is often a secondary pain generator resulting from suboptimal biomechanics. In fact, in people with low back pain, GTPS has a prevalence of up to 45%, and it commonly occurs in people with knee OA, as well. GTPS is more common in women, possibly because they have a wider pelvis structure. It may be associated with nighttime pain when lying on the affected side, pain with prolonged standing, and pain or paresthesias radiating down the lateral thigh along the course of the iliotibial band. Table 2 reviews additional common pain characteristics which can be elicited during the patient history to help distinguish GTPS from other conditions.

### Response to: rho et al. "Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain" [^b74913ce]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Dear Editor,

It was with great interest that we reviewed the article by Rho et al. "Deconstructing Chronic Low Back pain in the Older Adult-Step by Step Evidence and Expert-Based Recommendations for Evaluation and Treatment. Part VIII: Lateral Hip and Thigh Pain". We applaud the authors for addressing this common issue of lateral hip pain, and their thoughtfulness and evidence supported discussion regarding the diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) rather than the commonly used and inaccurate term "greater trochanteric bursitis". The authors nicely review the literature summarizing that there is a lack of findings on MRI and ultrasound, as well as in histological evidence to support the diagnosis of "bursitis" and/or "tendinitis" in the vast majority of these patients. Additionally, we fully agree with the authors' noting that there is a lack of inflammatory findings in patients suffering from GTPS and that effective treatment consists of strengthening the weak hip abductors that are often noted in these patients. We have found this to be true in the patients we have treated with GTPS. The authors also note the deficiency of evidence for the use of corticosteroid injections and both the potential systemic side effects and the now well-known toxic effects of corticosteroids to tenocytes, which they note "can potentially contribute to progressive tendinopathy and partial tears".

### High prevalence of lumbosacral pathology in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome [^34800369]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To establish prevalence of lumbar and lumbosacral pathologies in patients with hip abductor tendon disorders.

Methods

A retrospective review of patients' charts was conducted over a 5-year period, January 2013 to October 2018, using the S76 and M76 International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. Patients with symptomatic and radiologically confirmed hip abductor tendon disorders (partial and full-thickness tear of the gluteus medius tear with or without gluteus minimus tearing) were included in the study. No exclusion criteria were applied. Patient medical history was examined for concurrent diagnoses of lumbar and lumbosacral pathologies (radiculopathy, lumbar stenosis, degenerative disc disease, and neurogenic claudication).

Results

One-hundred and three patients with hip abductor tendon disorders were identified. Forty-seven (45.6%) patients had low-grade partial abductor tears, while 56 (54.4%) of patients had a high-grade partial or complete abductor tear. Fifty (48.5%) patients carried a concomitant lumbosacral diagnosis, with 20 (19.4%) patients being diagnosed with lumbar stenosis and 45 (43.7%) being diagnosed with degenerative disc disease.

Conclusion

Patients with hip abductor tendon disorders were associated with a high prevalence of underlying lumbar and lumbosacral pathologies. Nevertheless, a causal relationship between these conditions cannot be established.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^e0159918]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM coding — Macular degeneration, dry corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.51 and to ICD-10 CM Nonexudative AMD H35.31-; macular degeneration, wet corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.52 and to ICD-10 CM Exudative AMD H35.32-; macular drusen corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.57 and to ICD-10 CM Drusen (degenerative) of macula H35.36-. AMD does not require laterality indicators. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of ICD-10 CM codes indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Association of sex with risk of 2-year revision among patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty [^b1c22db9]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has strengths. We were able to capture information about the surgically treated side (laterality) through the use of detailed ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes. Also, the robust sample size allowed for more generalized conclusions about the association of sex with revision rates in the US population.

This study also has limitations. First, the coding system used limited the clinical significance of our findings because it can be subject to errors and did not allow us to exclude THA procedures in which large-head or metal-on-metal hip replacements were used. Second, we were not able to adjust for differences in specific implant designs or account for the effect of femoral head size; prior researchhas suggested an association between use of smaller femoral head sizes and a higher risk of revision in women compared with men. Third, we were not able to assess differences in the underlying condition necessitating the surgery or the reason for revision, such as aseptic loosening. Fourth, we were also unable to account for surgical approach; a prior studyshowed that the direct anterior approach was associated with lower rates of dislocation and revision because of instability, 1 of the main contributors to early implant failure. Fifth, the timing of our study was limited to short-term follow-up because ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes were only available from October 2015 onward. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision procedure codes used before that time did not distinguish laterality.

### Editorial commentary: hip trochanteric bursitis and femoroacetabular impingement: the arthroscope is only the tool [^f0825bea]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Lateral hip pain is debilitating, with pain located at or around the greater trochanter, and trochanteric bursitis is one of the conditions that are part of the greater trochanter pain syndrome. At times, trochanteric bursitis coexists with femoroacetabular impingement. In such cases, the arthroscope is used as a soft tissue endoscope facilitating debridement of the bursa and functional lengthening of the fascia lata. Coupled with appropriate femoroacetabular impingement treatment and rehabilitation, the procedure allows predictable functional results.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^abacd0df]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

An examination of the relative strengths and weaknesses of this study is needed to put the results in context. Firstly, this is the only controlled study that has evaluated trochanteric bursa injections. The absence of controlled studies is somewhat surprising, considering that a recent audit found that the number of procedures billed to Medicare, the largest health insurance supplier in the United States, under the current procedural terminology code pertaining to "major joint or bursa injection", which includes trochanteric bursa injections, far exceeds that of any other pain management intervention. Secondly, our outcomes are less positive than several others reported for trochanteric bursa injections. However, all previous studies evaluating trochanteric bursa injections were unblinded and uncontrolled, which tends to accentuate expectation bias. Nevertheless, larger, placebo controlled studies are needed to better ascertain the efficacy of trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injections.

Another concern about this study stems from the fact that only 39 of the 65 participants had outcome data recorded at three months. This was justified on the basis of ethical concerns stemming from pilot data showing that less than 10% of patients with "negative" outcomes at one month would experience a "positive" outcome three months post-injection with no intervening treatment. However, not carrying over one month treatment failures limits the long term conclusions on efficacy and differences between treatment groups that can be reached from these results.

The implications of this study may also extend beyond the sphere of "hip pathology", as they suggest that more sophisticated and expensive treatments do not necessarily translate into higher quality care or better outcomes. As an example, we need only examine the historical record of treatment for back pain, where rapidly evolving technological advances have not resulted in parallel declines in prevalence or in disability claims.

Conclusions

Fluoroscopically guided trochanteric bursa injections were not associated with superior outcomes to injections guided by landmarks alone in patients who presented with clinical greater trochanteric pain syndrome. Referral to a pain treatment centre should be reserved for patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome who fail landmark guided injections and conservative treatment. Because a single study of this size is not sufficient to change practice, further studies are needed both to confirm the efficacy of trochanteric bursa injections in greater trochanteric pain syndrome and to determine which patients may benefit from each approach.

### Precision or pitfall? Evaluating the accuracy of ICD-10 coding for cemented total hip arthroplasty: a multicenter study [^a0964464]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) was adopted in the U.S. in 2015. Proponents of the ICD-10-PCS have stated that its granularity allows for a more accurate representation of the types of procedures performed by including laterality, joint designation, and more detailed procedural data. However, other researchers have expressed concern that the increased number of codes adds further complexity that leads to inaccurate and inconsistent coding, rendering registry and research data based on ICD-10-PCS codes invalid and inaccurate. We aimed to determine the accuracy of the ICD-10-PCS for identifying cemented fixation in primary total hip arthroplasty (THA).

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all cemented primary THAs performed at 4 geographically diverse, academic medical centers between October 2015 and October 2020. Cemented fixation was identified from the ICD-10-PCS coding for each procedure. The accuracy of an ICD-10-PCS code relative to the surgical record was determined by postoperative radiograph and chart review, and cross-referencing with institution-level coding published by the American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR) was also performed.

Results

A total of 552 cemented THA cases were identified within the study period, of which 452 (81.9%) were correctly coded as cemented with the ICD-10-PCS. The proportion of cases that were correctly coded was 187 of 260 (72%) at Institution A, 158 of 185 (85%) at Institution B, 35 of 35 (100%) at Institution C, and 72 of 72 (100%) at Institution D. Of the 480 identified cemented THA cases at 3 of the 4 institutions, 403 (84%) were correctly reported as cemented to the AJRR (Institution A, 185 of 260 cases [71%]; Institution B, 185 of 185 [100%]; and Institution C, 33 of 35 [94%]). Lastly, of these 480 identified cemented THA cases, 317 (66%) were both correctly coded with the ICD-10-PCS and correctly reported as cemented to the AJRR.

Conclusions

Our findings revealed existing discrepancies within multiple institutional data sets, which may lead to inaccurate reporting by the AJRR and other registries that rely on ICD-10-PCS coding. Caution should be exercised when utilizing ICD-10 procedural data to evaluate specific details from administrative claims databases as these inaccuracies present inherent challenges to data validity and interpretation.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^2d398385]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The principal finding of this study suggests that the use of fluoroscopy does not improve outcomes in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome who receive corticosteroid injections. This is consistent with our secondary finding showing comparable success rates for intra-bursal and extra-bursal injections. The results from this pilot study should not be surprising considering that most patients clinically diagnosed as having greater trochanteric pain syndrome have no radiological evidence of bursal inflammation. Even among patients with actual "trochanteric bursitis", many develop secondary pathology in adjacent tissues. In these patients, using radiographic guidance to direct the needle into the bursa in patients with an extra-bursal pain generator might be counterproductive. However, subgroup analysis did not reveal any significant differences in outcomes in fluoroscopy patients who needed more than one needle placement before injection (45% success rate at three months) and patients in whom only one injection attempt was made (44% success rate).

Our results suggest that referral to a pain specialist with fluoroscopic capability is not warranted in most patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome who present to a primary care doctor, physiatrist, or surgeon, all of whom often encounter this condition. The delay in treatment entailed by referral to a subspecialty may even be detrimental, as previous interventional studies have found an inverse relation between duration of pain and likelihood of success. Patients who fail "blind" trochanteric bursa injections and those with radiological evidence of bursal inflammation, however, may benefit from referral to a pain treatment centre, as this study (37% accuracy rate) and a previous one found that injections guided by landmarks alone are unlikely to diffuse into the bursa. On the basis of current third party reimbursement codes for the 10 most recent procedures done at Johns Hopkins, the cost for a subspecialty consultation and subsequent procedure using fluoroscopy (including facility fees) is $1216 (£843; €897), compared with $188 if the procedure is done during an office visit.

### Four common types of bursitis: diagnosis and management [^8933b734]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Bursitis is a common cause of musculoskeletal pain and often prompts orthopaedic consultation. Bursitis must be distinguished from arthritis, fracture, tendinitis, and nerve pathology. Common types of bursitis include prepatellar, olecranon, trochanteric, and retrocalcaneal. Most patients respond to nonsurgical management, including ice, activity modification, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In cases of septic bursitis, oral antibiotics may be administered. Local corticosteroid injection may be used in the management of prepatellar and olecranon bursitis; however, steroid injection into the retrocalcaneal bursa may adversely affect the biomechanical properties of the Achilles tendon. Surgical intervention may be required for recalcitrant bursitis, such as refractory trochanteric bursitis.

### Esotropia and exotropia preferred practice pattern ® [^30383e9a]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Exotropia ICD-10 CM classifications — the page lists specific coding categories and codes: Alternating (H50.15), Alternating with A pattern (H50.16), Alternating with specified noncomitancy not elsewhere classifiable (includes alphabetical patterns) (H50.18), Alternating with V pattern (H50.17), Monocular (H50.11–), Monocular with A pattern (H50.12–), Intermittent unspecified (H50.30), Alternating, intermittent (H50.34), Monocular, intermittent (H50.33–), and Unspecified (H50.10).

### Trochanteric bursitis after total hip arthroplasty: incidence and evaluation of response to treatment [^75b012e7]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2010). Low credibility.

We examined the efficacy of corticosteroid injection as treatment for postarthroplasty trochanteric bursitis and the risk factors for failure of nonoperative treatment. There were 32 (4.6%) cases of postsurgical trochanteric bursitis in 689 primary total hip arthroplasties. Of the 25 hips with follow-up, 11 (45%) required multiple injections. Symptoms resolved in 20 (80%) but persisted in 5. We found no statistically significant differences between patients who did and did not develop trochanteric bursitis, or between those who did and did not respond to treatment. There was a trend toward younger age and greater limb-length discrepancy in nonresponders. In conclusion, (1) corticosteroid injection(s) for postoperative trochanteric bursitis is effective; and (2) nonoperative management may be more likely to fail in young patients and those with leg-length discrepancy.

### Radiofrequency ablation of the trochanteric branches of the femoral nerve for the treatment of greater trochanteric syndrome [^e51ade03]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 12–15% of adults over the age of 60 suffer from chronic hip pain, defined as pain most of the days over the past six weeks. The prevalence of chronic hip pain is even greater among adults who play sports, with estimates ranging from 30–40%. Not only is this pain debilitating, often impairing an individual's ability to sit and stand, but it often becomes chronic, increasing in incidence with increasing age. The high prevalence of chronic hip pain might be partially explained by the difficulty clinicians experience in diagnosing the pain. The hip joint is innervated by articular branches of the obturator, femoral, superior gluteal, and sciatic nerves, which complicates the diagnosis of hip pain, as pain is often referred to the hip via these nerves. Patients often present with hip pain accompanied by chronic lumbar or knee pain, or hip pain that is referred from the spine, abdomen, hernial sites, sites of trauma, and several other locations. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is one of the most common diagnoses in patients with chronic hip pain. GTPS encompasses several disorders of the lateral, peritrochanteric space of the hip, including tears of the gluteus medius and minimus, external coxa saltans tears, and trochanteric bursitis. Like generalized hip pain, GTPS is relatively common and has a broad differential diagnosis. A multicenter observational study conducted by Segal et al estimated the prevalence of unilateral and bilateral GTPS to be 15% and 8% in women and 6.6% and 1.9% in men ages 50–79, respectively. Many patients who present with GTPS will continue to experience chronic pain following both conservative and surgical intervention. Given the complexity of hip joint pathology, which commonly results in groin and thigh pain, it is often difficult to manage the pain of patients who suffer from GTPS.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Lower nationwide rates of arthroscopic procedures in 2016 compared with 1997 (634925 total arthroscopic procedures): has the tide turned? [^5cc02fa4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The strength of our study is the use of a validated nationwide database. In previous studies, the coverage and accuracy of the data in the Finnish NHDR have been found to be over 90%. The study population comprised the entire Finnish population and included all healthcare institutions. Thus, the results of the study describe the actual surgical practice in Finland. Consequently, the changes in the rates accurately show the change in surgical practice in Finland and reflect the general opinion among surgical practice because a universal healthcare system provides all surgical treatment equally to everyone in Finland.

There are some limitations with the Finnish NHDR, particularly the use of International Classification for Diseases (ICD) codes for diagnoses, which are often too vague for specific joint diseases. This prevents further analysis of the changes in the treatment of different joint conditions. Therefore, the indications and diagnoses were not taken into consideration owing to challenges in confirming the exact code and diagnosis from the registry. Also, the coding does not include the laterality of the limb, and thus it is not possible to evaluate whether the patient has had right or left limb operations separately or has had several arthroscopies of the same joint.

In conclusion, we observed declining rates in all of the most common arthroscopic procedures of different joints. After several high-quality studies, surgeons have perceived lack of efficacy of the most common knee and shoulder arthroscopic procedures, which probably accounts for the subsequent decrease in rates. However, the concurrent decrease in most of the other joint arthroscopic procedures was unexpected and not readily explicable.

What are the new findings?

The rates of knee and shoulder arthroscopies declined after peaking in 2006 and 2007, respectively.
The rates of wrist, elbow and hip joint arthroscopies have declined after 2012–2014 without a clear reason.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future?

Our study suggests that 'real life' clinical practice is following the evidence of randomised controlled trials and data synthesis but unbiased experts.

### Analysis of hip fractures in France during the first COVID-19 lockdown in spring 2020 [^4a5c008a]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Participants

The study included patients 50 years or older hospitalized for hip fracture in metropolitan France from January 1 to July 31, 2020 (study period), and from January 1 to July 31, 2019 (control period). Hip fractures were considered if they were identified with ICD-10 primary diagnosis codes S7200 (unspecified femoral neck fracture), S7210 (unspecified trochanteric hip fracture), and S7220 (subtrochanteric fracture: closed).

The exclusion criteria were (1) age less than 50 years, (2) incorrect patient identifier, (3) incorrect French diagnosis-related group, (4) bone metastases during hospitalization for fracture, (5) presence of more than 2 fractures, and (6) no hip surgery (procedure codes are given in eTable 1 in the Supplement). To take into account the episode of care for the fracture, consecutive hospital stays for which the interval between stays was less than 1 day were considered as single care sequences. The starting date of the care sequence was the starting date of the first stay, and the end date was the date of death or the date of discharge at the end of the last stay (Figure 1).

Figure 1.

Contiguous hospital stays indicate consecutive stays when the interval between stays was less than 1 day, and noncontiguous hospital stays indicate stays when the interval between stays was 1 day or more. DRG indicates diagnosis-related group.

Exposures of Interest

The main exposure of interest was the year 2020 vs the year 2019. For the 2 years of the study, 3 intervals were considered: January 1 to March 15 (before the lockdown period), March 16 to May 10 (during the lockdown period), and May 11 to July 31 (after the lockdown period). Patients' gender, age, and hospital status were reported as well as whether the patient died during hospitalization.

### 'Bald trochanter' spontaneous rupture of the conjoined tendons of the gluteus medius and minimus presenting as a trochanteric bursitis [^a6fd551a]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

A 66-yr-old white woman presented with progressive complaints of right lateral hip and thigh pain associated with a disabling limp without an antecedent history of trauma. Physical examination revealed localized pain over the right greater trochanter to palpation. A full pain-free range of motion of the right hip was associated with weakness in the hip abductors. The patient ambulated with a compensated right Trendelenburg gait. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a trochanteric bursitis and an effusion of the hip and a full-thickness tear of the gluteus medius muscle, with both a disruption and retraction of the tendon of an atretic gluteus minimus muscle. Conjoined tendon pathology of both the gluteus medius and minimus as, revealed by magnetic resonance examination, is probably more frequent than heretofore commonly recognized. In patients presenting with "intractable" complaints of a trochanteric bursitis and an ambulatory limp due to weakness in the hip abductors, imaging studies calling attention to a possible tendon rupture may be diagnostic.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### The inaccuracy of ICD-10 coding in revision total hip arthroplasty and its implication on revision data [^1d109bba]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), was adopted by the United States on October 1, 2015 and expanded coding from 3800 codes with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, procedure code system (ICD-9-PCS) to 73,000. The increase in number of codes was designed to create more accurate representations of procedures like revision total hip arthroplasties (rTHAs). However, many worry that the increased complexity leads to more inaccurate coding. The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of ICD-10-PCS coding for rTHA and discuss the implications on registry data.

Methods

The rTHA databases at 2 large, academic medical centers were retrospectively reviewed for all rTHAs between October 1, 2015 and July 3, 2019. The laterality and specific revised components were recorded and compared with the ICD-10-PCS codes used for each procedure. The accuracy of ICD-10-PCS codes relative to the surgical record was determined using coding guidelines published by the American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR).

Results

Overall, 895 cases were reviewed. Replacement coding was 22% accurate (195 of 895). For removal and replacement coding, accuracy dropped to 17% (152 of 895). All procedures had at least 1 rTHA trigger code that would signify correctly to AJRR that an rTHA occurred.

Conclusion

In this study, the percent of correctly coded rTHA was low. All rTHA procedures had at least 1 AJRR trigger code; therefore, an rTHA would have been appropriately captured by AJRR. But these inaccuracies should make one pause when using ICD-10-PCS procedural data to try to evaluate specific rTHA details from administrative claims databases and ward against expanding ICD-10-PCS as a means to collect implant survival and registry data.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^a36ea6dd]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Case selection

A total of 4832 records from MCA and 5211 records from MCB were included in the study and analysed in a parallel manner (table 2). On average, the ICD-9-CM subsets had more codes per record than the ICD-10-CM subsets: 8.9 versus 8.4 and 12.5 versus 12.3 in the MCA and MCB datasets, respectively. In the MCA dataset, 657 and 659 dually coded records had a principal diagnosis from the list of nature-of-injury codes shown in table 1, using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, respectively. In the MCB dataset, the corresponding numbers were 537 and 544 records, respectively.

Table 2
Sample selection and characteristics of the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM)/Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD-10-CM) dually coded datasets

In the MCA dataset, five records had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas seven records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). In the MCB dataset, one record had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas eight records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). Specifically, the ICD-10-CM case definition for injury has been slightly expanded by the NCHS, such that initial encounters for periprosthetic fractures around internal prosthetic joints (T84.04 before 10/01/2016; M97 thereafter) and encounters for injuries and abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (O9A.2-O9A.5) are now included. These expansions accounted for 9 of the additional 15 records that were selected as injuries based only on ICD-10-CM diagnoses, whereas the exclusion of subsequent encounters from the ICD-10-CM case definition accounted for five of the six records selected based only on ICD-9-CM diagnoses.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^953a5a45]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The conversion from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM was the largest change to health care coding in America in the last 30 years. While ICD-10 was approved in 1990 and had been utilized in several countries since as early as 1994, its use only became required in the United States on October 1, 2015. The version used in the United States has several significant modifications suggested during an open comment period and via a field test performed by The American Hospital Association and the American Health Information Management Association. ICD-10-CM, as the version is known, added many more codes than the original World Health Organization version used prior to adoption in the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services originally planned to instate ICD-10 on October 1, 2011, but its implementation met resistance. The American Medical Association feared that the costs of implementing ICD-10 would be extreme and could even put smaller practices out of business. In 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the date to October 1, 2013. Two additional delays led to the final implementation date of October 1, 2015.

Each ICD-10 code has space for seven characters, an increase from the five available in ICD-9. The nearly 70,000 diagnostic codes available in ICD-10 provide a much greater level of detail than the 14,500 codes available in ICD-9, and mapping diagnoses from one to the other is often convoluted and rarely straightforward. Included in the increased details are codes that specify laterality and severity of disease, features that have a substantial effect on coding in ophthalmology. The increased level of detail is projected to lead to an eventual decrease in denied claims. Unfortunately, this decrease in rejected claims is expected to occur after a period of increased rejected claims lasting from 6 months to 3 years as coders adapt to the new system.–The more detailed information available from ICD-10 codes is also predicted to more easily identify fraud and abuse, give insurance companies more accurate information in order to make coverage decisions, and improve public health monitoring and research. Notably a dually coded database in Canada showed no improvement in the validity of coding with ICD-10 compared to ICD-9. However, a Swedish study did show continual improvement in the accuracy of recording conditions using ICD-10 over a 5-year period related to a coding learning curve.

### Hip pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^65ce6ee1]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Adults commonly present to their family physicians with hip pain, and diagnosing the cause is important for prescribing effective therapy. Hip pain is usually located anteriorly, laterally, or posteriorly. Anterior hip pain includes referred pain from intra-abdominal or intrapelvic causes; extra-articular etiologies, such as hip flexor injuries; and intra-articular etiologies. Intra-articular pain is often caused by a labral tear or femoroacetabular impingement in younger adults or osteoarthritis in older adults. Lateral hip pain is most commonly caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which includes gluteus medius tendinopathy or tear, bursitis, and iliotibial band friction. Posterior hip pain includes referred pain such as lumbar spinal pathology, deep gluteal syndrome with sciatic nerve entrapment, ischiofemoral impingement, and hamstring tendinopathy. In addition to the history and physical examination, radiography, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed for a definitive diagnosis. Radiography of the hip and pelvis should be the initial imaging test. Ultrasound-guided anesthetic injections can aid in the diagnosis of an intra-articular cause of pain. Because femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears, and gluteus medius tendon tears typically have good surgical outcomes, advanced imaging and/or early referral may improve patient outcomes.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^98345727]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Resolution of Case

The patient experienced significant pain relief from the corticosteroid injection for a few weeks. However, 5 weeks after the injection her lateral hip pain returned, now with pain radiating into her left lateral thigh, knee, and lateral lower leg. On repeat exam, she now had tenderness over her left ITB, mild pain with passive hip range of motion and lumbar extension, and a positive seated slump test on the left. At this time, she was felt to have GTPS and ITBS with superimposed lumbar radicular pain. Ultrasound confirmed the recurrence of bursitis in the GT. She continued to be resistant to physical therapy, and 1 month later her pain had not improved so she requested a repeat ultrasound-guided greater trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injection.

The clinical course of this case highlights that corticosteroid injections for GTPS, even when an inflammatory bursitis is present, usually only provide temporary relief, and more definitive management of hip abductor strengthening must be strongly encouraged. In the setting of true bursitis and severe pain, a corticosteroid injection can help facilitate active engagement in a rehabilitation program. However, in older adults who are at risk for co-morbidities such as osteoporosis, hypertension, diabetes, and delirium, minimizing the use of corticosteroids is advantageous. This case also demonstrates that evaluation of lateral hip and thigh pain is often not straightforward. In this particular patient, she likely developed secondary lumbar pain, possibly in part due to compensatory mechanical changes in an attempt to relieve pain from her sub-optimally treated GTPS.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^ccf9d77a]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis ICD-10 CM coding — Blepharitis, which includes entities with the following ICD-10 classifications, lists Ulcerative (H01.01-), Squamous (H01.02-), Stye (H00.01-), Meibomitis (H01.02-), Abscess of eyelid (H00.03-), and Parasitic infestation of eyelid (B89). CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; "(-) = 1, right upper eyelid; 2, right lower eyelid; 4, left upper eyelid; 5, left lower eyelid", and when laterality is specified "Right upper eyelid is always 1", "Right lower eyelid is always 2", "Left upper eyelid is always 4", and "Left lower eyelid is always 5". "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field"; if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)".

### Esotropia and exotropia preferred practice pattern ® [^38cbc533]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Esotropia ICD-10 CM codes — entities and laterality rules are specified as follows: Nonaccommodative (unspecified) H50.00; Accommodative H50.43; Alternating H50.05; Alternating with A pattern H50.06; Alternating with V pattern H50.07; Alternating with X or Y pattern (with other noncomitancies) H50.08; Monocular H50.01–; Monocular with A pattern H50.02–; Monocular with V pattern H50.03–; Monocular with X or Y pattern (with other noncomitancies) H50.04–; Intermittent, alternating H50.32; Intermittent, monocular H50.31–; Unspecified H50.00. CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; = 1, right eye; 2, left eye. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes indicates laterality. Esotropia and exotropia do not have bilateral codes. Therefore, if the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), most often you will find: Right is 1 Left is 2.

### ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM mapping of the AAST emergency general surgery disease severity grading systems: conceptual approach, limitations, and recommendations for the future [^57d673b3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently established a grading system for uniform reporting of anatomic severity of several emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. There are five grades of severity for each disease, ranging from I (lowest severity) to V (highest severity). However, the grading process requires manual chart review. We sought to evaluate whether International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) codes might allow estimation of AAST grades for EGS diseases. The Patient Assessment and Outcomes Committee of the AAST reviewed all available ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes relevant to 16 EGS diseases with available AAST grades. We then matched grades for each EGS disease with one or more ICD codes. We used the Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and the American Hospital Association's "Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM" for coding guidance. The ICD codes did not allow for matching all five AAST grades of severity for each of the 16 diseases. With ICD-9-CM, six diseases mapped into four categories of severity (instead of five), another six diseases into three categories of severity, and four diseases into only two categories of severity. With ICD-10-CM, five diseases mapped into four categories of severity, seven diseases into three categories, and four diseases into two categories. Two diseases mapped into discontinuous categories of grades (two in ICD-9-CM and one in ICD-10-CM). Although resolution is limited, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes might have some utility in roughly approximating the severity of the AAST grades in the absence of more precise information. These ICD mappings should be validated and refined before widespread use to characterize EGS disease severity. In the long-term, it may be desirable to develop alternatives to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for routine collection of disease severity characteristics.

### An introduction to orthopaedic coding and billing [^2e3c42c9]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2014). Low credibility.

Coding is the process of identifying descriptive terms and codes for diagnoses and medical services, which result from patient interactions with physicians and other healthcare providers. This information is organized in alpha and/or numeric fashion and may be used for charge submission, performance measurement, and data collection for emerging technology, services, and procedures. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, The Department of Health and Human Services designated the International classification of Diseases and Current Procedural Terminology as the national standard code sets for healthcare professional services and procedures. The purpose of this article is to summarize the most important aspects of the billing and coding process.

### Reliability of international classification of disease-9 versus international classification of disease-10 coding for proximal femur fractures at a level 1 trauma center [^aa2d848d]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid services proposed that transitioning from the 9th to the 10th revision of the International Classification of Disease (ICD) would provide better data for research. This study sought to determine the reliability of ICD-10 compared with ICD-9 for proximal femur fractures.

Methods

Available imaging studies from 196 consecutively treated proximal femur fractures were retrospectively reviewed and assigned ICD codes by three physicians. Intercoder reliability (ICR) was calculated. Collectively, the physicians agreed on what should be the correct codes for each fracture, and this was compared with coding found in the medical and billing records.

Results

No significant difference was observed in ICR for both ICD-9 and ICD-10 exact coding, which were both unreliable. Less specific coding improved ICR. ICD-9 general coding was better than ICD-10. Electronic medical record coding was unreliable. Billing codes were also unreliable, yet ICD-10 was better than ICD-9.

Discussion

ICD-9 and ICD-10 lack reliability in coding proximal femur fractures. ICD-10 results in data that are no more reliable than those found with ICD-9.

Level Of Evidence

Level I diagnostic.

### International classification of diseases coding for inflammatory arthritides [^0c0feee4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The transition to ICD-10 afforded the potential of increased granularity of inflammatory arthritides diagnosis codes for clinical care, research, and billing purposes. This quality improvement study found that, despite a 30-fold increase in codes, adoption of ICD-10 has been poor; only 2.1% of available codes were used more than 1% of the time and were nonspecific. This may reflect the lack of financial incentive for accurate ICD-10 coding, because ICD-10 is not tied to reimbursement.

When assessed by year, the percentage of codes used with regularity did not increase. When assessed by clinician specialty, the percentage of codes used was not better for rheumatologists (who might be expected to be more refined users of such codes) than primary care clinicians. This study is limited by potential coding inaccuracies and cannot establish causality.

Overall, consistent with findings in other areas, the data suggest room for better application of inflammatory arthritis codes. This will be important in years to come if the benefits of ICD expansion are to be realized.

### Nonarthritic hip joint pain [^3a4b5ac3]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — diagnosis/classification and risk factors: Clinicians should consider the presence of osseous abnormalities, local or global ligamentous laxity, connective tissue disorders, and nature of the patient's activity and participation as risk factors for hip joint pathology (Recommendation based on expert opinion.). Clinicians should use the clinical findings of anterior groin or lateral hip pain or generalized hip joint pain that is reproduced with the hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation (FADIR) test or the hip flexion, abduction, external rotation (FABER) test, along with consistent imaging findings, to classify a patient with hip pain into the ICD categories of M25.5 Pain in joint, M24.7 Protrusio acetabula, M24.0 Loose body in joint, and M24.2 Disorder of ligament, and the associated ICF impairment-based categories of hip pain (b28016 Pain in joints) and mobility impairments (b7100 Mobility of a single joint; b7150 Stability of a single joint) (Recommendation based on weak evidence.). Clinicians should consider diagnostic categories other than nonarthritic joint pain when the patient's history, reported activity limitations, or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the Diagnosis/Classification section or when the patient's symptoms are not diminishing with interventions aimed at normalization of the impairments of body function (Recommendation based on expert opinion.).

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: a scoping review [^9743886f]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Lateral hip pain used to be a poorly defined entity, but advances in imaging and interest in sports medicine have led to a better understanding of the pathology, presentation and management of this cohort of patients. A thorough appreciation of the anatomy of the abductor musculature, specific clinical signs and imaging findings will lead to an appropriate diagnosis being made and management plan instituted. Finally, it should be noted that assessment of baseline psychological impairment is essential in this group of patients to optimise outcomes.

Retinal vein occlusion ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM codes — International Classification of Diseases (ICD) classifications include: central retinal vein occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.35; ICD-10 CM H34.811-, H34.812-, H34.813-; venous tributary (branch) occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.36; ICD-10 CM H34.831-, H34.832-, H34.833-; venous engorgement — ICD-9 CM 362.37; ICD-10 CM H34.821-, H34.822-, H34.823-. For ICD-10 CM laterality, the guidance states: "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1 Left is always 2 Bilateral is always 3".

### Inconsistency and ambiguity within the international classification of disease 10 procedure coding system for hip fractures [^076ac480]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD), 10th Revision Procedure Coding System (PCS) was created to increase the granularity of procedural coding. These codes are entered by hospital coders from information derived from the medical record. Concern exists that this increase in complexity could lead to inaccurate data.

Methods

Medical records and ICD-10-PCS codes were reviewed for operatively treated geriatric hip fractures from January 2016 through February 2019 at a tertiary referral medical center. Definitions for each of the 7-unit figures from the 2022 American Medical Association's ICD-10-PCS official codebook were compared to the medical, operative, and implant records.

Results

There were 56% (135 of 241) of PCS codes that had ambiguous, partially incorrect, or frankly incorrect figures within the code. One or more inaccurate figures were noted in 72% (72 of 100) of fractures treated with arthroplasty compared to 44.7% (63 of 141) treated with fixation (P < .01). There was at least 1 frankly incorrect figure contained in 9.5% (23 of 241) of codes. Approach was coded ambiguously for 24.8% (29 of 117) of pertrochanteric fractures. Device/implant codes were partially incorrect in 34.9% (84 of 241) of all hip fracture PCS codes. Hemi and total hip arthroplasties were partially incorrect in 78.4% (58 of 74) and 30.8% (8/26) of device/implant codes, respectively. Significantly more femoral neck (69.4%, 86 of 124) than pertrochanteric fractures (41.9%, 49 of 117) had 1 or more incorrect or partially correct figures (P < .01).

Conclusion

Despite the increased granularity of ICD-10-PCS codes, the application of this system is inconsistent and often incorrect when applied to hip fracture treatments. The definitions in the PCS system are difficult to be utilized by coders and do not reflect the operation performed.

### Age-and sex-specific incidence rates and future projections for hip fractures in Zimbabwe [^d834df11]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Hip fracture classification

Hip fractures were confirmed by reading radiographs wherever possible. Each radiograph was reviewed by two orthopaedic surgeons and classified as intracapsular (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] code S72.0), pertrochanteric (ICD-10 code S72.1) and sub-trochanteric (ICD-10 code S72.2). If a radiograph had been taken, but was not made available to the research team, the hip fracture classification was taken from the orthopaedic opinion documented in the hospital medical records. Where no radiograph (eg, due to X-ray equipment faults, interrupted electricity supply, unaffordability of radiographs), the case history was used by an orthopaedic surgeon to determine a clinical diagnosis of a hip fracture. This was defined as (i) a fall where the patient landed on their buttocks or side, after which (ii) they quickly experienced severe pain in the groin or hip with or without radiation down to the knee and (iii) a shortened and externally rotated leg was evident on examination.

Statistical analysis

Characteristics of the hip fracture population were described using numbers with percentages, and means with SD. χ² tests were used to determine associations between patient characteristics and (a) delayed presentation and (b) mechanism of injury.

### Accuracy of musculoskeletal imaging for the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica: systematic review [^7ea30a59]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the evidence for accuracy of imaging for diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).

Methods

Searches included MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed. Evaluations of diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for PMR were eligible, excluding reports with < 10 PMR cases. Two authors independently extracted study data and three authors assessed methodological quality using modified QUADAS-2 criteria.

Results

26 studies of 2370 patients were evaluated: 10 ultrasound scanning studies; 6 MRI studies; 1 USS and MRI study; 7 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET) studies; 1 plain radiography and 1 technetium scintigraphy study. In four ultrasound studies, subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis had sensitivity 80% (95% CI 55% to 93%) and specificity 68% (95% CI 60% to 75%), whereas bilateral subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis had sensitivity 66% (95% CI 43% to 87%) and specificity 89% (95% CI 66% to 97%). Sensitivity for ultrasound detection of trochanteric bursitis ranged from 21% to 100%. In four ultrasound studies reporting both subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis and glenohumeral synovitis, detection of subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis was more accurate than that of glenohumeral synovitis (p = 0.004). MRI and PET/CT revealed additional areas of inflammation in the spine and pelvis, including focal areas between the vertebrae and anterior to the hip joint, but the number of controls with inflammatory disease was inadequate for precise specificity estimates.

Conclusions

Subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis appears to be the most helpful ultrasound feature for PMR diagnosis, but interpretation is limited by study heterogeneity and methodological issues, including variability in blinding and potential bias due to case-control study designs. Recent MRI and PET/CT case-control studies, with blinded readers, yielded promising data requiring validation within a diagnostic cohort study.

### Hip pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^4d411868]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Anterior Hip Pain Intra-articular hip pain predominately presents anteriorly. 4, 5 In young adults, anterior hip or groin pain that is aggravated by hip flexion or rotation warrants evaluation for intra-articular pathologies. Hip flexor strains, tears, and avulsion fractures can cause anterior hip pain, with the patient history often including a sports-related or traumatic incident consistent with a flexor injury. 5 Because referred pain from intra-abdominal problems can present as anterior hip pain, the abdomen should be examined for gastrointestinal causes of pain, such as a mass; appendicitis; hernia; or pain originating in the bladder or the female reproductive system. 4, 6. FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT Femoroacetabular impingement is one of the most common causes of hip pain in young adults. Radiography is used to help diagnose femoroacetabular impingement, although the preferred radiographic views may vary.

Standing anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis may be most helpful for diagnosing of the pincer deformity, 26 whereas Meyer lateral and 90-degree Dunn views may be best to visualize the cam deformity.
27. LABRAL TEARS Patients with labral tears may present with anterior hip pain and a history of a sports-related or traumatic injury. They may also be associated with repetitive motions. Labral tears may cause a popping, catching, or clicking sound associated with activities such as dance, gymnastics, hockey, basketball, and soccer. 2, 5, 9 Physical examination for labral tears should include flexion adduction internal rotation and flexion abduction external rotation tests. 7 A standing radiograph should be the initial imaging test. 24 Previously, magnetic resonance arthrography with gadolinium injection of the hip was the diagnostic standard for labral tears.

However, with recent advances to 3-tesla MRI and specialized hip protocols, noncontrast 3-tesla MRI is as sensitive and specific as magnetic resonance arthrography and does not require a procedure for contrast injection. 22, 23 Physicians should consult with a local radiologist to determine the most appropriate test in their area. Lateral Hip Pain The most common cause of lateral hip pain is greater trochanteric pain syndrome. 15 Although this syndrome may be associated with bursitis, gluteus medius tendinopathy or tears are now thought to be more common. 16, 31 Iliotibial band friction and external snapping hip can contribute to greater trochanteric pain syndrome.
15. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome presents as lateral hip pain aggravated by ambulation or other physical activities, sitting for long periods, and sleeping on the affected hip. It most commonly affects women 40 to 60 years of age.

16 There is typically no inciting injury. The patient may walk with a Trendelenburg gait or have positive findings on the Trendelenburg test or resisted external derotation test. 7, 16. If a patient with greater trochanteric pain syndrome does not improve with anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy, a gluteus medius tendon tear should be considered. MRI and musculoskeletal ultrasonography performed by an experienced sonographer are sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosing a gluteus medius tendon tear. 15, 16, 21 Referral to an orthopedic hip specialist is often indicated for large partial or complete tears because surgery is typically associated with good outcomes in patients with this condition. 15, 16. Posterior Hip Pain The cause of posterior hip pain can be difficult to diagnose. The differential diagnosis includes musculoskeletal causes and referred pain from intrapelvic and gynecologic issues.

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^14409d67]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification — ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

Case 7

This was a 52-year-old female patient with a history of left trochanteric bursitis who presented to the interventional pain clinic with a complaint of left-sided low back pain and headaches. The patient rated her pain as a 5/10. The patient reported minimal improvement with physical therapy, pharmacotherapy, and left trochanteric bursa injection.

The patient underwent left nervous femoralis to the trochanter nerve RFA under fluoroscopic guidance on April 21, 2021. Thirty-four days postprocedure, her pain had improved to 0/10 on VAS. The patient did note that excessive activity would bring on the pain, but found significant improvements to her quality of life following the procedure. The patient continued to take hydrocodone, ibuprofen, and naproxen following the procedure.

Case 8

This was a 64-year female old patient who presented to the interventional pain clinic with a complaint of low back and right leg pain. She rated her pain 7/10, noting that the pain is 5/10 at best and 8/10 at worst. The patient noticed minimal improvement with physical therapy, chiropractic intervention, TENS unit, steroid injections, and pharmacotherapy. The patient noted an injury 38 days prior to her RFA after falling in the snow, exacerbating her hip and back pain.

The patient underwent bilateral nervous femoralis to the trochanter nerve RFA under fluoroscopic guidance on June 7, 2021. Thirty-nine days postprocedure, her pain had improved to 2/10 on VAS. The patient also reported improvement of her quality of life, noting the ability to lie on both sides and sleep through the night following the procedure. The patient continues to report ongoing pain relief from the procedure.

### Lateral hip pain: does imaging predict response to localized injection? [^0c6aff01]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

Lateral hip pain is a common complaint in patients with a history of lower back pain from spinal disease. These patients often are diagnosed and treated for trochanteric bursitis because of localized pain and tenderness in the lateral hip. We presumed numerous scintigraphic features could provide diagnostic criteria for diagnosing gluteus medius tendinitis and trochanteric bursitis. A study was designed to assess the scintigraphic criteria for diagnosis of trochanteric bursitis and to evaluate the relationship of trochanteric bursitis to gluteus medius tendinitis and lumbar degenerative disease in predicting relapse after injection. We evaluated 97 patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome to find a correlation between trochanteric bursitis, gluteus medius tendinitis, and spinal degenerative disease using scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging. We also evaluated predictors for responding to trochanteric injection of local anesthetic/glucocorticoid injection. We found a correlation between lumbar degenerative disease, gluteus medius tendinopathy, and trochanteric bursitis. Of these, 30 of 48 patients (63%) responded to injection of local anesthetic and glucocorticoids. The major predictor of relapse of pain after injection in 18 patients was the presence of moderate to severe lumbar degenerative disease seen on scintigraphic imaging. We propose a mechanistic model of the greater trochanteric pain syndrome to explain the interrelationship and response to therapy. Scintigraphy can provide sensitive and specific diagnoses of gluteus medius tendinitis and trochanteric bursitis.

### International classification of diseases coding for inflammatory arthritides [^f6832853]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The International Classification of Diseases was revised in 2015 from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), representing the largest revision to the system in 30 years (from 14 500 to 70 000 codes). Although ICD-10 could document conditions with greater granularity, it remains to be seen whether it has been well-utilized up to the 2022 transition to International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11).

With ICD-10, the number of inflammatory arthritis codes increased from 14 to 425. Although this allows for better characterization of such conditions for more than 1.3 million affected US individuals, the greater granularity is useful only if the breadth of codes is utilized. The purpose of this quality improvement study was to investigate usage patterns of inflammatory arthritides codes under ICD-10 vs ICD-9.

### Surgical repair of the gluteal tendons: a report of 72 cases [^ce780f04]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2011). Low credibility.

Lateral hip pain is a common problem in middle-aged women. This pain is usually attributed to trochanteric bursitis and treated as such. This study reports the results of investigation, the findings at surgery, the operative technique, the histopathologic findings, and the results of gluteal tendon repair in 72 patients with long-standing trochanteric pain and reports a classification of the operative findings. Six patients (7%) in the original study cohort of 89 patients were lost to follow-up, but of the remaining patients, 65 of 72, or 90%, were pain-free or had minimal pain (P < .00001). Surgical reconstruction of detached gluteal tendons causing chronic lateral hip pain addresses the problem directly and reliably relieves the symptoms of so-called "trochanteric bursitis".

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^61ccd7a3]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.2.2 Conditions involving the iliopsoas

The iliopsoas muscle can be affected by painful conditions such as tendinopathy and bursitis that can mimic radiculopathy. The iliopsoas bursa communicates with the hip joint, so any intraarticular pathology such as OA or inflammatory arthritis can lead to bursitis. Symptoms include anterior hip or groin pain that can be vaguely localized. Some patients report a snapping sensation due to the tendon rubbing over the iliopectineal eminence and lesser trochanter with hip ROM, or may notice an inguinal mass due to enlargement of the bursa.

Evidence based physical exam maneuvers are lacking; physical exam findings that identify the iliopsoas as the source of pain include tenderness to palpation over the iliopsoas, and pain or tightness with the Thomas test or the modified Thomas test.

Ultrasound (US), MRI, and US‐guided diagnostic injections can be used to confirm the diagnosis.MRI is recommended as the most accurate imaging modality with the best correlation with surgical findings such as bursa size, but US is an acceptable alternative, based on the results of one study.

4.3 radiculopathy mimics

4.3.1 Greater trochanteric pain syndrome

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome, previously termed (greater) trochanteric bursitis, is among the most common lower extremity musculoskeletal pain conditions, estimated to affect 10%–25% of the population. Lateral hip pain in proximity to the greater trochanter was classically attributed to trochanteric bursitis, putative inflammation of one or more of the regional bursae. However, more recent conceptions of GTPS consider it as a constellation of symptoms involving numerous structures including the trochanteric bursae, gluteus medius, and other regional muscles/tendons.GTPS can affect persons of any age, more commonly affects women than men, and frequently occurs concurrently with other musculoskeletal conditions. For instance, some studies estimate 20%–35% of persons with chronic low back pain have concurrent GTPS. In one study, GTPS was present in 18% of patients referred for lumbosacral radiculopathy.

### Is the American joint replacement registry able to correctly classify revision total knee arthroplasty procedural diagnoses? [^5917566a]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR) is a powerful tool for the study of revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). The AJRR uses International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10-CM) codes for recording surgical diagnoses. However, the validity of this methodology is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of ICD-10-CM codes, as used by AJRR, in classifying rTKA diagnoses.

Methods

There were 988 rTKAs performed from 2015 to 2021 identified in our institutional total joint registry (TJR). Revision diagnoses were obtained from TJR, in which trained abstractors prospectively record diagnoses independent of ICD-10-CM data. The ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes submitted to AJRR were retrieved for the same procedures. The accuracy of ICD-10-CM codes for classifying rTKA diagnoses as septic versus aseptic, aseptic loosening, instability, and periprosthetic fracture was assessed using Cohen's Kappa statistics, sensitivities, and specificities.

Results

Concordance between AJRR-submitted codes and TJR was excellent (97.3%, k = 0.9) for identifying septic versus aseptic revisions. Agreement for aseptic diagnoses varied from very good for loosening (k = 0.65) and instability (k = 0.64) to fair for periprosthetic fracture (k = 0.36). Specificity was high (> 94%) for all three diagnoses, but sensitivity was lower at 71%, 63%, and 28% for loosening, instability, and periprosthetic fracture, respectively.

Conclusion

The AJRR submitted ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes correctly classified rTKA cases as septic or aseptic with remarkable accuracy, but accuracy for more granular diagnoses varied. These data demonstrate the potential for diagnosis-specific limitations when using administrative claims data for registry reporting and have important implications for researchers using ICD-10-CM data.

### Outcomes of arthroscopic management of trochanteric bursitis in patients with femoroacetabular impingement: a comparison of two matched patient groups [^b2025f1d]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the prevalence of chronic trochanteric bursitis (TB) in patient being treated for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and determine the effectiveness of arthroscopic bursectomy and iliotibial band lengthening (AB-ITB-L) at the time of hip arthroscopy for FAI.

Methods

Patients diagnosed with primary FAI and chronic TB were included in the study. Patients were included if they underwent hip arthroscopy with labral repair, femoral and/or acetabular osteoplasty, and AB-ITB-L. Patients were matched by age and gender to patients without chronic TB.

Results

The prevalence of chronic TB with FAI was 7% (90/1,278). Females were 5.3 times more likely to have TB compared with males (95% confidence interval: 3.2–8.7). Patients more than 30 years of age were 2.5 times more likely to have TB (95% confidence interval: 1.48–4.4). Of the 90 patients diagnosed with TB, 72 (54 female, 18 male) with an average age of 36.7 years underwent AB-ITB-L at the time of their index hip arthroscopy for FAI. All 72 patients had associated intra-articular pathology consisting of a combined cam and pincer pathology. The TB (average follow-up = 42 ± 9.9 months) and non-TB group (average follow-up = 42 ± 9.1 months) both had significant improvement from preoperative to postoperative scores for Hip Outcome Score Activities Daily Living, Hip Outcome Score Sport, Modified Harris Hip Score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index, Short Form (SF)-12 Physical Component score, and SF-12 Mental Component Score. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in postoperative patient reported outcome scores.

Conclusions

The occurrence of chronic TB in the FAI population, which did not adequately respond to nonoperative management, for a single surgeon high volume hip arthroscopy practice was 7%, and was more commonly seen in women older than 30 years. Patients who undergo concomitant AB-ITB-L for chronic TB report excellent pain relief, and have equivalent results and outcome scores that are not inferior when compared with patients with primary FAI without chronic TB.

Results

Case 1

This was a 30-year old female patient with a history of trochanteric bursitis of the right hip who presented to the interventional pain clinic with chronic low back pain that initially began following a cesarean-section in 2016 and was exacerbated by a motor vehicle accident (MVA) in 2018. Following the MVA, the patient reported exacerbated sharp, achy, chronic bilateral axial low back pain and new right hip pain. Upon initial presentation, the patient's back pain was rated at a 8/10 on visual analogue scale (VAS), a 3.5/10 at its best and a 10/10 at its worst. The patient reported minimal improvement with trigger point injections (TPI), ibuprofen, heating cream, and one scoop daily of ortho molecular's collagen powder. The patient underwent one greater trochanteric bursa injection, one lumbar epidural steroid injection at L5-S1, and two diagnostic right nervus femoralis trochanteric branch nerve blocks prior to undergoing RFA intervention.

The patient underwent right nervus femoralis to the trochanter nerve RFA under fluoroscopic guidance on October 28, 2020. 16 days following the procedure, the patient's right trochanteric pain improved from 8/10 prior to the procedure to less than 1/10 postprocedure, reporting a 95% improvement. The patient underwent one additional lumbar epidural steroid injection following the procedure; however, this was targeted at her axial low back pain, which persisted following RFA intervention. Overall, the patient reported an improvement in quality of life following RFA. The patient continues to report ongoing pain relief from the procedure.

### Effects of femoral neck width and hip axis length on incident hip fracture risk: a registry-based cohort study [^ceef4e5d]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Fracture outcomes

Incident hip and non-hip major fractures (composite of clinical vertebral, humerus, forearm) were identified from linked population-based healthcare data. Fracture diagnoses were obtained through hospital discharge abstracts and physician billing claims. Diagnoses and procedures were coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) before 2004 and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Canadian Enhancements (ICD-10-CA) thereafter, using fracture identification algorithms that have been radiologically validated and adopted for national surveillance. ICD codes were further used to differentiate hip fractures involving the FN from the trochanteric fractures. High-trauma fractures, identified through specific trauma-related codes (ICD-9-CM trauma codes E800-E848 transport accident, E881-E884: falls from significant heights, E908-E909: cataclysmic storms; E916-E928: other accidents; ICD-10-CA: V01-V99, W11-W17, W20-W49, W85-W99, X10-X19, X34-X39, X50-X59), were excluded from the analysis to focus on low-trauma fractures typical of osteoporotic events.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Complication rates for hip arthroscopy are underestimated: a population-based study [^7b91085b]. Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To identify major and minor complication rates associated with hip arthroscopy from a payer-based national database and compare with the rates reported in the existing literature.

Methods

Patients who underwent hip arthroscopy between 2007 and 2014 were identified using PearlDiver, a publicly available database. Rates of major and minor complications, as well as conversion to total hip arthroscopy (THA), were determined by using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), codes. Incidence rates of select major complications across the entire database were used as a comparison group. Statistical significance was set at P < .05.

Results

Of 18 million patients screened from 2007 to 2014, a total of 2,581 hip arthroscopies were identified. The rates of major and minor complications within a 1-year postoperative period were 1.74% and 4.22%, respectively. Complications included heterotopic ossification (2.85%), bursitis (1.23%), proximal femur fracture (1.08%), deep vein thrombosis (0.79%), and hip dislocation (0.58%). The rate of conversion to THA within 1 year was 2.85%. When compared to rates in the general population, the relative risks [RRs] of requiring a THA (age < 50 years, RR = 57.66, P < .001; age > 50 years, RR = 22.05, P < .001), sustaining a proximal femur fracture (age < 50 years, RR = 18.02, P < .001; age > 50 years, RR = 2.23, P < .001), or experiencing a hip dislocation (RR 19.60, P < .001) at 1 year after hip arthroscopy were significantly higher in all age groups.

Conclusions

Higher major complication rates after hip arthroscopy were observed using a national payer-based database than previously reported in the literature, especially in regard to hip dislocations and proximal femur fractures. Rates of total hip arthroplasty were similar to prior studies, whereas the rates of revision hip arthroscopy were higher.

### The role of arthroscopic bursectomy in the treatment of trochanteric bursitis [^7d5ce4f9]. Arthroscopy (2002). Low credibility.

The use of arthroscopy to treat recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis is reported and its role in treating this common clinical entity is discussed. During a 7-year period, 27 patients underwent this procedure. All patients complained of recurrent lateral hip pain despite at least 2 localized injections with corticosteroids. Minimum follow-up was 1 year, and the cases of 22 patients were reviewed after 5 years. Twenty-three of the 27 patients had good or excellent results immediately following the procedure and experienced no complications. At 1 year, only 1 patient had experienced symptom recurrence, and at 5 years, only 2 patients had had recurrence. All patients except 1 were satisfied with their outcome. Arthroscopically performed trochanteric bursectomy is a minimally invasive technique that appears to be both safe and effective for treating recalcitrant pain syndromes.
