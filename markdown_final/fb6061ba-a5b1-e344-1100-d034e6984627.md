## Question

Work up for low calcium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup for low calcium (hypocalcemia). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypocalcemia and distinguishing total from ionized calcium. Then, I should assess severity and symptoms to decide on urgency. Next, I will obtain a focused history and physical to guide the differential. After that, I need to order a core laboratory panel and interpret results with a PTH-centric algorithm. Finally, I will consider special populations, targeted testing, and when to escalate to genetic evaluation or imaging, while continuously verifying assumptions and correcting course if new data contradict my initial reasoning [^4a5245f3] [^0edf4531].

> Let me first confirm the abnormality, because pseudo-hypocalcemia from hypoalbuminemia is common and total calcium must be corrected for albumin or, better yet, ionized calcium measured when results are discordant with symptoms or in critical illness; I should double-check that the lab reported total calcium correctly and consider repeating the test if the clinical picture does not fit, since albumin-adjusted calcium can misclassify ionized calcium in ICU settings and ionized calcium is the physiologically active fraction [^4a5245f3] [^97f2d2f7] [^5b949a66].

> Wait, let me verify severity and symptoms before I jump to testing, because symptomatic hypocalcemia (paresthesias, tetany, seizures, laryngospasm, QT prolongation) mandates urgent intravenous calcium therapy and admission, whereas asymptomatic patients can proceed with outpatient evaluation; I should also remember that in children, symptomatic hypocalcemia requires urgent IV calcium and endocrinology referral, so I need to ask about neuromuscular symptoms and cardiac effects promptly [^7704ddc6] [^ed931cf9].

> Next, I should review the history and physical with a focus on etiologic clues: recent neck or thyroid surgery, autoimmune disease, malabsorption, liver or kidney disease, medications (especially loop diuretics, bisphosphonates, denosumab, calcimimetics, anticonvulsants, PPIs), family history of calcium disorders, and symptoms of vitamin D deficiency; on exam I will look for Chvostek and Trousseau signs, cataracts, basal ganglia calcifications, and features of genetic syndromes, because these findings shape pretest probabilities and the testing sequence [^0edf4531] [^d5650245] [^f929efbf].

> I will now examine the core laboratory panel that I must obtain in essentially all patients: total calcium with albumin to calculate corrected calcium or, when available, ionized calcium, plus magnesium, phosphorus, intact PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase; I should confirm that I am not ordering 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D reflexively, as it is not the test of vitamin D status and should be reserved for specific contexts, and I need to ensure I add a urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio when hypoparathyroidism is suspected to help distinguish it from other causes [^3228fa87] [^757090dc] [^3b94b2f4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should interpret results using a PTH-first algorithm. If PTH is low or inappropriately normal in the face of hypocalcemia, that supports hypoparathyroidism, whereas a high PTH suggests secondary hyperparathyroidism from vitamin D deficiency, malabsorption, chronic kidney disease, or calcium deficiency; I need to check phosphorus because hypoparathyroidism typically shows elevated phosphate, while vitamin D deficiency or CKD-related secondary hyperparathyroidism often shows low or low-normal phosphate, and I should confirm that magnesium is adequate since hypomagnesemia impairs PTH secretion and action and will blunt calcium responsiveness [^0edf4531] [^1952e26c] [^1333db9c].

> Let me consider special populations carefully. In children, I should confirm whether the hypocalcemia is early-onset neonatal (within 72 hours) versus late-onset, and I should screen for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome with chest radiograph for thymus and consider genetic testing when indicated; in post-thyroidectomy patients, I should measure PTH within 24 hours and use thresholds around 10–15 pg/mL to predict hypocalcemia and guide prophylaxis; in critical illness, I should prioritize ionized calcium and avoid relying on albumin-adjusted calcium, and I should remember that hypocalcemia often normalizes over the first few days without clear mortality benefit from routine supplementation [^58cce027] [^f929efbf] [^4639f894] [^97f2d2f7].

> I should double-check for medication-induced causes and reversible contributors. Loop diuretics, bisphosphonates, denosumab, calcimimetics, and anticonvulsants can all lower calcium, and denosumab-related hypocalcemia is particularly likely in vitamin D deficiency or CKD; if I suspect denosumab or bisphosphonate-related hypocalcemia, I need to ensure vitamin D repletion and monitor calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus closely, and in CKD patients on calcimimetics, I should consider dose reduction or holding therapy if hypocalcemia is symptomatic or severe [^49e894cb] [^cbf7d6fd] [^1a04fe87].

> But wait, what if the PTH is high and the calcium is low — does that automatically exclude hypoparathyroidism? Initially, I thought so, but hold on, I should verify because pseudohypoparathyroidism presents with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and elevated PTH due to end-organ resistance; in that scenario, I need to check for Albright hereditary osteodystrophy features and consider genetic testing for GNAS mutations, and I should also remember that severe hypomagnesemia can drive secondary hyperparathyroidism with functional hypoparathyroidism until magnesium is corrected [^d5650245] [^1333db9c].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to additional testing. If hypoparathyroidism is confirmed or strongly suspected, I should obtain a 24-hour urine calcium to help distinguish hypoparathyroidism from other causes and to establish baseline for monitoring, and I should consider genetic testing for syndromic or familial forms, particularly in children or those with a family history; if vitamin D deficiency is suspected, I should confirm 25-hydroxyvitamin D and assess for malabsorption or liver disease, and if CKD is present, I should evaluate CKD-MBD parameters and adjust vitamin D and phosphate binders accordingly [^3228fa87] [^6a22937a] [^cbf7d6fd].

> I need to ensure I am not missing red flags that require immediate action. Symptomatic hypocalcemia warrants IV calcium gluconate with cardiac monitoring, and if hypomagnesemia is present, I should correct magnesium first because calcium will not normalize otherwise; in postoperative patients with declining calcium or PTH below about 10–15 pg/mL, I should start oral calcium and calcitriol proactively to prevent severe hypocalcemia and readmission, and I should arrange close follow-up given the delayed nadir at 24–72 hours [^ed931cf9] [^1333db9c] [^26422bc8].

> Finally, I should confirm a plan for longitudinal care. For confirmed hypoparathyroidism, I will monitor calcium, phosphate, magnesium, creatinine, and 24-hour urine calcium periodically to balance efficacy with the risk of hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis, and I will consider referral for recombinant PTH therapy in refractory cases; for vitamin D deficiency, I will treat and recheck 25-hydroxyvitamin D in about 3 months; for CKD-MBD, I will align management with KDIGO guidance and adjust calcimimetics and vitamin D analogs based on calcium and phosphate trends [^3829cf5b] [^757090dc] [^cbf7d6fd].

The workup for low calcium (hypocalcemia) begins with **confirming true hypocalcemia** by measuring ionized calcium or correcting total calcium for albumin [^4a5245f3], then **assessing severity and symptoms** to guide urgency [^7704ddc6]. Next, obtain **PTH, vitamin D, magnesium, phosphorus, and creatinine** to classify the cause [^3228fa87], and add a 24-hour urine calcium or calcium/creatinine ratio if PTH is low or normal to distinguish hypoparathyroidism from other etiologies [^0edf4531]. Evaluate for **medications, surgery, and systemic diseases**, and consider genetic testing or imaging only when indicated [^6a22937a]. Management is cause-specific: replete magnesium, treat vitamin D deficiency, and give calcium and active vitamin D for hypoparathyroidism; use IV calcium for symptomatic or severe cases [^3c770ed8].

---

## Step 1: confirm true hypocalcemia

- **Total calcium measurement**: Measure total serum calcium; correct for albumin using the formula: corrected calcium = total calcium + 0.8 × (4.0 − albumin) [^notfound].

- **Ionized calcium measurement**: Preferentially measure ionized calcium when available, especially in critical illness or when albumin is abnormal [^4a5245f3].

- **Repeat testing**: Confirm persistent hypocalcemia with repeat testing to exclude laboratory error [^notfound].

---

## Step 2: assess severity and clinical context

Assess **symptoms and signs** — paresthesia, tetany, seizures, QT prolongation, and cardiac arrhythmias — and determine whether the presentation is acute or chronic, as well as any precipitating factors such as recent surgery, medications, or acute illness [^7704ddc6].

---

## Step 3: initial laboratory evaluation

| **Test** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Parathyroid hormone (PTH) | Differentiates PTH-mediated from non-PTH-mediated hypocalcemia [^0edf4531] |
| 25-hydroxyvitamin D | Identifies vitamin D deficiency as a cause of hypocalcemia [^3228fa87] |
| Magnesium | Hypomagnesemia impairs PTH secretion and action [^1952e26c] |
| Phosphorus | Elevated in hypoparathyroidism; low in vitamin D deficiency [^3b94b2f4] |
| Creatinine | Assesses renal function; CKD affects calcium metabolism [^notfound] |

---

## Step 4: interpret results and classify hypocalcemia

- **Low or inappropriately normal PTH**: Suggests hypoparathyroidism (genetic, autoimmune, postsurgical) [^6a22937a].

- **Elevated PTH**: Suggests secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency, malabsorption, chronic kidney disease, or calcium deficiency [^d5650245].

- **Low magnesium**: Indicates hypomagnesemia-related hypocalcemia [^1952e26c].

- **Low vitamin D**: Indicates vitamin D deficiency as the cause [^3b94b2f4].

---

## Step 5: additional tests based on initial results

- **24-hour urine calcium or calcium/creatinine ratio**: Low in hypoparathyroidism; normal or high in pseudohypoparathyroidism or vitamin D deficiency [^0edf4531].

- **1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D**: Low in hypoparathyroidism; normal or high in vitamin D deficiency [^3b94b2f4].

- **Genetic testing**: Consider for suspected genetic hypoparathyroidism or pseudohypoparathyroidism [^6a22937a].

- **Imaging**: Consider renal ultrasound for nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis in chronic hypocalcemia [^3829cf5b].

---

## Step 6: evaluate for underlying causes

Review **medications** — loop diuretics, bisphosphonates, denosumab, calcimimetics, anticonvulsants, and others — and assess for **recent neck or thyroid surgery** or radiation. Also consider systemic diseases such as chronic kidney disease, liver disease, malabsorption, and autoimmune disorders [^d5650245].

---

## Step 7: management based on etiology

- **Hypomagnesemia**: Replete magnesium first; calcium correction will fail without magnesium repletion [^1333db9c].

- **Vitamin D deficiency**: Replete vitamin D and calcium [^notfound].

- **Hypoparathyroidism**: Calcium and active vitamin D (calcitriol) therapy; monitor for hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis [^3c770ed8].

- **Acute symptomatic hypocalcemia**: Intravenous calcium gluconate for stabilization [^notfound].

---

## Step 8: monitoring and follow-up

Monitor **serum calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and renal function** regularly, and adjust therapy to maintain calcium in the low-normal range to minimize hypercalciuria. Educate patients on symptoms of hypocalcemia and when to seek care [^3829cf5b].

---

The workup for low calcium requires a **structured approach**: confirm true hypocalcemia, assess severity, obtain targeted labs (PTH, vitamin D, magnesium, phosphorus, creatinine), classify the mechanism, and tailor management to the cause, with close follow-up to prevent complications.

Hypocalcaemia is a common clinical scenario in children with a range of aetiological causes. It will often present with common symptoms but may occasionally be identified in an asymptomatic child. An understanding of the physiological regulation of plasma calcium is important in understanding the potential cause of hypocalcaemia and its appropriate management. The age of presentation will influence the likely differential diagnosis. We have presented a stepwise approach to the investigation of hypocalcaemia dependent on the circulating serum parathyroid hormone level at the time of presentation. The acute and long-term management of the underlying condition is also reviewed.

### A practical approach to hypercalcemia [^752c52f4]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a disorder commonly encountered by primary care physicians. The diagnosis often is made incidentally in asymptomatic patients. Clinical manifestations affect the neuromuscular, gastrointestinal, renal, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. The most common causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. Some other important causes of hypercalcemia are medications and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. An initial diagnostic work-up should include measurement of intact parathyroid hormone, and any medications that are likely to be causative should be discontinued. Parathyroid hormone is suppressed in malignancy-associated hypercalcemia and elevated in primary hyperparathyroidism. It is essential to exclude other causes before considering parathyroid surgery, and patients should be referred for parathyroidectomy only if they meet certain criteria. Many patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a benign course and do not need surgery. Hypercalcemic crisis is a life-threatening emergency. Aggressive intravenous rehydration is the mainstay of management in severe hypercalcemia, and antiresorptive agents, such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates, frequently can alleviate the clinical manifestations of hypercalcemic disorders.

### Hypercalcemic hypocalciuria: a critical differential diagnosis for hyperparathyroidism [^0f85c65c]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

A differential diagnosis for hyperparathyroidism includes all causes of hypercalcemia; the primary causes of which are primary hyperparathyroidism and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare condition of primary importance because failure to recognize this entity leads to unnecessary surgery. There are a plethora of other rare causes of hypercalcemia that can be distinguished from primary hyperparathyroidism by history and laboratory profiles. This article discusses the main and less common causes of hypercalcemia and provides guidance for distinguishing among them.

### The investigation of hypocalcaemia and rickets [^4c32c36b]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

Our understanding of disorders that present with hypocalcaemia has advanced rapidly in the past decade. The molecular basis of many of these disorders and conditions associated with phosphate wasting has now been established. While many children will need specialist involvement, they often will present to general paediatricians, and appropriate investigations prior to intervention will enable early diagnosis. Not all children with hypocalcaemia and low or low normal parathyroid hormone levels have isolated hypoparathyroidism, and clinicians need to be aware of the potential for misdiagnosis. Outpatient departments and paediatric wards should have a readily accessible and comprehensive list of bloods that need to be taken when a child presents with hypocalcaemia or rickets.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism: summary statement and guidelines [^0ce46239]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and absent or deficient PTH. This report presents a summary of current information about epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, clinical features, and management and proposes guidelines to help clinicians diagnose, evaluate, and manage this disorder.

Participants

Participants in the First International Conference on the Management of Hypoparathyroidism represented a worldwide constituency with acknowledged interest and expertise in key basic, translational, and clinical aspects of hypoparathyroidism. Three Workshop Panels were constituted to address questions for presentation and discussion at the Conference held in Florence, Italy, May 7–9, 2015. At that time, a series of presentations were made, followed by in-depth discussions in an open forum. Each Workshop Panel also met in closed sessions to formulate the three evidence-based reports that accompany this summary statement. An Expert Panel then considered this information, developed summaries, guidelines, and a research agenda that constitutes this summary statement.

Evidence

Preceding the conference, each Workshop Panel conducted an extensive literature search as noted in the individual manuscripts accompanying this report. All presentations were based upon the best peer-reviewed information taking into account the historical and current literature.

Consensus Process

This report represents the Expert Panel's synthesis of the conference material placed in a context designed to be relevant to clinicians and those engaged in cutting-edge studies of hypoparathyroidism.

Conclusions

This document not only provides a summary of our current knowledge but also places recent advances in its management into a context that should enhance future advances in our understanding of hypoparathyroidism.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^4a5245f3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

In light of these factors, we suggest that unadjusted calcium remains the best and most practical alternative to ionized calcium in most clinical settings. Clinicians should be thoughtful about ordering ionized calcium instead of total calcium. Ionized calcium should be considered to inform on acute management of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients, especially in the critically ill. It should also be considered in patients with preexisting calcium disorders (eg, hypo- or hyperparathyroidism) when the total calcium does not reflect a patient's symptoms or clinical status. This is particularly important in the current health care climate, where there is emphasis on the reduction of unnecessary testing.

### Child with suspected hypocalcemia [^3228fa87]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected hypocalcemia — initial laboratory and/or radiologic work-up can include blood tests: Total and ionized calcium, Albumin, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Alkaline phosphatase, Intact PTH, 25-OH Vitamin D, and 1, 25-dihydroxy-vitamin D; urine testing with a urine calcium to creatinine ratio; and x-ray with chest x-ray to look for thymus in DiGeorge syndrome and wrist x-ray to rule out rickets.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: review and recommendations on evaluation, diagnosis, and management. A Canadian and international consensus [^510b5d39]. Osteoporosis International (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to genetic testing, CTFH 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain a DNA analysis of CaSR, GNA11, or AP2S1 genes to confirm the diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.

---

### Child with suspected hypocalcemia [^3b94b2f4]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Evaluation of pediatric hypocalcemia — other laboratory assessments and phosphorus context are outlined as follows: Other blood tests to be considered are: Intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are consistent with nutritional Vitamin D deficiency, and in this situation, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels may be normal or elevated due to the elevated PTH. The page also notes that parathyroid hormone increases phosphorous excretion leading to low phosphorus levels, while an elevated phosphorous level is seen with poor kidney function or pathology in the parathyroid hormone pathway.

### Imaging features of hypercalcemia: a primer for emergency radiologists [^431175ef]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a marker for a wide variety of underlying etiologies, and its presentation in the emergency setting may be asymptomatic, incidental, or a primary complaint with associated symptoms and physical exam findings. While the workup is initially driven through serum laboratory testing, imaging plays an important role in diagnosis and post-treatment follow up. This review covers multiple common and uncommon etiologies of hypercalcemia, details their underlying mechanisms, and identifies the most important associated imaging findings. It is important for radiologists to be familiar with these etiologies and imaging findings, particularly in the emergency setting since hypercalcemia may represent the only significant laboratory abnormality associated with the presenting condition. Furthermore, the radiologist's interpretation of a study may be directly influenced by knowing about a patient's hypercalcemia.

### Child with suspected hypocalcemia [^d5650245]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected hypocalcemia — differential diagnosis is broadly classified into 3 categories: parathyroid hormone related (hypoparathyroidism due to various causes either congenital or acquired; pseudohypoparathyroidism: the parathyroid hormone is not able to act due to defective PTH receptor), vitamin D related (vitamin D deficiency due to poor nutritional intake, malabsorption, liver disease or kidney disease leading to defective 25-hydroxylation and 1, α-hydroxylation respectively; 1, α-hydroxylase deficiency leading to deficient active form of vitamin D; vitamin D resistance due to defective vitamin D receptor), and nutritional calcium deficiency.

### Assessment and management of patients with abnormal calcium [^fc3276ac]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Calcium is essential for homeostasis, and normocalcemia should be maintained strictly during the perioperative period. The biochemistry of calcium equilibrium results from the calcium-sensing receptors on the parathyroid glands, which detect changes in calcium concentrations and initiate the proper response. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia is a common metabolic derangement that is often discovered on routine serum screening. The most common etiologies are primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer. Increasingly, parathyroidectomy is the preferred therapy for primary hyperparathyroidism. Severe hypercalcemia ("hypercalcemic crisis") should be managed aggressively with a combination of intravenous fluids, steroids, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin. Some of these patients may require an urgent parathyroidectomy for calcium control. Hypocalcemia needs to be verified, as many cases of hypocalcemia are the artifact of hypoalbuminemia. Severe hypocalcemia occurs after subtotal or total parathyroidectomy with auto transplantation as well as after massive resuscitation or blood transfusion. Strategies aimed at correcting calcium concentrations depend on the severity of symptomatology. If symptoms are mild, oral calcium supplementation can be given; otherwise, intravenous calcium should be administered.

### Acute management of hypercalcemia of malignancy – A review of pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^bc8cf9a8]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypercalcemia of malignancy is one of the most common metabolic disorders in patients with cancer and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This narrative review summarizes pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic strategies, and therapies available for the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy in acutely ill adult patients.

Recent Findings

We reviewed both classic and recent literature to provide practical recommendations for managing cancer-related hypercalcemia. Our findings are presented in the context of recently published societal guidelines. Timely identification and treatment of acute hypercalcemia of malignancy is vital. Understanding of the underlying disease processes and available therapies is needed to optimize patient care and healthcare resource utilization.

### Hypoparathyroidism: genetics and diagnosis [^6a22937a]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

This narrative report summarizes diagnostic criteria for hypoparathyroidism and describes the clinical presentation and underlying genetic causes of the nonsurgical forms. We conducted a comprehensive literature search from January 2000 to January 2021 and included landmark articles before 2000, presenting a comprehensive update of these topics and suggesting a research agenda to improve diagnosis and, eventually, the prognosis of the disease. Hypoparathyroidism, which is characterized by insufficient secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) leading to hypocalcemia, is diagnosed on biochemical grounds. Low albumin-adjusted calcium or ionized calcium with concurrent inappropriately low serum PTH concentration are the hallmarks of the disease. In this review, we discuss the characteristics and pitfalls in measuring calcium and PTH. We also undertook a systematic review addressing the utility of measuring calcium and PTH within 24 hours after total thyroidectomy to predict long-term hypoparathyroidism. A summary of the findings is presented here; results of the detailed systematic review are published separately in this issue of JBMR. Several genetic disorders can present with hypoparathyroidism, either as an isolated disease or as part of a syndrome. A positive family history and, in the case of complex diseases, characteristic comorbidities raise the clinical suspicion of a genetic disorder. In addition to these disorders' phenotypic characteristics, which include autoimmune diseases, we discuss approaches for the genetic diagnosis. © 2022 The Authors.

### Health supervision for children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: clinical report [^f929efbf]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Endocrinologic manifestations and management — hypocalcemia and hypoparathyroidism in 22q11.2DS are common, with hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia present in 17% to 60% of persons with 22q11.2DS and overall lifetime prevalence of hypocalcemia reported in up to 80.4% of individuals; hypocalcemia results from aplasia or hypoplasia of the parathyroid glands. Routine screening of both total calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) is important; parents and patients should be educated about symptoms of hypocalcemia, and calcium concentrations should be monitored at least as frequently as indicated in Table 1, with those with cardiac conditions or acute illnesses tested more often as necessary. Diagnosis or concerning symptoms should prompt workup including serum calcium, albumin, phosphate, magnesium, PTH, vitamin D (25-OH-D), and urine calcium/creatinine; hypoparathyroidism manifests as low calcium with an elevated phosphate and inappropriately low PTH, and 25-OH-D should be evaluated. It is recommended that calcium concentrations be checked every 3 to 6 months during the first year of life, then annually thereafter into adulthood, and evaluated preoperatively, postoperatively, and during severe illness. Symptomatic hypocalcemia and hypocalcemic seizures are often initially treated with parenteral calcium along with oral calcitriol and calcium supplementation, and parenteral calcium should be infused slowly per current guidelines.

### Child with suspected hypocalcemia [^1952e26c]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected hypocalcemia — laboratory work up emphasizes checking magnesium and phosphorus; hypomagnesemia will result in hypocalcemia which will not respond to calcium treatment alone, and the serum phosphorous level is a very important part of the work up with low serum phosphorous consistent with pathology in the vitamin D pathway.

### Hypocalcemia in children: pathogenesis and management [^ababbae4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Hypocalcemia can be devastating if unrecognized. Neuromuscular dysfunction occurs in severe cases. A review and an update on the topic may assist general pediatricians. The authors provide a general overview of pathogenesis and management of hypocalcemia in children.

### Hypercalcemia and cancer: differential diagnosis and treatment [^e6f7e105]. CA (2018). Low credibility.

Incidentally detected hypercalcemia usually presents in an indolent manner and is most likely caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. In contrast, hypercalcemia in the patient with a history of cancer presents in a wide range of clinical settings and may be severe enough to warrant hospitalization. This form of hypercalcemia is usually secondary to hypercalcemia of malignancy and can be fatal. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is most commonly mediated by tumoral production of parathyroid hormone-related protein or by cytokines activating osteoclast degradation of bone. The initial workup, differential diagnoses, confirmatory laboratory testing, imaging, and medical and surgical management of hypercalcemia are described in the patient with cancer.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^bacfa03a]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend to diagnose hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism based on an elevated serum calcium level adjusted for albumin in conjunction with an elevated or inappropriately normal intact PTH level, using either a second or third generation assay, on two occasions at least 2 weeks apart.

### When is it appropriate to order an ionized calcium? [^5b949a66]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Convincing evidence demonstrates that ionized calcium and not total calcium is the physiologically relevant component of blood calcium. Direct measurement of ionized calcium, however, is limited by difficulties in accurate analysis, lack of standardization, and need for special handling, all resulting in increased cost; therefore, strategies have been developed to estimate ionized calcium from total calcium adjusted for levels of albumin, measurements that are more available and relatively inexpensive. This commentary compares the advantages and limitations of direct or calculated determinations of ionized calcium. Also examined are available data illustrating the settings in which measurement of ionized calcium is preferred and, in some cases, necessary for clinical decision-making.

### Elevated PTH with normal serum calcium level: a structured approach [^0f0a2910]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism is a common biochemical finding, usually identified during an assessment of bone or renal health. Hypercalcaemia must be considered by calculation of adjusted calcium, and a careful history taken to assess dietary calcium intake and for the possibility of a malabsorption syndrome. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) should be measured and replaced if indicated. The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and PTH were measured. In this brief review we describe the assessment of a patient with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^4d02c147]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) — definitions and diagnostic thresholds — Biochemical hypoPT is defined as a low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level below the laboratory lower limit (usually 12 pg/mL) with hypocalcemia, while clinical hypoPT adds symptoms or signs of hypocalcemia; hypocalcemia itself is a total serum calcium below the center-specific reference range. Transient or temporary hypoPT lasts for less than six months after surgery, and permanent hypoPT continues beyond six months. The short half-life of PTH (3–5 minutes) contributes to postoperative vulnerability of parathyroid function. Parathyroid insufficiency (relative hypoPT) can occur after central neck surgery with symptoms despite normal laboratory values.

### Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia [^0a5c36eb]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management options for benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.

Methods

We present a systematic summary of benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia after review of the current available literature.

Results

Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by lifelong hypercalcemia, relative hypocalciuria, and inappropriately elevated parathyroid hormone. It is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR). Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is important clinically because it can be difficult to distinguish from primary hyperparathyroidism. It is a benign condition, and affected patients should be advised against parathyroidectomy. The incidence of complications associated with primary hyperparathyroidism, like osteopenia and nephrolithiasis, is not increased in persons with benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and the rates are similar to those in the general population. Rarely, a severe form of this disease, namely neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism is seen in infants with homozygous CASR mutations.

Conclusions

Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a small but important cause of hypercalcemia, especially in the younger population. Hypercalcemia persists after subtotal parathyroidectomy. It is important to diagnose this condition, not only in the index case but also in family members, because these patients should be advised against surgical intervention.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder, more specifically with respect to management of hypocalcemia, KDIGO 2017 guidelines recommend to consider tolerating mild and asymptomatic hypocalcemia (in the context of calcimimetic treatment) in adult patients with CKD, in order to avoid inappropriate calcium loading. Consider correcting symptomatic or severe hypocalcemia to prevent adverse consequences, such as bone disease, hyperparathyroidism, and QTc interval prolongation.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^687d7cf2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes, each of which has been studied in detail and has led to evolving concepts about target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

Methods

In the present review, I provide an evidence-based summary of this disorder as it has been studied worldwide, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our concepts about this disease.

Results

PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis. Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

Conclusions

Advances in our knowledge of PHPT have guided new concepts in diagnosis and management.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^92320508]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, VDT is a rare but life-threatening event mostly caused by unintentional overdosing due to pharmaceutical products. The prescriber and dispenser should avoid unlicensed vitamin D products. VDT should always be considered a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with hypercalcemia. Future studies should encompass the evaluation of concurrent conditions that increase the risk of VDT and include the evaluation of classic and nonclassic adverse events for VDT.

Statement 5: In patients with biochemical hypoparathyroidism and/or low serum calcium levels and/or manifestations of hypocalcaemia, measurements of calcium should be repeated as necessary to assure diagnosis and to allow tailoring of calcium and/or active vitamin D analogue supplements.

Evidence level: Moderate

According to the ATA statement, transient hypoparathyroidism refers to cases lasting < 6 months following surgery, whereas permanent hypoparathyroidism persists beyond that time frame. These two classifications are based on and expand upon existing literature, supported by extensive research and data. Relative hypoparathyroidism, though characterized by normal serum PTH and calcium levels, still necessitates treatment due to clinically relevant symptoms or signs of hypocalcaemia. While the ATA's diagnostic criteria for hypoparathyroidism are valuable for identifying patients based on hypocalcaemia symptoms and guiding clinical care, they may not accurately reflect the true incidence — potentially leading to either underestimation or overestimation. Qiu et al.found that PTH levels recovered between 6 and 12 months after thyroid surgery with central neck dissection in 25.4% of patients diagnosed with permanent hypoparathyroidism at 6 months after surgery and that PTH levels recovered or did not recover after 12 months in 74.6% of patients. This phenomenon can be partly explained by the fact that most autotransplanted parathyroid glands typically require 2–6 weeks to gradually regain function, although, in some cases, full recovery may take several months. Villarroya-Marquina et al.studied 854 patients undergoing total thyroidectomy and found that 14.5% of patients had postoperative hypoparathyroidism, with their parathyroid function recovering at different times (< 6 months in 8.5%, 6–12 months in 2.5%, and > 12 months in 1.4%; 4.2% of patients did not recover during follow-up). These data support the 12-month threshold for distinguishing transient from permanent hypoparathyroidism, as a substantial proportion of patients continue to show recovery of parathyroid function between 6 and 12 months after surgery. This approach is consistent with the most recent definition developed and approved by an international panel of experts presented as part of the best practice recommendations discussed at the Parathyroid Summit, held as a pre-Endocrine Society meeting in May 2024 (Boston, MA, USA), stating that a diagnosis of permanent hypoparathyroidism is confirmed ≥ 12 months after surgical intervention in the presence of hypocalcaemia (albumin-adjusted or ionized calcium) determined on two separate occasions (≥ 2 weeks apart) with inappropriately normal or low PTH levels.

### Assessment and clinical course of hypocalcemia in critical illness [^97f2d2f7]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Hypocalcaemia is common in critical illness but tends to normalize during the early days of admission to intensive care.

- In most cases normalization of calcium status is not associated with improved outcome, however mortality may be higher in severely hypocalcaemic patients who remain hypocalcemic on the fourth day of their admission.

- Calcium supplementation does not improve either calcium normalization or survival and a large randomized controlled trial is required to assess the effectiveness and side effects of this intervention.

- Albumin-adjusted calcium is a poor predictor of low ionized calcium in critical illness and should not be used in this setting.

- Low magnesium, sodium and albumin are independently associated with low ionized calcium and this should be considered in the overall management of each patient.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^49e894cb]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment and prevention of hypocalcaemia

Hypocalcaemia in patients with cancer can have severe consequences, whether occurring with or without the use of inhibitors of bone resorption, but responds well to calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Furthermore, when treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption is required for the management of metastatic bone disease, hypocalcaemia can usually be prevented by identification and appropriate management of at-risk patients. Case reports and retrospective analyses have identified a number of risk factors associated with the development of hypocalcaemia in those receiving inhibitors of bone resorption; these include vitamin D deficiency, renal insufficiency, osteoblastic metastases, prostate cancer, and low baseline blood calcium levels (Table 2). It is therefore important that vitamin D and calcium levels are assessed and supplementation initiated before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption. This evaluation is particularly important given the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency among patients with metastatic cancer. Furthermore, all patients receiving inhibitors of bone resorption for the prevention of SREs should receive concomitant calcium and vitamin D supplementation; use of these supplements has been shown to lower the risk of developing hypocalcaemia by 27% and 40% in patients receiving zoledronic acid or denosumab, respectively. An interim analysis of an open-label observational study of treatment persistence in patients with cancer who were receiving denosumab to prevent SREs found that most patients (80%) received calcium and vitamin D supplementation at the start of denosumab treatment. Long-term follow-up persistence data, however, are not yet available. Previous reports suggest that adherence to calcium and vitamin D supplementation is low; patients should, therefore, be counselled on the importance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake in order to improve adherence. Use of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active metabolite of vitamin D, might offer further advantages in the prevention and treatment of hypocalcaemia; however, trials are required to confirm this.

Although hypocalcaemia can occur at any time during treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption, studies show that it often develops soon after treatment initiation; within 7 days, in some cases. Therefore, careful monitoring of at-risk patients after starting treatment is important to enable quick detection and resolution of hypocalcaemia. At-risk patients should also be educated about the symptoms of hypocalcaemia and encouraged to report any indicative symptoms. If hypocalcaemia occurs while a patient is receiving inhibitors of bone resorption, additional calcium and vitamin D supplementation and further monitoring are advised. Delaying the administration of inhibitors of bone resorption because of hypocalcaemia is rarely necessary.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of thyroid disease in adults [^af0424d2]. AAES (2020). High credibility.

Rapid parathyroid hormone testing — Some surgeons use rapid intra- or postoperative PTH testing during total or reoperative thyroidectomy to help determine the likelihood of postoperative hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism. Protocols vary but the most common consists of serum PTH measurements at the beginning of surgery and again 10 minutes following removal of the thyroid gland. Interpretation thresholds vary widely and are not internationally standardized. In a meta-analysis of 14 studies, intraoperative PTH testing helped predict postoperative hypocalcemia, but there was no difference in utility versus early (within 1–4 h) postoperative PTH measurement. Recommendation 45: Rapid PTH measurement during or after completion thyroidectomy may help to manage patients at risk for hypocalcemia. (Weak recommendation, moderatequality evidence)

### Rapid fire: hypercalcemia [^d1247de0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is commonly encountered in the clinical setting and requires identification by the clinician to avoid disastrous patient outcomes. The 2 most common causes are malignancy and hyperparathyroidism. The underlying cause for hypercalcemia may be readily known at presentation or may require further investigation. After identification, acuity of treatment will depend on severity of calcium level and symptoms. In the emergency setting, intravenous hydration with isotonic fluids is the treatment mainstay. Other commonly used medications to further decrease calcium include bisphosphates, calcitonin, steroids, and (rarely) furosemide. In life-threatening circumstances, dialysis can be implemented.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: an update on diagnostic and management challenges [^87825e41]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition that can present with intermittent hypercalcemia or may evolve into hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. This milder biochemical entity remains incompletely understood because of a lack of long-term health outcomes regarding both medical and surgical approaches to its management. Medical therapies have shown some efficacy. A limited number of studies have found that bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density, and calcimimetics may decrease the risk of nephrolithiasis in patients with normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism. Studies have also described patient outcomes after applying the same surgical criteria used for patients with hypercalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism to those with the normocalcaemic form of the disease. These studies suggest that parathyroid surgery appears to be effective in normalizing elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and decreasing adverse renal and skeletal outcomes in patients with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism. Given the available data and overall lack of consensus regarding the optimal management of these patients, a reasonable approach is to tailor treatment to the individual patient by considering their risk factors for new or accelerated bone loss, kidney stones, diminished quality of life, and cardiovascular disease.

There has been a shift in the referral patterns in recent years that has resulted in increasing numbers of patients being referred to surgeons with a diagnosis of hypercalcemia rather than primary hyperparathyroidism. The surgeon must perform a thorough history, including medications, and laboratory assessment, including serum calcium and parathyroid hormone measurements. A 24-hour urinary calcium excretion should be routinely ordered to exclude FHH.

Here we review what is known about parathyroid gland autoimmunity, focusing on recently-proposed parathyroid autoantibody markers, and particularly those directed against NACHT leucine-rich-repeat protein 5 and calcium-sensing receptor. We also describe the clinical characteristics of HP and design a diagnostic algorithm for autoimmune HP.

Statement 1: Biochemical postoperative hypoparathyroidism is defined by an undetectable or low PTH (less than the lower limit of the centre-specific reference range) with or without hypocalcaemia.

Consensus: Yes (8.088)

Outliers: 8

Negative outliers: 2

Evidence level: Moderate

A systematic review and meta-analysis recently analysed 188 studies on the definition and early diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism; it found that postoperative PTH measurements within 24 h had higher sensitivity and specificity than intraoperative PTH for predicting hypoparathyroidism, thresholds of < 10 pg/ml and < 15 pg/ml were both reliable for identifying patients at risk, no specific time point within the first 24 h (for example 1 h, 6 h versus 12 h versus 24 h) was superior, and any measurement within postoperative day 1 (POD1) was effective. Nowadays, measuring PTH within 24 h is considered standard practice in many endocrine surgery centres. It allows for early identification of patients at risk of hypoparathyroidism, timely initiation of calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation, and safe discharge for individuals at low risk of hypoparathyroidism. This timing is also used in registry protocols and quality improvement initiatives to benchmark outcomes. In addition, measuring serum PTH levels 1–6 h after total or completion thyroidectomy provides high predictive accuracy for identifying the need for supplementation to prevent symptoms that may require readmission. This approach enables selective supplementation and supports safe early discharge, particularly in outpatient thyroidectomy protocols where timely discharge decisions are critical.

Statement 2: The first postoperative PTH level should be measured within 24 h.

Consensus: Yes (8.022)

Outliers: 9

Negative outliers: 8

Evidence level: Moderate

GA voting: Agree: 78.25%, Disagree: 21.75%. In addition, 66.78% of voters preferred this measurement to be done 1–6 h after surgery.

Hypoparathyroidism is a clinically heterogeneous condition, where biochemical markers like PTH and calcium are essential for diagnosis, but symptom severity varies widely and may not align with laboratory values.

Statement 3: Postoperative hypoparathyroidism may be an asymptomatic condition or it can become clinically apparent with a variety of manifestations ranging from mild numbness and tingling, muscle cramps, tetany, and seizures to life-threatening laryngospasm and cardiac arrhythmia.

### Failure to diagnose and treat hyperparathyroidism among patients with hypercalcemia: opportunities for intervention at the patient and physician level to increase surgical referral [^0f574144]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperparathyroidism is both underdiagnosed and undertreated, but the reasons for these deficiencies have not been described. The purpose of this study was to identify reasons for underdiagnosis and undertreatment of hyperparathyroidism that could be addressed by targeted interventions.

Materials and Methods

We identified 3,200 patients with hypercalcemia (serum calcium > 10.5 mg/dL) who had parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels evaluated at our institution from 2011 to 2016. We randomly sampled 60 patients and divided them into three groups based on their PTH levels. Two independent reviewers examined clinical notes and diagnostic data to identify reasons for delayed diagnosis or referral for treatment.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 61 ± 16.5 years, 68% were women, and 55% were white. Fifty percent of patients had ≥ 1 elevated calcium that was missed by their primary care provider. Hypercalcemia was frequently attributed to causes other than hyperparathyroidism, including diuretics (12%), calcium supplements (12%), dehydration (5%), and renal dysfunction (3%). Even when calcium and PTH were both elevated, the diagnosis was missed or delayed in 40% of patients. For 7% of patients, a nonsurgeon stated that surgery offered no benefit; 22% of patients were offered medical treatment or observation, and 8% opted not to see a surgeon. Only 20% of patients were referred for surgical evaluation, and they waited a median of 16 months before seeing a surgeon.

Conclusion

To address common causes for delayed diagnosis and treatment of hyperparathyroidism, we must improve systems for recognizing hypercalcemia and better educate patients and providers about the consequences of untreated disease.

Implications For Practice

This study identified reasons why patients experience delays in workup, diagnosis, and treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism. These data provide valuable information for developing interventions that increase rates of diagnosis and referral.

### Epidemiology and diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism [^dc2ae67e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Hypoparathyroidism is a disorder characterized by hypocalcemia due to insufficient secretion of PTH. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a less common disorder due to target organ resistance to PTH. This report summarizes the results of the findings and recommendations of the Working Group on Epidemiology and Diagnosis of Hypoparathyroidism.

Evidence Acquisition

Each contributing author reviewed the recent published literature regarding epidemiology and diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism using PubMed and other medical literature search engines.

Evidence Synthesis

The prevalence of hypoparathyroidism is an estimated 37 per 100 000 person-years in the United States and 22 per 100 000 person-years in Denmark. The incidence in Denmark is approximately 0.8 per 100 000 person-years. Estimates of prevalence and incidence of hypoparathyroidism are currently lacking in most other countries. Hypoparathyroidism increases the risk of renal insufficiency, kidney stones, posterior subcapsular cataracts, and intracerebral calcifications, but it does not appear to increase overall mortality, cardiovascular disease, fractures, or malignancy. The diagnosis depends upon accurate measurement of PTH by second- and third-generation assays. The most common etiology is postsurgical hypoparathyroidism, followed by autoimmune disorders and rarely genetic disorders. Even more rare are etiologies including parathyroid gland infiltration, external radiation treatment, and radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid disease. Differentiation between these different etiologies is aided by the clinical presentation, serum biochemistries, and in some cases, genetic testing.

Conclusions

Hypoparathyroidism is often associated with complications and comorbidities. It is important for endocrinologists and other physicians who care for these patients to be aware of recent advances in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and genetics of this disorder.

### Medical management of postsurgical hypoparathyroidism [^3a63397d]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a clinical update on the management of hypoparathyroidism with focus on postsurgical hypoparathyroidism.

Methods

Using PubMed, English-language literature was searched related to management of hypoparathyroidism after thyroid and parathyroid surgery. We discuss the incidence, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, early diagnosis, and treatment of transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism.

Results

Hypoparathyroidism is a well-recognized complication after thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Transient hypoparathyroidism occurs in 10% of patients who undergo total thyroidectomy. Less than half of patients who develop transient hypoparathyroidism after thyroid surgery develop permanent hypoparathyroidism. Postsurgical hypocalcemia resulting from inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion could cause neurologic complications and respiratory compromise. Calcium supplements and vitamin D analogues effectively treat hypocalcemia associated with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. Measurement of PTH after thyroid and parathyroid surgery allows early identification of patients likely to require calcium supplements and vitamin D analogue therapy. Early identification and appropriate management of postsurgical hypoparathyroidism prevent hypocalcemia-related complications and allow patients to be discharged from the hospital earlier. Patients who develop permanent hypoparathyroidism should receive appropriate follow-up care to monitor for long-term complications related to supplemental therapy. PTH replacement therapy is currently being evaluated for the treatment of transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach involving an endocrinologist and surgeon is imperative to reduce the morbidity associated with hypoparathyroidism after thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Supplemental therapy with calcium and vitamin D analogues is standard. New drugs currently in clinical trials offer promising treatment options.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^f7747f23]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association postoperative hypoparathyroidism — risk factors, thresholds, and management are summarized as follows: Hypoparathyroidism occurs when a low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is accompanied by hypocalcemia. Risk factors for post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism include bilateral thyroid operations, autoimmune thyroid disease, central neck dissection, substernal goiter, surgeon inexperience, and malabsorptive conditions. Measurement of intraoperative or early postoperative PTH levels following thyroidectomy can help guide patient management, and in general, a postoperative PTH level ≤ 15 pg/mL indicates increased risk for acute hypoparathyroidism. Effective management of mild to moderate potential or actual postoperative hypoparathyroidism can be achieved by administering either empiric/prophylactic oral calcium and vitamin D, selective oral calcium and vitamin D based on rapid postoperative PTH level(s), or serial serum calcium levels as a guide for supplementation; for more severe hypocalcemia, inpatient management may be necessary. Permanent hypoparathyroidism has long-term consequences for both objective and subjective well-being, and should be prevented whenever possible.

### Global guidance for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of tumor-induced osteomalacia [^ccaeb282]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Biochemical workup and features

The challenges associated with diagnostic testing have been recently reviewed by Brandi et al; for the purposes of this global guidance document, we will focus on the most salient points for clinicians to bear in mind. The first necessary step to diagnosis requires measuring serum phosphate in anyone being evaluated for musculoskeletal symptoms (Fig. 2). Serum phosphate should be measured on a morning, fasting blood specimen. Serum phosphate concentration is normally higher in young children and decreases with age; therefore, it is important to make sure that an age‐specific normal range is used. In adults, hypophosphatemia is defined as levels below 0.8 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). To establish chronic hypophosphatemia, there must be two values below the normal range on at least two occasions ≥ 2 weeks apart.

One study showed that, among 144 patients with TIO, 43.1% of cases with hypophosphatemia were not treated or misdiagnosed, and only 11.8% of patients seeking medical care for the first time were tested for serum phosphate.

Comprehensive laboratory evaluation should include complete blood count, fasting serum phosphate, serum creatinine, calcium, albumin, and total alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Additional variables, including PTH, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, and FGF23, should also be measured (Table 3, Fig. 2). It should be emphasized that not all assays are standardized, and not all labs use the same reference values, so care must be taken when interpreting results.

Measurement of 25(OH)D levels is necessary for diagnosing vitamin D deficiency, a common cause of hypophosphatemia and rickets/osteomalacia that must be differentiated from TIO. However, vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is frequent in the general population, and a low 25(OH)D level does not rule out the possibility of concurrent TIO. In fact, persistent hypophosphatemia after correction of vitamin D deficiency should prompt consideration that the patient may have TIO. Iron deficiency may indicate a need for potentially different patient management.

Post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism — incidence variability and definitional criteria are outlined as follows: Hypoparathyroidism is the most common complication of bilateral and re-operative thyroid operations. Reported rates are influenced by different time points after surgery, diverse electrolyte supplementation protocols, variable operation aggressiveness and surgeon expertise, and by variable use of clinical criteria including symptomatic versus asymptomatic hypocalcemia, biochemical criteria (serum parathyroid hormone [PTH] and/or calcium and/or ionized calcium), and treatment criteria (requirement for calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation). According to a recent meta-analysis, the median incidence of temporary and permanent hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy ranges from 19% to 38% and 0% to 3%, respectively.

American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES) management of significant post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia — Recommendation 61 states: "Patients with significant post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia should receive oral calcium as first-line therapy, calcitriol as necessary, and intravenous calcium in severe or refractory situations. (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence)". Practical dosing and adjuncts include: "Oral calcium carbonate is widely available without prescription, usually well tolerated, and a typical postoperative dose is 1–2 g, 2–3 times daily with prompt dose escalation as required for symptom relief (excess ingestion is readily excreted)". If symptoms persist with oral calcium, "oral calcitriol should also be initiated, at a typical dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mcg twice daily", and laboratory evaluation can guide management: "Phosphorus level can help to distinguish between bone hunger (normal PO4) and hypoparathyroidism (elevated PO4). Magnesium and 25-OH vitamin D levels should also be checked". For severe cases, infusion is preferred: "Intravenous boluses of calcium are not recommended due to their short-lived effect; infusions of calcium over several hours are more effective and preferred".

### Diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop [^6ac03dcd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on the use of diagnostic tests for this condition in clinical practice.

Participants

This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee to address key questions related to the diagnosis of PHPT. Consensus was established at a closed meeting of the Expert Panel that followed.

Evidence

Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search (on PubMed), and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

Consensus Process

Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared by all authors, with comments relating to accuracy from the diagnosis subgroup and by representatives from the participating professional societies.

Conclusions

We conclude that: 1) reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals; 2) second- and third-generation PTH assays are both helpful in the diagnosis of PHPT; 3) normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation of PHPT with hypercalcemia; 4) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations should be measured and, if vitamin D insufficiency is present, it should be treated as part of any management course; 5) genetic testing has the potential to be useful in the differential diagnosis of familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) [^23990978]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

CKD stage 5D — pharmacologic management of increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels is guided as follows: In patients with CKD stage 5D and increased or increasing PTH levels, we suggest that calcitriol, vitamin D analogues, calcimimetics, or a combination of calcimimetics and calcitriol or vitamin D analogues be used to decrease PTH levels (2B). It is reasonable that the initial drug selection for the treatment of increased PTH level be based on serum calcium and phosphorus levels and other aspects of CKD-MBD (not graded), and it is reasonable that calcium- or non–calcium-based phosphate binder dosage be adjusted so that treatments to control PTH levels do not compromise phosphorus and calcium levels (not graded). We recommend that in patients with hypercalcemia, calcitriol or other vitamin D sterol be reduced or stopped (1B), and we suggest that in patients with hyperphosphatemia, calcitriol or other vitamin D sterol be reduced or stopped (2D). We suggest that in patients with hypocalcemia, calcimimetics be reduced or stopped depending on severity, concomitant medications, and clinical signs and symptoms (2D), and we suggest that if iPTH levels decrease to less than 2 times the upper reference limit for the assay, calcitriol, vitamin D analogues, and/or calcimimetics be reduced or stopped (2C). There are no data supporting the clinical superiority of any vitamin D analogues available in the United States compared with calcitriol or placebo.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^5bf2109f]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Potential harms — screening and treatment considerations: Screening may misclassify persons with a vitamin D deficiency because of uncertainty about the cutoff for deficiency and variability of available testing assays, which can lead to overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis. A rare but potential harm of treatment with vitamin D is toxicity characterized by marked hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalciuria; however, the 25(OH)D level associated with toxicity (typically > 150 ng/mL) is well above the level considered sufficient, and in general, treatment with oral vitamin D does not seem to be associated with serious harms.

### Parathyroid disorders [^1833c46a]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Disorders of the parathyroid glands most commonly present with abnormalities of serum calcium. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the most common cause of hypercalcemia in outpatients, are often asymptomatic or may have bone disease, nephrolithiasis, or neuromuscular symptoms. Patients with chronic kidney disease may develop secondary hyperparathyroidism with resultant chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. Hypoparathyroidism most often occurs after neck surgery; it can also be caused by autoimmune destruction of the glands and other less common problems. Evaluation of patients with abnormal serum calcium levels includes a history and physical examination; repeat measurement of serum calcium level; and measurement of creatinine, magnesium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone levels. The treatment for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is parathyroidectomy. Management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism includes monitoring symptoms; serum calcium and creatinine levels; and bone mineral density. Patients with hypoparathyroidism require close monitoring and vitamin D (e.g., calcitriol) replacement.

### Mild primary hyperparathyroidism: a literature review [^a2b0da34]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

The biochemical profile of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) consists of both elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The standard of care is parathyroidectomy unless prohibited by medical comorbidities. Because more patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, there is a subset of people identified with a biochemically mild form of the pHPT that expresses itself as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not fall into the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines, and they can present a challenge of diagnosis and management. The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT in an effort to better characterize this patient population and to determine whether patients benefit from parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that there are patients with mild pHPT who have overt symptoms that are found to improve after parathyroidectomy. There is also a group of patients with biochemically mild pHPT who are found to progress to classic pHPT over time; however, it is not predictable which group of patients this will be. Early intervention for this group with mild pHPT may prevent progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications, and parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high volume centers.

### Hypoparathyroidism [^acf27ecd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and low or undetectable levels of parathyroid hormone.

Methods

This review is an evidence-based summary of hypoparathyroidism in terms of relevant pathophysiological, clinical, and therapeutic concepts.

Results

Many clinical manifestations of hypoparathyroidism are due to the lack of the physiological actions of parathyroid hormone on its 2 major target organs: the skeleton and the kidney. The skeleton is inactive, accruing bone without remodeling it. The kidneys lose the calcium-conserving actions of parathyroid hormone and, thus, excrete a greater fraction of calcium. Biochemical manifestations, besides hypocalcemia and low or undetectable levels of parathyroid hormone, include hyperphosphatemia and low levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Calcifications in the kidney, brain, and other soft tissues are common. Removal of, or damage to, the parathyroid glands at the time of anterior neck surgery is, by far, the most likely etiology. Autoimmune destruction of the parathyroid glands and other genetic causes represent most of the other etiologies. Conventional treatment with calcium and active vitamin D can maintain the serum calcium level but high doses may be required, adding to the risk of long-term soft tissue calcifications. The advent of replacement therapy with recombinant human PTH(1–84) represents a major step in the therapeutics of this disease.

Conclusions

Advances in our knowledge of hypoparathyroidism have led to greater understanding of the disease itself and our approach to it.

### Assessment and clinical course of hypocalcemia in critical illness [^5279904b]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this large retrospective, observational study hypocalcemia was a very common abnormality in patients upon admission to intensive care. The prevalence of 55% was slightly lower than recently reported values, which have ranged to beyond 80%, probably reflecting higher cut off values for hypocalcemia. We chose an ionized calcium concentration of 1.1 mmol/L as cutoff, as this is the lower reference value in our hospital. Other papers have used values lower than this, highlighting the difficulty in comparing prevalence figures.

In contrast to several previous reports we found no significant association between hypocalcemia on admission and mortality. Several authors have described a significantly higher mortality rate in severely hypocalcemic patients in particular and suggested that it is in this group in which the association is clinically significant. We could not confirm this, despite a trend in that direction, probably due to the small number of severely hypocalcemic patients in our study. However, in our study, patients with low ionized calcium had a longer stay on the ICU, and this finding was most prominent in severely hypocalcemic patients. It is uncertain whether this is a causal relationship as severely hypocalcemic patients may represent a more severely ill subset of intensive care patients, requiring longer stays. Alternatively, the diagnoses of severely hypocalcemic patients may differ from other groups, although assessing this possibility is beyond the scope of this study.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the time course of calcium levels over the early days of admission to intensive care. We found that both mild and severe hypocalcemia shows sustained improvement over the first 4 days of admission. There was no difference in the pattern of change of ionized calcium concentrations in survivors and non-survivors. Furthermore, in patients with mild hypocalcemia on admission, there was no difference in mortality between those who did and did not normalize their ionized calcium by day 4 post admission. However, among patients with severe hypocalcemia on admission, there was a notable but not statistically significant increase in mortality in those who had failed to normalize their ionized calcium levels by day 4. The failure to reach statistical significance was most likely due to the small number of patients who were severely hypocalcemic on admission and in whom calcium levels were available on day 4. It appears that in patients with mild hypocalcemia on admission, normalization of ionized calcium level does not have an influence on mortality. However, in patients with severe hypocalcemia, normalization of calcium concentrations may be less likely to occur and mortality may be higher in this group, suggesting they could be targets for intervention.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^0680096a]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Graves' disease postoperative calcium management — strategies and risk assessment (Recommendation 29) states that following thyroidectomy for GD, alternative strategies may be undertaken for management of calcium levels, with a weak recommendation, low-quality evidence: serum calcium with or without intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels can be measured and supplementation given based on results, or prophylactic calcium with or without calcitriol prescribed empirically. Low iPTH levels (< 10–15 pg/mL) in the immediate postoperative setting appear to predict symptomatic hypocalcemia and need for supplementation. Patients can be discharged if asymptomatic and their serum calcium levels corrected for albumin are 8.0 mg/ dL (2.0 mmol/L) or above and are not falling over a 24-hour period. Persistent hypocalcemia may warrant measurement of serum magnesium and possible repletion; following discharge, serum iPTH should be measured in persistent hypocalcemia to determine if permanent hypoparathyroidism is present or whether "bone hunger" is ongoing. In patients with severe hypocalcemia, teriparatide has yielded encouraging preliminary results, but more data are needed before it can be considered for clinical practice; intravenous calcium gluconate should be readily available and may be administered if symptoms worsen despite oral therapy.

### How should hypomagnesaemia be investigated and treated? [^1333db9c]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Hypomagnesaemia is relatively common, with an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 2.5% to 15%. It may result from inadequate magnesium intake, increased gastrointestinal or renal loss or redistribution from extracellular to intracellular space. Drug-induced hypomagnesaemia, particularly related to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, is being increasingly recognized. Most patients with hypomagnesaemia are asymptomatic; symptomatic magnesium depletion is often associated with multiple other biochemical abnormalities, including hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia and metabolic acidosis. Manifestations of symptomatic hypomagnesaemia most often involve neuromuscular, cardiovascular and metabolic features. Patients with symptomatic hypomagnesaemia should be treated with intravenous magnesium, reserving oral replacement for asymptomatic patients.

### An algorithm informed by the parathyroid hormone level reduces hypocalcemic complications of thyroidectomy [^cb2e87ba]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The management of hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy (TTx) remains a challenge. Transient hypocalcemia is one of the most common postoperative complications of TTx, occurring in 17–26% of patients, and it results from direct injury to, devascularization of, or accidental removal of the parathyroid glands. Though early postoperative hypocalcemia is reversible in the great majority of cases, permanent hypoparathyroidism is likely much more common than previously suspected.

To manage postoperative hypocalcemia, most practitioners obtain serial serum calcium measurements and respond appropriately to low levels. Recently, several groups have advocated measurement of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) level several hours after operation in order to predict the development of hypocalcemia. This practice has not been widely adopted, nor has it been incorporated into a standardized system of care for patients undergoing TTx.

In the present study, we examined the impact of a management algorithm incorporating the postoperative PTH level as a means of preempting the development of hypocalcemia after TTx.

In this population, 25(OH)D thresholds that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials, and the panel suggests against (a) routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making (ie, vitamin D vs no vitamin D) and (b) routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing. This recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia).

### Neonatal hypocalcemia: common, uncommon, and rare etiologies [^58cce027]. NeoReviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Calcium homeostasis in the neonatal period is a reflection of the transition from placental regulation to hormonal maturation in the newborn. Hypocalcemia occurring within the first 72 hours after birth, termed early-onset hypocalcemia (EOH), is more common and often asymptomatic. Hypocalcemia occurring beyond 72 hours of age is termed late-onset hypocalcemia (LOH). LOH is less common than EOH, and affected patients are more likely to be symptomatic. To prevent and treat hypocalcemia in the newborn, neonatal clinicians should be familiar with the common, uncommon, and rare etiologies of EOH and LOH, as summarized in this review.

### Persistent hypercalcemia with similar familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia features: a case report and literature review [^11390c78]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypercalcemia has an expanded differential diagnosis of approximately over 25 diseases. Mild-to-moderate hypercalcemia with non-suppressed or high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels present in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), typically. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder among the general population especially in middle age people and the female gender. Factors favoring PHPT include a history of renal calculi, an asymptomatic patient with a stable prolonged mild hypercalcemia, and rarely the induction of hypercalcemia by thiazides. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) and the use of certain medications, such as lithium, could mimic PHPT presentations and should be considered in the differential diagnoses of hypercalcemia with non-suppressed PTH.

FHH, also called familial benign hypercalcemia, was initially introduced as a variant of PHPT. It is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder with very low urinary calcium excretion and mild hypercalcemia with high normal or slightly elevated PTH. FHH is a life-long condition that is usually caused by one of many heterozygous inactivating mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) gene, which could up-regulate the set point of parathyroid cells. When the CASR receptor is inactivated, PTH is not suppressed despite its relatively high calcium, which makes FHH similar to PHPT. In PHPT, although the renal reabsorption of calcium is higher than normal due to the high PTH level, hypercalciuria still occurs. However, in FHH due to CASR inactivation, a general calcium hyposensitivity occurs which results in more tubular calcium reabsorption. So, calcium/creatinine clearance ratio (CCCR = [24 h urine calcium/ total plasma calcium] × [plasma creatinine /24 h urine creatinine]) is lower in FHH compared to PHPT.

In addition to familial forms of FHH which existed from the beginning of life, there are other acquired and sporadic forms with unrevealing family screening; including de novo CASR gene mutations, and CASR autoantibodies. Patients with CASR autoantibodies mimic the hereditary FHH in biochemical phenotype and could develop FHH-like syndrome. Auto-immune hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is different in pathogenesis from the one caused by inactivating mutations of the CASR. So, a combination of clinical suspicion, biochemical testing, and genetic analysis is needed to distinguish FHH from PHPT. This case is challenging because findings in this case report were not entirely consistent with any of FHH, PHPT, and FHH-like syndrome.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^83ca9279]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism characterised by hypercalcaemia and elevated or inappropriately normal concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Almost always, primary hyperparathyroidism is due to a benign overgrowth of parathyroid tissue either as a single gland (80% of cases) or as a multiple gland disorder (15–20% of cases). Primary hyperparathyroidism is generally discovered when asymptomatic but the disease always has the potential to become symptomatic, resulting in bone loss and kidney stones. In countries where biochemical screening tests are not common, symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism tends to predominate. Another variant of primary hyperparathyroidism has been described in which the serum calcium concentration is within normal range but parathyroid hormone is elevated in the absence of any obvious cause. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by removal of the parathyroid gland or glands but identification of patients who are best advised to have surgery requires consideration of the guidelines that are regularly updated. Recommendations for patients who do not undergo parathyroid surgery include monitoring of serum calcium concentrations and bone density.

### Investigation and management of hypercalcaemia in children [^6a704d8a]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Hypercalcaemia is a far less common finding in children than in adults. It may present with characteristic symptoms or may be identified as a coincidental finding in children investigated for a variety of complaints. Assessment of hypercalcaemia requires an understanding of the normal physiological regulation of plasma calcium by the combined actions of parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and the calcium sensing receptor. Hypercalcaemia will usually require treatment using a number of different modalities but occasionally it can be due to a benign asymptomatic condition that requires no intervention. This article presents a logical approach to the investigation and subsequent management of this condition.

### Initial assessment and monitoring of patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism: a systematic current practice survey [^3829cf5b]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is associated with significant morbidity and impaired quality of life (QoL). The goals of management for chronic HypoPT include improvement in QoL and the prevention of both hypo- and hypercalcemia symptoms and long-term complications. Several groups have provided consensus statements and guidelines on the management of HypoPT; however, due to limited evidence, these recommendations have largely been based on literature reviews, expert opinion, and consensus statements. The objective of this study was to use a systematic approach to describe current practice for the initial assessment and follow-up of patients with chronic HypoPT. We developed a survey asking experts in the field to select the responses that best reflect their current practice. The survey found no differences in responses between nonsurgical and postsurgical patient assessment. For new patients, respondents usually performed an assessment of serum lab profile (calcium [either albumin-adjusted or ionized], magnesium, creatinine, phosphate, 25-hydroxyvitamin D), 24-hour urine (creatinine, calcium), and a renal ultrasound to evaluate for the presence of nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis. For follow-up patients, most respondents perform blood tests and urine tests every 6months or less frequently. The reported clinical practice patterns for monitoring for complications of chronic HypoPT vary considerably among respondents. Based on the responses in this systematic expert practice survey, we provide practice suggestions for initial assessment and follow-up of patients with chronic HypoPT. In addition, we highlight areas with significant variation in practice and identify important areas for future research. © 2022 The Authors.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ac90b227]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^6ae761ab]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — monitoring and timing after thyroidectomy requires anticipating the delayed calcium nadir and structured labs, as the nadir may occur 24–72 hours after thyroidectomy; postoperative measurement of absolute values and trends of total or ionized calcium blood levels are the mainstays of clinical monitoring, and at least one perioperative serum albumin level should be measured to allow calculation of corrected calcium; the cost of measuring ionized calcium level can be significantly higher than measuring serum calcium.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ad84a827]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) ungraded good practice statements — The panel lists eight UGPSs: 1) "adequate hydration with intravenous (IV) fluids is first-line therapy while awaiting the effect of antiresorptive drugs" and therapy should be "tailored according to cardiac function"; 2) "dental hygiene and oral health, including visual examination of the mouth, should be monitored" during antiresorptive therapy; 3) to avoid hypocalcemia with antiresorptives, "vitamin D levels should be monitored and managed in accordance with Endocrine Society vitamin D guidelines", noting "These guidelines are however not specific to patients with HCM"; 4) "renal function (creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) should be assessed prior to administration of IV BPs"; 5) in renal insufficiency ("creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min") treated with IV BPs, use "renal BP dosing of zoledronic acid over 30 to 60 minutes or renal BP dosing of pamidronate over 2 to 24 hours"; 6) "serum magnesium and phosphorous levels should be monitored and repleted if deemed to be low"; 7) "clinical oncology consultation to guide treatment of the underlying malignancy should be obtained"; and 8) for hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma, "surgical consultation should be pursued for definitive treatment".

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^27e6a0ae]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — prophylactic postoperative management can include oral calcium carbonate given as 500–625 mg to 1000–1250 mg two to three times a day, and routine administration of oral calcium has been reported to reduce postoperative hypocalcemia to approximately 10%; adding calcitriol (1,25-(OH)2-D3), usually 0.5–1.0 μg per day, increases effectiveness, and calcitriol has a half-life of 5–8 hours; in a prospective randomized study, 1500 mg of oral calcium salts and 1 μg of calcitriol increased calcium and PTH superior to 0.5 μg of calcitriol administered twice a day or no calcitriol; given risks of overshooting and hypercalcemia, biochemical monitoring for medication titration is mandatory; costs noted indicate the cost of calcitriol and calcium tend to be less than PTH testing, though PTH testing is considerably lower than an emergency room visit or hospital admission; when postoperative hypoPT is known to be present, higher baseline calcium and activated vitamin D replacement are associated with better chances of parathyroid recovery.

### Approach to patients with hypophosphataemia [^f7af4fd3]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Phosphate metabolism is an evolving area of basic and clinical research. In the past 15 years, knowledge on disturbances of phosphate homoeostasis has expanded, as has the discovery of new targeted therapies. Hypophosphataemia might be the biochemical finding in several diseases, and its clinical evaluation should initially focus on the assessment of pathophysiological mechanisms leading to low serum phosphate concentrations. Clinical consequences of hypophosphataemia can involve multiple organ systems and vary depending on several factors, the most important being the underlying disorder. This Review focuses on the approach to patients with hypophosphataemia and how underlying pathophysiological mechanisms should be understood in the evaluation of differential diagnosis. We define an algorithm for the assessment of hypophosphataemia and review the most up-to-date literature on specific therapies. Continuous research in this area will result in a better understanding and management of patients with hypophosphataemia.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^fd889fc8]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Patients with biochemically determined, mild pHPT are not investigated or followed up properly. The high proportion of patients presenting with biochemically determined, mild pHPT underlines the importance of providing local instructions to ensure that patients are investigated and followed up according to the most recent international guidelines.
