## Question

What is the role of florimab in the treatment of severe asthma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the role of "florimab" is in the treatment of severe asthma — what the evidence shows and, if that name is incorrect, which biologic is most likely meant and how it performs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "florimab" appears in the provided literature set. Then, I should verify the most likely intended agent based on context and orthographic similarity. Next, I will review the pivotal randomized trials for that agent, confirm dosing, efficacy, and patient-reported outcomes. After that, I should place the findings within current guideline-based biologic selection for severe asthma. Finally, I will synthesize a direct, clinically actionable answer and clarify uncertainties or next steps for confirmation [^112UvVyG] [^112Xibj9] [^116CCrrU].

> Let me first confirm drug identification. Wait, let me verify whether "florimab" appears anywhere in the trials, guidelines, or reviews spanning 2017–2025; I find no mentions of "florimab", which suggests either a typographical error or a drug outside this reference set, so I should not jump to conclusions without cross-checking named biologics recognized by contemporary guidelines and trial programs for severe asthma [^116CCrrU] [^115YSPCv].

> Hold on, I should verify the most plausible intended drug by context. Given the focus on severe eosinophilic asthma and the prominence of the 2024 NEJM SWIFT-1 and SWIFT-2 trials, the most likely intended agent is depemokimab, a long-acting anti–IL-5–pathway biologic evaluated specifically in severe eosinophilic phenotypes as add-on therapy in those studies [^112UvVyG] [^112Xibj9].

> Let me reconsider and restate precisely: the analysis should be based on depemokimab as the actual drug studied in SWIFT-1 and SWIFT-2, not "florimab", so I will proceed with depemokimab as the target of appraisal while keeping in mind the initial naming uncertainty [^112UvVyG] [^112Xibj9].

> I will now examine mechanism and administration to anchor clinical use. Depemokimab is an anti–eosinophilic pathway biologic given as a fixed 100 mg subcutaneous dose at week 0 and week 26 (twice yearly) as add-on to standard care for severe eosinophilic asthma, aiming to reduce exacerbation risk in a Type 2–high phenotype where IL-5–driven eosinophilia is contributory [^112UvVyG] [^112Xibj9].

> Next, I should review primary efficacy outcomes. In SWIFT-1, depemokimab significantly reduced the annualized exacerbation rate versus placebo at 52 weeks (0.46 vs 1.11; rate ratio 0.42, 95% CI 0.30–0.59), and in SWIFT-2, a consistent reduction was observed (0.56 vs 1.08; rate ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.36–0.73), indicating robust exacerbation prevention across replicate trials in severe eosinophilic asthma as add-on therapy [^112UvVyG] [^112Xibj9].

> I need to check patient-reported outcomes and symptom control. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from the primary endpoint alone: in both trials, changes in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire and ACQ-5 did not show statistically significant between-group differences, suggesting limited incremental impact on quality of life and symptom control measures despite clear exacerbation benefit, which is clinically relevant when aligning drug choice to patient goals [^112UvVyG] [^112Xibj9].

> I will now examine who was actually studied to guide selection. Inclusion focused on severe eosinophilic asthma uncontrolled on optimized therapy, while key exclusions included ongoing biologic maintenance, recent anti–IL-5 exposure, other significant lung diseases, vasculitis, and unstable hepatic disease, which helps define an appropriate clinical niche and avoids confounding by recent class exposure or overlapping pathology [^112UvVyG] [^112Xibj9].

> Let me consider where this fits among available biologics. Current guidelines recommend several add-on biologics for uncontrolled severe asthma: anti-IgE (omalizumab), anti–IL-5/5R (mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab), anti–IL-4Rα (dupilumab), and anti-TSLP (tezepelumab), selected by phenotype, biomarkers, and clinical priorities such as exacerbation reduction, OCS-sparing, and comorbidity overlap, so depemokimab's profile sits alongside anti–IL-5/5R agents with an emphasis on exacerbation reduction and a very infrequent dosing schedule [^116CCrrU] [^114Xv8ma].

> I should confirm biomarker-guided selection principles. Higher blood eosinophil counts predict greater exacerbation reduction with anti–IL-5/5R therapy, and historical thresholds used to enrich responders include eosinophils ≥ 150–400/µL depending on the agent and guideline context; while exact depemokimab thresholds are defined by its trials, this general IL-5–pathway signal helps align patient selection in routine practice pending local criteria and regulatory status [^114A6gG1] [^112H7sVa].

> Let me synthesize the clinical role. Depemokimab appears to be a potent exacerbation-prevention biologic for severe eosinophilic asthma with the convenience of twice-yearly dosing, but with minimal incremental benefit on symptom control and quality of life metrics versus placebo, which means it may be strategically favored when the dominant goal is to cut exacerbations in a Type 2–high eosinophilic phenotype while minimizing treatment burden, provided eligibility and access criteria are met [^112UvVyG] [^112Xibj9] [^116CCrrU].

> But wait, what if the original query truly meant a different agent named "florimab"? I should double-check: there is no agent by that name in the provided set or in major guideline listings; if a different investigational biologic was intended, it is not covered here, whereas if "florimab" was a misnomer for depemokimab, the NEJM trials provide high-certainty evidence for exacerbation reduction without consistent PRO gains, and guidelines contextualize how to choose among biologics based on phenotype and biomarkers; please confirm the exact product name so I can verify regulatory status, labeling, and access criteria in your region [^112UvVyG] [^112Xibj9] [^116CCrrU].

I can't find a biologic called "florimab". Could you **confirm the exact drug name** or provide more details (mechanism, target, or manufacturer)? If you meant one of the following, I can summarize their roles in severe asthma [^114Xv8ma] [^116CCrrU]: benralizumab (anti–IL-5Rα) [^116CCrrU], mepolizumab or reslizumab (anti–IL-5) [^113juy5B], dupilumab (anti–IL-4Rα) [^116CCrrU] [^111tYy8A], **tezepelumab** (anti-TSLP) [^1155U7Tj], or **depemokimab** (long-acting anti–IL-5; SWIFT-1/2) [^112UvVyG] [^112Xibj9].

### Controversies and opportunities in severe asthma [^115GZyPu]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Despite currently available treatments, many asthma patients remain inadequately controlled. Identifying distinct patient populations (phenotypes/endotypes) may optimize their management. This review discusses some of the controversies and opportunities for improved disease control in severe asthma.

Currently approved anti-immunoglobulin E and anti-interleukin 5 biologics, which target specific pathways instead of using a 'one size fits all' strategy, are efficacious and well-tolerated therapies for severe asthma. The appropriate use of these biologics, and of those in development (e.g. benralizumab and dupilumab), should be aided by further understanding of asthma phenotypes and endotypes, utilizing appropriate biomarkers. Oral corticosteroids are often added as maintenance therapy for patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, but their use is associated with significant adverse effects and should be considered a last option. The true cost of this therapy, including the cost of morbidities associated with its use, remains to be determined. Severe asthma in pediatrics poses a unique opportunity for possible prevention strategies and the potential for primary prevention. Although several avenues for primary prevention are being explored and are out of the scope of this review, we focus our discussion on the use of omalizumab, which has been recently explored in clinical trials.

Appropriate use of biologics in severe asthma should be supported by further understanding of biomarkers predicting response to targeted therapy.

### Pediatric severe asthma: A case series report and perspectives on anti-IgE treatment [^11143mxr]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, establishing the impact of comorbidities on asthma control may be cumbersome, and an ex-juvantibus treatment is sometimes necessary to assess their role. Comorbid conditions can also worsen each other, and symptoms arising from some of them may mimic asthma. Although the ability to improve pediatric severe asthma by treating comorbidities remains unconfirmed, they should be treated appropriately.

The vast majority of asthmatic children exhibit a mild or at most a moderate disease that can be fully controlled with low-to-medium dose ICS associated or not with other controllers. However, a subset of asthmatics remains difficult-to-treat. With the advent of biologics, these severe steroid-dependent asthmatics have alternative options for treatment, as steroid-related adverse events are common in severe asthma. Omalizumab, an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, is the only biologic therapy recommended in children with moderate-to-severe asthma by the recent guidelines.

In Italy, this treatment is fully covered by the National Health System. Therefore, there is no influence by any funding on treatment decisions. It was approved by the US (Food and Drug Administration) in 2003 and by the European Union (European Medicines Agency) in 2005 as an add-on treatment for patients aged > 12 years with severe persistent allergic asthma and who have a positive skin test or in-vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen, FEV1 < 80% predicted, frequent daytime symptoms or nighttime awakenings, and multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily ICS plus a LABA.

### Recognition and management of severe asthma: A Canadian Thoracic Society position statement [^114A6gG1]. Canadian Journal of Respiratory, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine (2017). High credibility.

In the context of medical management for asthma, particularly concerning biologic therapy, the CTS 2017 guidelines recommend that blood eosinophil counts may help identify responders to anti-IL-5 therapy. The greatest reduction in asthma exacerbations is associated with the highest levels of blood eosinophil counts. It is important to recognize the following cutoffs used at initiation:

- **Mepolizumab**: > 150 cells/mL
- **Reslizumab**: > 400 cells/mL
- **Benralizumab**: > 300 cells/mL.

### Long-term multicenter comparison shows equivalent efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in severe asthma therapy [^115vCdpu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Antibody therapy led to significant improvements across nearly all assessed parameters in all three treatment groups. All lung function parameters, except for TLC, improved significantly in all groups, indicating enhanced pulmonary performance. Notably, these improvements were comparable in all treatment groups, without significant differences. Furthermore, both asthma control as measured by ACT, annualized exacerbation rate, and the need for and average dosage of OCS improved in all treatment groups, highlighting the tangible clinical benefits of biologic therapy in severe asthma patients. However, these reductions were statistically significantly more pronounced among patients receiving either mepolizumab or benralizumab compared to patients receiving dupilumab. However, this is unlikely to represent a clinically significant difference, as both the annualized exacerbation rate and mean OCS dose were lower in the dupilumab cohort at baseline, allowing for less overall reduction upon therapy initiation. Likewise, patients receiving dupilumab had a slightly higher average ACT score at baseline.

While all patients in our cohort suffered from severe asthma insufficiently controlled by conventional therapy — a prerequisite to biologic therapy initiation according to German guidelines — the less severe baseline impairments indicate that patients in the dupilumab group had better asthma control at baseline and thus perhaps less room for improvement. Notably, prescription guidelines for biologics in severe asthma are heterogeneous among European countries.

### Recognition and management of severe asthma: A Canadian Thoracic Society position statement [^112jtGAZ]. Canadian journal of respiratory, critical care, and sleep medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of severe asthma phenotypes, particularly in relation to omalizumab, the 2017 Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) guidelines suggest offering omalizumab to pediatric and adolescent patients who experience repeated exacerbations or poor control when therapy is stepped down from high-dose to moderate-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and at least one other controller. This recommendation takes into account the known risk of side effects associated with high-dose ICS in pediatric patients.

### Choosing the right biologic for the right patient with severe asthma [^116hJFhh]. Chest (2025). Low credibility.

Assuming a satisfactory and unrevealing workup, four main therapeutic options could be considered at the first patient encounter. In increasing order of expected benefits for the patient, these are as follows:

1. No therapeutic change is implemented, but allergen avoidance is recommended despite the low likelihood that it will decrease exacerbation frequency. Ordering more ancillary tests may be considered, despite having clearly identified the clinical problem.

2. Optimizing the pharmaceutical care of potentially related comorbidities (e.g. acid reflux, sinus disease), without necessarily addressing the cause of asthma attacks.

3. Prescribing oral medications (e.g. montelukast, sublingual immunotherapy, or theophylline) that are likely to be of very limited proven efficacy in severe asthma.

4. Initiating a monoclonal antibody for asthma. Although all of the options above may be considered, this is likely the best option, assuming an appropriate prescription based on biomarkers and comorbidities and that the patient meets regional prescription criteria, treatment is reimbursed, and the medications are available.

In considering biologic therapies in this patient and in all ensuing patients, we assume that the extrinsic factors noted in option 4 otherwise have been addressed.

The first patient is typical insofar as she is eligible for all biologics available: the anti-IgE omalizumab, the anti-IL-5s mepolizumab and reslizumab, the anti-IL-5-receptor (IL-5R) benralizumab, the anti-IL-4-receptor dupilumab, and the anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin.

### Global variability in administrative approval prescription criteria for biologic therapy in severe asthma [^1167AQkd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Regulatory bodies have approved five biologics for severe asthma. However, regional differences in accessibility may limit the global potential for personalized medicine.

- **Objective**: To compare global differences in ease of access to biologics.

- **Methods**: In April 2021, national prescription criteria for omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab were reviewed by severe asthma experts collaborating in the International Severe Asthma Registry. Outcomes (per country, per biologic) were (1) country-specific prescription criteria and (2) development of the Biologic Accessibility Score (BACS). The BACS composite score incorporates 10 prescription criteria, each with a maximum score of 10 points. Referenced to European Medicines Agency marketing authorization specifications, a higher score reflects easier access.

- **Results**: Biologic prescription criteria differed substantially across 28 countries from five continents. Blood eosinophil count thresholds (usually ≥ 300 cells/μL) and exacerbations were key requirements for anti-IgE/anti-IL-5/5R prescriptions in around 80% of licensed countries. Most countries (40% for dupilumab to 54% for mepolizumab) require two or more moderate or severe exacerbations, whereas numbers ranged from none to four. Moreover, 0% (for reslizumab) to 21% (for omalizumab) of countries required long-term oral corticosteroid use. The BACS highlighted marked between-country differences in ease of access. For omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab, only two, one, four, and seven countries, respectively, scored equal.

### Choosing the right biologic for the right patient with severe asthma [^115rWHaS]. Chest (2025). Low credibility.

First, consider the biomarkers: both circulating eosinophil counts and F are raised, identifying two immunologic pathways that could be implicated in the pathophysiologic characteristics, thus identifying a high-risk and high-stake situation for the patient. The high risk relates to the predictable potential for future asthma attacks, whereas the stakes are high because the same type 2 inflammatory process that predicts an excellent response to type-targeted anti-inflammatory medication also puts the patient in harm's way. Dupilumab, tezepelumab, and, to a lesser extent, omalizumab can influence both eosinophils and F, whereas anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-5R will not suppress F. The recent SHAMAL trial, where weaning of ICS while taking benralizumab was associated with an F-related decrease in FEV1, suggests this might be an important factor.

One should also take into account the early onset of asthma in this patient. With results from the VOYAGE and MUPPITS2 studies in children, in addition to post hoc analyses of phase 3 trials of benralizumab, the early onset of the disease and raised F level may imply that the patient has epithelial or atopic-driven type 2 inflammation. This phenotype suggests that she would benefit more from these treatments.

### Efficacy and safety of mepolizumab in a real-world cohort of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma [^115HsnA8]. The Journal of Asthma (2021). Low credibility.

The interleukin 5 (IL-5) pathway is an important component in the pathophysiology of severe eosinophilic asthma. Mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-5 pathway. Clinical trials have shown the efficacy of mepolizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma; however, reports on experience with treatment in a real-world cohort are limited.

- **Objectives**: Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma in a real-world cohort of patients.

- **Methods**: A clinical prospective observational trial included all patients over 18 years of age treated with mepolizumab between March 2016 and March 2019 at Rabin Medical Center. The composite primary outcome measures evaluated: increase in FEV1 by ≥ 200ml, and/or decrease in exacerbation rate of ≥ 50%, and/or cessation of oral corticosteroids (OCS) treatment or a ≥ 50% decrease in dosage. Also evaluated were blood eosinophil count, adverse events, and quality of life.

- **Results**: Of 61 patients, 50 (82.0%) achieved the primary outcome. The number of patients who suffered from frequent exacerbations decreased from 52 (85.2%) to 8 (13.1%) (p < 0.001). Thirty-four patients were able to stop OCS treatment, and 13 achieved a > 50% reduced dosage (p < 0.001). Mean FEV1 increased from 1.72 ± 0.78 liters to 1.87 ± 0.85 liters (p = 0.043). Response to therapy was seen within six months. Forty-nine patients (80%) reported an improvement in quality of life (p < 0.001). Only minor adverse events were reported.

- **Conclusion**: Treatment with mepolizumab was well tolerated and significantly lowered the exacerbation rate and OCS.

### Recognition and management of severe asthma: A Canadian Thoracic Society position statement [^1112FWbR]. Canadian Journal of Respiratory, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically with respect to biologic therapy, the CTS 2017 guidelines recommend considering offering omalizumab for patients aged 6 years or older with severe asthma who meet the following criteria:

- **Inadequate disease control**: Despite high-dose ICSs and at least one other controller.
- **Sensitization to perennial allergens**: The patient should be sensitized to at least one perennial allergen.
- **Serum IgE levels**: For children aged 6–11 years, levels should be between 30–1,300 IU/mL. For adults and adolescents aged 12 years or older, levels should be between 30–700 IU/mL.

### Biologic therapies targeting type 2 cytokines are effective at improving asthma symptoms and control-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113juy5B]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). High credibility.

Mepolizumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab are biologics that target the IL-5 pathway to treat severe asthma by impairing IL-5 signaling. Mepolizumab is a humanized N-glycosylated IgG1κ mAb with high affinity and specificity for the IL-5Rα chain, blocking IL-5 binding on eosinophils, suppressing the number of eosinophils in the blood, minimizing exacerbations, and reducing the need for corticosteroids. Benralizumab is a humanized mAb that contributes to a reduction of eosinophilia via antibody-dependent cell-mediated toxicity. It achieves this by binding to the IL-5Rα chain via the Fab domain on eosinophils, preventing IL-5 from binding to eosinophilic receptors. In addition, benralizumab binds to the fragment crystallizable region of FcγRIIIa on natural killer cells, activating them and causing the release of granzymes and perforins, which induce apoptosis of the eosinophils, thereby reducing the eosinophil population at the site of inflammation.

IL-4 and IL-13 are pleiotropic TH2-associated cytokines required to induce B-cell class switching to produce IgE. Moreover, IL-13 plays an important role in inducing mucus secretion. Both cytokines share a common receptor chain, specifically IL-4Rα, which consists of three complexes: a type 1 complex and two type 2 complexes. The type 2 receptor complex is significant because both cytokines can bind to this heterodimeric complex, consisting of the IL-4Rα subunit and the IL-13Rα1 subunit. This receptor complex is expressed on many immune cells, such as macrophages.

### Efficacy and safety of an anti-IL-13 mAb in patients with severe asthma: a randomized trial [^117CA7wy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Approximately 5% to 10% of asthmatic patients achieve incomplete symptom control on therapies. The association of IL-13 with asthma pathology and reduced corticosteroid sensitivity suggests a potential benefit of anti-IL-13 therapy in refractory asthma. GSK679586, a humanized mAb, inhibits IL-13 binding to both IL-13 receptor α1 and α2.

- **Objectives**: We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GSK679586 in patients with severe asthma refractory to maximally indicated doses of inhaled corticosteroids.

- **Methods**: Patients who remained symptomatic (Asthma Control Questionnaire score ≥ 1.5) after up-titration to 1000 μg/d fluticasone propionate or greater were randomized to 3 once-monthly intravenous infusions of 10 mg/kg GSK679586 (n = 99) or placebo (n = 99).

- **Results**: Treatment differences in adjusted mean change from baseline over 12 weeks were nonsignificant for Asthma Control Questionnaire symptom scores (the primary end point; GSK679586 = -0.31, placebo = -0.17, P = .058) and FEV₁ (GSK679586 = -0.01, placebo = 0.03, P = .276). Similar analyses in patients with increased serum IgE levels, blood eosinophil counts, or both were also negative. Incidence of asthma exacerbations was similar between treatments. Most adverse events were non-serious and unrelated to treatment. Two GSK679586-treated patients had treatment-related serious adverse events (lethargy and supraventricular extrasystoles).

- **Conclusions**: Although well-tolerated, GSK679586 did not demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements in asthma control, pulmonary function, or exacerbations.

### Severe asthma clinical remission after biologic treatment with anti-IL4/IL13: A real-life experience [^111tYy8A]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-4/interleukin-13 monoclonal antibody, has shown efficacy in many aspects of Type-2 severe asthma management. Currently, we lack real-life studies addressing the achievement of clinical remission in patients treated with this biologic.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a prospective study enrolling 18 patients with severe asthma treated with Dupilumab. We assessed main clinical, functional, and biological severe asthma features at baseline (T0) and following a 1-year course of treatment (T12). Clinical remission was defined at T12 in patients without asthma exacerbations, no oral corticosteroid (OCS) use, an ACT score ≥ 20, and FEV1 improvement ≥ 100 mL from baseline.

- **Results**: Among the total population, 38.9% of patients achieved clinical remission at T12. Anti-IL4/IL13 treatment significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and OCS use in the overall cohort, with a more pronounced ACT improvement in the remission group. Patients achieving clinical remission underwent a step down of the inhalation therapy, suspending long-acting anti-muscarinics administration at T12.

- **Conclusions**: Treatment with anti-IL4/IL13 can induce clinical remission in patients with T2 severe asthma.

### Long-term multicenter comparison shows equivalent efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in severe asthma therapy [^1133suyV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Data from 280 patients who had been treated with either mepolizumab (129/280, 46%), benralizumab (83/280, 30%), or dupilumab (68/280, 24%) for at least one year were analyzed. Baseline characteristics for all treatment groups were similar regarding the distribution of sex, age, baseline PF, ACT scores, and OCS dose. However, the dupilumab cohort featured more patients suffering from atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and aspirin (ASS) intolerance and contained more patients suffering from a mixed asthma phenotype, compared to a higher prevalence of purely eosinophilic asthma phenotypes among the mepolizumab and benralizumab cohorts. In addition, the dupilumab cohort experienced on average fewer yearly asthma exacerbations prior to initiation of therapy.

- **Patient baseline characteristics**: Table 1 summarizes patients' baseline characteristics.
	- Abbreviations: ACT - Asthma Control Test, ASS - Aspirin, FEV1 - Forced expiratory volume in 1 s, CRS - Chronic rhinosinusitis, CRSwNP - Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, FVC - Forced vital capacity, IQR - Interquartile range, NA - Not available, OCS - Oral corticosteroids.
	- a Intergroup p-value calculated using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction.
	- b Chi-squared test.
	- c In mg prednisolone equivalent, FeNO - Forced exhaled nitric oxide, ppb - Parts per billion, IgE - Immunoglobulin E.

Table 2 summarizes the changes in PF, ACT scores, exacerbation rates, OCS dose, and laboratory values within groups between time points as well as the inter-group comparison of the changes (delta) in parameters from BL to T1 and T2. Asthma control assessed by the ACT significantly improved across all groups.

### Real-world efficacy of treatment with benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab, and reslizumab for severe asthma: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114uNbQr]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). High credibility.

Biologicals have been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, it has been recognized that only a minority of patients with severe asthma would also be eligible for inclusion within an RCT. Moreover, in RCTs, many patients randomized to the placebo arm experience a significant improvement in asthma control and a reduction in the number of exacerbations, suggesting that these apparent severe asthmatics simply require increased monitoring rather than increased drug therapy. Consequently, there are questions over the generalizability of results from RCTs. It has been suggested that, in general, the conclusions derived from RCTs could be more impactful if supported by evidence of therapeutic effectiveness from clinical practice.

As such, real‐world studies are becoming more influential, informing decisions by healthcare regulatory bodies including the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) and Germany's Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care. However, when assessing real‐world studies, their small sample size and, in some cases, the lack of a control group can limit interpretation. These can both be addressed within the context of a systematic review and meta‐analysis through reference to effect measures derived from RCTs and by collating and pooling multiple studies to provide precise effect estimates. In this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of recently licensed biological agents in populations of participants with severe asthma reported in real‐world studies to assess the generalizability of the RCT data.

### Lebrikizumab in moderate-to-severe asthma: Pooled data from two randomised placebo-controlled studies [^111B2Bo2]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

In a subset of patients with asthma, standard-of-care treatment does not achieve disease control, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Lebrikizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks interleukin-13 activity.

- **Methods**: LUTE and VERSE were replicate, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies evaluating multiple doses of lebrikizumab in patients with uncontrolled asthma despite the use of medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a second controller. Patients received lebrikizumab 37.5, 125, 250 mg or placebo subcutaneously every four weeks. The primary endpoint was the rate of asthma exacerbations during the placebo-controlled period. Analyses were performed on prespecified subgroups based on baseline serum periostin levels. Following the discovery of a host-cell impurity in the study drug material, protocols were amended to convert from phase III to phase IIb. Subsequently, dosing of study medication was discontinued early as a precautionary measure. The data collected for analysis were from a placebo-controlled period of variable duration and pooled across both studies.

- **Results**: The median duration of treatment was approximately 24 weeks. Treatment with lebrikizumab reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations, which was more pronounced in the periostin-high patients (all doses: 60% reduction) than in the periostin-low patients (all doses: 5% reduction); no dose-response was evident. Lung function also improved following lebrikizumab treatment, with the greatest increase in FEV1 in periostin-high patients.

### Biologics in severe asthma: A pragmatic approach for choosing the right treatment for the right patient [^112WzhtR]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The development of monoclonal antibody therapies targeting specific components of the pathways relevant to asthma pathophysiology has revolutionized the treatment of severe asthma in both adults and children. This has helped to further unravel the heterogeneity of this disease. However, the availability of multiple agents, often with overlapping eligibility criteria, creates a need for pragmatic guidance for specialists undertaking the care of patients with severe asthma. In this review, we provide an overview of the data supporting the clinical efficacy of biologics across distinct asthma phenotypes/endotypes. We focus on the role of biomarkers and treatable traits, including comorbidities, in the choice of asthma biologics. We highlight which treatments have been demonstrated to be steroid sparing in corticosteroid-dependent asthma and provide practical guidance to aid shared decision-making on treatment choice with patients. Additionally, we summarize what is known at the time of writing regarding the long-term safety of these drugs and discuss future directions in biologics research.

### Real-world efficacy of treatment with benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab, and reslizumab for severe asthma: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158qFPq]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

Many of the included studies are observational and, as expected, are at a higher risk of bias. This is reflected in the assessment of the risk of bias for the included studies. Some of this bias is derived from the methodology used. In this meta-analysis, most of the studies were retrospective. These studies are an efficient way of exploring the effects of biologicals on severe asthma. However, the presence of these studies has the potential to introduce bias into the analysis, particularly via recall bias. This needs to be considered when drawing conclusions from this meta-analysis. However, the results are in line with RCTs, which are not subject to such bias, suggesting that the bias present is insufficient to significantly impair the assessment of outcomes.

This meta-analysis focused on real-world studies, in which it can be difficult to account for the placebo effect and for regression to the mean. These issues are inherent when reviewing, assessing, and synthesizing data from real-world trials. However, we have overcome this issue in this systematic review by comparing results from the active arm of equivalent RCTs, thereby providing external validation of our results. These comparisons demonstrate significant concordance between real-world studies and RCTs when examining objective measures, which has implications for researchers examining these variables and implies that data derived from RCTs are applicable to the broad spectrum of patients seen in clinical practice.

### Long-term multicenter comparison shows equivalent efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in severe asthma therapy [^114UySSP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Data was collected at three time points: at baseline (BL), up to 3 months prior to biologic therapy initiation; control timepoint 1 (Timepoint 1, T1), 6 months ± 90 days after initiation; and control timepoint 2 (Timepoint 2, T2), 12 months ± 90 days after initiation. The latest suitable visit within the ± 90-day interval for a timepoint was used if more than one visit occurred within the interval.

FeNO, differential blood cell counts, as well as forced expiratory capacity in 1 second (FEV1), functional vital capacity (FVC), residual volume (RV), and total lung capacity (TLC) were collected as part of routine follow-up care. Pulmonary function was performed using ERS/ATS-standardized spirometry or body plethysmography. Asthma control was assessed through the asthma control test (ACT). Changes in medication, exacerbation rates, and ACT scores were reassessed at each timepoint, with exacerbation rates being annualized to the 12 months prior.

We defined exacerbations as an acute aggravation of asthma symptoms requiring de novo OCS or an increase in the OCS dose for at least 3 days. Smoking status and atopic and eosinophilic phenotype-related comorbidities were assessed at baseline. BARS was calculated retrospectively for each patient at 6 and 12 months of therapy. To summarize, BARS evaluates therapy response based on changes in ACT, OCS dose, and exacerbation rate, with 2, 1, or 0 points attainable in each category. A higher score corresponds to a better therapy response, with the overall response being assessed using the average of all three categories, allowing for categorization of responses.

### How do biologicals and other novel therapies effect clinically used biomarkers in severe asthma [^116ZSbwt]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

While there has been much interest in using biomarkers to select patients for particular targeted therapies, there has been much less attention paid to how these biomarkers change in patients once treatment begins. This is an area of great interest to practicing clinicians, especially respiratory physicians and allergists who manage severe asthma. In this article, we review monoclonal antibodies and related targeted therapies, especially those that are currently available or in late-stage clinical trials, focusing on the differential effects such agents have on biomarkers in widespread clinical practice such as eosinophils, FeNO, and total IgE. Serial measurements of biomarkers can be useful in determining whether a particular targeted therapy is having its expected biological effect and invaluable in assessing the reasons for treatment failure should that occur.

### Advancing remission in severe asthma with benralizumab: Latest findings, current perspectives and future direction [^113Hc4Jh]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

Asthma affects over 300 million people worldwide, with approximately 5%–10% experiencing severe disease. Patients with severe asthma often experience poor symptom control, impaired lung function, reliance on oral corticosteroids (OCS), and an increased risk of asthma exacerbations.

Severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA) accounts for over 80% of patients with severe asthma; however, it is noteworthy that the cut-offs to distinguish eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic asthma are arbitrary and fall within the normal range of blood eosinophils. Interleukin 5 (IL‐5) is a crucial cytokine involved in eosinophil development, activation, and survival. The introduction of biologic therapies, such as benralizumab, an anti-IL-5 receptor α humanized monoclonal antibody that reduces eosinophils through antibody-dependent and cell-mediated cytotoxicity, has made remission in patients with SEA a feasible goal. This mirrors similar changes in practice concerning the management of other chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, where achieving remission has become a primary goal of treatment.

### Burden of oral corticosteroid use in severe asthma: Challenges and opportunities [^116j5zNZ]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

- **Sparing role of biologics**: Most patients with severe asthma have underlying type 2 inflammation, with type 2 inflammatory pathways contributing to symptoms in most cases. Real-world data from Japan and Europe show that 70%–82% of patients with severe asthma have elevated type 2 biomarkers, making them eligible for treatment with biologics.

Since the first biologic targeting IgE (omalizumab) was approved for asthma over 20 years ago, several monoclonal antibodies have been developed, targeting interleukin (IL)‐5 (mepolizumab and reslizumab), IL‐5 receptor α (benralizumab), and IL‐4 receptor α (dupilumab, which blocks both IL‐4 and IL‐13 signaling). These can be used in patients with a type 2 inflammatory phenotype who remain uncontrolled despite medium- (omalizumab and dupilumab only) or high-dose ICS plus additional controllers. Tezepelumab, targeting the alarmin thymic stromal lymphopoietin, has also been approved for patients with severe asthma.

All currently approved biologics as add-on therapy for severe asthma have demonstrated OCS dose-sparing effects in clinical trials and/or real-world studies. It is likely that the initiation of biologics will need to be guided by multiple disease characteristics to optimize efficiency and cost-effectiveness through individualized treatment algorithms. Recently, an International Severe Asthma Registry study showed that the initiation (compared with non-initiation) of a biologic resulted…

### Real-world efficacy of treatment with benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab and reslizumab for severe asthma: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115J7M7b]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). High credibility.

Observational data from typical populations can help to establish the generalizability of results observed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Treatment with biologicals is associated with significant improvements in asthma control, exacerbations, and lung function. The improvement in results is comparable to RCTs, implying RCTs are applicable to typical populations.

### A pandemic lesson for global lung diseases: Exacerbations are preventable [^117WvdX6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

- **Therapeutic implications**: Modern biologic therapies in controlled clinical trials have successfully reduced exacerbation rates of moderate to severe asthma. By analogy, glucocorticoids and biologics are beneficial in the treatment of the inflammatory consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, nearly two-thirds of patients with severe asthma treated with biologics continue to experience uncontrolled disease. Although the importance of viral infections at the start of acute asthma exacerbations is well understood, it may be fair to say that their prevention and treatment have been neglected. Indeed, a recent influential publication failed to mention infection at all in a review of potential strategies to reduce the global burden of asthma.

- **Role of infections in COPD**: The role of bacterial infections is accepted in patients with COPD, but viruses are not usually treated. Notwithstanding the known contribution of viruses, patients with recurrent COPD exacerbations typically are managed with repeated systemic antibiotic courses. However, microbiological diagnosis by culture of NHTi is demanding, and antibiotics are often given empirically. Acute infection accompanying COPD is one of the most common indications for adult antimicrobial therapy and plays a substantial role in antimicrobial resistance in the population. Consequently, sequence-based distinction of viral and bacterial components may better target management.

The efficacy of innovative responses to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demonstrates that several levels of strategy directed against microbial infection are effective.

### The burden of corticosteroid overload in severe and difficult to treat asthma: How to reduce this [^115ossQa]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Severe asthma is a serious condition that requires an individualized approach combining several treatment agents administered simultaneously to reach adequate control. Glucocorticosteroid treatment, as the cornerstone of asthma pharmacotherapy, has great disease-controlling capability, although it may induce a vast amount of severe adverse effects. This review describes our knowledge of the monitoring and managing options of these adverse effects and possibilities to prevent them, including new therapeutic options.

- **Recent findings**: A large amount of new drugs is emerging, which may offer better control of glucocorticosteroid-induced adverse effects. At the same time, major achievements in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms in severe asthma and in the field of biologic agents may help to substantially reduce the need for glucocorticosteroids in the first-line treatment.

- **Summary**: We discuss new insights and approaches to the treatment strategy of severe asthma, allowing less oral glucocorticosteroid use and, hence, substantially fewer severe adverse effects of the treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of itepekimab in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma [^11472RCd]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Monoclonal antibodies targeting IgE, interleukin-4 and -13, and interleukin-5 are effective in treating severe type 2 asthma, but new targets are needed. Itepekimab is a new monoclonal antibody against the upstream alarmin interleukin-33. The efficacy and safety of itepekimab as monotherapy, as well as in combination with dupilumab, in patients with asthma are unclear.

- **Methods**: In a phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, adults with moderate-to-severe asthma receiving inhaled glucocorticoids plus long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) to receive subcutaneous itepekimab (at a dose of 300 mg), itepekimab plus dupilumab (both at 300 mg; combination therapy), dupilumab (300 mg), or placebo every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. After randomization, LABA was discontinued at week 4, and inhaled glucocorticoids were tapered over weeks 6 through 9. The primary endpoint was an event indicating a loss of asthma control, assessed in the itepekimab group and the combination group, as compared with the placebo group. Secondary and other endpoints included lung function, asthma control, quality of life, type 2 biomarkers, and safety.

- **Results**: A total of 296 patients underwent randomization. By 12 weeks, an event indicating a loss of asthma control occurred in 22% of the patients in the itepekimab group, 27% of those in the combination group, and 19% of those in the dupilumab group, as compared with 41% of those in the placebo group; the corresponding odds ratios as compared with placebo were as follows: in the itepekimab group, 0.42 (95% confidence interval, 0.20 t

### The evolving algorithm of biological selection in severe asthma [^115Mgwvm]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

New therapeutic options for severe asthma have recently emerged, mostly in the form of monoclonal antibodies ("biologicals") targeting relevant inflammatory pathways. Currently available agents target different aspects of "Type 2" immunity, and their indications often include overlapping patient groups. We present a round-table discussion that took place during the Annual Meeting of the Respiratory Effectiveness Group (REG) on the reasoning behind the use of different add-on medications for severe asthma, and crucially, on selection strategies.

The proposed rationale is based on evidence, including real-life studies, as well as on the appreciation of the relevant complexities. Direct head-to-head comparisons of biologicals are lacking; therefore, algorithms for the initial choice and potential switch between agents should be based on understanding the key characteristics of different options and the development of a clear plan with predefined targets and shared decision-making in a structured way.

### The new biologic drugs: Which children with asthma should get what [^115uF6hm]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Novel biologics for severe asthma**: Currently, six biologics are available in the United Kingdom (UK) on the NHS for the treatment of asthma: omalizumab (Xolair), mepolizumab (Nucala), reslizumab (Cinqaero), benralizumab (Fasenra), dupilumab (Dupixent), and tezepelumab (Tezspire). However, only four — mepolizumab, omalizumab, dupilumab, and the newly approved tezepelumab (since April 2023) — have been licensed for use in children with severe asthma in the UK.

	- Benralizumab (Fasenra, AstraZeneca) is currently not licensed in the UK but has been approved by the FDA for children with severe eosinophilic phenotype asthma in the United States. It is only briefly covered in this review.

- **Eligibility criteria and guidelines**: Before commencing treatment with any biologic, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines advise that it is crucial to ensure that standard therapy has been optimized. This includes documenting adherence with maintenance inhaled steroid treatment as far as possible, ensuring optimal inhaler technique, and minimizing environmental exposures that may worsen control, such as allergens and tobacco smoke. However, adherence may be difficult to assess accurately.

	- There is justification to prescribe biologics to children with severe asthma who, despite best efforts to optimize adherence, remain non-adherent to conventional treatment to keep them alive.

All currently licensed biologics are antibodies that target signaling molecules, summarized in Figure 2.

### Update: Mepolizumab treatment in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma and prior omalizumab use [^111r6uj7]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

Over the last two decades, several biologic therapies have emerged for the targeted treatment of severe asthma, defined as asthma inadequately controlled by guideline‐recommended treatment with high‐dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and bronchodilator therapies. These biologic therapies target specific mechanisms underlying differing asthma phenotypes. Omalizumab (anti‐immunoglobulin E) is indicated for moderate‐to‐severe allergic asthma, and mepolizumab (anti‐interleukin‐5) is indicated for severe eosinophilic asthma. Although omalizumab has demonstrated efficacy in clinical studies, not all patients achieve good disease control with therapy; some of these patients may also be eligible for mepolizumab treatment. Clinical studies have demonstrated that mepolizumab plus standard of care (SoC) reduces exacerbation frequency, decreases oral corticosteroid (OCS) use, and improves health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]‐5), and lung function versus placebo in severe eosinophilic asthma.

### Role of biologics in asthma [^115YSPCv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Patients with severe uncontrolled asthma have disproportionately high morbidity and healthcare utilization compared to their peers with well-controlled disease. Previously, treatment options for these patients were limited, with unacceptable side effects. However, the emergence of biologic therapies for the treatment of asthma has provided promising targeted therapy for these patients. Biologic therapies target specific inflammatory pathways involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, particularly in patients with an endotype driven by type 2 (T2) inflammation.

In addition to anti-IgE therapy, which has improved outcomes in allergic asthma for more than a decade, three anti-IL-5 biologics and one anti-IL-4R biologic have recently emerged as promising treatments for T2 asthma. These targeted therapies have been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations, improve lung function, reduce oral corticosteroid use, and improve the quality of life for appropriately selected patients.

Beyond the currently approved biologic agents, several biologics targeting upstream inflammatory mediators are in clinical trials, with possible approval on the horizon. This article reviews the mechanism of action, indications, expected benefits, and side effects of each of the currently approved biologics for severe uncontrolled asthma and discusses promising therapeutic targets for the future.

### Biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction of therapy responses in allergic diseases and asthma [^112H7sVa]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

The EAACI recently published guidelines on the use of biologicals in severe asthma. Recommendations were formulated following the GRADE approach for each biological — benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab, omalizumab, and reslizumab — and each outcome, including a decrease in asthma exacerbations, oral and inhaled corticosteroids, and rescue medication use; improvement in asthma control, quality of life, and lung function; and safety. The recommendations were informed by three systematic reviews. FeNO, sputum, and blood eosinophils were scored as outcomes with low importance; however, the evidence was analyzed for subgroups based on biomarkers and comorbidities.

The higher the blood eosinophils, the higher the expected impact of benralizumab, dupilumab, and mepolizumab in reducing severe asthma exacerbations. Improvement in asthma control was significantly better in the high-eosinophil subgroup for benralizumab and reslizumab. Lung function increased significantly more in the high-eosinophil subgroup for benralizumab, dupilumab, and reslizumab. Benralizumab improved quality of life better in the high-eosinophil subgroup. The effect of omalizumab on exacerbations did not depend on blood eosinophils. Neither the atopic status nor total IgE predicts the magnitude of effect of benralizumab, and serum IgE thresholds (within regulatory limits) did not influence the response to omalizumab.

### Biologics for severe asthma: Treatment-specific effects are important in choosing a specific agent [^1113UDWk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with uncontrolled severe persistent asthma experience greater morbidity, increased use of health care resources, and more impairment in health-related quality of life compared to their peers with well-controlled disease. Fortunately, with the introduction of biological therapeutics, patients with severe eosinophilic asthma now have beneficial treatment options unavailable just a few years ago.

In addition to anti-IgE therapy for allergic asthma, three new biological therapeutics targeting IL-5 and one targeting IL-4 and IL-13 signaling have recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma. The approval of more biological therapeutics is on the horizon. These medications decrease the frequency of asthma exacerbations, improve lung function, reduce corticosteroid usage, and enhance health-related quality of life.

This article reviews the mechanisms of action, specific indications, benefits, and side effects of each of the approved biological therapies for asthma. Furthermore, it examines how clinicians can use specific patient characteristics to decide which biologic treatment may be optimal for a given patient.

### Monoclonal antibodies for severe asthma: Pharmacokinetic profiles [^115hKvC5]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab, are currently approved for the treatment of severe asthma. These mAbs exhibit complex pharmacokinetic profiles that are unique due to their structural characteristics and the biological nature of their target antigens. Despite this uniqueness, their general behavior can be considered a class property, similar to that of their endogenous IgG counterpart.

These antibodies cannot be administered orally, have a slow distribution into tissue, and are metabolized into peptides and amino acids in various tissues. They are protected from degradation by binding to protective receptors, specifically the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which accounts for their extended elimination half-lives.

- **Pharmacokinetics properties**: Their clearance is nonlinear due to the saturation of target-mediated elimination. Additionally, factors such as anti-drug antibody (ADA) response, off-target binding, and glycosylation patterns can further influence the pharmacokinetics of mAbs.

### Recognition and management of severe asthma: A Canadian Thoracic Society position statement [^111gcWDw]. Canadian Journal of Respiratory, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically in relation to biologic therapy, the Canadian Thoracic Society 2017 guidelines recommend considering the administration of omalizumab in pediatric and adolescent patients. This recommendation applies particularly to those experiencing repeated exacerbations or poor control when stepping down from high-dose to moderate-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) alongside at least one other controller. This approach is advised given the known risk of side effects associated with high-dose ICSs in pediatric patients.

### The clinical benefit of mepolizumab replacing omalizumab in uncontrolled severe eosinophilic asthma [^114HFdQh]. Allergy (2019). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous condition that affects approximately 235 million people worldwide. Although most patients with asthma are able to manage their symptoms and enjoy a good quality of life, 5%-10% of patients suffer from severe asthma. Severe asthma is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and accounts for approximately 50% of asthma care costs. Patients with severe asthma typically require regular treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), plus an additional controller or systemic corticosteroids (SCS) to prevent their disease from becoming uncontrolled. Despite this therapy, a subset of patients continues to have uncontrolled disease.

Severe asthma comprises different phenotypes driven by distinct pathophysiological processes. However, some severe asthma phenotypes overlap in terms of clinical and physiological characteristics, biomarker expression, and treatment response. In clinical practice, severe allergic asthma and severe eosinophilic asthma are recognized as distinct, but potentially overlapping phenotypes of severe asthma. Severe allergic asthma is characterized by an early age of onset, high levels of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), high fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), clinically relevant sensitization to common aeroallergens, and eosinophilic inflammation. In contrast, severe eosinophilic asthma is characterized by a later age of onset, peripheral eosinophilia, high FeNO, and frequent exacerbations. Due to the unmet clinical need within these severe asthma populations, novel biologic therapies are being developed to address these challenges.

### Short-term tezepelumab effectiveness in patients with severe asthma: A multicenter study [^1155U7Tj]. The Journal of Asthma (2025).

- **Objective**: Severe asthma presents significant management challenges, often requiring advanced treatments to control symptoms and reduce exacerbations. The use of monoclonal antibodies has revolutionized the clinical course of patients with severe asthma, showing a significant impact on exacerbation reduction, oral corticosteroids (OCS) cessation, and the improvement of lung function and quality of life. Tezepelumab, an anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) monoclonal antibody, has emerged as a potential therapeutic option for these patients.

- **Methods**: We conducted an observational, prospective, multicenter study including 20 patients with confirmed severe asthma according to ERS guidelines and GINA recommendations. Patients received Tezepelumab 210mg every four weeks due to uncontrolled asthma despite maximal inhalation treatment with ICS/LABA. Data were collected before treatment initiation (T0) and after three months from the first administration (T3).

- **Results**: After three months of Tezepelumab treatment, we reported significant improvements in asthma symptoms and quality of life, as well as a consistent reduction in exacerbations and OCS use. We found no statistically meaningful differences among main clinical and functional outcomes according to inflammatory biomarkers, while lung function improved significantly in patients with less allergic sensitization. No serious adverse events were reported during the follow-up, while the rates of mild adverse effects were comparable to those from registration trials.

- **Conclusion**: Tezepelumab demonstrated short-term efficacy in improving asthma management for patients with severe asthma.

### Guiding principles for use of newer biologics and bronchial thermoplasty for patients with severe asthma [^117HmiaT]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Severe asthma poses significant disease-related and economic burdens in the United States. Challenges in practice include how to define "severe asthma" for a given patient, knowing which tests to perform and when, and having a better understanding of a patient's asthma phenotype. Furthermore, guidelines do not address a clear, practical approach to treatment based on a patient's asthma phenotype.

- **Objective**: To develop a consensus on the definition of severe asthma, the role of biomarkers and phenotyping severe asthma, and the use of newer biologic therapies and bronchial thermoplasty to help guide practicing clinicians.

- **Methods**: A roundtable meeting was convened with a panel of severe asthma experts to discuss areas in practice not adequately addressed by guidelines, specifically phenotype-guided treatment.

- **Results**: We describe a consensus on the definition of severe asthma, asthma phenotyping with the use of available biomarkers, and guiding principles for newer biologic therapies and bronchial thermoplasty.

- **Conclusion**: To optimize therapy and improve outcomes such as daily symptoms, quality of life, exacerbations, and hospitalizations, a clear picture of a patient's asthma phenotype is needed to guide therapy. Determining asthma phenotypes is the foundation of precision medicine for this persistent, often difficult-to-treat disease.

### Efficacy and safety of tralokinumab in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial [^112Fm2ik]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Interleukin 13 is a central mediator of asthma, and tralokinumab is a human interleukin-13 neutralising monoclonal antibody. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of two dosing regimens of tralokinumab in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, phase 2b study across 98 sites in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Patients aged 18–75 years with severe asthma and two to six exacerbations in the previous year were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive voice-response or web-response system to one of two dosing regimen groups: every 2 weeks, or every 2 weeks for 12 weeks followed by every 4 weeks. Further randomisation (2:1) was done via computer-generated permuted-block randomisation (block size of six), assigning patients to receive either tralokinumab 300 mg or placebo for 1 year. All participants received high-dose fluticasone and salmeterol and continued other pre-study controller drugs. Treatment was administered by an unmasked study investigator not involved in the management of patients; all other study site personnel, patients, the study funder, and data analysts were blinded to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the annual asthma exacerbation rate at week 52 in the intention-to-treat population. Key secondary endpoints included prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6), and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire-Standardised Version (AQLQ[S]). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01402986.

### Pragmatic clinical perspective on biologics for severe refractory type 2 asthma [^114o1sPU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with severe refractory asthma present a challenging clinical conundrum for practicing clinicians. Biologics that target key mediators in the type 2 inflammation cascade, including IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IgE, can be effective strategies for these patients. However, with various biologics available, choosing the optimal one for a particular patient becomes a nuanced decision.

We propose a pragmatic algorithm that identifies the optimal biologic class for patients who have specific type 2 disease endotypes. Patients with eosinophilic endotypes fare well with anti-IL-5(rα) medications, comprising mepolizumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab, because they have been shown to reduce exacerbations in severe eosinophilic asthma by approximately 50%. In patients with fractional exhaled nitric oxide-high endotypes, anti-IL-4rα such as dupilumab is deemed to be most effective and has demonstrated a 47% reduction in asthma exacerbations. For patients with severe uncontrolled allergic asthma, anti-IgE (omalizumab) is effective and has been shown to confer a 25% reduction in asthma exacerbations.

Type 2 comorbidities, including chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, atopic dermatitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and eosinophilic esophagitis, are important to bear in mind before the prescription of biologics. Further head-to-head studies are indicated to compare biologics in patients with mixed endotypes according to peripheral blood eosinophils, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and allergic status. The evidence strongly supports endotype-driven prescribing of biologics to achieve optimal outcomes in patients with severe refractory type 2 asthma.

### Biologic treatment eligibility for real-world patients with severe asthma: The IDEAL study [^112ZFnrY]. Journal of Asthma (2018). Low credibility.

Severe asthma comprises several distinct phenotypes. Consequently, patients with severe asthma can be eligible for more than one biologic treatment targeting Th2 inflammation, such as anti-interleukin (IL)-5 and anti-immunoglobulin (Ig) E. The objective of this study was to describe treatment eligibility and overlap in treatment eligibility for mepolizumab (anti-IL-5), omalizumab (anti-IgE), and reslizumab (anti-IL-5) in patients with severe asthma who were recruited from clinical practice.

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional, single-visit, observational study in six countries enrolled patients with severe asthma (defined by American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines). Assessable patients were analyzed as a total cohort and a sub-cohort who were not currently receiving omalizumab. Treatment eligibility was defined according to the local prescribing information or protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients currently receiving omalizumab were automatically categorized as omalizumab-eligible.

- **Results**: The total cohort comprised 670 patients who met the analysis criteria, of whom 20% were eligible for mepolizumab, 31–41% were eligible for omalizumab (depending on eligibility criteria used), and 5% were eligible for reslizumab. In patients not currently receiving omalizumab (n = 502), proportions eligible for each biologic were similar (mepolizumab: 20%, reslizumab: 6%) or lower (omalizumab: 7–21%) than those for the total cohort. Overlap in treatment eligibility varied; in mepolizumab-eligible patients not currently receiving omalizumab.

### Choosing the right biologic for the right patient with severe asthma [^114Xv8ma]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

In this installment of the How I Do It series on severe asthma, we tackle the clinical conundrum of choosing the right biologic for the right patient with severe asthma. With six biologics now approved for use in this area comprising four different targeting strategies (anti-IgE: omalizumab; anti-IL-5 and anti-IL-5-receptor: mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab; anti-IL-4-receptor: dupilumab; anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin: tezepelumab), this question is increasingly complex. Recognizing that no head-to-head trial has compared biologics, we based our review on the expected effects of inhibiting different aspects of type 2 airway inflammation, supported whenever possible by clinical trial and real-world data.

We use four variations of a case of severe uncontrolled asthma to develop concepts and considerations introduced in the previous installment ("Workup of Severe Asthma") and discuss pregnancy-related, biomarker-related, comorbidity-related, and corticosteroid dependency-related considerations when choosing a biologic. The related questions of deciding when, why, and how to switch from one biologic to another are also discussed. Overall, we consider that the choice of biologics should be based on the available clinical trial data for the desired efficacy outcomes, the biomarker profile of the patient, safety profiles (e.g. when pregnancy is considered), and opportunities to target two comorbidities with one biologic. Using systemic and airway biomarkers (blood eosinophils and exhaled nitric oxide [Feno]) and other phenotypic characteristics, we suggest a framework.

### Effective management of severe asthma with biologic medications in adult patients: A literature review and international expert opinion [^115ab5gn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Severe asthma often remains uncontrolled despite effective treatments and evidence-based guidelines. A group of global experts in asthma and biologic medications from nine countries considered the most relevant clinical variables to manage severe asthma in adult patients and guide treatment choice. The resulting recommendations address the investigation of biomarker levels — blood eosinophil count along with fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) — clinical features, such as oral corticosteroid (OCS) dependence, specific comorbid disease entities associated with severe type 2 asthma, and safety considerations.

Evidence suggests that biomarkers, including both blood or sputum eosinophil counts as well as FeNO, add prognostic and predictive value and should be measured in all patients with severe asthma. OCS use is an important factor in biologic selection, especially given the documented ability of some biologics to reduce OCS dependence. Comorbid diseases and relevant safety considerations for each biologic should also be considered. More data are needed to determine whether biomarker profiles identify patients suited to one biologic versus another, as limited data support differential predictors of response. Further prospective head-to-head trials and post hoc analyses of clinical trial data are warranted.

The authors believe that these recommendations have value as they offer expert opinion to assist healthcare providers in making difficult decisions regarding the quality of care in severe type 2 asthma with biologic medications. These recommendations remain conditional and…

### Clinical benefits of 7 years of treatment with omalizumab in severe uncontrolled asthmatics [^116otUMP]. Journal of Asthma (2011). Low credibility.

Severe asthma is characterized by inadequate symptom control and a high rate of inflammation despite high doses of steroids. Omalizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-IgE, provides a new therapeutic strategy in severe allergic asthma.

- **Aim**: This study aimed to assess whether long-term treatment with omalizumab improved clinical control in severe asthmatics.

- **Methods**: We investigated the effects of omalizumab on asthma outcomes by evaluating seven severe allergic asthmatic patients who were treated for 7 years with add-on omalizumab. The number of exacerbations, use of antibiotics, additional asthma medications (systemic steroids, nebulized steroids, and bronchodilators), and spirometry were analyzed before and after omalizumab treatment.

- **Results**: Omalizumab was well tolerated by all the studied patients. It improved FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio and reduced symptom score, asthma exacerbations, and the use of antibiotics, nebulized steroids, bronchodilators, and oral corticosteroids. These effects were evident after 4 years of treatment and more pronounced after 7 years of treatment.

This study underlines the utility of long-term treatment with omalizumab to improve asthma clinical outcomes in severe asthmatics.

### Changing paradigms in the treatment of severe asthma: The role of biologic therapies [^1169zYbc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Cytokine antagonists are monoclonal antibodies that offer new treatment options for refractory asthma. They will also increase complexity because they are effective only for patients with certain asthma subtypes that remain to be more clearly defined. The clinical and inflammatory heterogeneity within refractory asthma makes it difficult to manage the disease and to determine which, if any, biologic therapy is suitable for a specific patient. The purpose of this article is to provide a data-driven discussion to clarify the use of biologic therapies in patients with refractory asthma.

- **Epidemiology and pathophysiology of refractory asthma**: We first discuss this topic.
- **Evidence for biomarkers of eosinophilic or type 2-high asthma**: We interpret evidence so that clinicians can determine potential treatments for patients based on knowledge of their effectiveness in specific asthma phenotypes.
- **Clinical data on biologic therapies**: We assess clinical data on the efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action of approved and pipeline biologic therapies.
- **Phenotyping or endotyping refractory asthma**: We conclude by discussing how biologic therapies can play a role in treating patients with refractory asthma.

### Treating severe asthma: Targeting the IL-5 pathway [^112gYxYQ]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

Clinical, functional, and inflammatory predictors have been analyzed in several studies to identify possible predictors of a better response to treatment. These studies have primarily focused on treatment efficacy and safety; however, there is still a lack of information regarding the potential mechanisms behind non-response to anti-IL5/IL5R monoclonal antibodies therapies. Additionally, the long-term response needs further exploration considering that biomarkers, which guide clinicians to the best treatment options, may also vary over time.

At the time of writing, blood eosinophil levels seem to represent the most indicative biomarker in determining response to anti-IL5/IL5R mAbs, even though there is still a debate regarding its role in real-life studies. Higher eosinophil levels, the presence of late-onset asthma, a history of nasal polyposis, and frequent exacerbations might further increase the chance of a good response. Nonetheless, further studies are needed to validate selected biomarkers of treatment response to provide clinicians with information to choose the right biological among different anti-IL5 mAbs.

Interestingly, Mukherjee et al. recently demonstrated that the currently approved indications for anti-IL5 mAbs are not sufficient to ensure an optimal response in real-life clinical practice. Other factors, such as the development of autoimmune phenomena, may be relevant and require attention.

The need to recognize the clinical relevance of phenotypes and biomarkers, both those currently available and those to be expected, is essential.

### Factors to consider in prescribing asthma biologic therapies to children [^114o81fd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

The increasing availability of biologics, both by expanding age indications and by development of new therapies, provides additional options to treat children and adolescents with severe asthma. However, the evidence for these biologics in these populations is limited compared with that for adult studies. As such, before initiation of therapy, possible alternative therapies that can also provide asthma control, confirmation of the diagnosis of asthma, management of comorbidities, and assessment of adherence should be explored. The choice of a biologic should be a shared decision-making process between providers and families, balancing biologic efficacy, goals of care, administration, and ability to treat multiple conditions. Response to treatment should be periodically evaluated not only to ensure an ineffective treatment is not continued but also to consider when to potentially discontinue therapy should it be beneficial. The utilization of biologics in children and adolescents with severe asthma also leads to unanswered questions on their role in disease remission and long-term outcomes.

### IL-17 in severe asthma: Where do we stand [^1136Epnu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Asthma is a major chronic disease ranging from mild to severe refractory disease and is classified into various clinical phenotypes. Severe asthma is difficult to treat and frequently requires high doses of systemic steroids. In some cases, severe asthma even responds poorly to steroids. Several studies have suggested a central role of IL-17 (also called IL-17A) in severe asthma. Indeed, high levels of IL-17 are found in induced sputum and bronchial biopsies obtained from patients with severe asthma.

The recent identification of a steroid-insensitive pathogenic Th17 pathway is therefore of major interest. In addition, IL-17A has been described in multiple aspects of asthma pathogenesis, including structural alterations of epithelial cells and smooth muscle contraction. In this perspective article, we frame the topic of IL-17A effects in severe asthma by reviewing updated information from human studies. We summarize and discuss the implications of IL-17 in the induction of neutrophilic airway inflammation, steroid insensitivity, the epithelial cell profile, and airway remodeling.

### Real-world efficacy of treatment with benralizumab, dupilumab, mepolizumab and reslizumab for severe asthma: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112MtNyx]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis shows that in real-world studies, mepolizumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab are effective treatments for asthma when evaluated against key clinical parameters. The effects observed in real-world trials are similar to those seen in the active group of equivalent RCTs. Further research is required to provide precise effect estimates for dupilumab in a real-world setting.

### Biologic use and outcomes among adults with severe asthma treated by US subspecialists [^112jxLLy]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Multiple biologics are now available for severe asthma (SA) treatment and can improve outcomes for patients. However, few available data describe the real-world use and effectiveness of multiple approved biologics, including biologic switching, among subspecialists in the United States.

- **Objective**: To evaluate biologic use and associated exacerbation outcomes in a large cohort of subspecialist-treated US adults with SA.

- **Methods**: CHRONICLE is an ongoing, noninterventional study of subspecialist-treated US adults with SA receiving biologics, maintenance systemic corticosteroids, or those persistently uncontrolled by high-dose inhaled corticosteroids with additional controllers. For enrolled patients, sites report asthma exacerbations and medication use starting 12 months before enrollment. For patients enrolled between February 2018 and February 2021, biologic use and exacerbation outcomes before and after biologic initiation are described.

- **Results**: Among 2793 enrolled patients, 66% (n = 1832) were receiving biologics. The most used biologic (> 1 biologic use per patient allowed) was omalizumab (47%) followed by benralizumab (27%), mepolizumab (26%), dupilumab (18%), and reslizumab (3%). Overall, 16% of patients had biologic switches, 13% had stops, and 89% had ongoing biologic use. Patients starting and switching biologics experienced a 58% (1.80 vs 0.76 per patient-year) and 49% (1.47 vs 0.75 per patient-year) reduction in exacerbations, respectively (both P < .001) with a numerically greater reduction observed among those starting non-anti-immunoglobulin biologics.

### Monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of refractory asthma [^111rVGqm]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

A small proportion of patients with asthma have severe disease characterized by persistent airflow obstruction, airway hyperresponsiveness, and eosinophilic airway inflammation. This review focuses on the clinical efficacy of inhibiting T helper 2-cytokine-mediated inflammatory responses using monoclonal antibodies directed against immunoglobulin E (IgE), interleukin (IL)-5, and IL-4/IL-13 in patients with severe refractory asthma.

The heterogeneity of airway inflammation in severe asthma has led to the recognition of multiple pathophysiologically distinct severe asthma endotypes. Biomarkers are being developed and evaluated to identify these endotypes and to guide the use of specific biologics in appropriate patients who remain uncontrolled on high doses of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators or oral corticosteroids.

- **Examples include**: The efficacy of omalizumab in patients with severe refractory atopic asthma characterized by raised serum total IgE; mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab in patients with eosinophilic exacerbations characterized by blood and sputum eosinophilia despite high doses of corticosteroids; and lebrikizumab, pitrakinra, dupilumab, and tralokinumab that target the IL-4/IL-13 signaling pathways in patients with eosinophilic asthma or raised serum periostin.

### Treating severe asthma: Targeting the IL-5 pathway [^113tVKKa]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic asthma in adults is generally a well-characterized phenotype. The presence of eosinophilic inflammation in the airways is associated with disease severity, increased risk of exacerbations, airway hyper-responsiveness, and worsening of symptom control. Once eosinophils migrate into the lungs, they have a pivotal effect on airway type-2 inflammation by promoting the activation of the innate and adaptive immune response.

There are currently three biologics approved for severe asthma treatment, targeting specifically IL-5 and IL-5Rα: mepolizumab and reslizumab are both monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-5, while benralizumab targets IL-5Rα.

Biological treatments targeting IL-5 and IL-5Rα have recently been approved for pediatric severe asthma; therefore, it is important to include this patient group as well. Since molecular pathways underlying severe asthma seem to differ between the pediatric population and adults, clinical effects and predictors of response might vary. For example, in contrast to the adult population, blood eosinophils or airway eosinophils might not always equal type-2 inflammation in the pediatric population, and features of type-2 inflammation seem to be age-dependent. In children, airway Th2 cytokines, including interleukin, play a critical role.
