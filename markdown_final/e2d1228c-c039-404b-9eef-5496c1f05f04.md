## Question

What medications can help the elderly sleep?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications can help older adults sleep, including what to use, what to avoid, and how to monitor safely and effectively in this population. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overall treatment hierarchy and confirm whether nonpharmacologic therapy remains first-line in the elderly. Then, I should verify which pharmacologic classes have supportive evidence and safer profiles for older adults and reconcile guideline differences. Next, I will review dosing, duration limits, and deprescribing strategies specific to geriatrics. Finally, I need to outline safety monitoring, special cautions, and a practical decision pathway with clear checkpoints and re-evaluation timelines.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: CBT‑I is first‑line for chronic insomnia at any age, and that includes older adults; I should double-check that multiple high‑credibility guidelines agree. Yes, ACP 2016 names CBT‑I as the initial treatment with strong recommendation and moderate‑quality evidence, and the 2023 European insomnia guideline and BAP 2019 both endorse CBT‑I as first‑line and feasible via in‑person or digital delivery, emphasizing sleep restriction and stimulus control as core active elements; importantly, in older adults CBT‑I also reduces long‑term risk of major depression, which further strengthens its primacy in geriatric care [^116NEnff] [^1173F5ek] [^113JEkcf] [^116EGjH1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about medications before I re‑establish hierarchy and time frames. I should confirm that pharmacotherapy is reserved for adjunctive use with CBT‑I, short‑term symptom relief, or when CBT‑I alone is insufficient after a fair trial and shared decision‑making; AAFP 2024 discourages long‑term pharmacotherapy beyond roughly 3 months, and ACP 2016 explicitly recommends shared decision‑making for short‑term medication add‑on after unsuccessful CBT‑I, which is especially relevant in older adults who are more sensitive to adverse effects [^113Xs6Gk] [^112P7P2s].

> Next, I will examine melatonin receptor–targeting options since age‑related melatonin decline is clinically relevant; wait, I need to reconcile differing guidance about melatonin itself. European guidelines and BAP recommend prolonged‑release melatonin for patients over 55, with ESRS 2023 allowing longer‑term courses up to 3 months in selected older adults, whereas AASM 2017 advised against melatonin for primary sleep onset or maintenance insomnia; I should clarify that the AASM caution was broad and not specific to the prolonged‑release geriatric indication, while ramelteon, an MT1/MT2 agonist, is suggested by AASM 2017 for sleep‑onset insomnia with supportive FDA data up to 6 months without evidence of dependence, which is attractive for older adults with sleep‑onset difficulties and circadian dysregulation [^116UfSZv] [^112Pw3DQ] [^111vt37A] [^114fFsFM] [^113fHpGH].

> I will now consider the nonbenzodiazepine "Z‑drugs" for carefully selected short‑term use; let me verify efficacy and risk specifically in older adults. Short‑term RCT evidence shows small but significant improvements in sleep outcomes with zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon, yet longer‑term observational data consistently associate Z‑drugs with increased risks of falls and fractures in older populations; ESRS 2023 recommends restricting BZRA use to short‑term courses of about 4 weeks, with any extended use being intermittent and individualized, and AASM 2017 suggests specific agents with attention to onset versus maintenance targets; in geriatrics I should start at the lowest effective dose, prefer shorter half‑life options to minimize next‑day effects, and implement an a‑priori taper plan, with CFPC 2018 advising slow dose reductions in adults 65 and older; I should double‑check that the small mean benefits in older RCTs are balanced against impaired next‑day function documented historically in sedative meta‑analyses [^114v8MUs] [^112XKYfQ] [^112HrsPY] [^117Ucop8] [^111u5L4j] [^112pGi9m] [^115K3JaA].

> Let me consider orexin receptor antagonists next, especially for sleep‑maintenance symptoms; I should confirm where they fit. AASM 2017 recommends considering suvorexant for sleep‑maintenance insomnia, and ESRS 2023 allows longer‑term use in selected patients after individualized discussion; these agents target wake‑promoting pathways and may avoid some respiratory and cognitive risks of GABAergic drugs, but geriatric long‑term safety data remain more limited, so they are reasonable after melatonin‑pathway options and with careful monitoring for next‑day somnolence and falls [^115ebFKm] [^117Hy74z].

> Now I will review low‑dose antidepressants; I need to check which have the best evidence in older adults. AASM 2017 supports very low‑dose doxepin, 3–6 mg, for sleep‑maintenance insomnia, which at these doses has minimal anticholinergic activity, while trazodone remains commonly used off‑label with limited high‑quality efficacy data and notable risks of orthostatic hypotension and falls in older patients; in dementia care, legacy APA guidance allowed trazodone or short‑acting hypnotics only after other approaches failed, reinforcing that these are fallback options rather than first‑line for geriatric insomnia [^115Qdvic] [^114X6wdZ] [^116u1vkm].

> Before recommending benzodiazepines, I should pause and re‑weigh risk; benzodiazepines carry higher risks of cognitive impairment, delirium, dependence, and falls in older adults, so even though AASM 2017 lists temazepam or triazolam as options and ESRS 2023 permits short‑term courses up to 4 weeks, these agents should generally be avoided in geriatrics unless there is a specific indication, the lowest dose is used, and meticulous monitoring is in place; if considered at all, treatment should be time‑limited with a clear deprescribing plan from the outset [^115xeZsx] [^115YfXEG] [^114ozjkD] [^113NgeWU] [^115GcPxM].

> I should also identify medications to avoid in the elderly with insomnia; antihistamines impose anticholinergic burden and delirium risk, antipsychotics should not be used for primary insomnia absent a compelling comorbidity, and herbal or phytotherapeutic agents are not recommended by ESRS 2023; moreover, neurological guidelines advise avoiding sedatives in Parkinson disease due to sleep–wake vulnerabilities, underscoring the need to review comorbid conditions and drug–drug interactions carefully before prescribing any hypnotic [^117WZuro] [^1133uYMz] [^114X6wdZ].

> Let me synthesize age‑specific prescribing principles; for patients older than about 55, prolonged‑release melatonin is a preferred first pharmacologic choice due to alignment with age‑related physiology and a favorable safety profile, with ramelteon as an evidence‑based alternative for sleep‑onset difficulty; if additional pharmacotherapy is needed, a short half‑life Z‑drug can be reserved for brief rescue use, and for predominant maintenance complaints low‑dose doxepin or an orexin antagonist can be considered; durations should be as short as possible, typically 1–2 week trials with firm limits around 4 weeks for BZRAs, and every initiation should be paired with an explicit deprescribing plan and concurrent CBT‑I to facilitate taper and consolidation of gains [^116UfSZv] [^112Pw3DQ] [^114v8MUs] [^114ozjkD] [^112pGi9m] [^113Xs6Gk].

> I need to ensure a robust safety monitoring protocol is in place before and after starting any hypnotic in older adults; at baseline I should assess fall risk and gait, screen cognition, reconcile medications for interactions, and collect a sleep diary, then reassess within two weeks and monthly for efficacy, next‑day sedation, confusion, and falls, documenting any cognitive fluctuations or delirium; concurrently maintaining CBT‑I and setting a taper timeline at the outset markedly improves outcomes and reduces exposure to sedatives [^111u5L4j] [^112pGi9m] [^113auRx1].

> Now, let me translate this into a practical decision pathway; first, confirm the insomnia diagnosis and screen for comorbid contributors such as sleep apnea, restless legs, pain, depression, polypharmacy, and circadian misalignment, then initiate CBT‑I as the nonpharmacologic foundation; if medication is still needed, for sleep‑onset difficulty consider ramelteon 8 mg qHS or prolonged‑release melatonin 2 mg qHS, for sleep‑maintenance difficulty consider prolonged‑release melatonin 2 mg qHS or low‑dose doxepin 3–6 mg qHS, and when both onset and maintenance are problematic after these steps, consider suvorexant 10–20 mg qHS; for short‑term rescue only, a low‑dose, short‑acting Z‑drug such as zaleplon 5 mg or zolpidem 5 mg can be used intermittently with an explicit end date, with reassessment at two weeks to confirm benefit and tolerability and with immediate discontinuation if ineffective or if adverse effects emerge [^111vt37A] [^116UfSZv] [^115Qdvic] [^115ebFKm] [^117DcWoi] [^112HrsPY].

> But wait, I should also consider long‑term brain health when selecting and continuing hypnotics in older adults; observational data associate frequent sleep medication use with increased dementia risk in some cohorts, and while causality is uncertain, this signal reinforces the importance of minimizing exposure, preferring safer mechanisms, and prioritizing durable nonpharmacologic strategies like CBT‑I for sustained benefit [^111Aa1yG].

> In summary, I should emphasize one key takeaway for the elderly: prolonged‑release melatonin is the preferred first‑line pharmacologic option when medication is indicated, ramelteon is a rational alternative for sleep‑onset complaints, and all other hypnotics should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration, embedded within CBT‑I and accompanied by rigorous monitoring for falls, cognitive changes, and next‑day impairment, with a clear deprescribing plan from day one [^116UfSZv] [^113fHpGH] [^114v8MUs] [^112pGi9m] [^113auRx1].

In older adults with insomnia, **CBT-I is first-line** and should precede medications [^1173F5ek] [^113auRx1]. If pharmacotherapy is needed, use the **lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration, with close monitoring for falls, cognitive effects, and drug–drug interactions [^113Xs6Gk] [^112pGi9m].

- **Melatonin (prolonged-release 2 mg)**: preferred for adults ≥ 55; safe, modestly effective, and suitable for longer-term use [^112Pw3DQ] [^116UfSZv].
- **Ramelteon**: for sleep-onset insomnia; minimal next-day effects and low abuse potential [^113fHpGH] [^111vt37A].
- **Doxepin (3–6 mg)**: for sleep maintenance; low anticholinergic burden [^114X6wdZ] [^115Qdvic].
- **Orexin antagonists (e.g. suvorexant)**: for sleep maintenance; consider in selected patients after individualized risk–benefit discussion [^117Hy74z] [^115ebFKm].
- **Z-drugs (zolpidem, eszopiclone, zaleplon)**: short-term use only (≤ 4 weeks) due to fall and cognitive risks [^114v8MUs] [^116ddxsV].
- **Benzodiazepines**: avoid or limit to very short-term use due to high risks of falls, cognitive impairment, and dependence [^114ozjkD] [^111u5L4j].

Avoid **antipsychotics**, **antihistamines**, and **herbal remedies** because of adverse effects or lack of efficacy [^115yN292] [^117WZuro]. Taper hypnotics slowly with **CBT-I** support to reduce withdrawal and relapse [^112pGi9m] [^113JEkcf].

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: a systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^116ddxsV]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Z-drugs are usually prescribed as first-line pharmacological therapy for insomnia. However, the benefits and risks of Z-drugs may differ for older adults. This systematic review investigated the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of Z-drugs in the management of insomnia in older adults.

- **Methods**: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, controlled interventional, and observational studies using a pre-formulated search term. The target population was older adults (≥ 65 years old) with insomnia. Studies were included if they reported efficacy and/or safety outcomes of the use of Z-drugs for the management of insomnia compared to placebo, usual or no treatment, or other pharmacological agents.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies were included (8 interventional and 10 observational studies). In short-term interventional studies, Z-drugs were similarly or better efficacious in improving both sleep and daytime parameters than placebo or other pharmacological treatments, while showing good results on measures of safety. However, in longer-term observational studies, Z-drugs significantly increased the risk for falls and fractures in comparison to no treatment or melatonin agonists.

- **Conclusions**: Analyzing the evidence from short-term interventional studies, Z-drugs appear effective and safe for treatment of insomnia in older adults, but they may have unfavorable side effects when used for longer periods of time. We, therefore, recommend…

Research into the sleep-wake cycle has provided new treatment targets for patients with insomnia, as well as a better understanding of how medications affect sleep processes. Insomnia medications, including benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, focus on enhancing sleep-promoting systems through broad antagonism of GABA. Other medications that promote sleep by blocking wake-promoting systems include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antihistamines, but adverse effects and nonspecific therapeutic effects limit their use. New and emerging insomnia medications are focusing on blocking wake-promoting systems via more selective antagonism of orexin, serotonin, and norepinephrine. These medications may offer improved efficacy with fewer adverse effects.

### Sedative hypnotics in older people with insomnia: Meta-analysis of risks and benefits [^111u5L4j]. BMJ (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to quantify and compare the potential benefits, such as subjective reports of sleep variables, and the risks, including adverse events and morning-after psychomotor impairment, of short-term treatment with sedative hypnotics in older people with insomnia.

- **Data sources**: The study utilized several databases and sources, including Medline, Embase, the Cochrane clinical trials database, PubMed, and PsychLit, covering the period from 1966 to 2003. It also included bibliographies of published reviews and meta-analyses and information from manufacturers of newer sedative hypnotics (zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone) regarding unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of any pharmacological treatment for insomnia were included, provided they lasted for at least five consecutive nights and involved participants aged 60 or older with insomnia who were otherwise free of psychiatric or psychological disorders.

- **Results**: Twenty-four studies, involving 2,417 participants with extractable data, met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Sleep quality improved with an effect size of 0.14 (P = 0.05). However, reports of daytime fatigue were 3.82 times more common (95% CI: 1.88 to 7.80, P < 0.001) in individuals using any sedative compared with those on a placebo.

- **Conclusions**: While improvements in sleep with sedative use are statistically significant, the magnitude of the effect is small.

### Management of chronic insomnia disorder in adults: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116NEnff]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of chronic insomnia disorder in adults.

- **Methods**: This guideline is based on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials published in English from 2004 through September 2015. Evaluated outcomes included global outcomes assessed by questionnaires, patient-reported sleep outcomes, and harms. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations by using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

- **Recommendation 1**: ACP recommends that all adult patients receive cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 2**: ACP recommends that clinicians use a shared decision-making approach, including a discussion of the benefits, harms, and costs of short-term use of medications, to decide whether to add pharmacological therapy in adults with chronic insomnia disorder in whom cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) alone was unsuccessful (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: A systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^112RwTwv]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a major healthcare problem in the Western world. It is defined as a dissatisfaction with the quantity or quality of sleep and is associated with difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, as well as early-morning waking with an inability to return to sleep. Approximately 6 to 10% of adults experience insomnia that meets diagnostic criteria. Insomnia is more commonly experienced by older adults and can occur independently or be caused by other diseases.

Benzodiazepine-like medications (BDLM), also called Z-drugs, are a chemically heterogeneous group defined by their mechanism of action: a selectivity for certain γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunits that distinguishes them from benzodiazepines (BDZ).

Over the last 5 years, zolpidem has been the most frequently prescribed hypnotic worldwide. In 2017, zolpidem and zopiclone were the top two prescribed BDLMs in Europe. Various studies confirm the high prescription rate of Z-drugs in community-dwelling, hospitalized, and nursing home patients, with prescribing rates highest for older women.

BDLMs are licensed only for short-term use. This restriction entails a paradox, as the vast majority of afflicted patients need long-term treatment. The time restriction on BDLM use is attributable to their effect-risk profile, where the negative impact multiplies with prolonged duration of treatment, and benefits decrease or stay steady at best.

BDLMs were expected to achieve the strong sedative and hypnotic effects desired, while avoiding the anxiolytic, myorelaxant, analgesic, and anticognitive side effects common with other medications.

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic insomnia in adults [^113Vj2DN]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder in the general population and is commonly encountered in medical practices. It is defined as the subjective perception of difficulty with sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep, resulting in some form of daytime impairment. Insomnia may present with a variety of specific complaints and etiologies, making its evaluation and management demanding on a clinician's time.

The purpose of this clinical guideline is to provide clinicians with a practical framework for the assessment and management of chronic adult insomnia. This is accomplished by using existing evidence-based insomnia practice parameters where available, as well as consensus-based recommendations to address gaps where such parameters do not exist. Unless otherwise stated, "insomnia" in this guideline refers to chronic insomnia, which is present for at least a month, as opposed to acute or transient insomnia, which may last from days to weeks.

### Novel perspective of 'poor sleep' in public health: A narrative review [^1164jWQL]. BMJ Public Health (2024). Low credibility.

To address poor sleep in the general population, it is important to promote sleep as a self-modifiable behavior associated with health and to increase awareness of alternative approaches with a well-rationalized improvement of sleep health. As a first line of action, we recommend using several non-pharmacological strategies in the management of poor sleep, starting with sleep hygiene education. When appropriate, additional interventions should be considered.

- **Healthy sleep habits**: Sleep hygiene refers to a set of recommended behaviors a person can engage in throughout the day or before bedtime to promote good sleep. Habits that promote healthy sleep include abstinence from caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine late in the day; restricting bedtime activity to sleep and sex; maintaining regular sleep/wake times; modifying the bedroom environment (e.g. reducing the impact of noise and light); taking naps of less than 30 minutes in the mid-afternoon; and minimizing the use of light-emitting devices, such as smartphones, in the hour before bedtime.

There is limited empirical support for sleep hygiene recommendations as standalone interventions when offered without personalization. However, they can be a valuable resource to increase sleep awareness. Sleep hygiene education can be widely disseminated to individuals not likely to seek medical treatment and may be a more appealing and intuitive option for the general population. We encourage public health authorities in every country to develop specific programs of sleep hygiene, focusing on people who are more vulnerable: the elderly, teenagers, and those with mental disabilities.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: a systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^1153tfWY]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). High credibility.

In summary, 1902 persons participated in the RCTs. All studies analyzed participants older than 65 years, with the proportion of male participants ranging from 19.2% to 45.6%. Four trials reported ethnicities. The number of participants ranged from 44 to 549, with study duration varying from 2 weeks to 18 weeks.

Four trials reported comorbid conditions, co-medication was mentioned in five studies, and cognitive examination was performed in five trials. All RCTs included aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of BDLM either versus placebo, versus BDZ, or versus both placebo and BDZ. Four RCTs were conducted in the US, one in Sweden, one in Canada, one in Germany, and one across France and Belgium. Six studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, while the remaining two studies did not provide information about sponsoring.

One retrospective cohort study was included in our analysis. All participants were older than 70 years, and up to 60% were female. The study included 156,987 participants taking BDLM, aiming to examine the risk of accidental events. Data were recorded over 3 months following at least 3 months without a prescription claim for insomnia medication. While the study provided information about comorbidities and co-medication, no data about physical or cognitive examinations was given. It was conducted in the US from 2000 to 2006.

Five case-control and four case-crossover studies were included in our analysis. In total, 83,720 individuals were analyzed.

Pharmacotherapy is indicated for many types of insomnia, most notably transient insomnia associated with stress, acute illness, or jet lag. Many patients with chronic insomnia, including primary insomnia and insomnia secondary to a variety of medical and psychiatric disorders, also benefit from pharmacotherapy. Relatively few individuals receive prescription medication to help them sleep, and the majority use medication for a few nights to several weeks, rather than continuous use for months or years.

The hypnotics available on the U.S. market today are benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs). BZRAs are efficacious in reducing sleep latency, increasing total sleep time, reducing awakenings, and improving sleep quality without the development of tolerance in studies as long as six months. Side effects of BZRAs are infrequent, dose-related, and associated with the sedative properties of the drug. Sedating antidepressants are also frequently prescribed to promote sleep despite inadequate data to support their efficacy for this indication and a greater potential for clinically troublesome side effects.

### The assessment and management of insomnia: an update [^112xjy2k]. World Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Insomnia poses significant challenges to public health. It is a common condition associated with marked impairment in function and quality of life, as well as psychiatric and physical morbidity and accidents. It is, therefore, important that effective treatment is provided in clinical practice. To this end, this paper reviews critical aspects of the assessment of insomnia and the available treatment options.

These options include both non-medication treatments, most notably cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, and a variety of pharmacologic therapies such as benzodiazepines, "z-drugs", melatonin receptor agonists, selective histamine H1 antagonists, orexin antagonists, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and non-selective antihistamines. A review of the available research indicates that rigorous double-blind, randomized controlled trials are lacking for some of the most commonly administered insomnia therapies. However, there are numerous interventions demonstrated to have therapeutic effects in insomnia in trials with the aforementioned features, and their risk/benefit profiles have been well characterized.

These interventions can form the basis for systematic, evidence-based treatment of insomnia in clinical practice. We review this evidence base and highlight areas where more studies are needed, aiming to provide a resource for improving the clinical management of the many patients with insomnia.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: A systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^117U8AdT]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

A comprehensive search for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, controlled interventional studies, and observational studies was conducted using a pre-developed search term on four databases: PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.

The PICOS-framework was utilized to develop a search term targeting: population - people over 65 years, intervention - BDLM, comparator - no limits, and outcomes as outlined in the 'Types of outcomes' section. The study design included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, controlled interventional studies, and observational studies. The complete search terms can be found in Additional File 1. This search was conducted on June 19, 2019, by a data research team at the University of Witten using the OVID interface for each database.

Search results were saved using EndNote X9 reference management software, where duplicates were removed upon retrieval.

- **Selection of studies**: The titles and abstracts identified were independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers. Full-text articles were obtained for all references meeting the inclusion criteria or where inclusion was uncertain. Reviewers VS, LH, and EM participated in this task. Consensus was established, and disagreements were arbitrated by AS. Additionally, reference lists of included studies and those identified via snowballing were screened for eligibility. Studies excluded at the full-text stage were documented with justifications for exclusion.

### Long-term health conditions and their impact on people with sleep disturbances and dementia [^112xSVvG]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Carers discussed the dilemmas they faced regarding medications prescribed to their relatives for sleep, pain, and other long-term conditions (LTCs). They highlighted that medication for dementia, sleep, and LTCs often does not help or produces side effects. Carers felt the responsibility of weighing up the risks and benefits of medications, especially for medications prescribed 'as needed', particularly painkillers, as this son explained:

"It does help her get off to sleep for a few hours. But I notice that if she has it for two or three days running… her daytime behavior just changes. She becomes more confused. She's looking a bit more lost… Last night, I didn't give her any medication at all because I saw that she was a bit confused. I thought I'm going to give her a couple of days off. But then, you know, I have a night which is just absolutely terrible. And I'm exhausted".

The challenge of weighing up the relative risks and benefits of medication for pain was exacerbated by people with dementia being unable to clearly recognize or communicate their level of pain. Carers reported receiving advice they experienced as conflicting from doctors, so they felt they had to make the decision for themselves based on trial and error. One daughter explained that despite receiving professional advice regarding pain management for her mother, she chose not to follow it for fear of her mother becoming addicted to painkillers. This potentially left pain untreated, which impacted her mother's sleep.

### Management of insomnia in the geriatric patient [^114kYjvs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Insomnia in older individuals is common and often undiagnosed, which can lead to significant patient morbidity. A stepwise, thorough history and physical examination, including interviews with the bed partner and the use of a sleep diary, are valuable diagnostic adjuncts. Polysomnography should be reserved for patients whose history suggests specific sleep-related breathing or movement disorders. Contributing physical or psychiatric conditions require treatment as in other geriatric patients. Improved sleep hygiene often provides symptom relief in mild to moderate insomnia, while various non-drug treatments can be tried for more refractory cases. Most prescription and over-the-counter medications carry significant risks of adverse events and drug interactions; however, others demonstrate an acceptable risk-to-benefit profile and are preferred in older patients.

### Novel perspective of 'poor sleep' in public health: A narrative review [^1129gFhg]. BMJ Public Health (2024). Low credibility.

A number of other popular non-prescription treatments have demonstrated safety and varying levels of effectiveness. Melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland, plays a fundamental role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythm, and melatonin-based supplements are available to manage sleep disturbances. Melatonin helps to reduce the time to fall asleep; however, there is no recommended dosage regimen for melatonin supplementation. Common side effects, such as somnolence and headaches, have been associated with the use of melatonin.

Plants or plant-derived materials have long been used to treat a range of sleep disturbances; these include chamomile (Matricaria recutita), valerian (Valeriana officinalis), hops (Humulus lupulus), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), and passionflower (Passiflora incarnata). Recent meta-analyses found conflicting results on the actual efficacy of these substances, but they have emphasized the lack of efficacy of most herbal components for insomnia. Some dietary supplements, for example, iron, zinc, magnesium, calcium, nicotinamide, B vitamins, and polyphenols, have shown some positive effects on sleep. There are still a few studies examining the relationship between micronutrient status and sleep; however, emerging evidence suggests a link between dietary micronutrient intake and sleep.

Finally, other sleep aids can improve sleep by modifying environmental factors. Body temperature is a critical determinant of both falling asleep (core body temperature drops) and staying asleep (core body temperature increases).

### Sonata [^115GxDbw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Tolerance

When sleep medicines are used every night for more than a few weeks, they may lose their effectiveness to help you sleep. This is known as "tolerance". Development of tolerance to Sonata has not been observed in outpatient clinical studies of up to 4 weeks in duration; however, it is unknown if the benefits of Sonata in falling asleep more quickly persist beyond 4 weeks. Sleep medicines should, in most cases, be used only for short periods of time, such as 1 or 2 days and generally no longer than 1 or 2 weeks. If your sleep problems continue, consult your doctor, who will determine whether other measures are needed to overcome your sleep problems.

Dependence

Sleep medicines can cause dependence, especially when these medicines are used regularly for longer than a few weeks or at high doses. Some people develop a need to continue taking their medicines. This is known as dependence or "addiction".

When people develop dependence, they may have difficulty stopping the sleep medicine. If the medicine is suddenly stopped, the body is not able to function normally and unpleasant symptoms (see Withdrawal) may occur. They may find they have to keep taking the medicine either at the prescribed dose or at increasing doses just to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

All people taking sleep medicines have some risk of becoming dependent on the medicine. However, people who have been dependent on alcohol or other drugs in the past may have a higher chance of becoming addicted to sleep medicines. This possibility must be considered before using these medicines.

### Effects of insomnia treatments on cognitive function: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116RZYu1]. Psychiatry Research (2024). High credibility.

Globally, insomnia has been shown to impact cognitive function, which has prompted the exploration of effective treatments to enhance cognitive outcomes. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions vary in their effects, indicating that further research for optimized therapeutic strategies is needed.

- **Methods**: Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and PsychInfo from database inception until August 2024 were conducted to identify relevant randomized controlled studies investigating the impacts of insomnia treatments on cognitive function. The standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for all studies. Sensitivity analysis, publication bias, and meta-regression were performed.

- **Results**: A total of 14,829 records were retrieved, with 24 randomized controlled studies assessing the impact of insomnia treatment on cognition. Pooled analysis indicated that non-pharmacological interventions significantly enhanced cognitive function (SMD: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.04–0.49, p = 0.019), with notable improvements observed in memory (SMD: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.25–2.12, p = 0.013), attention (SMD: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.15–0.50, p < 0.001), and daily living activities (SMD: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.20–0.39, p < 0.001) based on self-reported measures. Longer follow-up periods were associated with more pronounced cognitive benefits (SMD: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.14–0.54, p = 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: The critical role of insomnia treatments, particularly non-pharmacological interventions, in improving cognitive function is highlighted.

### Insomnia in the elderly: A review [^112uXHyU]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Insomnia remains one of the most common sleep disorders encountered in the geriatric clinic population. It is frequently characterized by the subjective complaint of difficulty falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or experiencing nonrestorative sleep, which produces significant daytime symptoms, including difficulty concentrating and mood disturbances.

- **Methods**: A search of the literature was conducted to review the epidemiology, definition, and age-related changes in sleep, as well as factors contributing to late-life insomnia. Scales utilized for the assessment of insomnia in older people were also reviewed. The aim is to summarize recent diagnostic guidelines and both nonpharmacological and pharmacological strategies for managing insomnia in the older population.

- **Results**: Insomnia remains a clinical diagnosis. Several demographic, psychosocial, biological, and behavioral factors can contribute to late-life insomnia. Older adults are at a higher risk for the medical and psychiatric effects of insomnia.

- **Conclusions**: The most important aspect of the evaluation of insomnia is detailed history taking and thorough physical examination. Nonpharmacological treatment options have favorable and enduring benefits compared to pharmacological therapy.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for sleep disturbances in people with dementia [^116yQhoC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Sleep disturbances occur frequently in people with dementia, with a reported prevalence of up to 40%. Common problems include an increased number and duration of awakenings and an increased percentage of light sleep. These disturbances are associated with several problems for people with dementia, their relatives, and carers. In individuals with dementia, sleep disturbances may lead to worsening cognitive symptoms, challenging behaviors such as restlessness or wandering, and further harms such as accidental falls. Additionally, they are associated with significant carer distress and have been reported as a factor contributing to the institutionalization of people with dementia.

As pharmacological approaches have shown unsatisfactory results, there is a need to synthesize research evidence on non-pharmacological strategies to improve sleep in people with dementia. Given that interventions are often complex — consisting of multiple active components and implemented in complex contexts — it may be challenging to identify effective intervention components.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of non-pharmacological interventions on sleep disturbances in people with dementia compared to usual care, no treatment, any other non-pharmacological intervention, or any drug treatment intended to improve sleep. Additionally, the aim is to describe the components and processes of any complex intervention included.

- **Search methods**: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was conducted on January 13, 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included individually or cluster-randomized controlled trials.

### Current concepts in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders in the elderly [^1166bRKp]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders are a pervasive problem throughout all patient populations but represent an especially important health problem for the elderly. Alterations in sleep architecture that occur as a part of normal aging contribute to sleep problems as we grow older. Other contributing factors, including comorbid medical conditions, changes in lifestyle and schedule, and altered circadian rhythms, among a host of others, can have detrimental effects on the health of the elderly. Coupled with a number of sleep disorders that either emerge or worsen with age, the effects of poor sleep often result in an overall worsening of quality of life.

Treatment options can be unique in this population and often more difficult due to the effects of normal aging, polypharmacy, and possible medication interactions. The following article focuses on the common sleep disorders that can besiege this population, symptoms to aid in diagnosis, and specific treatment options to help improve the quality of life in the elderly.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the assessment and management of sleep disorders in older persons [^1113SJSU]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2009). Low credibility.

Sleep-related disorders are most prevalent in the older adult population. A high prevalence of medical and psychosocial comorbidities and the frequent use of multiple medications, rather than aging per se, are major reasons for this. A major concern, often underappreciated and underaddressed by clinicians, is the strong bidirectional relationship between sleep disorders and serious medical problems in older adults. Hypertension, depression, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease are examples of diseases more likely to develop in individuals with sleep disorders. Conversely, individuals with any of these diseases are at a higher risk of developing sleep disorders.

The goals of this article are to help guide clinicians in their general understanding of sleep problems in older persons, examine specific sleep disorders that occur in older persons, and suggest evidence- and expert-based recommendations for the assessment and treatment of sleep disorders in older persons. No such recommendations are available to help clinicians in their daily patient care practices.

- **Background and significance**: Introduces the context and importance of understanding sleep issues in older adults.
- **General review of sleep**: Covers basic concepts of sleep health and its impact.
- **Recommendations development**: Discusses the process of forming the recommended practices.
- **General approach to detecting sleep disorders in an ambulatory setting**: Provides methods and strategies for identifying sleep disorders in clinical practice.

These sections are followed by overviews of specific sleep disorders: insomnia, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, parasomnias, hypersomnias, and sleep disorders in long-term care settings. Evidence- and expert-based recommendations are developed to assist clinicians.

### Causes, consequences, and treatments of sleep and circadian disruption in the ICU: An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113RxE49]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Workshop members noted the high demand for sleep medications from caregivers, surrogates, and patients, together with the common misperception that sedation is equivalent to sleep. Bedside clinicians express a strong desire for a safe and effective sleep aid, particularly in patients with concomitant delirium. However, the study of pharmacologic options to promote nighttime sleepiness is limited by small trial sizes, the failure to enroll mechanically ventilated adults with a high severity of illness, and an overreliance on delirium reduction and/or patient-reported sleep quality to define efficacy.

In addition, RCTs at the time of writing have involved prescribing pharmacologic agents upon ICU admission or timed in relation to specific clinical events (e.g. surgical procedure). However, in practice, clinicians are frequently seeking options to promote sleep after patients report sleep disruption or have already presented with delirium. This discrepancy raises important questions regarding the timing and patient selection for pharmaceutical interventions.

Interestingly, pharmacologic therapies to promote daytime wakefulness in the ICU have not been rigorously studied, and this may be a novel and effective approach to sleep promotion in the ICU. Finally, we should continue to consider the sleep and circadian implications of medications routinely used in the ICU (e.g. corticosteroids, benzodiazepines, narcotics, antipsychotics).

### A retrospective observational study to understand medication utilization and lines of treatment in patients with insomnia disorder [^112T8Crm]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a common sleep disorder associated with multiple health concerns. Medications for insomnia carry higher safety risks if clinical practice guidelines or monograph recommendations are not followed. This study aims to understand real-world prescribing practices among patients with insomnia in Canada, including medication utilization, potentially inappropriate medication use, costs incurred, and lines of treatment.

- **Methods**: This retrospective observational study utilized longitudinal drug claims data from 2018 to 2020 from the Canadian IQVIA National Private Drug Plan and Ontario Drug Benefit databases. Patients with any claims for medications approved for insomnia in Canada were identified. Four types of inappropriate medication usage were defined: (1) elevated daily dose; (2) extended duration of use for benzodiazepines (BZD) and/or Z-drugs; (3) combination use; and (4) opioid overlap with BZD and/or Z-drugs.

- **Results**: In 2019, 597,222 patients with insomnia were identified; 64% were female, with an average age of 55 years. Inappropriate medication use was noted in 52.5% of adult patients (aged 18–65 years) and 69.5% of senior patients (aged > 65 years). Extended duration was the most common inappropriate medication usage category. The annual cost of medications for insomnia was $54.8 million, and $30.3 million (55.2%) met inappropriate medication use criteria.

The high prevalence of inappropriate medication usage in insomnia raises serious safety concerns for patients, particularly seniors, suffering from this condition.

### Melatonin treatment for age-related insomnia [^115Vg1nV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Older people typically exhibit poor sleep efficiency and reduced nocturnal plasma melatonin levels. The daytime administration of oral melatonin to younger people, in doses that raise their plasma melatonin levels to the nocturnal range, can accelerate sleep onset. We examined the ability of similar physiological doses to restore nighttime melatonin levels and sleep efficiency in insomniac subjects over 50 years old.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, subjects who slept normally (n = 15) or exhibited actigraphically confirmed decreases in sleep efficiency (n = 15) received, in randomized order, a placebo and three melatonin doses (0.1, 0.3, and 3.0 mg) orally 30 minutes before bedtime for a week. Treatments were separated by one-week washout periods. Sleep data were obtained by polysomnography on the last three nights of each treatment period.

- **Physiologic melatonin dose**: The 0.3 mg dose restored sleep efficiency (P < 0.0001), acting principally in the middle third of the night; it also elevated plasma melatonin levels (P < 0.0008) to normal.
- **Pharmacologic and lowest doses**: The 3.0 mg dose, like the lowest dose (0.1 mg), also improved sleep. However, it induced hypothermia and caused plasma melatonin to remain elevated into the daylight hours.

Although control subjects, like insomniacs, had low melatonin levels, their sleep was unaffected by any melatonin dose.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: A systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^116oSMfN]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Z-drugs are usually prescribed as first-line pharmacological therapy for insomnia. However, the benefits and risks of Z-drugs may differ for older adults. This systematic review investigated the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of Z-drugs in the management of insomnia in older adults.

- **Methods**: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, controlled interventional and observational studies using a pre-formulated search term. The target population was older adults (≥ 65 years old) with insomnia. Studies were included if they reported efficacy and/or safety outcomes of the use of Z-drugs for the management of insomnia compared to placebo, usual or no treatment, or other pharmacological agents.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies were included (8 interventional and 10 observational studies). In short-term interventional studies, Z-drugs were similarly or more efficacious in improving both sleep and daytime parameters than placebo or other pharmacological treatments, while showing good results on measures of safety. However, in longer-term observational studies, Z-drugs significantly increased the risk for falls and fractures in comparison to no treatment or melatonin agonists.

- **Conclusions**: Analyzing the evidence from short-term interventional studies, Z-drugs appear effective and safe for the treatment of insomnia in older adults, but they may have unfavorable side effects when used for longer periods of time. We, therefore, recommend…

### Prevention of incident and recurrent major depression in older adults with insomnia: A randomized clinical trial [^116EGjH1]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Older adults with insomnia have a high risk of incident and recurrent depression. Depression prevention is urgently needed, and such efforts have been neglected for older adults.

The objective of this study was to examine whether treatment of insomnia disorder with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), compared with an active comparator condition, sleep education therapy (SET), prevents major depressive disorder in older adults.

Design, setting, and participants: This assessor-blinded, parallel-group, single-site randomized clinical trial assessed a community-based sample of 431 people and enrolled 291 adults aged 60 years or older with insomnia disorder, who had no major depression or major health events in the past year. Study recruitment was conducted from July 1, 2012, to April 30, 2015. The trial protocol was modified to extend follow-up from 24 to 36 months, with follow-up completion in July 2018. Data analysis was performed from March 1, 2019, to March 30, 2020.

Interventions: Participants were randomized to 2 months of CBT-I (n = 156) or SET (n = 135).

Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the time to incident major depressive disorder as diagnosed by interview and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria. The secondary outcome was sustained remission of insomnia disorder before the depression event or duration of follow-up.

Results: Among the 291 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 70.1 [6.7] years; 168 [57.7%] female; 7 [2.4%] Asian, 32 [11.0%] Black, 3 [1.0%] Pacific Islander, 241 [82.8%] White, 6 [2.1%] multiracial, and 2 [0.7%]).

### Race differences in the association between sleep medication use and risk of dementia [^111Aa1yG]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). High credibility.

The effect of sleep medications on cognition in older adults is controversial, possibly dependent upon sleep quality, and may differ by race. This study aimed to determine the longitudinal association between sleep medication use and incident dementia over 15 years and to explore whether the association is independent of nighttime sleep disturbances and if it differs by race.

Methods: We examined 3,068 community-dwelling older adults (aged 74.1 ± 2.9 years, 41.7% Black, 51.5% female) without dementia. Sleep medication use was recorded three times by asking, "Do you take sleeping pills or other medications to help you sleep?" with response options: "Never (0)", "Rarely (≤ 1/month)", "Sometimes (2–4/month)", "Often (5–15/month)", or "Almost Always (16–30/month)". Incident dementia was defined using hospitalization records, dementia medication prescriptions, or clinically significant decline in global cognition.

Results: Among the participants, 138 (7.71%) Whites and 34 (2.66%) Blacks reported taking sleep medications "often or almost always". Whites were almost twice as likely to take all prescription hypnotics. Over the follow-up period, 617 participants developed dementia. After adjusting for all covariates, participants who reported taking sleep medications ≥ 5/month versus ≤ 1/month were significantly more likely to develop dementia, with this association only observed among Whites (HR = 1.79, 1.21–2.66) but not Blacks (HR = 0.84, 0.38–1.83); p for interaction = 0.048. Further adjustment for nighttime sleep did not appreciably alter the results.

### Diagnosing and treating insomnia in adults and older adults [^112wqjVm]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Insomnia, the most prevalent sleep-wake disorder, affects 6% to 10% of adults. It may result in interpersonal and occupational problems and has a deleterious effect on quality of life. Patients may experience difficulty with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, or both. Insomnia disorder is frequently comorbid with psychiatric, medical, and neurologic disorders, and insomnia and comorbid conditions have bidirectional relationships. Diagnosis should be based on patient interview, assessment with tools, and use of criteria.

Selection of treatment for patients with insomnia should factor in efficacy for the patient's specific complaint as well as other features such as safety profile and abuse liability. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia is a first-line recommendation by guidelines, but some patients are unable or unwilling to try it or may not respond to it. Older adults with insomnia disorder require careful consideration of medications' risk-benefit profiles.

### Non-pharmacological management of primary and secondary insomnia among older people: Review of assessment tools and treatments [^117H5CGa]. Age and Ageing (2003). Low credibility.

Primary and secondary insomnia, especially among older adults, is frequently encountered by family physicians. Pharmacological interventions, although effective in some circumstances, can be detrimental in others. Non-pharmacological management of insomnia may allow patients to self-administer the treatment.

- **Objectives**: Review of published literature of assessment tools and treatments for primary and secondary insomnia.

- **Results**: Two frequently used self-reporting methods for obtaining sleep data are sleep diaries and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. A large amount of research supports the use of non-pharmacological treatments such as stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene education, cognitive therapy, multi-component therapy, and paradoxical intention.

- **Conclusion**: Assessing the nature of insomnia by using an effective assessment tool and providing patients with a non-pharmacological treatment should be the first intervention for insomnia. It is shown that non-pharmacological treatments for primary and secondary insomnia are feasible and effective alternatives to the use of benzodiazepines, and family physicians should consider these when managing older patients with insomnia.

### Insomnia (primary) in older people: Non-drug treatments [^113DsqLR]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Low credibility.

Up to 40% of older adults experience insomnia, characterized by difficulty falling asleep, early waking, or feeling unrefreshed upon waking. The prevalence of insomnia increases with age, and other risk factors include psychological factors, stress, daytime napping, and hyperarousal.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the clinical question: What are the effects of non-drug treatments for primary insomnia in older people (aged 60 years and older)? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other significant databases up to May 2014. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), exercise programmes, and timed exposure to bright light.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112JJKpB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to establish clinical practice recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults when such treatment is clinically indicated. Unlike previous meta-analyses, which focused on broad classes of drugs, this guideline focuses on individual drugs commonly used to treat insomnia. It includes drugs that are FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, as well as several drugs commonly used to treat insomnia without an FDA indication for this condition. This guideline should be used in conjunction with other AASM guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of chronic insomnia in adults.

- **Methods**: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of four experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, and patient values and preferences. Literature reviews are provided for those pharmacologic agents for which sufficient evidence was available to establish recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

- **Recommendations**: The following recommendations are intended as a guideline for clinicians in choosing a specific pharmacological agent for the treatment of chronic insomnia in adults when such treatment is indicated. Under GRADE, a strong recommendation is one that…

### Special considerations in insomnia diagnosis and management: Depressed, elderly, and chronic pain populations [^115V3mzT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with insomnia who also suffer from chronic pain, depression, or are elderly represent segments of the population that are particularly difficult to treat. These populations are at higher risk for experiencing difficulty sleeping and are more likely to face chronic insomnia, sleep maintenance problems, and/or nonrestorative sleep.

Worsening insomnia may exacerbate other somatic and psychological symptoms, and vice versa. Conversely, there is evidence that appropriate recognition and management of the sleep complaint may alleviate other symptoms related to the associated condition and help interrupt this vicious cycle.

### Circadian rhythm and sleep disruption: Causes, metabolic consequences, and countermeasures [^114AufwN]. Endocrine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Finally, behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions show promise in offsetting the adverse effects of circadian rhythm and sleep disruption. Some of the beneficial effects of these interventions may be independent of the circadian system and sleep, however. Because our understanding of the range of healthy phase relationships between the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and peripheral clock systems is poorly characterized, clarifying these relationships could help personalize the prescription of chronobiotics, some of which still require human safety and efficacy studies. Thereafter, comparisons of these interventions are needed to evaluate which are most effective and in what circumstances.

Ultimately, we hope that mankind's historic fascination with the temporal world will continue to draw interest to the importance of the human timing system in all facets of health.

### Optimizing treatment for insomnia [^117Hf3YP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

By tailoring the mechanism of action and effects of therapy to the specific nature of each patient's insomnia and other conditions, clinicians can offer personalized care in an attempt to achieve an improved risk-benefit ratio compared to that of a "one-size-fits-all" treatment strategy. To move toward this personalization and optimization of treatment, clinicians need awareness of the specific effects of interventions and the subpopulations with insomnia who would benefit from each intervention. This report reviews insomnia treatments, focusing on effects associated with the mechanism of action.

### Pharmacologic treatment of insomnia disorder: An evidence report for a clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians [^112AiBos]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic interventions are often prescribed for insomnia disorder.

- **Purpose**: To assess the benefits, harms, and comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for adults with insomnia disorder.

- **Data sources**: Several electronic databases (2004-September 2015), reference lists, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents.

- **Study selection**: 35 randomized, controlled trials of at least 4 weeks' duration that evaluated pharmacotherapies available in the United States and that reported global or sleep outcomes; 11 long-term observational studies that reported harm information; FDA review data for nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics and orexin receptor antagonists; and product labels for all agents.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction by a single investigator confirmed by a second reviewer; dual-investigator assessment of risk of bias; consensus determination of strength of evidence.

- **Data synthesis**: Eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant improved short-term global and sleep outcomes compared with placebo, although absolute effect sizes were small (low- to moderate-strength evidence). Evidence for benzodiazepine hypnotics, melatonin agonists, antidepressants, and for most pharmacologic interventions in older adults, was insufficient or low strength. Evidence was also insufficient to compare efficacy within or across pharmacotherapy classes or versus behavioral therapy. Harms evidence reported in trials was judged insufficient or low strength; observational studies suggested that use of hypnotics for insomnia was associated with increased risk for dementia.

### Insomnia in the elderly: Cause, approach, and treatment [^111LwR3Q]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a prevalent problem in late life. Sleep problems in the elderly are often mistakenly considered a normal part of aging. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is a subjective report of insufficient or nonrestorative sleep despite adequate opportunity to sleep. Despite the fact that more than 50% of elderly people have insomnia, it is typically undertreated, and nonpharmacologic interventions are underused by healthcare practitioners. This article reviews the causes of insomnia in the elderly, the approach to patient evaluation, and the nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment of insomnia.

### Prevention of incident and recurrent major depression in older adults with insomnia: A randomized clinical trial [^114pVyLM]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Late-life depression, defined as major depressive disorder in adults aged 60 and older, has a 12-month prevalence that exceeds 10% in community-dwelling older adults and is a significant risk factor for cognitive decline, disability, medical comorbidity, and all-cause mortality. Suicide rates are highest among older men. However, older adults with depression often do not receive a diagnosis or treatment, and even with treatment, only approximately one-third achieve remission, leaving an estimated remaining disease burden of 60%. Effective depression prevention is urgently needed, but such efforts have been neglected for this group. This oversight is striking given that older adults account for nearly 20% of the U.S. population, are most vulnerable to depression, and report the lowest use of mental health services.

Insomnia affects nearly 50% of individuals aged 60 years or older and contributes to a twofold greater risk of major depression. Pharmacotherapy is often used to treat insomnia, although medication provides only temporary relief and poses risks for daytime effects and dependency. Among nonpharmacologic treatments, sleep education therapy (SET) is a universal behavioral program that targets behavioral and environmental factors contributing to poor sleep. Another treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), combines cognitive therapy, stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, and relaxation; CBT-I is recommended as the first-line treatment for insomnia disorder.

### Improving sleep quality leads to better mental health: A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111QPFWk]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). High credibility.

- **Eligibility criteria**: To be included in the present review, studies needed to 1) be a randomized controlled trial that tested an intervention designed to improve sleep; 2) produce a statistically significant effect on sleep quality when compared to a control group or an alternative treatment; 3) report a measure of mental health subsequent to the measure of sleep quality; 4) report sufficient data to compute an effect size representing the impact of the intervention on both sleep quality and mental health; 5) be written in English, or translatable using available resources. To reliably and validly assess the independent contribution of changes in sleep on mental health outcomes among adult populations, studies were excluded if 1) the intervention contained elements that specifically target a mental health problem in addition to elements that target sleep; or 2) recruited children and young people (i.e. < 18 years of age).

- **Search strategy**: First, we searched MEDLINE (1946 to present), Embase (1974 to present), PsycINFO (1967 to present), and The Cochrane Library (1898 to present) using the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy (HSSS) to identify RCTs that included terms relating to sleep quality and/or sleep disorders, and mental health. Second, the reference lists of extant reviews of the relationship between sleep and mental health were searched for any potential articles. Third, a search for any unpublished or ongoing studies was conducted.

### Sleep disorders [^1115KGxQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders are frequent and can have serious consequences on patients' health and quality of life. Although some sleep disorders are more challenging to treat, most can be easily managed with adequate interventions. This review discusses the main diagnostic features of six major sleep disorders: insomnia, circadian rhythm disorders, sleep-disordered breathing, hypersomnia/narcolepsy, parasomnias, and restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder. It aims to aid medical practitioners in screening and treating sleep disorders as part of clinical practice.

### Medical cannabis for the treatment of insomnia [^115nqXGH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Addressing insomnia is crucial, as it affects 6% to 10% of the adult population, with a higher prevalence in older adults and those with medical or psychiatric conditions. Insomnia significantly impacts individual health and quality of life and imposes a heavy burden on healthcare systems through increased emergency and office visits, prescription drug costs, and indirect costs like work absenteeism and reduced productivity. Additionally, insomnia is associated with anxiety or depression, as well as lack of impulse control, substance abuse, hypertension, heart failure, and pain, among other conditions.

Conventional treatments for insomnia, while effective, often come with adverse effects such as dependence, tolerance, and cognitive impairment, which limit their long-term use. This has led to a growing interest in alternative treatments, including medical cannabis (MC). Studies show that MC can potentially improve sleep quality, with some reports highlighting its benefits. However, its use remains controversial due to legal and safety concerns, and the lack of robust evidence supporting its efficacy and safety for insomnia.

This question is especially topical given the increasing legalization and prescriptions of MC worldwide. Although not yet included in the American guideline for managing insomnia, and identified as an area lacking sufficient evidence in the European guideline, the use of MC for insomnia has become increasingly intriguing in recent years. This interest has prompted the development of several research trials aimed at exploring its potential.

### Prevention of incident and recurrent major depression in older adults with insomnia: A randomized clinical trial [^111uMEt1]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

- **Question**: Does treatment of insomnia prevent depression in community-dwelling adults 60 years or older without depression but with insomnia?

- **Findings**: In this randomized clinical trial of 291 adults 60 years or older with insomnia disorder, 2 months of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) resulted in a decreased likelihood of incident and recurrent depression during 36 months of follow-up compared with an active comparator control, sleep education therapy. Sustained insomnia remission in adults undergoing CBT-I resulted in a decreased likelihood of depression versus no insomnia remission in adults receiving sleep education therapy.

- **Meaning**: Treatment of insomnia may be beneficial in the prevention of depression in older adults.

### Effects of pharmacotherapy on sleep-related outcomes in adults with chronic low back pain: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111bnWtC]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

When investigating the effects of pharmacotherapy on different sleep characteristics, the findings from our review indicated that pain medications had a small effect only on subjective sleep quality. Thus, improving subjective sleep quality may be particularly crucial to reduce pain intensity and back-related disability in adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP). However, it is important to note that we did not find eligible studies that required participants to have comorbid sleep impairments at baseline or studies that investigated sleep medications. Additional studies are needed to investigate potential modifying effects of comorbidity and intervention focus (pain-based vs. sleep-based).

For clinical implications, our analysis demonstrated that pharmacotherapy used to manage CLBP did not achieve clinically meaningful improvements in sleep in adults with CLBP when compared to control. Additionally, in studies that investigated sleep outcomes, pain medications were associated with increased risk of adverse events and lack of clinically relevant improvements in pain intensity and back-related disability in this population. Considering certain medications such as opioids increase the risk of drug dependency, abuse, and tolerance, adjunct or alternative treatments, including non-pharmacological interventions, to address sleep impairments in this population warrant investigation. For example, non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia are recommended as the first-line treatment option for these forms of impaired sleep. A meta-analysis estimated that cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is effective in this context.

### Diagnosis and management of insomnia in older people [^116beeU3]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a common but underrecognized problem in elderly patients. Five basic steps can help clinicians identify and treat insomnia.

- **First step**: Ask a single question about sleep at every new patient visit. This approach aids in detecting patients with insomnia.
- **Second step**: Perform an initial evaluation of the problem, including symptoms, contributing factors, and effects on daytime function.
- **Third step**: Determine whether the patient is in crisis. True sleep emergencies are rare; in most cases, treatment can be delayed until another appointment can be made for a full evaluation of the problem.
- **Fourth step**: Conduct a sleep evaluation focused mainly on a thorough sleep history; blood tests and polysomnography rarely have a role.
- **Final step**: Implement intervention. Nonpharmacological strategies are a mainstay of treatment for chronic insomnia. Hypnotics can be useful for treating transient insomnia and chronic insomnia that does not improve with nonpharmacological treatment or treatment of associated primary conditions.

Pharmacological therapy usually consists of benzodiazepines with short half-lives or nonbenzodiazepines such as zolpidem and zaleplon. However, the lack of demonstrated efficacy against sleep maintenance difficulties, one of the primary symptoms of insomnia among older people, limits the use of these agents. Emerging nonbenzodiazepine agents such as indiplon and eszopiclone may specifically address sleep maintenance problems in elderly patients and are pending Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.
