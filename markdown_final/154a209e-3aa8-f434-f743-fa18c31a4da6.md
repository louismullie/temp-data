## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about under-eye dark circles, specifically their causes, how to assess them, and what treatments are effective. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and its major etiologic categories. Then, I should verify a practical, stepwise clinical assessment framework. Next, I will classify patient phenotypes to guide therapy. After that, I need to match treatments to causes, including fillers, lasers, topicals, and surgery, and I should double-check safety and complication risks. Finally, I will consider special populations, set expectations, and outline follow-up and counseling points, making sure each claim is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the definition and etiologic buckets. Under-eye dark circles, also called periorbital hyperpigmentation or infraorbital dark circles, are a cosmetic concern with multifactorial causes including pigmentation, vascular translucency, structural shadowing, and skin quality changes; most patients have mixed factors, so I need to ensure I don't anchor on a single cause too early [^fa39a7c3] [^d7baf36e] [^5f3779ac].

> Wait, let me verify the key contributors before moving on. Thin, translucent lower eyelid skin with minimal sebaceous glands allows visibility of underlying muscle and vessels, aging reduces collagen and elastin worsening laxity and shadowing, and hyperpigmentation can be primary or postinflammatory; additionally, structural deficits like a negative orbital vector or tear-trough depression create shadows that mimic dark circles, and prominent infraorbital veins can appear bluish and contribute to the hue, so I should keep all of these in mind during assessment [^ac2e1940] [^b8c5702b] [^a2259273].

> Next, I should review a stepwise assessment framework and make sure I'm not missing anything. I need to check lighting and patient position because shadows can mislead, inspect the lid-cheek junction in frontal, oblique, and lateral views, palpate the orbital rim to assess bone position and simulate midface volumization, and classify the patient into Group 1 (congenital structural deficit) versus Group 2 (age-related changes), while also noting skin quality, pigmentation, and the tightness of the tear trough ligament; this structured approach reduces misclassification and helps avoid unnecessary tear-trough injections [^19f565f7] [^c8c54503] [^e9ec0174] [^806b8d92].

> Hold on, I should verify the classification details so I don't misstate them. Group 1 includes patients with congenital maxillary retrusion or negative orbital vector, often presenting in late teens to early adulthood, with subtypes including medial orbital rim deficit, global maxillary retrusion with pseudo-eye bags, and recessed orbital rim with prominent eyes; Group 2 reflects age-related midface volume loss, skin laxity, and fat redistribution, typically presenting from the late 20s onward, and this distinction guides whether I prioritize bony augmentation versus midface volumization and skin treatments [^a06a4ba4] [^b9994d59] [^e9ec0174].

> I will now examine treatment matching to etiology, but I need to ensure I don't overpromise. For pigment-dominant dark circles, topical depigmenting agents and low-fluence Q-switched 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser can reduce melanin and improve appearance; for vascular or thin-skin translucency, long-pulsed 1064 nm Nd:YAG can target prominent veins; for structural shadowing, hyaluronic acid fillers and autologous fat grafting restore volume and blunt the tear-trough depression; for skin laxity and bags, blepharoplasty or fat repositioning may be indicated; and for mixed etiologies, combination strategies yield the best outcomes, though I should confirm patient goals and downtime tolerance first [^5f3779ac] [^8042cecd] [^8febb469] [^b8c5702b] [^1c6c3705] [^f4d94386].

> But wait, what about fillers in the tear trough — are they safe and effective when done correctly? I should double-check the complication profile and technique. The region is high risk for Tyndall effect, edema, irregularities, and rare but serious vascular events; expert consensus favors deep, preperiosteal placement of low-G′, low-hygroscopic HA in small volumes, with cannula use and a thorough understanding of anatomy to mitigate risk, and patient selection should exclude atrophic skin or excessive fat prolapse that would blunt improvement [^cc5f134f] [^2dd0b8c9] [^ea3411b9].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't overlook nuances. In patients with skin of color, hyperpigmentation is more common and may require gentler lasers and careful topical regimens; in younger patients with congenital structural deficits, bony augmentation or strategic midface volumization may outperform direct tear-trough filling; in men, I should avoid overcorrection that feminizes and instead aim for conservative, natural restoration; and in patients with allergic shiners, treating allergic rhinitis can meaningfully reduce periorbital darkening, so I need to ask about allergies and consider intranasal steroids or immunotherapy when indicated [^d7baf36e] [^a06a4ba4] [^168969f4] [^1c97705c].

> I should confirm expectations and counseling points to reduce dissatisfaction. Many dark circles are multifactorial, so a single-modality treatment may only partially improve appearance; HA fillers improve shadowing and hollowing but do not treat pigmentation; results are technique- and anatomy-dependent; and complications like swelling or Tyndall can occur but are often preventable with proper assessment and injection depth, so pre-treatment simulation with finger maneuvers and honest counseling are essential [^ac2e1940] [^2dd0b8c9] [^cc5f134f].

> Next, I should review follow-up and maintenance. For HA fillers, longevity varies by product and patient, with touch-ups typically at 6–12 months; for fat grafting, survival is variable and some patients require a second session; for pigment, maintenance topicals and sun protection are key; and for lasers, multiple sessions spaced appropriately are often needed, with periodic reassessment of evolving midface volume and skin quality to adjust the plan over time [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify that my synthesis aligns with the evidence hierarchy. The strongest support exists for structural correction with HA fillers and fat grafting in appropriately selected patients, with moderate evidence for lasers in pigment and vascular phenotypes, and lower-level evidence for many topicals; nonetheless, the stepwise assessment framework is consensus-based and widely adopted in contemporary practice, which strengthens its clinical utility even if it is not RCT-derived [^5f3779ac] [^806b8d92] [^19f565f7].

> In summary, I need to ensure my approach remains cause-specific: classify the driver as pigment, vascular, structural, or mixed; assess anatomy and skin quality methodically; match therapy to the dominant etiology while layering treatments when needed; prioritize safety and natural results; and set realistic expectations about improvement rather than cure, adjusting the plan as the face ages or as new factors emerge [^5f3779ac] [^19f565f7] [^2dd0b8c9].

Under-eye dark circles are a common cosmetic concern with **multifactorial causes** including thin skin, hyperpigmentation, vascular pooling, and structural hollowing [^fa39a7c3] [^5f3779ac]. Effective management requires a **cause-specific approach**: topical retinoids, vitamin C, or hydroquinone for pigmentation; hyaluronic acid fillers or autologous fat for volume loss; and long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser for vascular prominence [^5f3779ac] [^8febb469]. Lifestyle measures such as sleep, hydration, and sun protection are essential, and persistent or severe cases warrant dermatologic evaluation to rule out medical contributors [^d7baf36e]. Outcomes vary by cause and modality, so **individualized treatment and realistic expectations** are key [^5f3779ac].

---

## Etiology and contributing factors

Under-eye dark circles arise from **interacting factors**:

- **Thin skin and translucency**: The lower eyelid skin is the thinnest on the body, allowing visibility of underlying vessels and muscle, creating a bluish or purplish hue [^ac2e1940].

- **Hyperpigmentation**: Increased melanin deposition can result from genetics, chronic rubbing, or inflammation (e.g. allergies, eczema) [^d7baf36e].

- **Vascular pooling**: Dilated or prominent periorbital veins cause bluish discoloration, especially in fair skin or with fatigue [^a2259273].

- **Structural hollowing**: Age-related fat loss, maxillary retrusion, or tear-trough deformity create shadows that accentuate dark circles [^b8c5702b].

- **Lifestyle factors**: Sleep deprivation, stress, smoking, and alcohol intake can worsen vascular pooling and skin quality [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evaluation

A structured evaluation distinguishes causes and guides therapy:

| **Assessment step** | **Clinical findings** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Inspection | - Color (brown, blue, purple) <br/> - Shadowing <br/> - Bags or hollows | - Pigmentation <br/> - Vascular <br/> - Structural |
| Palpation | - Thin skin <br/> - Fat herniation <br/> - Bony retrusion | - Translucency <br/> - Fat prolapse <br/> - Maxillary hypoplasia |
| Lighting | - Change with indirect vs direct light | - Shadowing vs true color |
| Classification | - Group 1: congenital structural deficit <br/> - Group 2: age-related changes | Guides filler vs surgical approach [^e9ec0174] |

---

## Treatment options

Treatment should be **tailored to the dominant cause**:

---

### Topical treatments

- **Depigmenting agents**: Hydroquinone, azelaic acid, kojic acid, and vitamin C reduce melanin and improve pigmentation [^notfound].

- **Retinoids**: Tretinoin or retinol thicken skin and reduce fine lines, improving translucency [^notfound].

- **Caffeine-containing creams**: Constrict vessels and reduce puffiness and vascular darkening [^notfound].

---

### Minimally invasive procedures

- **Hyaluronic acid fillers**: Restore volume to tear troughs and lid-cheek junction; use low-G′, low-hygroscopic products and deep preperiosteal placement to minimize Tyndall effect and swelling [^cc5f134f] [^e06b0d63].

- **Autologous fat transfer**: Provides durable volume correction and improves skin quality via stem cell effects; nanofat can enhance superficial texture [^f4d94386] [^1c6c3705].

- **Laser therapy**: Long-pulsed 1,064-nm Nd:YAG targets vascular dark circles; low-fluence Q-switched 1,064-nm laser treats pigmentation [^8febb469] [^8042cecd].

---

### Surgical options

Surgical options include **lower blepharoplasty** for significant fat prolapse, skin laxity, or persistent hollows, and **midface lift** to address deep tear-trough deformity and malar fat descent.

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle measures can meaningfully reduce severity: aim for 7–9 hours nightly, maintain hydration, limit salt to reduce edema, use SPF 30+ daily, and avoid smoking and excess alcohol [^d7baf36e].

---

## Expected outcomes and patient satisfaction

Outcomes vary by cause and modality: **fillers and fat grafting** yield high satisfaction for structural dark circles, whereas **topicals and lasers** offer modest improvement for pigment or vascular causes. Realistic counseling is essential to align expectations with achievable results [^5f3779ac].

---

## Potential risks and complications

- **Topicals**: Irritation, dermatitis, paradoxical darkening in darker skin types [^notfound].

- **Fillers**: Tyndall effect, swelling, irregularities, rare vascular occlusion [^2dd0b8c9].

- **Fat transfer**: Irregularities, resorption, rare infection [^0f201078].

- **Lasers**: Temporary erythema, edema, rare dyspigmentation [^8042cecd].

---

## Special considerations

In patients with **skin of color**, hyperpigmentation is common and requires gentle topicals and cautious laser use; in older adults, combined modalities (fillers plus skin tightening) often yield the best results; and in younger patients with congenital hollows, early volumization can prevent progression [^d7baf36e] [^269c62ab] [^a06a4ba4].

---

Under-eye dark circles reflect multiple, interacting causes; **individualized, cause-specific therapy** — often combining topicals, injectables, and devices — achieves the best outcomes, with lifestyle measures and patient education supporting sustained improvement [^5f3779ac].

### Infraorbital dark circles: definition, causes, and treatment options [^fa39a7c3]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Infraorbital dark circles refer to the conditions that present with darkness of the infraorbital eyelids. Although it is not a medical concern, it can be a cosmetic concern for a large number of individuals. Moreover, clear definition and possible causes have not been elucidated.

Objective

To review the possible causes and treatment options for infraorbital dark circles.

Methods

The article is based on a review of the medical literature and the author's clinical experience in treating infraorbital dark circles.

Conclusion

Possible causative factors of infraorbital dark circles include excessive pigmentation, thin and translucent lower eyelid skin overlying the orbicularis oculi muscle, and shadowing due to skin laxity and tear trough, but because multiple factors cause infraorbital dark circles in the majority of patients, it is essential to identify the cause and choose the appropriate treatment according to the cause.

### Lower eyelid dark circles (tear trough and lid-cheek junction): a stepwise assessment framework [^ac2e1940]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Three key contributors of skin quality to dark eye circles have been identified; lower eyelid skin thickness, the number and/or thickness of under-eye capillaries, and hyperpigmentation. The lower eyelid skin is extremely thin. It is also inelastic due to lower levels of collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans than are observed in other areas of the face, and dry due to the presence of few sebaceous glands. Thinner skin contributes to the appearance of dark circles because it increases the likelihood that underlying pigmentation and dilated vessels are visible. This is further compounded by the aging process, during which loss of elasticity leads to folding and redundancy (dermatochalasis) with associated increases in edema, laxity, and sagging that accentuate the appearance of dark circles, and the appearance of wrinkles that accentuate the extent of fat prolapse and the depth of the visible grooves. Careful lighting and stretching of the skin allow a detailed inspection of the eyelid skin quality and can confirm or rule out pigmentation. Pigmentation does not contribute directly to the depth of the tear trough; rather it creates an illusion of depth. Pigmentation of the lower eyelid skin is relatively common as part of the presentation of dark circles, but will not be improved by HA filler injection. Irrespective of whether a patient falls into functional classification Group 1 or Group 2, if pigmentation is a contributory cause of their dark circles counseling on outcomes is paramount. Patients should be made aware of this and offered additional treatment options when necessary and appropriate.

This work has been underpinned by literature and expert opinion. The literature provides ample guidance on anatomy, injection technique, and management of posttreatment complications. But practical guidance on patient assessment is limited. The practitioner survey highlighted a preference for clinical assessment over formal classification systems, which in turn drove the development of an assessment algorithm. However, this research was undertaken in a selective group that could have introduced opinion bias. Although we do not believe this limitation to have resulted in any significant negative impact, future refinement might come from the application of the algorithm in a more diverse population. Formal further study is not necessary because the algorithm is not intended to provide a formal validated scale. However, it is our hope that in the future it can be incorporated into educational meetings at which attendees can be taught how to use the algorithm and apply it in their day-to-day practice.

### Lower eyelid dark circles (tear trough and lid-cheek junction): a stepwise assessment framework [^ea3411b9]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this article, the phrase "dark eye circles" was intentionally utilized because this is the lay term coined by patients as they seek treatment. Equally, this term helps clarify to practitioners the number of etiological factors that can present as common complaints that are not amenable to HA filler treatment.

HA fillers are an effective solution for the correction of tear-trough deformities. Despite having been available for many years, injecting HA fillers in the tear trough and the lower eyelid is technically challenging and associated with a high incidence of posttreatment complications. Why are we still seeing these problems and what can be done to minimize or avoid them?

The problem is directly related to the complex anatomy of the tear-trough area. The anatomy of the tear trough and lid-cheek junction has been previously reviewed. Due to the tight compartmental nature of this region, there is limited space within which to inject filler. If large volumes are injected, they can saturate the deeper muscle layer and be dispersed into the more mobile orbicularis muscle layer. Common complications, both early and late, associated with lower eyelid HA filler injections such as swelling, puffiness, Tyndall effect, and sausage-shaped lumps almost always appear on the medial lid-cheek junction as the result of too much filler being placed directly in 1 treatment, or repeatedly over time, in the tear trough.

We believe a proper assessment process can guide diagnosis, which in turn underpins appropriate patient selection, choice of management technique, and optimal outcomes. Several classification scales are available to help evaluate tear-trough deformity and guide treatment selection. Our practitioner survey highlighted a limited use of classification systems and an increased reliance on clinical assessment. However, comprehensive guidance on clinical assessment of dark eye circles is limited. Previous work supports a functional anatomical classification of the lid-cheek junction for soft tissue filler treatment. This classification has established a simplified clinical approach enabling categorization of patients presenting with dark eye circles into 2 broad groups — those with tear-trough depression due to underlying congenital bony structural deficits (Group 1) and those with age-related changes (Group 2). Here we provide a practical application of this classification system for a clinical setting. Through stepwise, detailed examination practitioners can assess patients presenting with lower eyelid dark circles and stratify them to guide a more strategic approach to treatment.

### Periorbital hyperpigmentation: review of etiology, medical evaluation, and aesthetic treatment [^d7baf36e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Periorbital hyperpigmentation (POH) is a common worldwide problem. It is challenging to treat, complex in pathogenesis, and lacking straightforward and repeatable therapeutic options. It may occur in the young and old, however the development of dark circles under the eyes in any age is of great aesthetic concern because it may depict the individual as sad, tired, stressed, and old. While "dark circles" are seen in all skin types, POH is often more commonly seen in skin of color patients worldwide. With a shifting US demographic characterized by growing number of aging patients as well as skin of color patients, we will encounter POH with greater frequency. As forecasted by the US Census, by 2030 1 in 5 Americans will be 65 plus years old and greater than 50% of the population will possess ethnic skin of color. The disparity in the medical community's understanding of POH versus popular demand for treatment is best illustrated when you have only 65 cited articles to date indexed on PubMed line compared to the 150,000,000 results on Google search engine. Most importantly POH may be a final common pathway of dermatitis, allergy, systemic disorders, sleep disturbances, or nutritional deficiences that lends itself to medical, surgical, and cosmeceutical treatments. A complete medical history with ROS and physical examination is encouraged prior to treating the aesthetic component. Sun protection is a cornerstone of therapy. Safety issues are of utmost concern when embarking upon treatments such as chemical peeling, filler injection, and laser therapy as not to worsen the pigmentation. Without intervention, POH usually progresses over time so early intervention and management is encouraged. The objective of this study was to review the current body of knowledge on POH, provide the clinician with a guide to the evaluation and treatment of POH, and to present diverse clinical cases of POH that have responded to different therapies including non-ablative fractional photothermolysis in two skin of color patients.

### Treatment of infraorbital dark circles by autologous fat transplantation: a pilot study [^1c6c3705]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Infraorbital dark circles are a cosmetic concern for a large number of individuals. However, the exact definition and precise cause has not been elucidated clearly. In our experience infraorbital dark circles due to thin and translucent lower eyelid skin overlying the orbicularis oculi muscle can be treated successfully with autologous fat transplantation.

Objectives

This study was conducted to clarify the nature of dark circles under the eyes and determine the efficacy of autologous fat transplantation.

Patients and Methods

Ten patients with dark circles due to increased vascularity and translucency of the skin were included. They received at least one autologous fat transplantation and follow-up evaluations were conducted at least 3 months after the last treatment.

Results

An average of 1.6 autologous fat transplantations were done in both infraorbital areas. Patients showed an average of 78% improvement (average grading scale: 2.6 out of 4). Most of the patients showed improvement in the infraorbital darkening and contour of the lower eyelids.

Conclusions

Autologous fat transplantation is an effective method for the treatment of infraorbital dark circles due to thin and translucent lower eyelid skin overlying the orbicularis oculi muscle.

### Evaluation of the safety and tolerability of lumify eye illuminations cosmetic products [^e71c1ed4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines cosmetics as

articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body. for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance.

Of the more than 12,500 chemicals used in cosmetics, fewer than 20% have been evaluated by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review, an independent organization formed with the cooperation of the FDA. Despite the wide variety of cosmetic products available, an online survey of 169 cosmetics users found that only 30% of respondents considered the ingredients when deciding which cosmetic products to purchase.

Many women use cosmetics in the periocular region (eg, eyelids, eyelashes, outer-eye and under-eye skin), and topical cosmetic products are often the first-line approach for minimizing the signs of aging and addressing common concerns (eg, crow's feet, dark circles, dry skin). The skin of the eyelids and around the eyes is especially thin and delicate, which increases vulnerability to aging-related changes. The potential effects of chemicals and other ingredients in skin and eye care products applied to the periocular region also must be considered.

### Lower eyelid dark circles (tear trough and lid-cheek junction): a stepwise assessment framework [^19f565f7]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Step 1: Inspect the Lid-Cheek Junction

In patients who present seeking correction of dark circles, physical examination of the lower lid-cheek junction should be conducted with the patient sitting upright directly in front of the examiner at eye level (Figure 2).

Figure 2.
Inspection of the lid-cheek junction. Patient images reproduced from Liew and DeSilva (with permission from Georg Thieme Verlag KG).

After an initial general inspection of the overall facial aesthetics, a more detailed inspection of the shadowing at the lid-cheek junction should be undertaken in a well-lit room in multiple views (frontal, oblique, and lateral). The lid-cheek junction can be divided into 3 segments (Supplemental Figure 2, available at). If present, the location of the dark circles should be recorded (Table 1).

Table 1.
Functional Classification of Lid-Cheek Junction

Further inspection should then be undertaken to determine if the dark circles are due to skin pigmentation, structural deficits, the presence of eye bags, or a combination of these. Lighting and patient position can highlight specific features, and both play a key role in determining the cause of dark circles (Table 2).

### FDA approves enfortumab vedotin-ejfv with… [^e7fc9368]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

On December 15, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved enfortumab vedotin-ejfv in combination with pembrolizumab for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. FDA previously granted accelerated approval to this combination for patients with la/mUC who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. Full prescribing information for Padcev and Keytruda will be posted here. Efficacy was evaluated in EV-302/KN-A39, an open-label, randomized trial of 886 patients with la/mUC and no prior systemic therapy for advanced disease. Patients were randomized 1: 1 to receive either enfortumab vedotin-ejfv with pembrolizumab or platinum-based chemotherapy. Randomization was stratified by cisplatin eligibility, PD-L1 expression, and presence of liver metastases.

The major efficacy outcome measures were overall survival and progression-free survival as assessed by blinded independent central review. Statistically significant improvements in both OS and PFS were demonstrated for enfortumab vedotin-ejfv with pembrolizumab compared with platinum-based chemotherapy. The most common adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, in patients receiving enfortumab vedotin-ejfv with pembrolizumab were increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased creatinine, rash, increased glucose, peripheral neuropathy, increased lipase, decreased lymphocytes, increased alanine. aminotransferase, decreased hemoglobin, fatigue, decreased sodium, decreased phosphate, decreased albumin, pruritus, diarrhea, alopecia, decreased weight, decreased appetite, increased urate, decreased neutrophils, decreased potassium, dry eye, nausea, constipation, increased potassium, dysgeusia, urinary tract infection, and decreased platelets.

Healthcare professionals should report all serious adverse events suspected to be associated with the use of any medicine and device to FDA's MedWatch Reporting System or by calling 1-800-FDA-1088.

### Lower eyelid dark circles (tear trough and lid-cheek junction): a stepwise assessment framework [^2dd0b8c9]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

A youthful periocular region is characterized by fullness of the periorbital area, minimal or no skin excess, minimal pigmentation or skin wrinkles, and appropriate brow height and shape. By contrast, lower eyelid dark shadows are characterized by soft tissue loss and bony resorption, which create a sunken appearance and cast dark shadows despite adequate rest. The presence of dark shadows negatively influences perceptions of youthfulness, attractiveness, and emotion, often resulting in the utilization of descriptors such as tiredness, unhappiness, or sadness.

The lower periorbital region is one of the most common areas for which patients seek minimally invasive facial aesthetic treatment, citing under-eye bags and dark circles as their primary concerns. The use of hyaluronic acid (HA) gel filler for the correction of dark under-eye shadows, with its quick results and minimal recovery time, has become a popular rejuvenation treatment and is associated with high levels of posttreatment patient satisfaction. Yet the lower periorbital is a challenging area to inject. Complications observed with dermal fillers to treat this area include mild, self-limiting adverse effects (puffiness, swelling, bruising), persistent irregularities (irregular surface contours, edema, and a bluish hue or Tyndall effect), and severe (irreversible vision loss) or long-term complications (granulomas). These unacceptable aesthetic outcomes can result from overcorrection, too superficial injections, and inappropriate choice of filler. Good knowledge of periorbital anatomy, product selection, and appropriate injection technique are therefore vital for optimal treatment outcomes. In recognition of this, the recent literature provides details of therapeutic approaches and comprehensive reviews of periorbital anatomy, as well as guidance for the recognition, prevention, and management of filler-associated complications that are most commonly encountered when treating this region. However, specific guidance on assessment is limited. This paper draws on recent concepts and current clinical practices to help guide the practitioner through an assessment framework for lower eyelid dark shadows that can be undertaken before establishing a treatment plan with the patient. The aim is to provide an assessment that will better enable the practitioner to classify the patient based on their underlying problems and facilitate a more strategic approach to treatment.

### Treatments of periorbital hyperpigmentation: a systematic review [^5f3779ac]. Dermatologic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Periorbital hyperpigmentation (POH) is an aesthetic concern for patients. Etiologies of the condition include pigmentary, structural, vascular, and mixed causes.

Objective

To systematically review the current literature for treatment of POH.

Methods

A systematic literature review was performed on PubMed. Search terms included "infraorbital dark circles", "dark circles", "periorbital hyperpigmentation", "idiopathic hyperchromia AND orbital", "under-eye circles", "ICHOR (idiopathic cutaneous hyperchromia of the orbital region)", "dark circles" AND "treatment", and "filler" AND "dark circles".

Results

A total of 39 studies were included. Effective treatments for POH include lasers, topical creams and serums, fillers, chemical peels, carboxytherapy, plasma-rich platelet injections, blepharoplasty, and normobaric oxygen.

Conclusion

Soft tissue fillers and autologous fat grafting are most effective in treating dark circles due to volume loss. Blepharoplasty surgery is best when excessive skin laxity is the underlying cause. Various topical creams and chemical peels are useful in treating pigment-based POH, whereas lasers are mildly to moderately beneficial for both vascular and pigment types. Given the scarcity of high-quality evidence supporting these results, recommendations should be interpreted selectively. Additional randomized clinical trials studying POH will be helpful.

### Lower eyelid dark circles (tear trough and lid-cheek junction): a stepwise assessment framework [^1e653c68]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The utilization of HA fillers for dark eye circles is popular but challenging and associated with a high rate of complications. We present a comprehensive assessment framework that combines inspection, assessment, and palpation. The overall aim is to encourage practitioners to pause and think before they treat, rather than simply treating the problem location. Careful step-by-step assessment, conducted with judicious lighting, can help to identify patients in whom dark eye circles may be improved without the need to directly inject HA filler into the tear trough. Correct patient classification can facilitate individualized treatment planning and optimize treatment outcomes while avoiding the known challenges associated with treating this area.

### Anatomy and nonsurgical correction of the tear trough deformity [^b8c5702b]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Summary

The development of dark circles under the eyes is one of the early signs of periorbital aging, lending a fatigued and aged appearance to the face. Loeb, in 1961, used the term "nasojugal groove" to describe the concavity at the border of the eyelid and the cheek medially. Flowers, in 1969, first named this groove the "tear trough". In the present article, the author presents a detailed description of the anatomy and nonsurgical correction of this deformity. Nonsurgical correction of the tear trough deformity with hyaluronic acid is effective and safe and is associated with high patient satisfaction. The procedure offers both an adjunct to surgery and an alternative to it in some patients. It also provides an opportunity for global midfacial volume correction. Careful patient selection and attention to technique will minimize side effects.

### Lower eyelid dark circles (tear trough and lid-cheek junction): a stepwise assessment framework [^b9994d59]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Group 2: Age-related Changes

This group of patients tends to present from the late 20s to the early 30s onward, complaining of looking tired and of lower eyelid dark circles. Group 2 constitutes the main bulk of patients seeking treatment for dark circles. This group also encompasses the original Group 1 cohort whose structural deficits are now compounded by the aging process and its sequelae. In this case, the lower eyelid appearance is associated with various degrees of midfacial aging. Within this group there are 2 broad categories:

2a: There is typically recession and hollowing along the lid-cheek junction, and the hollowed appearance may extend across the entire lid-cheek junction (Supplemental Figure 5).
2b: These patients present with predominantly lower eye bag formation associated with a varying degree of lid-cheek junction hollowing (Supplemental Figure S5, available at).

### Lower eyelid dark circles (tear trough and lid-cheek junction): a stepwise assessment framework [^a06a4ba4]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Group 1: Congenital Structural Deficit of the Underlying Maxilla

This group of patients tends to present complaining of dark circles early in adulthood or in the late teens. Within this group there are 3 subvariants:

1a: The structural deficit is confined to the medial orbital rim of the maxilla. Patients tend to present in their early adulthood with deep tear-trough depression associated with a minimal degree of extension laterally and minimal to no volume loss of the midface (Supplemental Figure 3, available at).
1b: The entire maxilla is retruded and there is a negative orbital vector (Figure 5A). This group of patients tends to present early complaining of dark circles or eye bags. Anatomically, the retrusion of the maxilla creates a "short orbital floor" for the size of the globe and the orbital content. This leads to a spillage of the orbital fat beyond the lower orbital rim rather than excessive fat pad, causing "pseudo eye bags" at an earlier age (Figure 5B). The same anatomical retrusion of the maxilla also creates a recessed alar base with deep nasolabial retrusion at an early age. Group 1b is common among patients of Northeast and Southeast Asian ethnicity.
1c: The structural deficit is confined mainly to the entire maxillary orbital rim. Palpation of the lower orbital rim displays a recessive orbital rim posteriorly beyond that of the body of the maxilla. The lower eyelid in this group tends to be short and recline further posteriorly as it approaches the lid-cheek junction. This eyelid configuration creates a distinct eye appearance of large prominent eyes with excessive scleral show (Supplemental Figure 4, available at). Group 1c is common among patients of Southern Asian, Middle Eastern, Turkish, and Iranian descents.

### Allergic rhinitis: rapid evidence review [^1c97705c]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis, the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States, is an immunoglobulin E-mediated process. A family history of allergic rhinitis, asthma, or atopic dermatitis increases a patient's risk of being diagnosed with allergic rhinitis. People in the United States are commonly sensitized to grass, dust mites, and ragweed allergens. Dust mite-proof mattress covers do not prevent allergic rhinitis in children two years and younger. Diagnosis is clinical and based on history, physical examination, and at least one symptom of nasal congestion, runny or itchy nose, or sneezing. History should include whether the symptoms are seasonal or perennial, symptom triggers, and severity. Common examination findings are clear rhinorrhea, pale nasal mucosa, swollen nasal turbinates, watery eye discharge, conjunctival swelling, and allergic shiners (i.e., dark circles under the eyes). Serum or skin testing for specific allergens should be performed when there is inadequate response to empiric treatment, if diagnosis is uncertain, or to guide initiation or titration of therapy. Intranasal corticosteroids are first-line treatment for allergic rhinitis. Second-line therapies include antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists and neither shows superiority. If allergy testing is performed, trigger-directed immunotherapy can be effectively delivered subcutaneously or sublingually. High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are not effective at decreasing allergy symptoms. Approximately 1 in 10 patients with allergic rhinitis will develop asthma.

### Lower eyelid dark circles (tear trough and lid-cheek junction): a stepwise assessment framework [^806b8d92]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Despite increasing popularity, the use of hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers for the correction of dark under-eye shadows remains challenging. Specific guidance on patient assessment is limited.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to develop a stepwise assessment framework for lower eyelid dark shadows to help practitioners classify patients based on their underlying problems and facilitate a more strategic approach to treatment.

Methods

Literature review and peer collaboration informed the current availability of educational material for use by experienced injectors when assessing patients presenting with dark circles. A practitioner survey provided insight into current practices. A focus group convened to review the survey results and discuss best practice approaches to patient assessment.

Results

Surveyed practitioners (n = 39) reported patient concern about under-eye hollows (91%), dark eye circles (80%), and looking tired (60%). All (100%) agreed that midcheek volume was critical when treating tear-trough depression, and only 26% reported use of a tear-trough classification system. The focus group developed a framework for assessing tear-trough depression and the lid-cheek junction in patients presenting with dark circles. Key factors within this framework included the importance of appropriate lighting when conducting a visual inspection, regional inspection of the cheek and tear trough, palpation of the orbital rim and soft tissues, determination of the orbital vector, and assessment of lower eyelid pigmentation and skin quality.

Conclusions

Careful step-by-step assessment can reduce the challenges of treating dark circles by identifying patients in whom dark eye circles may be improved without the need to directly inject filler into the tear trough.

RESULTS

Practitioner Survey Responses

The response rate to the practitioner survey was 98% (39/40 surveys returned). Respondents were from 18 countries (predominantly Australia 46%; Supplemental Table 1, available at). The majority were cosmetic physicians (61%), 21% were dermatologists and 18% were surgeons; almost all respondents (95%) had been practicing aesthetic medicine for more than 10 years. Respondents recognized "ZOOM dysmorphia", with majority agreement that virtual communications platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic had been associated with an increase in patient concerns about under-eye hollows (91%), dark eye circles (80%), and looking tired (60%). An absence of eye bags and a high, smooth lid-cheek junction were regarded as the most important contributors to the youthful eye, followed by brow position, hollowing, and infraorbital skin quality (Supplemental Figure 1, available at). Taking these factors into consideration, survey respondents unanimously agreed that midcheek volume was critical when treating tear-trough depression. Only 26% of respondents reported employing a specific classification system for assessing tear-trough depression, with the majority relying on clinical assessment and serial photography instead. When scales were utilized, the most frequently cited was Hirmand's classification, followed by the Barton tear-trough grading system.

Best Practice Approach to Patient Assessment

A variety of factors can contribute to the appearance of lower eyelid dark shadows — bone structure, midface soft tissues (fat, muscles, ligaments), and skin quality. Determining which factors are most prevalent provides information to guide treatment approaches and counsel patients about expectations, both of which contribute to the development of an appropriate treatment plan. Figure 1 displays a proposed stepwise approach to assessment.

Practical Tips for Treatment Planning

A detailed description of treatment for each of the above groups is beyond the scope of this article. In essence a more precise understanding of the appearance of the lid-cheek junction pathology, as described through the steps in our assessment framework, enables the clinician to optimize the most logical ways of treating each patient type (Figure 6). For example:

Group 1a: Requires precise placement of the minimum amount of the least hygroscopic filler deep on the medial orbital rim, with the aid of stretching of those with a tight TTL to ensure adequate correction with the least amount of product and minimize potential swelling posttreatment.
Group 1b: Requires treatment to deal with the structural retrusion of the maxilla by placement of an appropriate volumizing filler in the medial SOOF, DMCF, and/or deep piriform fat pad. By assessing the patient (Figure 7A) and determining the underlying cause of the dark circles (Figure 7B), dark circle correction can be accomplished without the need to directly inject the tear trough (Figure 7C).
Group 1c: Requires filler placed just below the orbicularis retaining ligament within the upper portion of the medial SOOF and a minute amount of filler placed judiciously on the bony level at the tear-trough depression, where it can be applied as a filler strut to augment the retruded orbital rim and correct the hollowness.
Group 2a: Requires replenishment of volume loss of the medial SOOF and DMCF to see the extent of improvement of the lid-cheek junction (Figure 8). Once that is achieved, consultation with the patient should be undertaken to decide if any of the residual deficit in the tear-trough depression needs to be dealt with. If this is determined necessary, then additional smaller volumes of filler can be injected directly into the medial and lateral lid-cheek junction.
Group 2b: Patients in this subgroup are candidates for surgery, and therefore treatment is beyond the scope of this article.

### Nonsurgical treatments for infraorbital rejuvenation: a review [^269c62ab]. Dermatologic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Tear trough and infraorbital region changes are one of the first signs recognizable aging. This is a common consultation for cosmetic dermatologists and there are many treatment options available.

Objective

This article provides a review of the anatomy and changes that occur in the infraorbital region as we age. We also suggest the use of the osseous, color, underlying anatomy, laxity, adipose, rhytides (OCULAR) mnemonic to evaluate these changes and review the literature for treatments options.

Materials and Methods

A literature search was performed through PubMed, using search terms "Tear trough", "Infra-orbital", "Dark-circles", "Lower-Eyelid", and "Midface".

Results

Fillers, lasers, radiofrequency devices, chemical peels, various topicals, and botulinum toxin are available non-surgical treatment options discussed in the literature found to significantly improve and rejuvenate the infraorbital region.

Conclusion

A complete understanding of the anatomy and changes that occur with aging are of most importance when assessing the infraorbital region. Organizing these changes into the OCULAR mnemonic is one way to assess the infraorbital region and achieve optimal rejuvenation.

Utility of understanding the genetic architecture of iris colour

The application of these genetic data is particularly useful in forensic and anthropological work, where the eye colour of individuals can be predicted based on DNA evidence. Researchers have inferred that early Neolithic Britons had brown eyes, and that the famous Cheddar Man probably had blue/green eyes, with dark brown (possibly black) hair and dark or dark to black skin. Eye colour is also a risk factor for eye disease; however, researchers can make interesting associations that are more linked to behaviours than genetics such as the gene for blue eyes is common in people who are bad at using chopsticks.

Step 4: Patient Classification

Based on the assessment process above, patients with dark circles associated with some degree of depression or hollowing of the lid-cheek junction can be classified into 2 broad groups (Table 4). Group 1 comprises patients with dark circle depression that is due to an anatomical structural deficit from the underlying bone. Because this is not associated with aging, these cases tend to be younger patients in their early adulthood. They are not associated with midfacial volume loss. The other, larger group includes those with lid-cheek junction pathology secondary to the aging process, with age-associated maxillary retrusion, deep fat pad volume loss, and the associated degeneration changes of the overlying skin, muscle, and orbital retaining ligament and orbital septum.

### Correction of infraorbital dark circles using autologous adipose-derived collagen filler: a novel regenerative option [^fbf440cc]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors, notably the aging process, contribute to the development of infraorbital dark circles. These features, commonly associated with old age and fatigue, are caused by a disruption of dermal melanin and impairment of skin barrier function. Common aesthetic concerns affecting patients with infraorbital dark circles are primarily owing to lean and translucent lower eyelid skin overlying the orbicularis oculi muscle. This study aimed to present a novel technique for correcting infraorbital dark circles utilizing an adipose-derived extracellular matrix concentrate-adipose collagen fragment (ACF)-to correct infraorbital dark circles.

Methods

Female patients (n = 94) aged 20–38 who presented infraorbital dark circles were enrolled to assess the efficacy of this technique for an eight-month follow-up. Following intradermal injections with ACF filler, the clinical outcome was determined by responses to GAIS and patient satisfaction surveys. Statistical analysis was performed with the one-way ANOVA test, and a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Patients (n = 92) completed a single treatment session and underwent an eight-month follow-up. Eighty patients (86%) reported being "highly satisfied" or "satisfied" with the outcome and responded that the technique resulted in brighter, tighter, and smoother infraorbital skin. Over 97% of patients were rated as "improved", "much improved" and "Very much improved" throughout the follow-up on GAIS by three independent surgeons (p < 0.05). The statistical analyses demonstrated the percentage differences among groups are highly significant (p < 0.0001). No irregularity or lump was observed during the follow-up. Two patients were excluded from the study due to having undergone cosmetic eyelid surgery.

Conclusion

Intradermal ACF filler represents a novel approach to addressing infraorbital dark circles and yields significantly high patient satisfaction. ACF fillers provide a degree of bio-stimulation, and adipose-derived concentrate is a natural filler with regenerative effects used in periorbital rejuvenation.

### Cosmetic concerns among men [^168969f4]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Men are interested in reducing signs of aging, while maintaining a masculine appearance. A chief concern among men is maintenance of scalp hair. Men are also concerned with reducing under eye bags and dark circles. The concern of feminization is of significant importance. Neuromodulators remain the most common cosmetic procedure performed in men. Men often prefer a reduction in facial rhytids, as opposed to elimination of the lines. Softening facial lines in men is meant to maintain an appearance of wisdom, without appearing fragile. Men also wish to maintain a taut jawline and a slim waist and reduce breast tissue.

### Lower eyelid dark circles (tear trough and lid-cheek junction): a stepwise assessment framework [^c8c54503]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Step 3: Palpate the Orbital Rim and Lid-Cheek Junction

Palpation of the orbital rim is conducted to determine if there is any underlying structural deficit, if so whether it is limited to the orbital rim, part of it or involving the whole orbital rim, and if it involves the maxilla, which is prevalent among East Asian patients. The orbital vector is determined with the patient in a profile position (Figure 4). It refers to the relative position of the globe to that of the supporting bony orbital floor, which is formed mainly by the maxillary bone. Patients with negative orbital vectors tend to present early with dark circles due to orbital fat prominence. With the patient gazing forward, place a finger on the anterior surface of the orbital rim and determine the relative position of the apex of the cornea to the orbital rim by dropping an imaginary line from apex of the cornea to the orbital rim. The vector is described as positive when the orbital rim is in front of the corneal apex, negative when the orbital rim is behind the cornea and neutral when it is in a vertical plane. Kato et al provide schematic images showing the relationship between the facial vector and eye bags.

Figure 4.

DMCF, deep medial cheek fat; SOOF, suborbicularis oculi fat; TTL, tear trough ligament.

If tear-trough depression is present, gentle pulling of the skin from the underlying bone with finger and thumb will give an indication of the tightness of the tear trough ligament (TTL). A tight TTL is indicative of a difficult case for optimal correction. In this case, the patient needs to be counseled about realistic expectations from filler treatment.

In patients with volume loss to the midface, finger maneuvers can simulate the effect of volumizing of the medial SOOF and DMCF on the lid-cheek junction. To help determine the extent to which midfacial volume loss is contributing to the dark circles, gently push the midfacial tissue just caudal to the medial SOOF in a cephalad direction toward the lid-cheek junction. This will simulate the effect of medial SOOF volumization and visually highlight the improvement of the lid-cheek junction.

### Treatment of venous infraorbital dark circles using a long-pulsed 1, 064-nm neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser [^8febb469]. Dermatologic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Infraorbital dark circles are a common cosmetic problem with multiple causative factors and few studies into the different treatment options.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness and safety of long-pulsed 1,064-nm neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser therapy for infraorbital dark circles caused by visible prominent veins.

Participants and Methods

Twenty-six patients with venous infraorbital dark circles were treated with a Nd:YAG laser (fluence, 130–140 J/cm(2); spot size, 6 mm) in double-pulse mode (pulse width, 6–10 ms; interpulse interval, 20 ms). Patients were examined 12 months after the final treatment. Results were ranked in five categories based on percentage clearance (5 = 100%, 4 = 75–99%, 3 = 50–74%, 2 = 25–49%, 1 ≤ 25% clearance). Patient satisfaction was ranked on a scale of 1 to 3 (1 = minimal improvement; 3 = completely satisfied), and pain was ranked on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 = mild pain; 10 = severe pain).

Results

Twenty-six patients completed the study. Objective improvement scores were 5 in all patients, and all patient satisfaction scores were 3. All patients tolerated the moderate pain (mean score 3.6). Transient erythema was observed in all patients.

Conclusion

Long-pulsed 1,064-nm Nd:YAG-laser treatment appears effective and safe for the treatment of venous infraorbital dark circles and selectively removes visible prominent veins.

### Correction of infraorbital dark circles using collagenase-digested fat cell grafts [^0f201078]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A number of factors, including visibility of the orbicularis oculi muscle through thin skin, can cause dark circles around the eyes. Fat grafts have been used to augment the lower eyelid skin to correct dark circles, but irregularities caused by leaving visible lumps of the fat can occur. We used collagenase-digested fat cell grafts to correct these deformities.

Methods and Materials

Fat was aspirated from the medial thigh using the Coleman method. After centrifugation, the middle fat layer was segregated, digested using Clostridium histolyticum-derived type II collagenase, and mixed with Hartman's solution. The grafts were injected into the infradermal layer using blunt 22-G needles.

Results

Eighty-two patients were evaluated for improvement using photographic evidence; 55 (67.1%) showed improvement, 23 (28%) showed no difference, and four (4.9%) had worsened from preoperative findings. There were no visible lumps of fat, contour irregularities, or fat necroses. Postoperative edema and ecchymosis were minimal.

Conclusion

Collagenase-digested fat cell grafts provide another option for correcting dark circles by augmenting thin skin. Further histologic evaluation of the grafted collagenase-digested fat cells is recommended.

### Ants integrate proprioception as well as visual context and efference copies to make robust predictions [^276b34a9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In insects, the Lateral Accessory Lobes (LAL) are pre-motor areas responsible for the generation and control of oscillations or other steering mechanisms such as phototaxis. Some studies have highlighted the importance of optic flow in regulating the oscillations. Here we demonstrated that, at least in ants, what modulates the LAL is not directly the optic flow detected, but the prediction errors resulting from the difference between what was expected and what was perceived. Interestingly, regular oscillations persisted across all our manipulations but were expressed with various amplitudes and frequencies, showing that prediction error signals are sent to the LAL and modulate the intrinsic oscillators rather than bypass it. This corroborates the idea that such intrinsic oscillations are an ancestral feature in insects that has been outsourced for various tasks through the control of various sensory modalities –. In addition, there seems to be a summation of the prediction errors from both eyes. Cataglyphis ants' brains actually have a neural track, called the Inferior Optic Commissure (IOC) crossing the hemispheres to connect both left and right optic lobes. The IOC also projects to the ventrolateral neuropils, which are known to possess wide-field optic flow detector cells in flies. This may indicate that the prediction errors are computed in each eye and then summed upstream from the LAL.

Our results highlight common points but also differences with the way flies deal with optic flow. Like for our ants, electrophysiological recording in fruit flies showed that the strength of the efference copy depended on the structure of their visual surrounding: the magnitude of the efference copy sent for the same movement was weaker when exposed to a homogeneous gray screen compared to a moving grating. However, when the grating was moving it hyperpolarized or depolarized the cells, which may impact the net effect of the efference copy. This suggests that modulation of the predicted optic flow produced by the visual structure is ancestral to both ants and flies. However, contrary to ants in the dark, the expression of the efference copy signals in flying flies is not silenced when blinded through artificially prolonged depolarizing afterpotential (PDA) causing R1–6 opsin to photoconvert to a persistently active state, even if it remains doubtful that flies would get blocked turning into circles when in the dark (see for examplefor flies walking in the dark andfor flies flying in the dark).

### Efficacy of platelet-rich plasma versus autologous fat transfer with nanofat in the treatment of infraorbital dark circles: a single-blinded randomized comparative clinical trial [^f4d94386]. Dermatologic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Treating infraorbital dark circles is one of the commonest aesthetic demands worldwide. Autologous fat transfer is commonly used to treat dark circles by filling the grooves, without effect on skin quality. Platelet-rich plasma has been reported to improve skin quality. Autologous fat can be emulsified and filtered to produce nanofat, which is then injected superficially in the dark circles to improve skin quality and discoloration.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma versus combined fat transfer and nanofat in treating infraorbital dark circles.

Materials and Methods

30 patients with infraorbital dark circles of combined etiological factors were randomized into 2 equal groups: Group A treated with platelet-rich plasma and Group B treated with autologous fat transfer with emulsified fat injection.

Results

Excellent and moderate responses were observed in 3 (20%) and 2 (13%) patients in group A versus 7 (46.7%) and 4 (27%) in group B, respectively. Nonresponders were 8 (53.3%) in group A and only 1 patient (6.7%) in group B. The difference was statistically significant regarding improvement (p = .048) and patient satisfaction (p = .032).

Conclusion

Autologous fat transfer with nanofat is significantly superior to platelet-rich plasma in improvement and satisfaction.

### Intraocular (uveal) melanoma treatment-NCI… [^2073bd40]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Intraocular Melanoma Treatment –Patient Version General Information About Intraocular MelanomaGo to Health Professional Version Key Points
- Intraocular melanoma is a disease in which malignant cells form in the tissues of the eye.
- Being older and having fair skin may increase the risk of intraocular melanoma.
- Signs and symptoms of intraocular melanoma may include blurred vision or a dark spot on the iris.
- Tests that examine the eye are used to diagnose intraocular melanoma.
- A biopsy of the tumor is rarely needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma.
- Certain factors affect prognosis and treatment options. Intraocular melanoma is a disease in which malignant cells form in the tissues of the eye. Intraocular melanoma begins in the middle of three layers of the wall of the eye. The outer layer includes the white sclera and the clear cornea at the front of the eye.

The inner layer has a lining of nerve tissue, called the retina, which senses light and sends images along the optic nerve to the brain. The middle layer, where intraocular melanoma forms, is called the uvea or uveal tract, and has three main parts: Iris The iris is the colored area at the front of the eye. It can be seen through the clear cornea. The pupil is in the center of the iris, and it changes size to let more or less light into the eye. Intraocular melanoma of the iris is usually a small tumor that grows slowly and rarely spreads to other parts of the body. Ciliary body The ciliary body is a ring of tissue with muscle fibers that change the shape of the lens. It is found behind the iris. Changes in the shape of the lens help the eye focus. The ciliary body also makes the clear fluid that fills the space between the cornea and the iris.

Intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris.
- **Exenteration**: Surgery to remove the eye and eyelid, and muscles, nerves, and fat in the eye socket. After surgery, the patient may be fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye or a facial prosthesis.

### Facial aesthetic priorities and concerns: a physician and patient perception global survey [^ff731cec]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 6.
Facial features indicated as being very or extremely concerning. Proportion of aesthetically conscious survey respondents reporting very high or extreme levels of concern with aesthetic aspects of their face. Composite scores to describe features of high/extreme concern for survey respondents were generated by adding the percentages of respondents rating "extremely concerned" and "very concerned" for each feature. Physician respondents were asked to rank the top 5 concerns and related treatments requested by patients. Composite scores were generated for each feature by adding the percentage of physicians ranking the concern as the top or second-most common concern for which patients request treatment.

Looking at facial features for which aesthetically conscious respondents expressed high or extreme levels of concern, Millennials (aged 21–35 years) reported higher levels of concern (ie, ratings of very concerned or extremely concerned) than Generation X (aged 36–55 years) and Baby Boomers (aged 56 years or older) for most facial aesthetic concerns (Figure 7). Although all age groups indicated high/extreme levels of concern over CFL and under-eye bags or dark circles, facial skin issues were more frequently indicated as being very or extremely concerning by Millennials (approximately 39%) than Generation X (approximately 31%) or Baby Boomers (approximately 16%). Additionally, fewer Generation X survey respondents (8%) rated eyelid folds/creases as a feature they had high/extreme levels of concern with compared with > 20% of both Millennial and Baby Boomer respondents (Figure 7A). The feature most frequently indicated as being very or extremely concerning for female respondents was under-eye bags or dark circles (38%). In contrast, male respondents most frequently indicated high or extreme levels of concern with hair-related issues (35%; Figure 7B).

### Eye-opening effect achieved by modified transconjunctival lower blepharoplasty [^5f429b3b]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Signs of aging around the eye initially appear in the periorbital regions due to the intricate anatomical structures there. For instance, the upper eyelid blinks almost 20,000 times a day, and these repeated mechanical actions wear skin from the upper eyelids with age because the thin periorbital skin is easily attenuated, leading to the manifestation of droopy upper eyelids or wrinkles as evidence of premature aging. Symptoms also appear on the lower eyelids and typically manifest as baggy eyelids (anterior herniation of the lower orbital fat compartment [LOFC]), tear trough deformities, nasojugal grooves, and dark circles. Tear trough deformity is a hollowed and sunken area between the lower lid and cheekbone that originates in the inner canthus and extends to the midpupillary line. Depression lateral to tear trough deformity is also referred to as the nasojugal groove. Dark circles are unique to the lower lid and show inverted semilunar-shaped dark shadows that delineate the lower orbit. This is further highlighted by the combination of skin pigmentations. Dark circles are occasionally exaggerated by other lower lid symptoms, such as eyebags and tear trough deformities. Through meticulous studies of the periorbital region, the anatomical structures and functions of the eyelid have been thoroughly investigated and documented. Treating aging signs in lower lids has traditionally been performed by cutting-edge surgeries, making oculoplastic surgery one of the most common procedures performed by facial aesthetic surgeries. Transconjunctival lower blepharoplasty (TCLB) is becoming a high-profile surgery due to its minimal invasiveness. In particular, scar-free surgery is favored in Asian populations, because this skin type is more susceptible to postoperative scarring.

### Treatment of periorbital veins with long-pulse Nd: YAG laser [^a2259273]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Periorbital veins (POVs) are a common cosmetic concern. Anatomically, POVs are formed by superficial facial veins that start from the bridge of the nose, travel as supraorbital and infraorbital veins, and join venous branches from the lateral forehead and scalp. In patients with fair skin, or in patients whose facial skin is atrophied, POVs can become prominent. This can lead to a fatigued appearance, with perceived "dark circles" around the patients' eyes. Previously described surgical therapies for prominent POVs are invasive and can leave unsightly scars, and sclerotherapy has been reported to lead to embolization that could lead to blindness. Here, we give examples of the use of 1,064 nm neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser to non-invasively treat or at least minimize prominent POVs. We discuss various techniques, and review treatment schedules to achieve the optimal cosmetic outcome. Furthermore, potential pitfalls, such as local site reaction and laser-specific tissue damage, are explored. Overall, Nd:YAG laser does appear to be a safe and effective treatment for POVs that requires minimal post-treatment care.

### Effectiveness of volbella (VYC-15L) for infraorbital hollowing: patient-reported outcomes from a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized, controlled study [^c366e2e7]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The aging midface manifests several distinct yet related findings that are commonly described as infraorbital hollowing. These include, but are not limited to, the tear trough, which comprises the medial aspect of the infraorbital rim to the midpupillary line, and the palpebromalar groove (or lid-cheek junction), which comprises the lateral aspect of in the infraorbital rim (Figure 1). These anatomic landmarks contribute to the U-shaped or relative curvilinear depression under the eyes that can result in dark shading, conferring a fatigued appearance. Tear troughs are one of the most common target areas for facial aesthetic treatment. Infraorbital rejuvenation techniques range from invasive procedures, such as surgical approaches (eg, fat grafting, lower eyelid blepharoplasty), to more minimally invasive approaches, such as energy-based treatments, and dermal filler injections.

### 2030 in sight: the future of global eye health [^cad4295a]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

There are 1.1 billion people around the world living with the consequences of sight loss, mostly because they do not have access to eye care services and assistive products. Most people affected by sight loss live in low- and middle-income settings with sight loss due to avoidable causes. Women and girls, aging populations and the most vulnerable people are disproportionately affected by sight loss. Without change, this will rise to 1.8 billion people by 2050.

Unless there is significant investment, eye health systems are unlikely to cope with future needs.

2030 In Sight is a global strategy written and embraced by the sector drawing on the WHO World Report on Vision, the Lancet Global Health Commission on Global Eye Health and the landmark UN Resolution, Vision for Everyone. To meet the growing challenges, we need to think differently and act collectively.

### Novel eye cream containing a mixture of human growth factors and cytokines for periorbital skin rejuvenation [^97c61ba8]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Evidence of the signs associated with skin aging often first appears in the periorbital area and includes wrinkles, eyelid bags, circles around the eye, or a "tired" look. This multicenter study aimed to investigate a novel eye cream containing a proprietary mixture of human growth factors and cytokines in combination with caffeine, bisabolol, glycyrrhetinic acid, and sodium hyaluronate for periorbital rejuvenation. The study, which was completed by 37 female subjects between 36 to 65 years of age, revealed that clinical signs for wrinkles, lower eyelid bags or sagging, dark circles, and skin texture show significant improvement (average 14%-28%) after 6 weeks of twice-daily application. These clinical improvements were confirmed by a subject questionnaire. The subjects further reported that their tired look significantly improved by 32% in average. All subjects tolerated the eye cream well and liked the way it felt. The cream's efficacy, excellent tolerability in the delicate periorbital skin area, and pleasant sensory properties explain why a large majority (78%) would continue regular use.

Conjunctivitis — common features and field care: Among fluorescein‑negative medical eye conditions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and ultraviolet keratitis can usually be treated in the field and are typically not serious, and conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye. Common etiologies include allergies, viruses, and bacteria; conjunctivitis always involves the palpebral conjunctiva and the examiner must look under the lid to evaluate for this inflammation. The hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis is itching; bacterial conjunctivitis gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge. Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics.

### Eye safety | NIOSH archivearchive.cdc.gov › www_cdc_gov › niosh › topics › eye… [^08865183]. archive.cdc.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

Eye Safety Each day about 2000 U. S. workers sustain a job-related eye injury that requires medical treatment. About one third of the injuries are treated in hospital emergency departments, and more than 100 of these injuries result in one or more days away from work. How do eye injuries happen to workers. Striking or scraping: The majority of eye injuries result from small particles or objects striking or scraping the eye, such as: dust, cement chips, metal slivers, and wood chips. These materials are often ejected by tools, windblown, or fall from above a worker. Large objects may also strike the eye or face, or a worker may run into an object causing blunt-force trauma to the eyeball or eye socket. Penetration: Objects like nails, staples, or slivers of wood or metal can go through the eyeball and result in a permanent loss of vision. Chemical and thermal burns: Industrial chemicals or cleaning products are common causes of chemical burns to one or both eyes.

Thermal burns to the eye also occur, often among welders. These burns routinely damage workers' eyes and surrounding tissue. How do workers acquire eye diseases. Eye diseases are often transmitted through the mucous membranes of the eye as a result of direct exposure to things like blood splashes, and droplets from coughing or sneezing or from touching the eyes with a contaminated finger or object. Eye diseases can result in minor reddening or soreness of the eye or in a life threatening disease such as HIV, hepatitis B virus, or avian influenza. What can workers do to prevent eye injury and disease. Wear personal protective eyewear, such as goggles, face shields, safety glasses, or full face respirators. The eye protection chosen for specific work situations depends upon the nature and extent of the hazard, the circumstances of exposure, other protective equipment used, and personal vision needs.

Eye protection should be fit to an individual or adjustable to provide appropriate coverage. It should be comfortable and allow for sufficient peripheral vision. What can employers do to prevent worker eye injury and disease. Employers can ensure engineering controls are used to reduce eye injuries and to protect against ocular infection exposures. Employers can also conduct a hazard assessment to determine the appropriate type of protective eyewear appropriate for a given task.

### Infraorbital rejuvenation combined with thread-lifting and non-cross-linked hyaluronic acid injection: a retrospective, case-series study [^df69e30b]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The infraorbital area is one of the primary regions to show signs of aging, making a significant contribution to the overall facial appearance. The aging process is influenced by a combination of genetic composition and environmental factors. Infraorbital aging is characterized by the appearance of fine wrinkles, infraorbital dark circles, tear trough deformity, and infraorbital hollowing, collectively contributing to a fatigued and aged facial appearance. Consequently, infraorbital rejuvenation plays a pivotal role in enhancing the appearance of the aging face. The treatment of the infraorbital region is essential for achieving a more youthful and rejuvenated overall facial aesthetic.

Recent advancements in cosmetic medicine have contributed to the growing popularity of nonsurgical and minimally invasive procedures as the preferred treatment options. Commonly used treatments today include topical therapies, mechanical and chemical skin resurfacing techniques, lasers, radiofrequency devices, fillers, and neuromodulation through botulinum toxin. These treatment options offer unique advantages along with varying side effect profiles, and they can be combined synergistically to optimize results. As a result, patients have a diverse range of options to achieve their desired cosmetic outcomes while minimizing invasiveness and downtime.

The main objectives of rejuvenating the area around the eyes include restoring soft tissue volume, smoothing fine wrinkles, and improving skin quality. Soft tissue filler injection has emerged as a straightforward and effective procedure to correct tear trough deformity, delivering immediate and noticeable results with a relatively short recovery time. This treatment approach addresses multiple aspects of infraorbital aging and offers patients a convenient and efficient way to achieve a more youthful and refreshed appearance around the eyes. However, despite reports of aesthetically pleasing outcomes with filler use, infraorbital rejuvenation using soft tissue fillers can result in unnatural contours and puffiness due to the complex anatomical features in this area. Additionally, the thin skin in the periorbital region and the relative scarcity of fatty tissue increase the risk of producing lumps, irregularities, and the Tyndall effect when injecting cross-linked hyaluronic acid into the infraorbital area. As such, careful consideration of patient anatomy and selection of appropriate injection techniques are essential for achieving satisfactory and natural-looking results in infraorbital rejuvenation procedures.

In addition to catastrophic loss of life, and dramatic and unwanted alterations to the daily lives of those left behind, the COVID-19 pandemic has fostered the publication and dissemination of an unprecedented quantity of peer-reviewed medical and scientific publications on a single subject. In particular, the ophthalmic literature is now replete with clinical and laboratory studies on putative eye involvement by SARS-CoV-2, the aetiologic agent of COVID-19. In this review, we critically appraise the published literature on COVID-19, and suggest that the quality of scientific peer review and editorial decision-making also suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Treatment of infraorbital dark circles using a low-fluence Q-switched 1, 064-nm laser [^8042cecd]. Dermatologic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the low-fluence 1,064-nm Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (QSNY) laser in treating infraorbital dark circles.

Participants and Methods

Thirty women with infraorbital dark circles (predominant color dark brown) participated in this open-label study. Participants underwent eight sessions of low-fluence QSNY laser treatment at 4.2 J/cm(2) at 3- to 4-day intervals. A spot size of 3.5 mm was used, with a pulse duration of 8 ns. The melanin deposition in the lesional skin was observed in vivo using reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM). Morphologic changes were evaluated using a global evaluation, an overall self-assessment, a narrow-band reflectance spectrophotometer, and a skin hydration measurement instrument.

Results

Twenty-six of 30 patients showed global improvement that they rated as excellent or good. Twenty-eight rated their overall satisfaction as excellent or good. The melanin index indicated a substantial decrease, from 225.84 at baseline to 182.65 (p < .05). RCM results showed a dramatic decrease of melanin deposition in the upper dermis. Adverse effects were minimal.

Conclusions

The characteristic finding for dark-brown infraorbital dark circles is melanin deposition in the upper dermis. Treatment of infraorbital dark circles using low-fluence 1,064-nm QSNY laser is safe and effective. The authors have indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters.

### Effectiveness of volbella (VYC-15L) for infraorbital hollowing: patient-reported outcomes from a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized, controlled study [^216cda4e]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Participants

Eligible male or female adult participants were aged at least 22 years (no age upper limit per protocol), with a baseline grade of 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe) on the 5-point AIHS (range, 0 [none] to 4 [extreme]) for each eye, as assessed by the evaluating investigator (EI). Both eyes had to qualify but did not need to have the same score. The participant's anatomy also needed to be amenable to an AIHS grade improvement of 0 (none) or 1 (minimal). Exclusion criteria included atrophic skin in the tear trough region or large lower lid fat pads that would mask improvement, hyperpigmentation in the infraorbital area (not including dark circles under the eyes), substantial volume loss in the midface, or a cornea that projected farther forward than the most anteriorly projected part of the cheek. Participants were excluded if they had previously received permanent facial implants, blepharoplasty, facelift, or browlift; underwent botulinum toxin injections (within 6 months before enrollment) or fat injections above the subnasale; or underwent volume augmentation with dermal fillers in the malar area, temples, or around the eyes within 12 months before enrollment.

### Influence of eyelid pigmentation on the diagnosis of meibomian gland dysfunction [^bbc24009]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Plain language summary

Dry eye disease is a common problem that affects people around the world. Meibomian gland dysfunction, or MGD, is a common contributor to dry eye disease. Some people who suffer from MGD have more small blood vessels along the edge of the eyelid than those who do not have MGD. This feature of the disease has been used by eye doctors to help in diagnosing and treating MGD. In this study, we looked for these blood vessels and other exam findings that can be seen with MGD, in people with a wide spectrum of skin tones. We found that in individuals with dark skin, we did not see these blood vessels, even if they had MGD. If eye doctors rely on observing the presence of these blood vessels, they may miss the diagnosis of MGD. Therefore, we argue that eye doctors should not rely on the presence (or absence) of blood vessels along the eyelid margin in their diagnosis of MGD, especially in people with dark skin.

We believe this list of challenges serves as a starting point for immediate action that needs to be taken by researchers and funders. We call for funders to use the grand challenges to guide their research investments. Further, the list provides an opportunity for consortia and networks, advocacy organisations, universities, and governments to organise their activities around these challenges. In 2021, the authors of this Commission will seek to cohost a workshop to generate a research agenda and establish collaboration opportunities. The outputs of this workshop will include a strategy for periodic monitoring of eye health progress.

Delivering research for universal eye health

We have identified six crucial actions to generate and use evidence to promote eye health within universal health coverage. First, to develop a research agenda based on the grand challenges. Second, to increase solution-focused research including more contextually relevant implementation and health systems research, in partnership with patients, communities, service implementers, and policy makers, with an emphasis on ensuring that services address the leading causes of vision impairment in terms of coverage, quality, equity, and financial protection. Third, to ensure more emphasis is put on translating research findings into policy and practice, including better partnership with policy makers and integrating eye health research into general research priorities. Fourth, to avoid research waste by ensuring relevant questions are answered by adequately powered, robustly designed studies that are informed by systematic reviews of all the available evidence. Fifth, to support capacity building through equitable North-South and South-South partnerships between researchers and research institutions. Sixth, to ensure inclusion by monitoring diversity of research teams with structural change toward better inclusion, and by including communities and patients throughout the research development process.

### Types of descemet membrane detachment after ocular surface burns: the factor long been ignored [^935d3b4e]. Cornea (2023). Medium credibility.

Types of DMD Evaluated by AS-OCT

In the 9 eyes with ocular surface burns, the presence of DMD was clearly verified by AS-OCT. The DMD was categorized based on the involvement of the PDL and DM. Three types of DMD were discovered, which were as follows: 1) type A DMD referred as detachment of both DM and PDL from the posterior stroma, identified as a thick and straight strand like the chord of a circle in the anterior chamber by AS-OCT (Fig. 1 A, B, C); 2) type B DMD was termed as DM detachment from the PDL and stroma that appeared as a wavy line separated from the posterior cornea by a dark slit by AS-OCT (Fig. 1 D, E, F); and 3) type C DMD presented with 2 separated retrocorneal lines by AS-OCT (Fig. 1 G, H, I), illustrating the detachment of DM and PDL and their separation from each other.

FIGURE 1.
Three types of DMD after ocular surface burns. A, D, G, Limbal ischemia, corneal edema, and corneal clarity were common manifestations after acute ocular surface burns, obscuring the view of the details of iris and changes in the anterior chamber. AS-OCT (B, E, H) showed the eyes of different types of DMD. Schematic diagrams (C, F, I) illustrated the shape and involved layer in the 3 types. The gray stripe referred to the cornea, the dark blue line showed the pre-Descemet layer (PDL), and the yellow line showed DM. A thick hyperreflective strand was seen in the anterior chamber (white arrow in B), which was straight and chord-like, presenting detachment of both DM and PDL from the posterior stroma. An undulating hyperreflective parallel line (red arrow in E) representing DM detachment from the PDL and stroma could be seen in the anterior chamber, part of which was reattached to the PDL. Two separated lines showed DM detachment (white arrow in H) and PDL detachment (red arrow in H), respectively, with interlayer exudation behind the stroma (yellow arrow in H).

Among the 9 eyes, DMD of type A, B, and C were discovered in 3 eyes, 1 eye, and 4 eyes, respectively. In the eye of patient 6, both type A and type C DMDs were confirmed by OCT.

### A prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized, controlled study of VYC-15L, a hyaluronic acid filler, in adults for correction of infraorbital hollowing [^97c012aa]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

This was a prospective, multicenter, evaluator-blinded, randomized, and controlled study conducted between January 2018 and August 2019 at 15 US sites to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of VYC-15L used to correct infraorbital hollowing. Eligible participants were males and females (aged ≥ 22 years) with a Grade 2 (moderate) or Grade 3 (severe) score assessed by the investigator employing the validated 5-point photonumeric Allergan Infraorbital Hollow Scale (AIHS) and considered amenable to improvement to an AIHS grade of 0 or 1 (none or minimal). Both eyes must have qualified but did not need to have the same score (Supplemental Figure 1). Participants were excluded from the study if they had atrophic skin in the TT region or large lower lid fat pads that would mask improvement; had steatoblepharon (anterior prolapse of eyelid fat pad); had hyperpigmentation in the IOA (excluding dark under-eye circles not due to hyperpigmentation); had a cornea that projected farther forward than the most anteriorly projected part of the cheek; had received permanent facial implants; had received a blepharoplasty, facelift, or browlift; had undergone fat injections above the subnasale; or had undergone volume augmentation with dermal fillers in the malar area, temples, or around the eyes within 12 months before enrollment. Participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to VYC-15L treatment or no-treatment control group and 1:1 to receive first treatment in the right or left side (the same order employed for all treatments). The randomization schedule was generated using an established program that was internally developed with SAS. The study-specific parameters were a 3:1 ratio for treatment group, a 1:1 ratio for left/right side for each treatment group, and block size.

### Touchless short-wave infrared imaging for dynamic rapid pupillometry and gaze estimation in closed eyes [^f07a3110]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Next, we developed a data analysis method that can work without pupil segmentation. The rationale was that the contrast between pupil borders and the surrounding iris allows for robust segmentation in open-eye conditions. However, we anticipated that the subsequent imaging in closed-eye conditions may not necessarily yield a strong contrast between the pupil and surrounding iris (i.e. sharp pupil borders may not necessarily be observed). To address this challenge, our approach measures the average pixel darkness within a fixed circle that includes the area of both the pupil and surrounding iris (cyan contour, Fig. 1d). When the pupil constricts (e.g. in PLR events), the area of black pixels within this fixed circle reduces, decreasing the average pixel darkness in the circle (Fig. 1d, left).

Next, we assessed PLR in closed-eye conditions using SWIR imaging. Participants held one eye closed throughout two experimental sessions while the other was open. Leveraging symmetry of pupil dynamics across eyes in healthy individuals, we compared closed-eye SWIR imaging to the open-eye data used as ground truth. Figure 1e shows a representative trace of estimated pupil dynamics from closed-eye SWIR data (using "fixed circle darkness" approach, as above) where deflections could be readily observed around each PLR event. Comparing closed-eye SWIR data estimates against the ground truth open-eye measurements (Fig. 1e) revealed that SWIR imaging could accurately capture PLR dynamics through closed eyes (Fig. 1f) and perform well in participants with different iris colors (Fig. 1 g, h). Across the entire dataset, with this setup and parameters, a robust PLR (Methods) could be revealed for 92.7% of the participants (Fig. 1f, see also Supplementary Fig. 2 for individual participant data). For all participants, the average Pearson correlation coefficient between the open-eye average PLR event time-course and the closed-eye average PLR event time-courses was 0.57 (range: −0.36 to 0.99, SD = 0.38) with an average R-squared value of 0.47 (range: 0–0.98, SD: 0.37). The difference between the all-participant fisher-transformed Pearson coefficients and zero was statistically significant (t (40) = 7.65, p = 2.36e −09, 95% CI [0.71, 1.22]) and the R-squared values (t (40) = 6.71, p = 4.733e −08, 95% CI [0.5, 0.94]).

### Expert recommendations on the use of hyaluronic acid filler for tear trough rejuvenation [^cc5f134f]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Restylane&reg; Lidocaine is one of the most widely used hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers to replace lost or displaced volume during tear trough correction. Patient goals for tear trough correction include looking less tired or removing dark circles and this may be achieved by administering HA filler into the infraorbital region to correct the lower eyelid relative to the volume deficit, thereby smoothing the transition from the lower eyelid to the cheek. To achieve patient satisfaction and consistent results with Restylane, optimal application is essential; however, clinical guidance based on experience is limited. This paper reflects the recommendations of an interdisciplinary expert panel for the use of Restylane in correcting tear trough deformity, including patient selection, dosing, injection technique, and post-treatment care. Recommendations were discussed and agreed as a consensus, according to cross-sectional expertise and clinical experience. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(4):387–392. doi:10.36849/JDD.6597.

Wilderness Medical Society — conjunctivitis in wilderness settings is common, as "Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye", with "Common etiologies includ[ing] allergies, viruses, and bacteria". Bacterial conjunctivitis "gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge". Management differs by cause: "Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics", and "studies have demonstrated that use of antibiotics results in faster clinical and microbiological remission", with "no studies showing superiority of any one antibiotic" so choice is based on availability; "Erythromycin ointment, 1-cm ribbon, placed in the lower conjunctival sac 3 or 4 times daily for 7 days is a reasonable option". Because "viral conjunctivitis is extremely contagious", "proper hand washing is essential… to avoid spread throughout a group or to the contralateral eye". "Topical anesthetic eye drops are diagnostically beneficial and provide acute relief…; however,… they should not be used chronically as they are toxic to the corneal epithelium".

### Dark without pressure retinal changes in a paediatric age group [^d8fb0593]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

We aim to describe the clinical and imaging characteristics of young children with dark without pressure- a well-defined area of dark retina in the mid periphery associated with attenuated hyperreflective outer segment bands on spectral domain OCT.

Subjects/Methods

Retrospective medical chart review. We reviewed the charts and retinal images of children with dark without pressure (DWP) seen in the paediatric eye clinic that had undergone retinal imaging.

Results

We identified 6 children (3 males, 3 females) ranging in age from 3 to 13 years with DWP lesions. These were an incidental finding in children referred for other disorders. The lesions spared the macula and were typically in the mid-peripheral retina. In those children who could cooperate with detailed imaging, the DWP lesions were hypoautofluorecent on fundus autofluorescence imaging and OCT imaging showed reduced reflectance of the outer segments and EZ line as has been described in older children and adults. In two of the six subjects a DWP lesion appeared in an area of previously normal fundus; in no subjects did the lesion resolve over the period of follow up.

Conclusions

The clinical and imaging characteristics of DWP lesions are similar in young children to those described in adults. The site of dysfunction appears to be at the level of the outer retina, but the precise cause is unknown. Recognition of this benign disorder will prevent patient anxiety and unnecessary further investigation.

### The eye and the heart [^61940c7c]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The heart and the eye, two organs at first sight not linked to each other, have more in common than one would expect. The vasculature of the eye, although some peculiarities do exist, shares many features with the vasculature of the heart and is often exposed to the same intrinsic and environmental influences. Thus, the eye, with its easily accessible vasculature, may indeed be a window to the heart, but knowledge about some unique vascular features is necessary. It is the aim of this review (i) to describe the basic characteristics of the vasculature of the eye, (ii) to spark interest for the eye as a 'vascular' organ and the inherent advantages of depicting the microvasculature directly, and (iii) to make cardiologists aware of ophthalmologists' concerns about systemic conditions potentially aggravating eye diseases.

### Evolution and impact of eye and vision terms in written english [^2bbc209f]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2013). Medium credibility.

With this article, we aimed to trace the evolution and impact of eye-related terms common in written English during the past 2 centuries by studying digital resources. Eye-related words and phrases (n-grams) occurring in English books at a frequency of 0.00001% for at least 25 years between 1790 and 2008 were identified from the Google n-gram database by searching for 254 strings such as eye or ophth. The first known English use of these n-grams was identified from historical articles and from multiple digital resources. Eye color was not commonly described as brown or green before 1840. Many common bigrams, such as bright eyes, suggested light emanating from the eyes, consistent with the extramission theory of vision. Based on word frequency, the impact of the revolutionary 1850 ophthalmoscope exceeded that of the stethoscope for 60 years. Glaucoma was not commonly written until the ophthalmoscope permitted visualization of the characteristic optic neuropathy. Green spectacles gave way during the early 1900s to dark glasses, subsequently renamed sunglasses. Until the mid-1900s, an eye surgeon was more often described as an oculist than an ophthalmologist, and inflamed eyes were said to experience ophthalmia more often than uveitis. Macular degeneration was rarely written about for more than a century after 1850 because it was labeled choroiditis. Of the 135 n-grams in the dictionary, an earlier written instance was identified in 92 cases (68%). Online databases of the written word reveal the origin and impact of many important vision concepts.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) disparities — epidemiology and phenotype — In the US AD population, a higher persistence and prevalence of AD among female and black children in urban areas exist; among 78 clinical trials from 2000 to 2009 only 46 (59%) included information on race and ethnicity and only 10.3% of the studies reporting race and ethnicity factored these characteristics into interpretation of the results; studies have demonstrated a higher prevalence as well as greater severity and more impaired QOL in AD among black adults and children, and black and Asian children are seen for office encounters for AD at a higher frequency than white children; biology and presentation differ, as genes encoding filaggrin are associated with skin barrier defects in many patients with AD and filaggrin mutations appear to be less common in black patients compared with white patients while their effect on the persistence of AD is similar; AD classically presents commonly with erythematous plaques with scale on flexor surfaces, whereas black patients are less likely to have flexural dermatitis and more commonly present with extensor dermatitis, with perifollicular prominence and distinct papules more common in patients of African descent, a lichen-planus–type presentation and features including Dennie-Morgan lines, diffuse xerosis, periorbital dark circles, prurigo nodularis, and palmar hyperlinearity commonly seen, and erythema may not be as well appreciated with common scoring systems potentially underestimating severity.

### Comprehensive adult eye and vision examination [^8ade24b1]. AOA (2023). High credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration — types, impact, and projections: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) causes a progressive loss of photoreceptors in the macula, with two types — nonexudative (dry or geographic atrophy) and exudative (wet or neovascular). Nonexudative AMD accounts for 80 to 90 percent of all advanced cases, but more than 90 percent of patients with severe vision loss have exudative AMD. AMD is among the most common causes of legal blindness in the United States and some form of AMD is thought to affect more than 9 million individuals, and persons with AMD are expected to double by 2050, reaching 17.8 million among people age 50 or older.

To put the risk of developing a blood clot into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use birth control pills are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a blood clot. The figure below shows the likelihood of developing a serious blood clot for women who are not pregnant and do not use birth control pills, for women who use birth control pills, for pregnant women, and for women in the first 12 weeks after delivering a baby.

Likelihood of Developing a Serious Blood Clot

A few women who take birth control pills may get:

High blood pressure
Gallbladder problems
Rare cancerous or noncancerous liver tumors.

All of these events are uncommon in healthy women.

Call your healthcare provider right away if you have:

Persistent leg pain
Sudden shortness of breath
Sudden blindness, partial or complete
Severe pain in your chest
Sudden, severe headache unlike your usual headaches
Weakness or numbness in an arm or leg, or trouble speaking
Yellowing of the skin or eyeballs

What are the Common Side Effects of Birth Control Pills?

The most common side effects of birth control pills are:

Spotting or bleeding between menstrual periods
Nausea
Breast tenderness
Headache

These side effects are usually mild and usually disappear with time.

Less common side effects are:

Acne
Less sexual desire
Bloating or fluid retention
Blotchy darkening of the skin, especially on the face
High blood sugar, especially in women who already have diabetes
High fat (cholesterol; triglyceride) levels in the blood
Depression, especially if you have had depression in the past. Call your healthcare provider immediately if you have any thoughts of harming yourself.

### Are eyes the windows to COVID-19? Systematic review and meta-analysis [^2da072cb]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

After carefully reviewing the available literature, we found that ocular manifestation can be the first presenting symptom of COVID-19. Eye infection of SARS-CoV-2 could potentially lead to systemic manifestation, although its evidence needs further investigation. Patients with COVID-19 with ocular manifestation were not associated with severe COVID-19. Detecting SARS-CoV-2 from tears yielded a relatively low positivity rate. However, we acknowledged the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from patients with COVID-19 presenting with only ocular manifestation.

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (philith) [^bbab1af3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision (indicating a possible clot in the eye)

- Breast lumps (indicating possible breast cancer or fibrocystic disease of the breast; ask your doctor or health care provider to show you how to examine your breasts)

- Severe pain or tenderness in the stomach area (indicating a possibly ruptured liver tumor)

- Difficulty in sleeping, weakness, lack of energy, fatigue, or change in mood (possibly indicating severe depression)

- Jaundice or a yellowing of the skin or eyeballs, accompanied frequently by fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark-colored urine, or light-colored bowel movements (indicating possible liver problems)

- Abnormal vaginal bleeding (see SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES, 1. Vaginal Bleeding below.)

SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES:

In addition to the risks and more serious side effects discussed above (see RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES, ESTIMATED RISK OF DEATH FROM A BIRTH CONTROL METHOD OR PREGNANCY and WARNING SIGNALS sections above), the following may also occur:

1. **Vaginal Bleeding**:

Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking the pills. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your doctor or health care provider.

### Progressive macular hypomelanosis: an overview [^c1d11ccf]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Progressive macular hypomelanosis (PMH) is a common skin disorder that is often misdiagnosed. Various authors have written about similar skin disorders, referring to them by different names, but we believe that all these similar disorders are part of the same entity.PMH is characterized by ill-defined nummular, non-scaly hypopigmented spots on the trunk, often confluent in and around the midline, and rarely extending to the proximal extremities and neck/head region. There is no itch, pain, or preceding inflammation. PMH has a worldwide distribution; however, it is more often identified in Black people living in or originating from tropical countries. It is also more often seen in young females. The natural history of PMH is stable disease or perhaps slow progression over decades, with spontaneous disappearance after mid-life. Extensive pityriasis alba is probably identical with PMH and we suggest discontinuation of use of the former term on the grounds that extensive pityriasis alba is histologically and clinically different from classical pityriasis alba, which is basically an eczematous type of disorder.PMH is characterized histologically by diminished pigment in the epidermis and a normal-looking dermis. Electron microscopy shows a shift from large melanosomes in normal-looking skin to small aggregated, membrane-bound melanosomes in hypopigmented skin. PMH should be differentiated from other disorders with hypopigmentation on the trunk such as pityriasis versicolor. We propose that Propionibacterium acnes bacteria living in hair follicles are the cause of PMH as a result of production of a hypothetical depigmenting factor. This hypothesis is based on: (i) the presence of a red follicular fluorescence in the hypopigmented spots and the absence of this phenomenon in normal skin when examined under a Wood's light in a dark room; (ii) cultivation of P. acnes from the follicles in the hypopigmented spots but not from follicles in normal-looking skin; and (iii) improvement of the disorder after elimination of these micro-organisms with topical antimicrobial treatment in combination with UVA light. Currently, the treatment of choice of PMH is application of 1% clindamycin lotion during the daytime, 5% benzoyl peroxide gel at night-time, and UVA light irradiation three times a week for a period of 12 weeks. There is insufficient information available as yet to comment on the recurrence rate after therapy.

### The Lancet global health commission on global eye health: vision beyond 2020 [^c3a915a1]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

This Commission did a Grand Challenges in Global Eye Health prioritisation exercise to highlight key areas for concerted research and action. This exercise has identified a broad set of challenges spanning the fields of epidemiology, health systems, diagnostics, therapeutics, and implementation. The most compelling of these issues, picked from among 3400 suggestions proposed by 336 people from 118 countries, can help to frame the future research agenda for global eye health.

In this Commission, we harness lessons learned from over two decades, present the growing evidence for the life-transforming impact of eye care, and provide a thorough understanding of rapid developments in the field. This report was created through a broad consultation involving experts within and outside the eye care sector to help inform governments and other stakeholders about the path forward for eye health beyond 2020, to further the SDGs (including universal health coverage), and work towards a world without avoidable vision loss.

The next few years are a crucial time for the global eye health community and its partners in health care, government, and other sectors to consider the successes and challenges encountered in the past two decades, and at the same time to chart a way forward for the upcoming decades. Moving forward requires building on the strong foundation laid by WHO and partners in VISION 2020 with renewed impetus to ultimately deliver high quality universal eye health care for all.

### Diagnosing disorders of hypopigmentation and depigmentation in patients with skin of color [^137fdebc]. Dermatologic Clinics (2023). Medium credibility.

Skin hypopigmentation and depigmentation disorders are a top concern for patients with skin of color seeking care from a dermatologist. The visual contrast between involved and uninvolved skin in these disorders makes them particularly burdensome for patients with skin of color. These disorders may have a wide differential of diagnosis, as patients with skin of color may present differently or more frequently than White patients for certain conditions. Clues from a comprehensive history and physical examination with standard lighting and a Wood's light are essential for clinching the diagnosis, although a biopsy may be warranted in special cases.

### Comprehensive pediatric eye and vision examination [^bf7bf30c]. AOA (2017). Medium credibility.

Eye safety and protection — pediatric epidemiology and risk sources: Eye injury is a leading cause of monocular blindness in the United States and a common reason for eye-related emergency department visits. Eye injuries treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms among children younger than 18 years of age averaged over 70,000 annually in 1990 through 2009, the risk for eye injuries in children is highest among 15 to 17 year olds, and the most common eye injuries are due to abrasions or foreign bodies. The majority of eye injuries in children occur at home, with frequent causes including sports and recreation activities, chemicals, or household products, and common injury categories include sports and recreation (e.g., basketball, baseball, football, playground equipment), household chemicals (e.g., cleaning agents, bleach, pesticides), housewares and furniture (e.g., microwaves, flatware, tables), and tools and hardware (e.g., hammers, nails). Despite preventability with protective eyewear, in a National Health Interview Survey of children participating in activities that can cause eye injury, only 14.5% were reported to wear protective eyewear all or most of the time, and older children (12 to 17 years of age) were more likely to use protective eyewear than younger children.

### Correction of tear trough deformity with novel porcine collagen dermal filler (dermicol-P35) [^2dbfe6a3]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Deformity of the tear trough region, which can occur during the aging process, can result in dark shadows under the eyes and a fatigued appearance. Augmentation of the tear trough is challenging because of the thin skin and lack of fat in the region. Adding volume to the tear trough region with a dermal filler is a nonsurgical procedure with minimal discomfort to the patient. Dermicol-P35 (Evolence; Ortho Dermatologics, Skillman, NJ) is a new, ribose crosslinked, highly purified, porcine-based collagen filler that does not require prior skin testing and has shown improved persistence compared with bovine collagen-based dermal fillers. In this article, we present the clinical outcomes of patients who have received treatment with a novel ribose crosslinked porcine collagen dermal filler for the correction of tear trough deformity.

### Three simple steps for refining transcutaneous lower blepharoplasty for aging eyelids: the indispensability of micro-autologous fat transplantation [^4b5e466a]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 3.
This 51-year-old woman (A) presented for transcutaneous lower blepharoplasty with micro-autologous fat transplantation to improve her aging lower eyelid. Transcutaneous lower blepharoplasty with skin-only excision was performed in conjunction with micro-autologous fat transplantation to remove right and left orbital fat (0.31 g and 0.43 g, respectively) that was then transplanted in the right and left tear troughs and lid-cheek junctions (4.0 mL and 4.0 mL, respectively). (B) At 57 months after surgery, retention of the fat volume in her tear trough and lid-cheek junction areas was maintained. The (C, D) oblique and (E, F) close-up profile views show good recontouring in the tear troughs and lid-cheek junctions at 57 months postoperatively. The fine wrinkles over the crow's feet area and the skin dyspigmentation were improved and maintained. (G, H) A downward view demonstrates not only the eliminated infra-orbital fine wrinkles but also rejuvenation of the entire area with appropriate volume restoration.

Figure 4.
This 38-year-old woman presented for fat grafting to improve her aging lower eyelid including moderate baggy eye, skin redundant, and dark circles. Transcutaneous lower blepharoplasty with micro-autologous fat transplantation for recontouring the tear trough deformity and lid-cheek junction was performed. (A) Fat graft volumes of 3.5 mL and 3.0 mL were placed in the right side and left side, respectively, after removal of orbital fat volumes of 0.11 g and 0.12 g from the right side and left side, respectively. (B) Four years after a single micro-autologous fat transplantation session and lower blepharoplasty, the improved appearance of her lower eyelid was maintained. (C, D) The recontoured tear trough and the lid-cheek junction with an improved appearance of the baggy lower eyelid are shown in the oblique view. (E, F) Close-up, downward-looking view further indicates the skin rejuvenation effects with diminished dark circles.

### Co-occurrence of periodic alternating and pendular seesaw nystagmus in blindness [^1918e446]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Even though pendular seesaw nystagmus (PSN) or periodic alternating nystagmus (PAN) has been reported in blind persons, the co-occurrence of PSN and PAN has not been described. A 69-year-old woman with progressive visual loss to only light perception in both eyes showed PSN with a conjugate torsional component and the vertical components in the opposite directions in both eyes. In complete darkness, she also exhibited PAN in addition to PSN. PSN remained unchanged in darkness. The rest of the neurological examination, testing for mitochondrial mutations of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, fluorescent angiography, electroretinogram, and brain MRI were normal except for bilateral optic atrophy. Deprivation of the visual inputs, which are required to calibrate normal eye motion, may produce various ocular motor abnormalities in blindness. Although the co-occurrence of PSN and PAN in our patient with visual loss indicates a common etiology, the different effects of darkness on nystagmus intensity suggest a distinct pathomechanism.

### Ophthalmic drug discovery [^26d3f522]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2003). Medium credibility.

Millions of people suffer from a wide variety of ocular diseases, many of which lead to irreversible blindness. The leading causes of irreversible blindness in the elderly — age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma — will continue to effect more individuals as the worldwide population continues to age. Although there are therapies for treating glaucoma, as well as ongoing clinical trials of treatments for age-related macular degeneration, there still is a great need for more efficacious treatments that halt or even reverse ocular diseases. The eye has special attributes that allow local drug delivery and non-invasive clinical assessment of disease, but it is also a highly complex and unique organ, which makes understanding disease pathogenesis and ocular drug discovery challenging. As we learn more about the cellular mechanisms involved in age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, potentially, new drug targets will emerge. This review provides insight into some of the new approaches to therapy.

### Extended phenotypic spectrum of benign yellow dot maculopathy [^1c46644e]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

What was known before

Benign yellow dot maculopathy has recently been recognized as a specific entity.
Patients are usually asymptomatic and retinal function is usually normal.
Vertical transmission has been observed in families of some patients.

What this study adds

The prevalence of benign yellow dot maculopathy is possibly higher than previously assumed.
The extend of retinal involvement is very variable, resulting in a wide spectrum of phenotypic presentation.
The yellow dots appear dark on near-infrared autofluorescence imaging, possibly indicating a developmental focal lack of melanin in retinal pigment epithelial cells.

### Comprehensive adult eye and vision examination [^4ef5f7a5]. AOA (2023). High credibility.

Comprehensive adult eye and vision examination — supplemental tests and indications are described as follows: Additional tests (e.g. Farnsworth D-15, anomaloscope) may be needed to properly categorize moderate or severe color vision deficiency (Evidence Grade: B). Contrast sensitivity testing measures the ability to detect low contrast images and subtle changes in vision not measured by visual acuity and may be used to evaluate patients with macular degeneration, cataract, or glaucoma. Dark adaptometry measures the ability of the eyes to adapt from bright light to darkness and may be used to evaluate complaints of poor night vision and the presence of retinal diseases (e.g., age-related macular degeneration, cone dysfunction syndrome). Dry eye assessment evaluates the quantity and quality of tears and may include measurement of tear production, evaluation of ocular surface staining, tear-film break-up time, and blink rate. Fundus photography is used to document the status of the retina and to evaluate the progression of retinal disease. Glare testing evaluates any reduction in the retinal image caused by intraocular light scattering (e.g., the effects of cataracts or an ocular media opacity on vision). Gonioscopy is used to visualize and evaluate the anterior chamber angle to determine if it is open or narrowed, or the possibility of it becoming closed. Keratometry/corneal topography/corneal tomography measure the curvature of the surface of the cornea to determine the extent of corneal astigmatism for the fitting of contact lenses, identifying keratoconus, and monitoring corneal pathology. Optical coherence tomography provides in vivo, cross-sectional high-resolution images of the anterior chamber, retina, optic nerve head, and retinal nerve fiber layer. Pachymetry is used to measure corneal thickness and diagnose and/or monitor glaucoma, keratoconus and other corneal dystrophies, and post-surgical edema. Threshold visual field testing identifies defects in peripheral vision (e.g., for the diagnosis of glaucoma and other diseases) and is used to monitor treatment to determine if the disease is under control or if vision loss is progressing.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Clinical Studies Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety data described below reflect exposure in four controlled clinical trials of 90 days to 2 years duration in 317 patients diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In the four clinical trials, patients were treated with pilocarpine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 2%, two to four times daily or with pilocarpine 1%, 1.75% or 2% in fixed combination with betaxolol 0.25%, two or three times daily. The most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 5% of patients in the pilocarpine 2% populations were: headache/browache, accommodative change, blurred vision, eye irritation, visual impairment (dim, dark, or "jumping" vision), and eye pain.

The adverse reaction profile reported for the use of pilocarpine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution in pediatric patients is comparable to that seen in adult patients.

Most common adverse reactions are headache/browache, accommodative change, eye irritation, eye pain, blurred vision, and/or visual impairment (6.1).

### A global assessment of eye health and quality of life: a systematic review of systematic reviews [^33e94085]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association between vision impairment, eye diseases, or ophthalmic interventions and quality of life?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study, vision impairment and eye diseases were associated with lower quality of life. More than half of the ophthalmic interventions included had a positive association with quality of life.

Meaning

The associations of quality of life with vision impairment and the improvements in quality of life with ophthalmic interventions support efforts to improve access to ophthalmic treatments globally to reach the millions of people affected by eye disease each year.

### Procedures for the evaluation of the visual system by pediatricians [^8ba7ea23]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Red reflex assessment in pediatric vision screening — During evaluation "at a distance of approximately arm's length from the child, both pupils are evaluated simultaneously as the child looks at the light". Normal findings are that reflexes "should be a light orange-yellow in color in lightly pigmented eyes or a dark red in darkly pigmented brown eyes" and "the 2 red reflexes should be identical in color, brightness, and size". An abnormal "bright white or yellow reflex or, conversely, a dull or absent red reflex" "necessitates further evaluation by a pediatric ophthalmologist, or if unavailable, a comprehensive ophthalmologist or optometrist" with pediatric expertise.

### Amblyopia preferred practice pattern [^74d7637c]. Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on amblyopia:

- **Definition**: Amblyopia, often referred to as 'lazy eye', is a neurological disease characterized by cortical visual impairment, with loss or lack of development of central vision in one eye that is unrelated to primary ocular pathology.
- **Pathophysiology**: Abnormal or inadequate stimulation of the visual system during its early developmental period results in amblyopia. Common etiologies include strabismus, refractive errors (anisometropia and high hyperopia), and structural ocular abnormalities (ptosis, corneal opacity, vitreous hemorrhage, and congenital cataract).
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of amblyopia in the US is estimated to be < 2,000 cases per 100,000 individuals.
- **Disease course**: The resulting alterations in the development of visual pathways cause clinical manifestations of visual impairment and permanent vision loss of the affected eye.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Amblyopia is not associated with an increase in mortality.
