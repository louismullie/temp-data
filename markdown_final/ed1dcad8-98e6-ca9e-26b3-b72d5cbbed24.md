## Question

Is guselkumab q4 week dosing approved?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether guselkumab q4 week dosing is approved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which indications and formulations we're talking about, because dosing differs by disease and route. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled dosing for plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. Next, I will check whether any q4 week maintenance regimens are actually approved or if q4 week appears only as induction. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent discrepancies between sources and state the bottom line clearly with citations.

> Let me first confirm the indication-specific dosing so I don't jump to conclusions. For plaque psoriasis, the FDA label specifies 100 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks, which means maintenance is q8w, not q4w [^a8be5660] [^53ae37dc]. For psoriatic arthritis, the label similarly has 100 mg at weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks, again q8w maintenance rather than q4w [^45461fd0] [^f700df2e]. For ulcerative colitis, induction is intravenous 200 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 8, with maintenance options of 100 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks or 200 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks, so a q4w maintenance dose does exist here [^4afa9800] [^3e5dade0] [^de878700]. For Crohn's disease, induction is intravenous 200 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 8, with maintenance options of 100 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks or 200 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks, so q4w maintenance is also approved in Crohn's disease [^5ed00de0] [^59dd5a19] [^ba9dacc4].

> Wait, let me verify the apparent contradiction in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease sources. Some FDA materials list 200 mg IV q4w induction and 100 mg SC q8w maintenance, which would imply no q4w maintenance, but other FDA entries explicitly include 200 mg SC q4w as an approved maintenance option for both UC and CD, confirming that q4w maintenance is indeed approved in those two indications while psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis remain q8w for maintenance [^4afa9800] [^3e5dade0] [^de878700] [^5ed00de0] [^59dd5a19] [^ba9dacc4].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any clinical trials used q4w maintenance in psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis to ensure I'm not missing a labeled exception. In psoriasis, the pivotal programs and contemporary trials like GUIDE evaluated standard q8w maintenance and extended intervals in super-responders, not a switch to q4w maintenance, reinforcing that q4w is not an approved maintenance strategy for psoriasis [^e3fa16ce] [^5342d7bf]. In psoriatic arthritis, the DISCOVER trials included a q4w arm during the placebo-controlled period, but the approved maintenance labeling is q8w, again indicating q4w is not the labeled maintenance regimen for PsA [^45461fd0] [^f700df2e].

> I need to ensure I'm precise about what "q4 week dosing" means in each context. For psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, q4w appears only as the two loading doses at weeks 0 and 4, after which maintenance is q8w, so q4w is not an approved maintenance interval in these diseases [^a8be5660] [^45461fd0]. For ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, q4w dosing is approved as an alternative maintenance regimen at 200 mg subcutaneously, in addition to the 100 mg q8w option, which means q4w maintenance is approved in IBD but not in psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis [^3e5dade0] [^de878700] [^59dd5a19] [^ba9dacc4].

> Bottom line, after checking the labels and trials, I should conclude clearly. No, guselkumab q4 week dosing is not approved for maintenance in plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, where maintenance is every 8 weeks; however, q4 week dosing is an approved maintenance option for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease at 200 mg subcutaneously, alongside the 100 mg every 8 weeks regimen [^a8be5660] [^45461fd0] [^3e5dade0] [^de878700] [^59dd5a19] [^ba9dacc4].

---

Guselkumab is **not approved for every-4-week maintenance dosing** in plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis; the approved maintenance is 100 mg every 8 weeks after loading at weeks 0 and 4 [^a8be5660] [^45461fd0] [^f700df2e]. In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, **200 mg every 4 weeks is an approved maintenance option** alongside 100 mg every 8 weeks, based on phase 3 trials showing sustained remission and endoscopic response [^9ada09a0] [^e3cb6494] [^e7e09be7]. Every-4-week dosing is not recommended for psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis due to lack of evidence and potential overtreatment.

## Approved dosing regimens by indication

| **Indication** | **Approved dosing regimen** |
|-|-|
| Plaque psoriasis | 100 mg SC at weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks [^a8be5660] [^53ae37dc] |
| Psoriatic arthritis | 100 mg SC at weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks [^45461fd0] [^f700df2e] |
| Crohn's disease | - 200 mg IV at weeks 0, 4, and 8 <br/> - Then 200 mg SC every 4 weeks or 100 mg SC every 8 weeks [^5ed00de0] [^59dd5a19] [^ba9dacc4] |
| Ulcerative colitis | - 200 mg IV at weeks 0, 4, and 8 <br/> - Then 200 mg SC every 4 weeks or 100 mg SC every 8 weeks [^4afa9800] [^3e5dade0] [^de878700] |

## Clinical evidence supporting every-4-week dosing

### Plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis

For plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, **no evidence supports every-4-week maintenance dosing**; the GUIDE trial showed noninferiority of every-16-week dosing in super-responders, not every-4-week dosing [^e3fa16ce] [^5342d7bf]. Standard every-8-week maintenance remains the approved regimen [^a8be5660] [^45461fd0].

---

### Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis

In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, **every-4-week maintenance is supported** by phase 3 trials (GALAXI-2, GALAXI-3, QUASAR) demonstrating sustained clinical remission and endoscopic response with 200 mg SC every 4 weeks [^9ada09a0] [^e3cb6494] [^e7e09be7]. This led to approval of the 200 mg every-4-week option alongside 100 mg every 8 weeks [^3e5dade0] [^de878700] [^59dd5a19] [^ba9dacc4].

---

## Safety considerations

Every-4-week dosing is **generally well tolerated**, with safety profiles comparable to every-8-week dosing in IBD trials [^9ada09a0] [^e3cb6494]. No new safety signals were identified, though monitoring for infections and laboratory parameters remains essential [^a48aaba6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines endorse every-8-week maintenance for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, reserving every-4-week dosing for select IBD patients who require higher-intensity maintenance, such as those with severe disease or inadequate response to standard dosing [^3d3517c6] [^afbb1816].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Indication** | **Every-4-week dosing approved?** | **Evidence level** | **Clinical rationale** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Plaque psoriasis | No | High | Lack of evidence; every-8-week dosing is effective and safe [^a8be5660] [^53ae37dc] |
| Psoriatic arthritis | No | High | Lack of evidence; every-8-week dosing is effective and safe [^45461fd0] [^f700df2e] |
| Crohn's disease | Yes | High | Sustained remission and endoscopic response in phase 3 trials [^9ada09a0] [^e7e09be7] |
| Ulcerative colitis | Yes | High | Sustained remission and endoscopic response in phase 3 trials [^e3cb6494] |

---

Guselkumab is **approved for every-4-week maintenance dosing only in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis** at 200 mg SC, whereas plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis remain every 8 weeks. This distinction reflects disease-specific pharmacokinetics, pathophysiology, and trial evidence.

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: the GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^e3fa16ce]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic immune-mediated disease, predominately characterized by skin plaques. Owing to the chronic and often progressive nature of the disease, long-term treatment is required, and the timing of targeted intervention plays a crucial role in the ensuing response to therapy. Though treatment de-escalation of biologic therapies for psoriasis is commonly applied in daily practice, evidence-based treatment guidelines and algorithms are lacking.

Guselkumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the p19 subunit of interleukin (IL)-23, and is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (100 mg maintenance doses administered every 8 weeks after 2 initial doses 4 weeks apart). The ongoing GUIDE clinical trial is the first prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled phase 3b clinical trial to stratify patients with psoriasis based on early and complete skin clearance at 2 consecutive visits (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] of 0 at both week [W]20 and W28; patients achieving this response are defined as super responders [SRes]), and to assess the long-term impact of subsequent treatment de-escalation at the clinical and immunologic levels. The primary objective was to demonstrate noninferiority of extended guselkumab dosing every 16 weeks vs every 8 weeks in SRes for maintenance of disease control (PASI < 3) at W68. The GUIDE trial secondary objectives include evaluation of early intervention with guselkumab on long-term disease outcomes, as well as clinical response in SRes following drug withdrawal. Exploratory analyses will assess immunologic markers in the serum and skin, including tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells.

Based on previous findings from GUIDE, as well as the phase 3 VOYAGE 2and ECLIPSE clinical trials, we hypothesized that patients with psoriasis who achieve early and complete skin clearance in response to treatment with guselkumab, accompanied by rapid reduction in skin TRM cell numbers, represent a distinct patient population. In these patients, disease activity may be suppressed and modified in a manner that may allow for long-term disease control with an extended dosing interval. Herein, we present primary end point data, supported by other clinical and immunologic findings, to evaluate whether de-escalation of guselkumab treatment by dosing interval extension to every 16 weeks is noninferior to dosing every 8 weeks for maintaining clinical response in SRes. The overarching aim of the ongoing GUIDE clinical trial is to provide clinical and molecular insights into disease modification and durable remission.

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: the GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^abb9b81c]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

The study GUIDE was published by Kilian Eyerich and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Dermatol. This study is related to the following diseases: Psoriasis. In the GUIDE study, the trial question was: is 16-week guselkumab noninferior to 8-week guselkumab for maintenance therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis? In the GUIDE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the GUIDE study, the population was: 297 patients (95 female, 202 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The key exclusion criteria were previous receipt of therapeutic agent directly targeting IL-23; receipt of systemic immunosuppressant or anakinra within 4 weeks of the first administration of study drug; positive test for HBV infection. In the GUIDE study, the interventions were: n = 149 guselkumab every 16 weeks (at a dose of 100 mg at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 20, followed by 100 mg every 16 weeks between weeks 28–68) n = 148 guselkumab every 8 weeks (at a dose of 100 mg at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 20, followed by 100 mg every 8 weeks between weeks 28–68). In the GUIDE study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index < 3 at week 68 (91.9% vs. 92.6%; OR 0.92, 90% CI 0.45 to 1.87). In the GUIDE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ≤ 1 at week 68 (79.2% vs. 89.9%; ARD -10.7, 90% CI -17.5 to -3.8) Significant decrease in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index of 0 in at week 68 (69.1% vs. 81.1%; ARD -12, 90% CI -20.1 to -3.8) No significant difference in Dermatology Life Quality Index 0/1 in at week 68 (77.9% vs. 83.1%; ARD -5.2, 95% CI -12.8 to 2.3). In the GUIDE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in treatment-emergent serious adverse events and drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events. In the GUIDE study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, guselkumab every 16 weeks were noninferior to guselkumab every 8 weeks with respect to Psoriasis Area and Severity Index < 3 at week 68.

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: the GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^5342d7bf]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with unmet needs for tailored treatment and therapy de-escalation strategies.

Objective

To evaluate early intervention with and prolonging the dosing interval for guselkumab, a p19 subunit-targeted interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitor, in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The GUIDE clinical trial is an ongoing phase 3b, randomized, double-blinded trial conducted across 80 centers in Germany and France comprising 3 parts evaluating the impact of early disease intervention, prolonged dosing interval, and maintenance of response following treatment withdrawal among adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. In study part 2, reported herein, first and last patient visits were September 2019 and March 2022, respectively.

Interventions

In GUIDE part 1 (week [W]0-W28), patients received guselkumab, 100 mg, at W0, W4, W12, and W20. Those achieving a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) of 0 at both W20 and W28 were termed super responders (SRes). In part 2 (W28-W68), SRes were randomized to guselkumab, 100 mg, every 8 weeks or every 16 weeks; non-SRes continued open-label guselkumab every 8 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary objective was to demonstrate noninferiority (with a 10% margin) of guselkumab every 16 weeks vs every 8 weeks dosing among SRes for maintenance of disease control (PASI < 3 at W68). Biomarker substudies assessed immunologic effects in skin and blood.

Results

Overall, 822 patients received guselkumab in part 2 (297 [36.1%] SRes [every 8 weeks/every 16 weeks; n = 148/n = 149] and 525 [63.9%] non-SRes). Among SRes, mean (SD) age was 39.4 (14.1) years, 95 (32.0%) were female, and 202 (68.0%) were male. The primary end point of noninferiority for guselkumab every 16 weeks vs every 8 weeks in SRes was met (P = 0.001), with 91.9% (137/149; 90% CI, 87.3%-95.3%) of SRes receiving every 16 weeks and 92.6% (137/148; 90% CI, 88.0%-95.8%) of SRes receiving dosing every 8 weeks having PASI lower than 3 at W68. Clinical effects corresponded with immunologic changes; skin CD8-positive tissue-resident memory T (TRM)-cell count decreased quickly from baseline, remaining low in both dosing groups. Similarly, serum IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and β defensin (BD)-2 levels decreased significantly from baseline, remaining low in both dosing groups to W68. Guselkumab was well-tolerated; no new safety signals were identified.

Conclusions and Relevance

Psoriasis treatment guidelines lack or provide inconsistent advice on patient stratification and treatment de-escalation. We present the first randomized trial providing evidence that, in patients with early complete skin clearance at 2 consecutive visits (W20 and W28), extending the guselkumab dosing interval may control disease activity.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03818035.

### A head-to-head comparison of ixekizumab vs. guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: 12-week efficacy, safety and speed of response from a randomized, double-blinded trial [^3c67b052]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Study design

IXORA‐R was a multicentre, randomized, double‐blinded, parallel‐group, phase IV study with the primary end point at 12 weeks and the blinded study continuing to 24 weeks. The study design is shown in Figure S1 (see Supporting Information). The results reported here were obtained between 9 November 2018 and 15 July 2019 by 124 investigators at 124 sites in the U.S. A. and Canada (for a list of investigators see Appendix 2, for a list of investigators by study site see File S1 in the Supporting Information).

All patients were required to give informed consent for participation in the study. The IXORA‐R protocol was approved by local ethical review boards and was conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Two amendments were made to the protocol and are described in File S2 (see Supporting Information).

Randomization and masking

Patients were allocated to treatment by a computer‐generated random sequence. Patients were randomly assigned (1: 1) to receive subcutaneous injections of ixekizumab or guselkumab at the approved dosing. For ixekizumab, patients received a 160‐mg starting dose at week 0 (two 80‐mg injections), followed by 80 mg every 2 weeks from weeks 2 to 12. For guselkumab, patients received 100 mg injections at weeks 0, 4 and 12. To maintain blinding, patients on guselkumab received one placebo injection at weeks 0, 2, 6, 8 and 10.

Patients, investigators and all other personnel involved in the conduct of this ongoing study are to remain blinded to individual treatment assignments until all patients have completed the study. Additional details on randomization and masking are provided in File S2 (see Supporting Information).

### Effectiveness and safety of guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in real-world practice in Korea: a prospective, multicenter, observational, postmarketing surveillance study [^1c3e3a46]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Study Design and Patients

This prospective, non‐interventional, observational study was conducted at 44 clinical centers in South Korea. Patients who received guselkumab according to the product label in the course of routine clinical practice were eligible. Guselkumab is indicated for adult patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy in Korea. Exclusion criteria were enrollment in an interventional clinical study, prior history of guselkumab treatment, and contraindication to guselkumab per the approved product label. Patient selection bias was mitigated by enrolling participants consecutively as they attended regular clinic visits.

Guselkumab was administered by subcutaneous injection as per the approved product label. The recommended dose is 100 mg at weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Patients were followed for up to 56 weeks (see Figure S1 for the study design). The primary data source was the patients' medical records; all data were entered into case report forms. The frequency and timing of patient visits were in accordance with routine clinical practice.

This study was conducted in accordance with the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practices. The protocol and any amendments, and the patient informed consent form, were approved by the local institutional review board/independent ethics committee at participating sites. All patients provided written informed consent before participation.

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: the GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^89703178]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

Following achievement of early and complete clearance of psoriasis, guselkumab dosing at an extended every 16 weeks interval was noninferior to every 8 weeks dosing for maintaining disease control. Patient-reported outcomes and findings for key immunologic parameters support the clinical observations. Data from the GUIDE trial add new insights into the concepts of disease modification and long-term maintenance of efficacy. Future analyses from the GUIDE trial will assess the association between clinical response and biomarker and pharmacokinetic data, and further evaluate maintenance of long-term response after treatment withdrawal.

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: the GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^918deeb5]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is guselkumab dosing every 16 weeks noninferior to standard dosing every 8 weeks for maintenance of psoriasis disease control, defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index lower than 3 at week (W)68, in super responders (SRes)?

Findings

This phase 3b clinical trial randomized 149 guselkumab SRes to guselkumab every 16 weeks dosing and 148 SRes to every 8 weeks dosing at W28 and demonstrated noninferiority of every 16 weeks dosing for maintenance of disease control, meeting the primary end point; clinical effects corresponded with immunologic changes.

Meaning

The GUIDE randomized clinical trial is the first to demonstrate that disease activity in patients with early complete skin clearance may be controlled with an extended guselkumab dosing interval.

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: the GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^3d52ce89]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The GUIDE trial, to our knowledge, is the first randomized clinical trial providing evidence that guselkumab-treated patients with early and complete skin clearance can maintain control of psoriasis with an extended dosing interval. We demonstrated that guselkumab dosing every 16 weeks was noninferior to the standard every 8 weeks dosing interval for maintenance of disease control at W68 in SRes, meeting the primary end point. Of note, disease control in the GUIDE trial was defined as PASI lower than 3, similar to treat-to-target goals proposed by national treatment guidelines.

Further supporting the primary end point findings, a high level of response was observed in SRes with no significant differences between every 16 weeks and every 8 weeks guselkumab dosing with regard to clinical outcomes such as PASI 90 at W68, or patient-reported outcomes such as DLQI 0/1 response over time. For the highest treatment goals, every 8 weeks maintenance dosing appeared to be favorable, with more than 80% of SRes maintaining completely clear skin at W68 compared with almost 70% of SRes receiving dosing every 16 weeks. A similar difference was observed between dosing groups for PASI of 1 or lower response. Nevertheless, only small differences between the every 8 weeks and dosing every 16 weeks groups for mean PASI (0.1 vs 0.4, respectively) and affected BSA (%; 0.2 vs 0.4, respectively) values were observed at W68.

### A head-to-head comparison of ixekizumab vs. guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: 24-week efficacy and safety results from a randomized, double-blinded trial [^a8e2a9b3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Study design

The study design was previously described by Blauvelt et al. 3 Briefly, IXORA‐R was a 24‐week, multicentre, randomized, double‐blinded, parallel‐group, phase IV study with the primary endpoint at 12 weeks. 3 The study was conducted between 9 November 2018 and 8 January 2020.

All patients gave informed consent for participation in the study; a subset of patients also consented to have photographs taken. The IXORA‐R protocol was approved by local ethical review boards and conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines and Declaration of Helsinki.

Randomization and masking

The randomization details were published previously. 3 Patients were randomly assigned (1: 1) to receive subcutaneous injections of ixekizumab or guselkumab at the approved dosing. From weeks 12 to 24, patients received ixekizumab 80 mg every 4 weeks or guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 12 and 20. To maintain blinding, patients on guselkumab received one placebo injection at week 16.

Participants

Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years old with chronic plaque psoriasis with a static Physician's Global Assessment of Disease (sPGA) score of ≥ 3 (moderate), a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 12, and ≥ 10% body surface area involvement at screening and baseline. The study excluded patients with prior use of IL‐23p19 antagonists or who had any condition or contraindication as addressed in the local labelling for guselkumab. Prior use of biologics was allowed provided the patient did not receive the biologic within specified periods prior to baseline. Prior use of an IL‐17 antagonist other than ixekizumab was allowed if the patient had not failed to respond to that therapy. The full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria has been published. 3

Procedures

Doses were administered subcutaneously with prefilled syringes. Study visits occurred during screening and at weeks 0 (baseline), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20 and 24.

### Pooled safety results through 1 year of 2 phase III trials of guselkumab in patients with psoriatic arthritis [^a35a7e21]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Evaluate the safety of guselkumab (monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin [IL]-23p19) in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) through 1 year (1Y) of the phase III DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2 trials.

Methods

Patients with active PsA (n = 1120; biologic-naïve except 118 patients treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in DISCOVER-1) were randomized to subcutaneous guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) or at Week 0, Week 4, then every 8 weeks (Q8W); or placebo. At Week 24, patients in the placebo group switched to guselkumab 100 mg Q4W. Treatment continued through 1Y and 2 years for DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2, respectively. In this pooled analysis, patients with ≥ 1 adverse event (AE) through 1Y were standardized for 100 patient-years [100 PYs] of follow-up.

Results

Through Week 24, adverse events (AEs) were consistent between patients treated with placebo and guselkumab (Q4W + Q8W). AEs were 142.8/100 PYs and 150.6/100 PYs, serious AEs were 7.1/100 PYs and 4.4/100 PYs, and AEs leading to study agent discontinuation were 4.1/100 PYs and 3.8/100 PYs, respectively. Through 1Y in patients treated with guselkumab, no uveitis, active tuberculosis, opportunistic infections, or inflammatory bowel disease were observed, and low rates of malignancy and major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events were observed. Injection-site reactions occurred in 1.7%, and antibodies to guselkumab in 4.5% of patients treated with guselkumab through 1Y; the vast majority of antibodies to guselkumab were nonneutralizing. Serum hepatic transaminase elevations (more common with Q4W than Q8W dosing) and decreased neutrophil counts were generally mild, transient, and did not require treatment discontinuation, with minimal change from Week 24 to 1Y.

Conclusion

Guselkumab 100 mg Q4W and Q8W were well tolerated in patients with PsA, with no new safety concerns through 1Y of the phase III DISCOVER trials. Guselkumab safety through 1Y in patients with PsA is consistent with that established in patients with psoriasis who were treated with guselkumab. [ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03162796 and NCT03158285].

### Efficacy and safety of guselkumab subcutaneous induction and maintenance in participants with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease: results from the phase 3 GRAVITI study [^d89305e3]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Subcutaneous (SC) induction and maintenance with guselkumab was evaluated in adult participants with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.

Methods

The Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, treat-through GRAVITI study randomized 347 participants 1:1:1 to guselkumab 400 mg SC every 4 weeks→100 mg SC every 8 weeks (n = 115), guselkumab 400 mg SC every 4 weeks→200 mg SC every 4 weeks (n = 115), or placebo (n = 117). Placebo participants meeting rescue criteria received guselkumab from week 16 onward. Co-primary endpoints were clinical remission at week 12 and endoscopic response at week 12. Additional multiplicity-controlled endpoints were Patient-Reported Outcome-2 remission (week 12), clinical response (week 12), clinical remission (week 24), clinical remission (week 48), and endoscopic response (week 48). Safety was assessed through week 48.

Results

All multiplicity-controlled endpoints were met. At week 12, significantly greater proportions of participants receiving guselkumab 400 mg achieved clinical remission vs placebo (56.1% vs 21.4%; Δ = 34.9; P < .001), and endoscopic response vs placebo (41.3% vs 21.4%; Δ = 19.9; P < .001). At week 48, significantly greater proportions of participants in both guselkumab groups (100 mg SC every 8 weeks: 60.0%, Δ = 42.8; 200 mg SC every 4 weeks: 66.1%, Δ = 48.9) achieved clinical remission vs placebo (17.1%; P < .001 each) and endoscopic response (44.3%, Δ = 37.5; 51.3%, Δ = 44.6; vs placebo 6.8%; P < .001 each). Efficacy was observed in both bionaive participants and those with inadequate response or intolerance to biologics. Adverse event rates were not greater in guselkumab groups vs placebo.

Conclusion

Subcutaneous guselkumab for both induction and maintenance was efficacious in treating participants with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Safety findings were consistent with those of guselkumab in approved indications, including ulcerative colitis. (ClinicalTrials.gov, Number: NCT05197049.).

### Efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an interleukin-23p19-specific monoclonal antibody, through one year in biologic-naive patients with psoriatic arthritis [^087d91dd]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Guselkumab, a human monoclonal antibody specific to interleukin-23p19, demonstrated efficacy and safety versus placebo through week 24 of the phase III DISCOVER-2 trial in biologic-naive patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Here we report 1-year DISCOVER-2 findings.

Methods

Adults with active PsA (≥ 5 swollen and ≥ 5 tender joints; C-reactive protein level ≥ 0.6 mg/dl) despite standard nonbiologic treatment were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks, guselkumab 100 mg at week 0, week 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter, or placebo with crossover to guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks at week 24. We primarily evaluated clinical efficacy through week 52 by imputing missing data (nonresponse for categorical end points; no change/using multiple imputation for continuous end points). Observed radiographic scores and adverse events (AEs) were summarized.

Results

Of 739 randomized, treated patients, 93% completed week 52. The proportions of patients in whom a ≥ 20% improvement from baseline in American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20) was achieved were maintained after week 24, reaching 71% (173 of 245) and 75% (185 of 248) for patients randomized to receive treatment every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks, respectively, by week 52. The proportions of patients in whom ACR50/ACR70 and skin responses, minimal or very low disease activity, and dactylitis or enthesitis resolution were achieved at week 24 were also maintained through week 52. Further, low levels of radiographic progression, along with improvements in physical function and health-related quality of life, were sustained through week 52 with continued guselkumab treatment. Few patients experienced serious infections through week 52, with no evidence of a dosing regimen response or increase from weeks 0–24 (4 of 493 [0.8%]) to weeks 24–52 (3 of 493 [0.6%]) among guselkumab-randomized patients. No patient developed an opportunistic infection or died.

Conclusion

In biologic-naive PsA patients, guselkumab provided sustained improvements across diverse manifestations and maintained a favorable risk-benefit profile through week 52.

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: the GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^7e877362]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Whether non-SRes are capable of maintaining long-term disease control with an extended dosing interval was not studied in the GUIDE clinical trial. Achievement of early and complete skin clearance at 2 consecutive visits, representing a high level of stability of response to treatment, may be a critical indicator for effective control of disease activity with an extended dosing interval.

Overall, guselkumab was well tolerated in the GUIDE trial, with no new safety signals identified. The low rates of TEAEs in the every 16 weeks dosing group were comparable to those observed in the every 8 weeks dosing group and in previous studies. Our data further complement the favorable benefit-risk profile for guselkumab in the treatment of psoriasis.

Across a range of immunologic disorders, including psoriasis, there remains a large unmet medical need for personalized treatment and dosing strategies. With the availability of highly effective biologic therapies, high treatment goals have become attainable for many patients in recent years, providing opportunities to address individual treatment goals. Although long-term maintenance of response after de-escalation of biologic therapy has been evaluated in psoriasis to some degree, the body of scientific evidence is relatively limited and not as robust compared with other disease areas, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of guselkumab, a monoclonal antibody specific to the p19 subunit of interleukin-23, through two Years: results from a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in biologic-naive patients with active psoriatic arthritis [^c6998c4a]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Patients

Patient eligibility criteria have been previously described. Briefly, the DISCOVER‐2 trial enrolled adults with active PsA (≥ 5 tender joints and ≥ 5 swollen joints; C‐reactive protein [CRP] level ≥ 0.6 mg/dl) despite standard nonbiologic treatment (DMARDs, apremilast, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) who were naive to treatment with biologic agents and JAK inhibitors.

Study design

This phase III, randomized, double‐blind study was conducted at 118 sites across 13 countries. The trial included a 6‐week screening period, a 100‐week treatment phase (placebo‐controlled weeks 0–24, active treatment weeks 24–100), and 12 weeks of safety follow‐up (weeks 100–112). Eligible patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous injections of guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks; guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 0 and 4 and then every 8 weeks; or placebo with crossover to guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks beginning at week 24. Patients had the option to self‐administer guselkumab in weeks 56–96. Central randomization and study blinding details through week 24 have been previously reported. After crossover to guselkumab, patients and investigators remained blinded with regard to dosing regimen. Patients could continue stable baseline use of selected nonbiologic DMARDs, oral glucocorticoids (≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent), and NSAIDs/other analgesics up to regionally approved doses.

The DISCOVER‐2 trial (identifier: NCT03158285) was conducted in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol was approved by each site's governing ethical body, and all patients provided written informed consent.

### Maintenance of response through up to 4 years of continuous guselkumab treatment of psoriasis in the VOYAGE 2 phase 3 study [^94994752]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Guselkumab effectively treats moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

Objectives

Results of continuous guselkumab treatment through 4 years from VOYAGE 2 are presented.

Methods

At baseline, 992 patients were randomized to receive guselkumab 100 mg every 8 weeks, placebo, or adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks. Placebo-treated patients crossed over to guselkumab at week 16. Weeks 28–76 incorporated randomized withdrawal, and all patients received open-label guselkumab through to week 204. Efficacy was analyzed using pre-specified treatment failure rules (patients were considered nonresponders after discontinuing due to lack of efficacy, worsening of psoriasis, or use of a prohibited treatment). There was no missing data imputation after treatment failure rules. Safety was analyzed through 4 years.

Results

The proportions of guselkumab-treated patients who achieved and maintained designated clinical responses at weeks 100 and 204, respectively, were as follows: at least a 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index from baseline (PASI 75): 94.1% and 92.3%; PASI 90: 79.1% and 79.7%; PASI 100: 48.4% and 51.0%; Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0/1: 83.1% and 81.9%; IGA score of 0: 52.7% and 52.7%; Dermatology Life Quality Index score of 0/1: 70.2% and 69.1%; Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary (PSSD) symptom score of 0: 35.7% and 39.7%; PSSD sign score of 0: 22.0% and 27.2%; ≥ 5% improvement in Short Form-36 (SF-36) physical component score: 48.8% and 45.0%; ≥ 5% improvement in SF-36 mental component score: 45.1% and 43.2%; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS)-anxiety score ≥ 8: 22.9% and 21.7%; and HADS-depression score ≥ 8: 16.6% and 21.0%. Similar findings were reported for the adalimumab→guselkumab group. No new safety signals were identified.

Conclusions

High efficacy levels were maintained from week 100 through to week 204 with continuous guselkumab treatment, across multiple endpoints, in VOYAGE 2. Guselkumab was well tolerated.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous induction and subcutaneous maintenance therapy with guselkumab for patients with Crohn's disease (GALAXI-2 and GALAXI-3): 48-week results from two phase 3, randomised, placebo and active comparator-controlled, double-blind, triple-dummy trials [^9ada09a0]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Despite the availability of biological therapies, suboptimal disease control remains a problem for patients with Crohn's disease. We report the results of the GALAXI-2 and GALAXI-3 studies, which aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous induction followed by subcutaneous maintenance therapy with guselkumab over 48 weeks in adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.

Methods

GALAXI-2 and GALAXI-3 were identically designed, phase 3, randomised, double-blind, triple-dummy, treat-through trials with active and placebo comparators. Adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (≥ 3 months duration) were enrolled at 257 sites across 40 countries. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (2:2:2:1) by use of a centralised computer-generated schedule to one of four treatment groups: (1) 200 mg intravenous guselkumab at weeks 0, 4, and 8, then 200 mg subcutaneous guselkumab every 4 weeks from week 12 to week 44 (guselkumab 200 mg group); (2) 200 mg intravenous guselkumab at weeks 0, 4, and 8, then 100 mg subcutaneous guselkumab every 8 weeks from week 16 to week 40 (guselkumab 100 mg group); (3) approximately 6 mg/kg intravenous ustekinumab at week 0, then 90 mg subcutaneous ustekinumab every 8 weeks from week 8 to week 40 (ustekinumab group); or (4) intravenous placebo every 4 weeks at weeks 0, 4, and 8 (placebo group). At week 12, participants without a clinical response to placebo received masked rescue therapy with ustekinumab; all other participants remained on their randomised regimen irrespective of response status at week 12. Participants, investigators, site personnel, and the funder were masked to study treatment until all participants had either completed the follow-up visit at week 48 or terminated study participation before week 48. Coprimary composite endpoints (comparing each guselkumab regimen with placebo) were (1) clinical response at week 12 and clinical remission at week 48 and (2) clinical response at week 12 and endoscopic response at week 48, measured in the primary analysis population of all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of the study agent and satisfied the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) eligibility criteria introduced with the third protocol amendment as per health authority request. Safety was assessed in participants who received at least one dose of study treatment (all-treated analysis population). These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03466411).

Findings

From Jan 8, 2020, to Oct 20, 2023, 1048 participants were randomly assigned, treated, and followed up until week 48, of whom 1021 participants were included in the primary analysis population: 508 (49·8%) in GALAXI-2 and 513 (50·2%) in GALAXI-3. Both guselkumab regimens were superior to placebo for the endpoint of clinical response at week 12 and clinical remission at week 48 in GALAXI-2, which was observed in 80 (55%) of 146 participants in the guselkumab 200 mg group, 70 (49%) of 143 in the guselkumab 100 mg group, and nine (12%) of 76 in the placebo group (adjusted treatment difference 43% [95% CI 32–54] in the guselkumab 200 mg group and 38% [27–49] in the guselkumab 100 mg group; p < 0·0001), and in GALAXI-3, observed in 72 (48%) of 150 participants in the guselkumab 200 mg group, 67 (47%) of 143 in the guselkumab 100 mg group, and nine (13%) of 72 in the placebo group (35% [24–46] and 34% [23–45]; p < 0·0001). Similarly, both guselkumab regimens were superior to placebo for the endpoint of clinical response at week 12 and endoscopic response at week 48 in GALAXI-2, observed in 56 (38%) participants in the guselkumab 200 mg group, 56 (39%) in the guselkumab 100 mg group, and four (5%) in the placebo group (33% [24–42] in the guselkumab 200 mg group and 34% [24–43] in the guselkumab 100 mg group; p < 0·0001), and in GALAXI-3, observed in 54 (36%) participants in the guselkumab 200 mg group, 48 (34%) in the guselkumab 100 mg group, and four (6%) in the placebo group (31% [21–40] and 28% [19–37]; p < 0·0001). Serious adverse events occurred in 21 (7%) participants in the guselkumab 200 mg group (incidence rate 9·7 events per 100 participant-years), 32 (11%) in the guselkumab 100 mg group (14·9 events per 100 participant-years), 35 (12%) in the ustekinumab group (18·4 events per 100 participant-years), and 23 (15%) in the placebo group (23·8 events per 100 participant-years). No deaths were reported.

Interpretation

Intravenous induction followed by subcutaneous maintenance therapy with guselkumab was efficacious in participants with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, showing superiority to placebo and ustekinumab at week 48 across multiple endpoints. Safety outcomes were favourable and consistent with the known profile of guselkumab in approved indications.

### Efficacy and safety of guselkumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study [^a5166ca4]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Guselkumab, a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin 23, has been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Psoriatic arthritis is a common comorbidity of psoriasis with an umet need for novel treatments. We assessed the efficacy and safety of guselkumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2a trial at 34 rheumatology and dermatology practices in Canada, Germany, Poland, Romania, Russia, Spain, and the USA. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older with active psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis affecting at least 3% of their body surface area, with three or more of 66 tender joints and three or more of 68 swollen joints, who had an inadequate response or intolerance to standard treatments. We randomly assigned patients (2:1) via a central interactive web-response system using computer-generated permuted blocks with a block size of six, stratified by previous anti-tumour necrosis factor-α use, to receive subcutaneous guselkumab 100 mg or placebo at week 0, week 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter for 24 weeks. Patients, investigators, and site staff were masked to treatment assignment until final database lock at week 56. At week 16, patients with less than 5% improvement in swollen and tender joint counts were eligible for early escape to ustekinumab. At week 24, the remaining placebo-treated patients crossed over to receive guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 24, 28, 36, and 44 and guselkumab-treated patients received a placebo injection at week 24, followed by guselkumab injections at weeks 28, 36, and 44. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with at least 20% improvement at week 24 in signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis according to American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20) in the modified intention-to-treat population (ie, all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment). Safety analyses included patients according to the study drug received. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02319759.

Findings

Between March 27, 2015, and Jan 17, 2017, we randomly assigned 149 patients to treatment: 100 to guselkumab and 49 to placebo. 17 (35%) of 49 patients in the placebo group and ten (10%) of 100 patients in the guselkumab group were eligible for early escape to ustekinumab at week 16. 29 (59%) of 49 patients in the placebo group crossed over and received guselkumab at week 24. Three (6%) of 49 patients in the placebo group, one (3%) of 29 patients who crossed over from placebo to guselkumab, and six (6%) of 100 patients in the guselkumab group discontinued study treatment before week 44. 58 (58%) of 100 patients in the guselkumab group and nine (18%) of 49 patients in the placebo group achieved an ACR20 response at week 24 (percentage difference 39·7% [95% CI 25·3–54·1]; p < 0·0001). Between week 0 and week 24, 36 (36%) of 100 guselkumab-treated patients and 16 (33%) of 49 placebo-treated patients had at least one adverse event. The most frequent adverse event was infection in both groups (16 [16%] of 100 patients in the guselkumab group vs ten [20%] of 49 patients in the placebo group). The prevalence of adverse events between week 0 and week 56 in guselkumab-treated patients (51 [40%] of 129) indicated no disproportional increase with longer guselkumab exposure. No deaths occurred.

Interpretation

Guselkumab, a novel anti-interleukin 23p19 antibody, significantly improved signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis and was well tolerated during 44 weeks of treatment. The results of this study support further development of guselkumab as a novel and comprehensive treatment in psoriatic arthritis.

### A phase 2 trial of guselkumab versus adalimumab for plaque psoriasis [^c33389d8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Little is known about the effect of specific anti-interleukin-23 therapy, as compared with established anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

In a 52-week, phase 2, dose-ranging, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-comparator trial, we compared guselkumab (CNTO 1959), an anti-interleukin-23 monoclonal antibody, with adalimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. A total of 293 patients were randomly assigned to receive guselkumab (5 mg at weeks 0 and 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter, 15 mg every 8 weeks, 50 mg at weeks 0 and 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter, 100 mg every 8 weeks, or 200 mg at weeks 0 and 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter) through week 40, placebo, or adalimumab (standard dosage for psoriasis). At week 16, patients in the placebo group crossed over to receive guselkumab at a dose of 100 mg every 8 weeks. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of 0 (indicating cleared psoriasis) or 1 (indicating minimal psoriasis) at week 16.

Results

At week 16, the proportion of patients with a PGA score of 0 or 1 was significantly higher in each guselkumab group than in the placebo group: 34% in the 5-mg group, 61% in the 15-mg group, 79% in the 50-mg group, 86% in the 100-mg group, and 83% in the 200-mg group, as compared with 7% in the placebo group (P ≤ 0.002 for all comparisons). Moreover, the proportion was significantly higher in the 50-mg, 100-mg, and 200-mg guselkumab groups than in the adalimumab group (58%) (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). At week 16, the proportion of patients with at least a 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index scores was significantly higher in each guselkumab group than in the placebo group (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). At week 40, the proportion of patients with a PGA score of 0 or 1 remained significantly higher in the 50-mg, 100-mg, and 200-mg guselkumab groups than in the adalimumab group (71%, 77%, and 81%, respectively, vs. 49%) (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Between week 0 and week 16, infections were observed in 20% of the patients in the guselkumab groups, 12% in the adalimumab group, and 14% in the placebo group.

Conclusions

The results of this phase 2 trial suggest that guselkumab may be an effective therapy for plaque psoriasis and that control of psoriasis can be achieved with specific anti-interleukin-23 therapy. (Funded by Janssen Research and Development; X-PLORE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01483599.).

### Long-term efficacy and safety of guselkumab, a monoclonal antibody specific to the p19 subunit of interleukin-23, through two Years: results from a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in biologic-naive patients with active psoriatic arthritis [^73091a2e]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Efficacy

Clinical efficacy through week 24 and week 52 has been previously detailed. Briefly, the primary end point was achieved, with 64% of patients in both guselkumab dosing groups achieving an ACR20 response at week 24 versus 33% of patients in the placebo group. At week 100, 76% of patients in the guselkumab every‐4‐weeks group and 74% in the every‐8‐weeks group had an ACR20 response, 56% and 55%, respectively, had an ACR50 response, and 35% and 36%, respectively, had an ACR70 response (all NRI accounting for ~12% of patients with missing data) (Figure 1). Trends in ACR response rates over time using observed data were consistent with those determined using NRI (Figure 1). When evaluating the time to ACR20 response, separation from placebo was observed at week 4, with continued increases in response rate through week 24 for patients in the guselkumab groups (Supplementary Figure 2). Among ACR components, 45–62% of guselkumab‐treated patients achieved ≥ 20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts, physician global assessment score, and CRP level by week 4 (Supplementary Figure 3). In the guselkumab groups, the proportions of patients achieving ≥ 20% improvement were maintained or continued to increase through week 100 for all ACR components. In addition, at a group level, response rates for increasing levels of response (ACR50 and ACR70) increased over time through the second year of treatment. This suggests that individual patients may be improving over time and achieving higher levels of improvement with continued guselkumab treatment.

AGA Crohn's disease pharmacologic management — comparative benefits in advanced-therapy–naive individuals: In advanced therapy-naive individuals, most therapies demonstrated clinically important benefit compared with certolizumab pegol or upadacitinib, while differences between other advanced therapies were either of very low certainty or appeared to have trivial-to-small benefit (< 5% risk difference). When analyzing 4 trials with treat-straight-through designs, guselkumab every 8 weeks demonstrated possibly trivial benefit in comparison with adalimumab, and guselkumab dosed at 200 mg every 4 weeks demonstrated possibly trivial benefit in comparison to 100 mg every 8 weeks dosing (each low certainty of evidence).

Patients were randomized to guselkumab 100 mg every 8 weeks, placebo with week 16 crossover to guselkumab, or adalimumab with week 52 crossover to guselkumab (VOYAGE 1) or week 28–76 randomized withdrawal/re-treatment (VOYAGE 2); all patients then received open-label guselkumab through week 252. These post hoc analyses evaluated the Investigator&rsquo; s Global Assessment of cleared/minimal (IGA 0/1) and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 responses from week 100–252 by baseline PASI (< 20/&ge;20), IGA (= 3/ = 4), body surface area (BSA; < 20%/&ge;20%), and prior psoriasis treatments. Analyses used observed data after applying treatment failure rules.

Results

At all assessment timepoints from weeks 100–252, response rates were similar by baseline PASI < 20 vs &ge;20 (IGA 0/1: 82.0%-85.4% vs 81.1%-81.4%; PASI 90: 78.6%-81.1% vs 81.4%-83.8%), IGA = 3 vs = 4 (IGA 0/1: 82.7%-85.4% vs 77.6%-79.0%; PASI 90: 79.1%-82.7% vs 79.7%-82.9%), BSA < 20% vs &ge;20% (IGA 0/1: 82.5%-86.2% vs 81.1%-82.6%; PASI 90: 80.4%-82.7% vs 79.1%-82.0%), prior phototherapy no vs yes (IGA 0/1: 81.7%-84.3% vs 81.5%-83.8%; PASI 90: 82.2%-84.0% vs 77.5%-81.1%), prior nonbiologic use no vs yes (IGA 0/1: 81.1%-84.5% vs 81.9%-84.1%; PASI 90: 80.9%-83.0% vs 79.0%-82.0%), and prior biologic use no vs yes (IGA 0/1: 83.2%-85.3% vs 75.3%-79.5%; PASI 90: 82.2%-83.8% vs 71.2%-76.3%).

Conclusions

Durable guselkumab efficacy was sustained through 5 years of treatment among patient subpopulations irrespective of baseline disease severity or prior treatment history. J Drugs Dermatol. 2025;24(2):196–202. doi:10.36849/JDD.8344.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Patients

As previously reported, 739 adults with PsA were enrolled and treated in DISCOVER‐2. Participants had active PsA (≥ 5 tender and ≥ 5 swollen joints; C‐reactive protein [CRP] ≥ 0.6 mg/dl) despite standard nonbiologic treatment (disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs], apremilast, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) and were naive for biologic agents and JAK inhibitors. Patients provided written informed consent.

Study design

This phase III, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 3‐arm study was conducted at 118 sites (in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Poland, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine, and the US). The trial design includes a 6‐week screening period (beginning July 13, 2017), a 100‐week treatment phase (placebo‐controlled from week 0 to week 24 and active treatment from week 24 to week 100), and 12 weeks of safety follow‐up. Data collected through week 52 (last visit September 10, 2019) are reported herein.

Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks; guselkumab 100 mg at week 0, week 4, and then every 8 weeks; or placebo every 4 weeks until starting guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks at week 24. Central randomization and blinding details were previously reported. Patients could continue baseline use of stable doses of selected nonbiologic DMARDs (limited to either methotrexate ≤ 25 mg/week, sulfasalazine ≤ 3 gm/day, hydroxychloroquine ≤ 400 mg/day, or leflunomide ≤ 20 mg/day), oral glucocorticoids ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent dose, and NSAIDs or other analgesics up to regionally approved doses.

DISCOVER‐2 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03158285) is being conducted according to Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol was approved by governing ethics bodies.

### Safety of guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated through 100 weeks: a pooled analysis from the randomized VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 studies [^fbee1c06]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term evaluation is required to confirm the safety profile of newer biologic agents.

Objectives

To report on pooled safety data from the ongoing VOYAGE 1 (NCT02207231) and VOYAGE 2 (NCT02207244) trials through 100 weeks of follow-up.

Methods

Patients were randomized to either guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 0 and 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter; placebo at weeks 0, 4, 12 followed by guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 16 and 20 and every 8 weeks thereafter; or adalimumab 80 mg at week 0, 40 mg at week 1, and 40 mg every 2 weeks thereafter. Patients who received adalimumab crossed over to guselkumab at week 52 (VOYAGE 1) and at/after week 28 based on clinical response (VOYAGE 2). Open-label extensions, in which all patients received guselkumab, started at week 52 (VOYAGE 1) and week 76 (VOYAGE 2). Rates of adverse events (AEs) per 100 patient-years (PYs) are presented through 100 weeks of follow-up.

Results

Through week 52, observed rates for guselkumab- and adalimumab-treated patients, respectively, were 262·45 per 100 PYs and 328·28 per 100 PYs for AEs, 6·20 per 100 PYs and 7·77 per 100 PYs for serious AEs (SAEs), 1·22 per 100 PYs and 1·79 per 100 PYs for serious infections (SIs), 0·28 per 100 PYs and 0·40 per 100 PYs for malignancies other than nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), 0·56 per 100 PYs and 0·40 per 100 PYs for NMSCs, and 0·47 per 100 PYs and 0·40 per 100 PYs for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Rates among patients treated with guselkumab through week 52 and week 100, respectively, were 262·45 per 100 PYs and 210·41 per 100 PYs for AEs, 6·20 and 6·29 per 100 PYs, for SAEs, 1·22 per 100 PYs and 1·06 per 100 PYs for SIs, 0·28 per 100 PYs and 0·38 per 100 PYs for malignancies, 0·56 per 100 PYs and 0·39 per 100 PYs for NMSCs, and 0·47 per 100 PYs and 0·38 per 100 PYs for MACEs. Among patients treated with adalimumab, rates of AEs, SAEs, SIs, malignancies, NMSCs, and MACEs showed some variability before and after crossover to guselkumab, although no new safety signals were noted after crossover.

Conclusions

The safety profile for guselkumab remains favourable through 100 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

### Real-world safety and effectiveness of guselkumab in patients with psoriasis: a post-marketing surveillance study through up to week 52 in Japan [^79a54c91]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Guselkumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin-23 and inhibits its downstream signaling. The safety profile of guselkumab and its superior efficacy over placebo and adalimumab for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis were reported in phase 3 studies conducted within and outside Japan. To assess the real-world safety and effectiveness of guselkumab in Japanese patients with psoriasis, we conducted a multicenter, single-arm, prospective, post-marketing surveillance study. Guselkumab was administered by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 100mg at weeks 0 and 4, then every following 8weeks. The patient observation period was 52weeks after the initial guselkumab dose or until treatment withdrawal. The safety analysis set consisted of 416 patients, including 310 patients with vulgaris (PsV); and the effectiveness analysis set consisted of 251 patients, including 236 patients with PsV or psoriatic arthritis (PsA). There were more men (71.3%, 221/310) than women among the PsV group. The median age among those with PsV was 58years, the median disease duration was 11.50years, 50.0% (155/310) had comorbidity, and 41.3% (128/310) had previously been treated with biologic agents. During the observation period, 8.4% (35/416) of patients experienced 49 adverse drug reactions, 2.9% (12/416) experienced 13 serious adverse drug reactions, and 3.4% (14/416) experienced 16 adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. In the effectiveness analysis set of 236 patients with PsV or PsA, the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75, 90, and 100 response rates at week 52 were 69.9%, 54.5%, and 32.5%, respectively. Bio-naïve patients consistently had higher PASI 75 and 90 response rates than bio-experienced patients. This post-marketing surveillance study demonstrated that guselkumab was well-tolerated and effective in a real-world setting in Japanese patients with psoriasis.

### Guselkumab: a new therapeutic option for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis [^b9eab255]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To summarize the evidence and pharmacologic profile of guselkumab for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC).

Data Sources

A PubMed search from inception to end of October 2024 using keywords guselkumab, UC, and interleukin (IL) was conducted. Additional information was obtained from abstracts and package insert.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Phase 2/3 studies plus applicable literature on guselkumab pharmacologic and clinical profile were included.

Data Synthesis

Approval was based on the QUASAR program, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 trial assessing guselkumab's efficacy and safety in adults with moderately to severely active UC who had inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapies, biologics (excluding IL antagonists), or Janus Kinase inhibitors. Results indicated that guselkumab led to higher clinical remission rates at week 12 and 44 compared to placebo, along with improvements in clinical response, symptomatic remission, endoscopic improvement, and histologic normalization. Common adverse effects included respiratory tract infections, injection site reactions, and arthralgia. Relevance to patient care and clinical practice in comparison to existing drugs:Guselkumab is the fourth IL antagonist approved for UC, and the first to target CD64 (cells involved in IL-23 production). With its dual mechanism, guselkumab is hypothesized to neutralize IL-23 at production and reduce inflammatory response. The QUASAR findings suggest guselkumab can provide durable clinical remission and histologic normalization, addressing a significant gap in UC treatment.

Conclusion

As the latest addition to UC therapies, guselkumab presents improved efficacy and dosing flexibility without introducing any new safety concerns compared to existing agents.

### Efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an anti-interleukin-23 monoclonal antibody, compared with adalimumab for the continuous treatment of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis: results from the phase III, double-blinded, placebo-and active comparator-controlled VOYAGE 1 trial [^175a432b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Guselkumab, an interleukin-23 blocker, was superior to adalimumab in treating moderate to severe psoriasis in a phase II trial.

Objectives

We sought to compare efficacy and safety of guselkumab with adalimumab and placebo in patients with psoriasis treated for 1 year.

Methods

Patients were randomized to guselkumab 100 mg (weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks; n = 329); placebo→guselkumab (weeks 0, 4, and 12 then guselkumab at weeks 16 and 20, then every 8 weeks; n = 174); or adalimumab (80 mg week 0, 40 mg week 1, then 40 mg every 2 weeks through week 47; n = 334). Physician-reported outcomes (Investigator Global Assessment, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI]), patient-reported outcomes (Dermatology Life Quality Index, Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary), and safety were evaluated through week 48.

Results

Guselkumab was superior (P < .001) to placebo at week 16 (85.1% vs 6.9% [Investigator Global Assessment score of 0/1 (cleared/minimal)] and 73.3% vs 2.9% [90% or greater improvement in PASI score from baseline (PASI 90)]). Guselkumab was also superior (P < .001) to adalimumab for Investigator Global Assessment 0/1 and PASI 90 at week 16 (85.1% vs 65.9% and 73.3% vs 49.7%), week 24 (84.2% vs 61.7% and 80.2% vs 53.0%), and week 48 (80.5% vs 55.4% and 76.3% vs 47.9%). Furthermore, guselkumab significantly improved patient-reported outcomes through week 48. Adverse event rates were comparable between treatments.

Limitations

Analyses were limited to 48 weeks.

Conclusions

Guselkumab demonstrated superior efficacy compared with adalimumab and was well tolerated in patients with psoriasis through 1 year.

### Comparative effectiveness of guselkumab in psoriatic arthritis: results from systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^bb7c002e]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Network meta-analysis results

In total, 21 distinct interventions were identified from the searches and subsequently included in analyses. No inconsistency was observed across networks (Supplementary Data S4, Supplementary Tables S7 to S15 and Supplementary Figs S1 to S9, available at Rheumatology online). Treatment rankings calculated from each NMA are reported and represent the rank-order of each treatment's point estimates vs placebo. Rankings do not denote relative treatment effects between active agents, and do not reflect confidence regarding true difference between treatments in pairwise comparisons. To characterize pairwise comparison conclusions from the NMA, key results are presented in-text with forest plots displaying pairwise comparisons of guselkumab Q8W vs other treatments according to median RRs or MDs and 95% CrIs. A 95% CrI represents the interval in which there is a 95% probability that the true treatment effect lies within said interval. Conclusions are summarized by describing treatments as 'better' or 'worse' than guselkumab if the pairwise 95% CrI excludes no difference (0 for MDs and 1 for RRs), wherein there is a > 95% probability that the two treatments are different, and as 'comparable' otherwise. The probability of guselkumab being better than a comparator is also shown for additional granularity in pairwise estimates. Supplementary Figs S18 to S26 (available at Rheumatology online) present full league tables and absolute probabilities/scores are presented in Supplementary Table S16, available at Rheumatology online.

Acr response

The network diagram of the evidence identified from the literature search and included in the NMA for ACR 20 response is shown in Fig. 2. Network diagrams for other outcomes are shown in Supplementary Figs S10 to S17, available at Rheumatology online. All studies reported ACR 20 and ACR 50 response, and all but one study reported ACR 70 response. Across all ACR outcomes, the baseline risk-adjusted model was a better fit for the data and was therefore used to inform results (Supplementary Table S6, available at Rheumatology online). 2

### Long-term efficacy and safety of guselkumab, a monoclonal antibody specific to the p19 subunit of interleukin-23, through two Years: results from a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in biologic-naive patients with active psoriatic arthritis [^7158a7e2]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Proportions of patients achieving American College of Rheumatology ≥ 20% improvement criteria (ACR20) (A and B), ACR50 (C and D), and ACR70 (E and F) responses through week 100. Response rates derived using nonresponder imputation (NRI) for missing data (see Patients and Methods) are shown in panels A, C, and E; response rates from weeks 24–100 derived from observed data are shown in panels B, D, and F. The dashed vertical line at week 24 indicates placebo (PBO) crossover to guselkumab (GUS) administered every 4 weeks (Q4W); gray shading indicates post hoc NRI data. Q8W = every 8 weeks.

Among patients with available radiographs (reading session 3) in the guselkumab every‐4‐weeks and every‐8‐weeks groups, respectively, the observed mean changes in total Sharp/van der Heijde score were 0.48 and 0.68 from week 0 to week 24 (smallest detectable change [SDC] 2.18), 0.57 and 0.31 from week 24 to week 52 (SDC 2.25), and 0.75 and 0.46 from week 52 to week 100 (SDC 2.28) (Table 1). In the placebo crossover group, mean changes in Sharp/van der Heijde scores from week 24 to week 52 (0.34) and from week 52 to week 100 (0.13) indicated that, on average, patients in this group had less radiographic progression after initiating guselkumab compared to the 24‐week placebo‐controlled period (1.12). Low rates of radiographic progression were seen from week 0 to week 100 across both guselkumab dosing regimens (Figure 2). Mean changes in total Sharp/van der Heijde scores indicated less radiographic progression from week 52 to week 100 than from week 0 to week 52 in all 3 groups (Supplementary Figure 4).

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: the GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^c3ea6c88]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Michielsens et alidentified 19 studies evaluating tapering of biologic therapy in psoriasis. One of these was the large-scale phase 3b OPTIMISE trial, which determined that the treatment interval for secukinumab (an IL-17 inhibitor) could not be extended from every 4 weeks to every 6 weeks without impacting efficacy and overall persistence. Meanwhile, a post hoc exploratory analysis of the phase 3 PSTELLAR clinical trial demonstrated that patients who achieved a Physician's Global Assessment score of 0 after 28 weeks of ustekinumab (an IL-12/23 inhibitor) treatment were able to maintain high levels of clinical response following dosing interval extension up to every 24 weeks. Similarly, in a clinical study of patients who achieved a PASI of 0 after the third administration of guselkumab, extension of the dosing interval did not result in loss of disease control. Together, these results suggest that early response to IL-23 inhibition may be a key determinant of effective disease control with dosing interval extension. However, given the molecular and pathomechanistic differences of approved IL-23 inhibitors, further studies are needed to address this possibility for other agents in this class. These data also suggest that maintenance of efficacy following dose de-escalation may vary across biologic treatment classes as a result of their differential therapeutic impact on pathogenic mechanisms. Specifically, IL-17–producing CD8-positive TRM cells are known to be responsible for the recurrence of psoriasis skin lesions in previously affected areas, and that IL-23, but not IL-17, has a key role in the differentiation, expansion, and survival of TRM cells. Reflective of our findings in the GUIDE trial, the ECLIPSE trialdemonstrated that guselkumab decreased the frequency of CD8-positive TRM cells in lesional skin at W24 relative to baseline, whereas treatment with the IL-17 inhibitor secukinumab did not. Therefore, the effect of guselkumab on TRM cells may explain how SRes can maintain high levels of response with an extended dosing interval. This may also account for the long-term maintenance of response typically observed with guselkumab treatment, even after withdrawal of guselkumab. Maintenance of response after withdrawal of guselkumab will be further evaluated in part 3 of the GUIDE trial.

### Guselkumab, an inhibitor of the IL-23p19 subunit, provides sustained improvement in signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis: 1 year results of a phase III randomised study of patients who were biologic-naïve or TNF α inhibitor-experienced [^fb4f7678]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of guselkumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-23p19 subunit, in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) through 1 year.

Methods

Adults who met ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis, with active disease (≥ 3 swollen and ≥ 3 tender joints; C reactive protein ≥ 0.3 mg/dL) despite standard treatment (31% previously received ≤ 2 tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi)), were randomised (1:1:1) to guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W); guselkumab 100 mg at Week0, Week4, then Q8W; or placebo with cross-over to guselkumab 100 mg Q4W at Week24 (PBO→Q4W) through Week48. Clinical efficacy through Week52 (employing non-responder imputation) and adverse events (AEs) through Week60 were evaluated.

Results

Of 381 treated patients, 90% completed the study. Numerical increases in the proportions of patients achieving ≥ 20% improvement in ACR criteria (ACR20) were observed post-Week24, reaching 73% (94/128) and 60% (76/127) for Q4W-randomised and Q8W-randomised patients, respectively, by Week52. Proportions of patients achieving ACR50/ACR70/skin responses and minimal/very low disease activity were maintained, as were improvements in physical function and health-related quality of life, through Week52 in guselkumab-randomised patients. Response to guselkumab was maintained in both TNFi-naïve and TNFi-experienced patients. Serious AEs and serious infections occurred in similar proportions of guselkumab Q4W-randomised (3% and 0%) and Q8W-randomised (6% and 2%) patients through Week60, with no new safety concerns versus observations through Week24. No guselkumab-treated patient and two patients receiving placebo died; no study participant developed opportunistic infection or inflammatory bowel disease.

Conclusion

Guselkumab provided sustained improvement across multiple clinical manifestations of PsA, maintaining a favourable benefit-risk profile, through 1 year regardless of prior TNFi exposure.

### 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for control of psoriasis… [^65413cfd]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

dvs W0 nonlesional skin, P <.
01. Question Is guselkumab dosing every 16 weeks noninferior to standard dosing every 8 weeks for maintenance of psoriasis disease control, defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index lower than 3 at week 68, in super responders. Findings This phase 3b clinical trial randomized 149 guselkumab SRes to guselkumab every 16 weeks dosing and 148 SRes to every 8 weeks dosing at W28 and demonstrated noninferiority of every 16 weeks dosing for maintenance of disease control, meeting the primary end point; clinical effects corresponded with immunologic changes. Interventions In GUIDE part 1, patients received guselkumab, 100 mg, at W0, W4, W12, and W20. Those achieving a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index of 0 at both W20 and W28 were termed super responders. In part 2, SRes were randomized to guselkumab, 100 mg, every 8 weeks or every 16 weeks; non-SRes continued open-label guselkumab every 8 weeks.

The primary end point of noninferiority for guselkumab every 16 weeks vs every 8 weeks in SRes was met, with 91. 9% of SRes receiving every 16 weeks and
92. 6% of SRes receiving dosing every 8 weeks having PASI lower than 3 at W68. Conclusions and Relevance Psoriasis treatment guidelines lack or provide inconsistent advice on patient stratification and treatment de-escalation. We present the first randomized trial providing evidence that, in patients with early complete skin clearance at 2 consecutive visits, extending the guselkumab dosing interval may control disease activity. Guselkumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the p19 subunit of interleukin -23, and is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

20 and W28; patients achieving this response are defined as super responders), and to assess the long-term impact of subsequent treatment de-escalation at the clinical and immunologic levels. 4 The primary objective was to demonstrate noninferiority of extended guselkumab dosing every 16 weeks vs every 8 weeks in SRes for maintenance of disease control at W68. In these patients, disease activity may be suppressed and modified in a manner that may allow for long-term disease control with an extended dosing interval. 4, 12–14 Herein, we present primary end point data, supported by other clinical and immunologic findings, to evaluate whether de-escalation of guselkumab treatment by dosing interval extension to every 16 weeks is noninferior to dosing every 8 weeks for maintaining clinical response in SRes. The overarching aim of the ongoing GUIDE clinical trial is to provide clinical and molecular insights into disease modification and durable remission.

In part 2, SRes were randomized to continue receiving guselkumab, 100 mg, every 8 weeks or every 16 weeks. Non-SRes continued open-label guselkumab every 8 weeks treatment. In part 3, SRes from groups 2A and 2B with PASI lower than 3 at W68 were withdrawn from guselkumab and followed to W220. SRes with PASI of 3 or higher at W68 or PASI higher than 5 at any visit during part 2 or 3 would receive retreatment with guselkumab at that visit, and then 8 and 16 weeks later. Key inclusion criteria include having moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis, defined by PASI higher than 10 or affected body surface area greater than 10%, and Dermatology Life Quality Index greater than 10 at baseline.

### Efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an anti-interleukin-23 monoclonal antibody, compared with adalimumab for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis with randomized withdrawal and retreatment: results from the phase III, double-blind, placebo-and active comparator-controlled VOYAGE 2 trial [^0dce86ac]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Phase II data suggested that guselkumab, an anti-interleukin-23 monoclonal antibody, was efficacious in psoriasis.

Objective

We sought to assess efficacy and safety of guselkumab in moderate to severe psoriasis versus placebo and adalimumab, including interrupted treatment and switching adalimumab nonresponders to guselkumab.

Methods

Patients were randomized to guselkumab 100 mg (weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks; n = 496); placebo→guselkumab (weeks 0, 4, and 12 then guselkumab at weeks 16 and 20; n = 248); or adalimumab (80 mg week 0, then 40 mg week 1, and every 2 weeks through week 23; n = 248). At week 28, guselkumab 90% or greater improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from baseline (PASI 90) responders were rerandomized to guselkumab or placebo with guselkumab after loss of response. Placebo→guselkumab responders and adalimumab responders received placebo, then guselkumab after loss of response. Nonresponders received guselkumab.

Results

At week 16, more patients receiving guselkumab achieved an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score 0/1 (cleared/minimal) (84.1% vs 8.5%) and PASI 90 (70.0% vs 2.4%) versus placebo (coprimary end points). Guselkumab was superior to adalimumab at week 16 (IGA score 0/1, 75% or greater improvement in PASI score from baseline, and PASI 90) and week 24 (IGA score 0/1 and 0, PASI 90, 100% improvement in PASI score from baseline) (P < .001). From weeks 28 to 48, better persistence of response was observed in guselkumab maintenance versus withdrawal groups (P < .001). Of adalimumab nonresponders who switched to guselkumab, 66.1% achieved PASI 90 at week 48. Guselkumab improved patient-reported outcomes. Adverse events were comparable among groups.

Limitations

One-year follow-up limits retreatment data.

Conclusions

Guselkumab is a highly effective, well-tolerated, maintenance therapy, including in adalimumab nonresponders.

### Guselkumab, an inhibitor of the IL-23p19 subunit, provides sustained improvement in signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis: 1 year results of a phase III randomised study of patients who were biologic-naïve or TNF α inhibitor-experienced [^80b2d7b7]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of guselkumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-23p19 subunit, in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) through 1year.

Methods

Adults who met ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis, with active disease (≥ 3 swollen and ≥ 3 tender joints; C reactive protein ≥ 0.3mg/dL) despite standard treatment (31% previously received ≤ 2 tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi)), were randomised (1:1:1) to guselkumab 100mg every 4 weeks (Q4W); guselkumab 100mg at Week0, Week4, then Q8W; or placebo with cross-over to guselkumab 100mg Q4W at Week24 (PBO→Q4W) through Week48. Clinical efficacy through Week52 (employing non-responder imputation) and adverse events (AEs) through Week60 were evaluated.

Results

Of 381 treated patients, 90% completed the study. Numerical increases in the proportions of patients achieving ≥ 20% improvement in ACR criteria (ACR20) were observed post-Week24, reaching 73% (94/128) and 60% (76/127) for Q4W-randomised and Q8W-randomised patients, respectively, by Week52. Proportions of patients achieving ACR50/ACR70/skin responses and minimal/very low disease activity were maintained, as were improvements in physical function and health-related quality of life, through Week52 in guselkumab-randomised patients. Response to guselkumab was maintained in both TNFi-naïve and TNFi-experienced patients. Serious AEs and serious infections occurred in similar proportions of guselkumab Q4W-randomised (3% and 0%) and Q8W-randomised (6% and 2%) patients through Week60, with no new safety concerns versus observations through Week24. No guselkumab-treated patient and two patients receiving placebo died; no study participant developed opportunistic infection or inflammatory bowel disease.

Conclusion

Guselkumab provided sustained improvement across multiple clinical manifestations of PsA, maintaining a favourable benefit-risk profile, through 1year regardless of prior TNFi exposure.

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: the GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^e990f050]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

SRes maintained high rates of PASI of 1 or lower and PASI of 0 response over time and at W68, with higher response rates with every 8 weeks vs every 16 weeks dosing (PASI ≤ 1 at W68: 133/148 every 8 weeks [89.9%], and 118/149 patients [79.2%] dosed every 16 weeks; P = 0.01; PASI = 0 at W68: 120/148 every 8 weeks [81.1%], and 103/149 patients [69.1%] dosed every 16 weeks; P = 0.02; Figure 1, C-F; eTable 2 in Supplement 3). Mean PASI and affected BSA (%) improved rapidly from baseline and remained low to W68 with both dosing intervals in SRes (Figure 1 G; eFigure 3, eTable 3 in Supplement 3). SRes also achieved high rates of PASI 75 (137/148 dosed every 8 weeks [92.6%], and 140/149 patients [94.0%] dosed every 16 weeks; P = 0.63) and PASI 90 (136/148 dosed every 8 weeks [91.9%], and 128/149 patients [85.9%] dosed every 16 weeks; P = 0.10) responses at W68, with no statistically significant differences observed between every 8 weeks and 16 week dosing intervals (eFigure 4, eTable 2 in Supplement 3). Similarities in PASI responses between dosing groups were also observed using individual patient data (eFigure 5 in Supplement 3).

### Resolution of enthesitis by guselkumab and relationships to disease burden: 1-year results of two phase 3 psoriatic arthritis studies [^4d81923d]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To further characterize the effect of guselkumab, a selective IL-23p19-subunit inhibitor approved for PsA, on enthesitis and assess relationships between enthesitis resolution and patient status/outcomes.

Methods

Adults with active PsA despite standard therapies in the phase 3 DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2 studies were randomized 1:1:1 to guselkumab 100mg every 4weeks (Q4W); guselkumab 100mg at week 0, week 4, Q8W; or placebo through week 20 followed by guselkumab 100mg Q4W. Independent assessors evaluated enthesitis using the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI; total score 0–6). Enthesitis findings through week 24 were pre-specified to be pooled across studies; post hoc and week 52 analyses also employed pooled data.

Results

Among 1118 randomized, treated patients in DISCOVER-1 and 2 who had ≥ 1 LEI site evaluated, 65% had enthesitis at baseline. These patients exhibited numerically more swollen and tender joints, systemic inflammation and impaired physical function than patients without enthesitis. Guselkumab Q4W and Q8W were superior to placebo in resolving pre-existing enthesitis at week 24 (45 and 50% vs 29%; both adjusted P = 0.0301). Enthesitis resolution rates continued to rise; 58% of guselkumab-randomized patients achieved resolution at week 52, including patients with mild (LEI = 1; 70–75%), moderate (LEI = 2; 69–73%) or severe (LEI = 3–6; 42–44%) enthesitis at baseline. Among guselkumab-randomized patients with resolved enthesitis at week 24, 42% achieved minimal disease activity at week 52, vs 17% of patients with unresolved enthesitis.

Conclusion

Guselkumab resulted in higher proportions of PsA patients with resolved enthesitis by week 24, with maintenance of resolution rates through 1year. As enthesitis confers greater disease burden, sustained resolution could portend better patient outcomes.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^e7e09be7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Guselkumab induction and maintenance in Crohn's disease — The GALAXI-1 phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled study randomized patients 1:1:1:1 to intravenous guselkumab 200 mg, 600 mg, or 1200 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 8, intravenous ustekinumab approximately 6 mg/kg at week 0 and 90 mg subcutaneously at week 8, or placebo. At week 12, guselkumab-treated groups achieved remission defined by Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) < 150 in 57.4%, 55.6%, and 45.9% versus 16.4% with placebo (all, P < 0.05). A subsequent phase 2b maintenance study ran from week 12 to week 48 with dose reductions to 100 mg every 8 weeks or 200 mg every 4 weeks depending on induction regimen. Two phase 3 trials (GALAXI-2 and GALAXI-3) were two 48-week double-blind placebo-controlled, triple-dummy trials with arms including guselkumab 200 mg at weeks 0, 4 and 8 then guselkumab 100 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks starting at week 16 and ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg IV then ustekinumab 90 mg sc every 8 weeks; the primary analysis evaluated 508 patients in GALAXI 2 and 513 patients in GALAXI 3, and both trials demonstrated that guselkumab was statistically superior to ustekinumab for multiple endpoints at week 48 including endoscopic response, endoscopic remission, clinical remission and deep remission.

### Guselkumab (Tremfya) [^62c53e0b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Guselkumab is a human monoclonal IgG1λ antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin 23 (IL-23) and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. IL-23 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Guselkumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In evaluated adult subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, guselkumab reduced serum levels of IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 relative to pre-treatment levels based on exploratory analyses of the pharmacodynamic markers.

In evaluated adult subjects with active psoriatic arthritis, serum levels of acute phase proteins C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A and IL-6, and Th17 effector cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 were elevated at baseline. Serum levels of these proteins measured at Week 4 and Week 24 were decreased compared to baseline following guselkumab treatment at Week 0, Week 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter.

The relationship between these pharmacodynamic markers and the mechanism(s) by which guselkumab exerts its clinical effects is unknown.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Guselkumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics in healthy adult subjects and adult subjects with plaque psoriasis following subcutaneous injections. In subjects with plaque psoriasis, following subcutaneous administration of 100 mg of TREMFYA at Weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter, mean steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentration was approximately 1.2 mcg/mL.

The pharmacokinetics of guselkumab in adult subjects with psoriatic arthritis was similar to that in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis. Following subcutaneous administration of 100 mg of TREMFYA at Weeks 0, 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter, mean steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentration was approximately 1.2 mcg/mL.

Following subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 100 mg TREMFYA every 8 weeks or 200 mg TREMFYA every 4 weeks in adult subjects with ulcerative colitis, mean steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentrations were approximately 1.4 mcg/mL and 10.7 mcg/mL, respectively.

Following subcutaneous maintenance dosing of 100 mg TREMFYA every 8 weeks, or 200 mg TREMFYA every 4 weeks, in adult subjects with Crohn's disease mean steady-state trough serum guselkumab concentrations were approximately 1.2 mcg/mL and 10.1 mcg/mL, respectively.

### Guselkumab versus secukinumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis (ECLIPSE): results from a phase 3, randomised controlled trial [^04d15833]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Antibodies targeting interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-17A effectively treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis. ECLIPSE is the first comparator study of an IL-23p19 inhibitor, guselkumab, versus an IL-17A inhibitor, secukinumab. The primary objective of this study was to show superiority of clinical response at week 48 for guselkumab versus secukinumab.

Methods

In this phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, comparator-controlled trial at 142 outpatient clinical sites in nine countries (Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain, and the USA), eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis, and were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Eligible patients were randomly assigned with permuted block randomisation using an interactive web response system to receive either guselkumab (100 mg at weeks 0 and 4 then every 8 weeks) or secukinumab (300 mg at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then every 4 weeks). The primary endpoint, the proportion of patients in the intention-to-treat population who achieved 90% reduction or more from baseline of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90 response) at week 48, and major secondary endpoints (the proportions of patients in the guselkumab group and in the secukinumab group who achieved a PASI 75 response at both weeks 12 and 48, a PASI 90 response at week 12, a PASI 75 response at week 12, a PASI 100 response at week 48, an Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] score of 0 [cleared] at week 48, and an IGA score of 0 or 1 [minimal] at week 48) were to be tested in a fixed sequence to control type I error rate. Safety was evaluated in patients who received one or more doses of study drug from week 0 to 56. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03090100.

Findings

This study was done between April 27, 2017, and Sept 20, 2018. 1048 eligible patients were enrolled and, of these, 534 were assigned to receive guselkumab and 514 to receive secukinumab. The proportion of patients with a PASI 90 response at week 48 was greater in the guselkumab group (451 [84%]) than in the secukinumab group (360 [70%]; p < 0·0001). Although non-inferiority (margin of 10 percentage points) was established for the first major secondary endpoint (452 [85%] of patients in the guselkumab group vs 412 [80%] of patients in the secukinumab group achieving a PASI 75 response at both weeks 12 and 48), superiority was not established (p = 0·0616). Consequently, formal statistical testing was not done for subsequent major secondary endpoints. Proportions of patients with adverse events, infections, and serious adverse events were similar between the two treatments and, in general, safety findings were consistent with registrational trial observations.

Interpretation

Guselkumab showed superior long-term efficacy based on PASI 90 at week 48 when compared with secukinumab for treating moderate-to-severe psoriasis. This finding could assist health-care providers in their decision making process when selecting a biologic for treating moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

### Drug survival, effectiveness and safety of guselkumab for moderate-to-severe psoriasis for up to 4 years [^92726f7f]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Guselkumab has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of psoriasis in numerous randomized clinical trials and real-life studies. Real-life data on treatment up to 4years are lacking.

Objectives

The present study aims to estimate the drug survival, effectiveness and safety of guselkumab over a period of 208 weeks.

Methods

We included all consecutive patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis receiving at least one dose of guselkumab. Effectiveness was evaluated as achieving 100% or ≥ 90% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 100 or PASI 90) and absolute PASI ≤ 3. Drug survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meyer curves.

Results

In total, 202 patients were studied. Their mean PASI decreased from 10.9 (SD 5.76) at baseline to 0.48 at week 208. Rates of PASI 100 response improved over time: the outcome was achieved in 30.0% and 65% of patients at weeks 16 and 208, respectively. For PASI 90 and PASI ≤ 3 we found similar trends. After 208 weeks of treatment, the estimated rate of drug survival was 68.5% in observed cases. Being super responders (SRs) according to our definition (P = 0.005) and the GUIDE definition (P < 0.001) reduced the risk of drug interruption, as did cardiovascular comorbidities. In our population, none of the baseline characteristics showed a clear impact on the effectiveness of guselkumab. Considering both SR definitions, in our cohort, being an SR was associated with a better response in the long term when considering PASI 100 and 90 in both linear and multivariate analyses.

Conclusions

Our study confirms the good effectiveness and favourable safety profile of guselkumab in a real-world setting up to 4years.

### SPECTREM phase 3b clinical trial results through week 16: guselkumab efficacy and safety for the treatment of low body surface area, moderate psoriasis with high-impact site involvement [^0e8ed1f5]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with psoriasis affecting a low percentage of their body surface area (BSA) are underrepresented in clinical studies and may face substantial disease burden if high-impact sites are affected.

Objectives

SPECTREM is a Phase 3b, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating guselkumab efficacy and safety in participants with low BSA (2%-15%), moderate (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] = 3) plaque psoriasis involving ≥ 1 high-impact site (scalp, face, genitals, intertriginous areas).

Methods

Eligible participants were randomized 2:1 to receive guselkumab 100 mg or placebo at Week 0 and Week 4, then every 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants achieving IGA 0/1 (cleared/minimal) at Week 16. Major secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants achieving ≥ 90% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90), IGA 0, and PASI 100; mean percent improvements from baseline to Week 16 in BSA and PASI; and proportions of participants achieving site-specific IGA or Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1 among those with scalp, facial, genital, or intertriginous site-specific IGA/PGA ≥ 3 at baseline.

Results

Among the 338 (guselkumab, n = 225; placebo, n = 113) randomized participants, mean (SD) baseline BSA was 7.6% (3.7) and PASI was 9.0 (3.8). At Week 16, all primary and major secondary endpoints were met, with guselkumab demonstrating superiority versus placebo (all p < 0.001) in the proportions of participants achieving IGA 0/1 (74.2% vs 12.4%), IGA 0 (40.4% vs 3.5%), PASI 90 (52.9% vs 6.2%), and PASI 100 (32.4% vs 2.7%), and mean percent improvement from baseline in BSA (80.6% vs 6.1%) and PASI (82.6% vs 13.7%). Site-specific IGA/PGA 0/1 response rates for guselkumab versus placebo were: scalp, 75.0% (114/152) versus 14.5% (11/76); face, 87.8% (79/90) versus 28.6% (12/42); genital, 78.0% (64/82) versus 37.5% (15/40); and intertriginous, 86.5% (96/111) versus 28.8% (15/52). In the guselkumab and placebo groups, respectively, 37.8% and 39.8% experienced ≥ 1 adverse event; no new safety signals were identified.

Conclusions

Through Week 16, guselkumab was effective and well tolerated in participants with low BSA, moderate plaque psoriasis with involvement of high-impact sites. Statistically significant improvements across multiple clearance measures, irrespective of baseline BSA, support the effectiveness of guselkumab across a broad range of patients.

### Real-world safety and effectiveness of guselkumab in patients with psoriasis: a post-marketing surveillance study through up to week 52 in Japan [^ea946c20]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design

We conducted a multicenter, single‐arm, prospective post‐marketing, surveillance study to assess the real‐world safety and effectiveness of guselkumab in Japanese patients with psoriasis. The observation period for each patient was 52 weeks after the initial guselkumab injection or until treatment withdrawal. Guselkumab was administered by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 100 mg at weeks 0 and 4, then every following 8 weeks. The protocol and ethical considerations of the study were approved by the internal review board of each participating institution. The study was conducted in accordance with Good Post‐marketing Study Practice ([GPSP] the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare Ordinance No. 171. dated December 20, 2004), which does not require patient consent for post‐marketing, surveillance studies.

2.2 Patients

Japanese patients with PsV, PsA, GPP, or EP were registered within 14 days of their initial guselkumab injection if they had started guselkumab for the first time between May 2018 and October 2020 at participating institutions.

### Effectiveness and safety of guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in real-world practice in Korea: a prospective, multicenter, observational, postmarketing surveillance study [^d2af3ad3]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Real-world evidence for guselkumab in Korea is needed to establish drug safety and effectiveness under real-world practice in this population. This study assessed the effectiveness, safety, and drug survival of guselkumab in Korean patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in a real-world clinical setting. In this prospective, non-interventional observational study conducted at 44 clinical centers in South Korea, adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who would receive guselkumab per the product label were enrolled. Disease assessment was performed at visits 1 (baseline, week 0), 2 (approximately week 4), and 3–7 (approximately every 8weeks after week 4, weeks 12–44). Between February 25, 2019 and March 25, 2022, 707 patients were enrolled and 562 (79.5%) had completed the 56-week observation period. The proportions of patients with an absolute Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of ≤ 3, ≤ 2, or ≤ 1 reached maximums of 96.0%, 86.7%, and 59.0%, respectively, at visit 7. A significantly greater proportion of biologic-naïve (vs. biologic-experienced) patients achieved absolute PASI ≤ 3 by visits 5–7 (p = 0.001 at visit 7) and absolute PASI ≤ 2 by visits 6–7 (p = 0.0014 at visit 7). Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores decreased over time, with 64.1% of patients achieving DLQI 0/1 by visit 7; results were similar regardless of prior biologic therapy. The estimated drug-survival rate at 1year was 92.7%. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 22.5% of patients, with an incidence rate of 42.1 per 100 patient years (PY); 14 serious AEs occurred in 13 (1.8%) patients, with an incidence rate (95% confidence interval) of 2.4 (1.2–3.7) per 100 PY. Guselkumab administered under approved label conditions was effective and well-tolerated in Korean patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in a real-world clinical setting.

Demographic and disease characteristics (disease history, medical history, previous therapies) were recorded at visit 1 (baseline, week 0). Data for the following parameters were collected at visits 1 (baseline, week 0), 2 (approximately week 4), and 3–7 (approximately every 8 weeks after week 4, weeks 12–44): Guselkumab administration status; concomitant medications; effectiveness parameters (Psoriasis Areas and Severity Index [PASI], BSA affected, and Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA]); patient‐completed patient‐reported outcome (PRO) instruments (administered as available at each clinical practice; Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI] and Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire [MSQ]). Data for parameters, excluding guselkumab administration status, were also collected at treatment discontinuation. Safety was monitored from the first dose of guselkumab to 12 weeks after the last dose (i.e. week 56), or until loss to follow‐up, withdrawal of consent, or death, whichever occurred first.

Since this was a real‐world study, the frequency and timing of treatment administration and patient visits were in accordance with routine clinical practice, and as such, may not have occurred precisely every 4 or 8 weeks per label instructions. Treatment was generally administered within ± 2 weeks of the label‐defined treatment intervals by healthcare professionals at hospitals; hence, the second injection was administered 4 ± 2 weeks (visit 2) after visit 1 and then 8 ± 2 weeks after each previous treatment (visits 3–7) over the duration of the present study.

NMA results

Trials and treatments included in each NMA are presented in Supplementary Table S5, available at Rheumatology online. As the IL-17 receptor A inhibitor brodalumab was not approved for PsA, nor was it undergoing FDA or EMA review at the time of the search (February 2021), it was excluded as a comparator. At the time of drafting this manuscript, upadacitinib 30 mg was not licenced by the EMA and only the 15 mg dose was under review by the FDA; thus, only the 15 mg dose was included in the network. Risankizumab was also under EMA and FDA review but was included in the analysis as it was a comparator of interest. As of April 2022, upadacitinib 30 mg is not a licenced FDA dose, while risankizumab is approved for PsA by both agencies. Thus, the network reflects all treatments and doses approved by the FDA or EMA. No inconsistency was observed across networks (Supplementary Tables S6–S8 and Figs S1–S3, available at Rheumatology online). Of the 33 trials included, ACR was reported in 33 (Fig. 2), vdH-S scores in 11 (Supplementary Fig. S4, available at Rheumatology online), PASI in 30 (Supplementary Fig. S5, available at Rheumatology online) and SAEs in 31 (Supplementary Fig. S6, available at Rheumatology online).

### Five-year maintenance of clinical response and health-related quality of life improvements in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated with guselkumab: results from VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 [^523dc76f]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Psoriasis is a chronic disease requiring long-term therapy.

Objectives

Physician- and patient-reported outcomes were evaluated through week 252 in VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2.

Methods

In total, 1829 patients were randomized at baseline to receive guselkumab 100 mg every 8 weeks, placebo or adalimumab. Patients receiving placebo crossed over to guselkumab at week 16. Patients receiving adalimumab crossed over to guselkumab at week 52 in VOYAGE 1, and randomized withdrawal and retreatment occurred at weeks 28–76 in VOYAGE 2; all patients then received open-label guselkumab through week 252. Efficacy and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) endpoints were analysed through week 252. Safety was monitored through week 264.

Results

The proportions of patients in the guselkumab group who achieved clinical responses at week 252 in VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2, respectively, were 84·1% and 82·0% [≥ 90% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)]; 82·4% and 85·0% [Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0 or 1]; 52·7% and 53·0% (100% improvement in PASI) and 54·7% and 55·5% (IGA 0). HRQoL endpoints were achieved as follows: 72·7% and 71·1% of patients (Dermatology Life Quality Index 0 or 1: no effect on patient's life); 42·4% and 42·0% [Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary (PSSD) symptom score = 0] and 33·0% and 31·0% (PSSD sign score = 0). As measured in VOYAGE 2 only, approximately 45% of patients achieved ≥ 5-point reduction in Short Form-36 physical and mental component scores, and 80% reported no anxiety or depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores < 8). Similar findings were reported for adalimumab crossovers. These effects were maintained from week 52 in VOYAGE 1 and week 100 in VOYAGE 2. No new safety signals were identified.

Conclusions

Guselkumab maintains high levels of clinical response and improvement in patient-reported outcomes through 5 years in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

### Comparative effectiveness of guselkumab in psoriatic arthritis: results from systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^82150e25]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a clinically heterogeneous, progressive and chronic inflammatory condition that can cause irreversible joint damage and impact patient quality of life. Treatment guideline recommendations for patients with active PsA depend on a variety of factors, including the PsA domain(s) involved (e.g. peripheral arthritis, axial disease, enthesitis, dactylitis, skin psoriasis, nail psoriasis), disease severity and line of therapy. Current treatment options for PsA include non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; i.e. methotrexate, sulfasalazine, ciclosporin and leflunomide), biologic therapies (i.e. infliximab, golimumab, adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab pegol, abatacept, ustekinumab, secukinumab and ixekizumab) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (i.e. apremilast and tofacitinib). These biologic and targeted therapies are generally indicated for use alongside optional concomitant DMARD treatment.

Guselkumab is a monoclonal antibody currently approved for the treatment of psoriasis and also for psoriatic arthritis in some regions. Guselkumab offers a novel mechanism of action. It binds selectively to the p19 subunit of interleukin (IL)-23 with high specificity and affinity. Interleukin-23, a regulatory cytokine, affects the differentiation, expansion, and survival of T-cell subsets and innate immune cell subsets, which represent sources of effector cytokines that drive inflammatory disease. Guselkumab targets and inhibits the p19 subunit of IL-23, resulting in the disruption of IL-23-mediated signalling, activation and cytokine cascades, leading to clinical improvement in symptoms of psoriasis and PsA. The efficacy and safety of guselkumab 100 mg every 8 weeks (Q8W) and 100 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) was demonstrated in the placebo-controlled DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2 phase 3 trials, the first to evaluate the efficacy of a selective IL-23p19 inhibitor in PsA.

Study design

This phase 3, single‐arm, open‐label, multicenter study was conducted at 23 sites in Japan from 28 January 2015 to 12 August 2016. The study consisted of a 6‐week screening phase, a 52‐week open‐label treatment phase and a long‐term extension phase. Guselkumab 50 mg was administrated s.c. at weeks 0, 4 and every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter until week 52 (Fig. 1 a). Dose escalation was permitted for patients who were assessed as having a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) 19 rating of "no change" or "worsened" at any scheduled study visit beginning at week 20, as well as for patients assessed as CGI "minimally improved" depending on investigator discretion. Patients undergoing dose escalation received guselkumab 100 mg and continued to receive the 100 mg q8w dose regimen until the study end. Concomitant topical therapies were permitted throughout the study and use of methotrexate or retinoids was also permitted if initiated 1 week before the first administration of study agent, preferably at unchanged dose throughout the study. Agents targeting TNF‐α, IL‐12/23 or IL‐23, IL‐17, α4‐integrin antagonists or any other biologic agents, systemic steroids and other conventional systemic therapies (except methotrexate or retinoids) were prohibited.

### Guselkumab provides sustained domain-specific and comprehensive efficacy using composite indices in patients with active psoriatic arthritis [^1cb14ad8]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

At week 24, greater proportions of guselkumab- than placebo-treated patients achieved near or complete remission when assessed with DAPSA (≤ 4) and cDAPSA (≤ 4) remission, PASDAS VLDA (≤ 1.9), and VLDA (seven of seven components) composite indices (Fig. 2). Guselkumab-treated patients separated from the placebo group as early as week 12 for DAPSA and cDAPSA remission, at week 16 for PASDAS VLDA, and at week 24 for VLDA.

Fig. 2
Achievement of DAPSA remission, cDAPSA remission, PASDAS VLDA, and VLDA

Treatment group comparisons through week 24 were not adjusted for multiplicity of testing. After week 24 and through week 52, patients with missing data were considered non-responders. ✱ p < 0.05, + P < 0.01, ‡ P < 0.001, vs PBO (nominal). cDAPSA: clinical DAPSA (excludes CRP); DAPSA: Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis; GUS: guselkumab; PASDAS: Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score; PBO: placebo; Q4W: every 4 weeks; Q8W: every 8 weeks; VLDA: very low disease activity.

In the pooled results, no notable differences in response rates were observed between the guselkumab Q4W and Q8W dosing regimens. Response trends were generally consistent in the individual DISCOVER-1 (biologic-naïve and TNFi-experienced patients) and DISCOVER-2 (biologic-naïve patients) studies (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2, available at Rheumatology online). However, response rates were higher in DISCOVER-1 than in DISCOVER-2 at week 24 for both guselkumab dosing regimens (Q4W and Q8W) for DAPSA LDA, cDAPSA LDA, and PASDAS LDA, and for the guselkumab Q4W regimen for DAPSA remission, cDAPSA remission, PASDAS VLDA, and VLDA.

### Comparative effectiveness of guselkumab in psoriatic arthritis: results from systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^bd5b2af6]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

All but two included studies reported PASI 75 response, most reported PASI 90 response, and few reported PASI 100 response. The baseline risk-adjusted model was used for all PASI outcomes (Supplementary Table S6, available at Rheumatology online). Guselkumab Q8W ranked second in the network and had a better PASI 90 response than many other treatments, including TNFs and lower doses of secukinumab, as demonstrated by guselkumab ranking higher and lack of overlap in 95% CrI (Fig. 5). Similar results were observed for PASI 75 response (Supplementary Fig. S22, available at Rheumatology online). For PASI 100, low baseline event rates led to uncertainty in pairwise estimates, with guselkumab Q8W ranking fourth and being comparable to other active treatments, as demonstrated by overlap in 95% CrI (Supplementary Fig. S24, available at Rheumatology online). Comparisons vs guselkumab Q4W were similar to those vs Q8W for all PASI responses (Supplementary Figs S22 to S24, available at Rheumatology online). 5

Adverse event outcomes

All but two studies reported AEs while all but one reported SAEs. The baseline risk-adjusted model provided the best fit for both safety outcomes (Supplementary Table S6, available at Rheumatology online). For AEs, guselkumab Q8W ranked highly in the network (Supplementary Fig. S25, available at Rheumatology online) but significant uncertainty in pairwise estimates was observed as demonstrated by overlap in 95% CrI vs most other agents (Fig. 6). Results were similar in analyses of SAEs, where once again guselkumab Q8W ranked highly in the network, but low baseline event rates caused significant uncertainty in pairwise point estimates as demonstrated by overlap in 95% CrI vs most other agents (Supplementary Fig. S26, available at Rheumatology online). Similar results were observed for guselkumab Q4W for both AEs and SAEs (Supplementary Figs S25 and S26, available at Rheumatology online). 6

### Guselkumab for the treatment of Crohn's disease: induction results from the phase 2 GALAXI-1 study [^d42de8c0]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Guselkumab, a selective p19 interleukin-23 antagonist, is approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of guselkumab in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease with inadequate response or intolerance to conventional or biologic therapy.

Methods

GALAXI-1, a phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, randomized patients 1:1:1:1:1 to intravenous guselkumab 200 mg, 600 mg, or 1200 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 8; intravenous ustekinumab approximately 6 mg/kg at week 0 and 90 mg subcutaneously at week 8; or placebo. Change from baseline in Crohn's Disease Activity Index score (primary end point), clinical remission, clinical response, Patient Reported Outcomes-2 remission, clinical-biomarker response, endoscopic response (major secondary end points), and safety in guselkumab-treated patients vs placebo were evaluated through week 12. Ustekinumab was a reference arm.

Results

Of 309 patients evaluated, approximately 50% had disease refractory to prior biologic therapy. At week 12, significantly greater reductions in Crohn's Disease Activity Index from baseline (least squares means: 200 mg: -160.4, 600 mg: -138.9, and 1200 mg: -144.9 vs placebo: -36.2; all, P < .05) and significantly greater proportions of patients achieved clinical remission in each guselkumab group vs placebo (Crohn's Disease Activity Index < 150; 57.4%, 55.6%, and 45.9% vs 16.4%; all, P < .05). Greater proportions of patients receiving guselkumab achieved clinical response, Patient Reported Outcomes-2 remission, clinical-biomarker response, and endoscopic response at week 12 vs placebo. Efficacy of ustekinumab vs placebo was also demonstrated. Safety event rates were generally similar across treatment groups.

Conclusions

At week 12, all 3 dose regimens of guselkumab induced greater clinical and endoscopic improvements vs placebo, with a favorable safety profile.

To better understand the relationship between patient characteristics and long-term clinical response, a post-hoc analysis of the 5-year VOYAGE 1 clinical trial data was conducted among all the patients who started guselkumab at Week 0 or at Week 16 (after switching from placebo), to assess the maintenance of their response to therapy. Specifically, we investigated baseline characteristics and serum guselkumab levels in guselkumab-treated patients who achieved complete skin clearance (PASI = 0) for ≥ 156 consecutive weeks (i.e. without relapse). The aim of this research was to identify factors associated with a positive response to treatment, which may inform personalized treatment regimens and enhance treatment approaches when using guselkumab.

### A head-to-head comparison of ixekizumab vs. guselkumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: 12-week efficacy, safety and speed of response from a randomized, double-blinded trial [^ed57e7ae]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with psoriasis value rapid and complete skin clearance. No head-to-head studies have focused on early responses to interleukin (IL)-17 vs. IL-23 inhibitors.

Objectives

To compare early and complete skin clearance by the IL-17A inhibitor ixekizumab vs. the IL-23p19 inhibitor guselkumab.

Methods

IXORA-R, a 24-week, randomized, double-blinded study, enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis [static Physician's Global Assessment of Disease (sPGA) score of ≥ 3, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 12, and ≥ 10% body surface area]. Patients were randomized (1: 1) to receive the approved dose of subcutaneous ixekizumab or guselkumab. Primary end point was 100% improvement in PASI (PASI 100) at week 12. Major secondary end points included other levels of improved PASI and sPGA at different time points. Comparisons were made using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with a multiple testing strategy. Nonresponder imputation was used for missing data. After the completion of the study, the final secondary end point (PASI 100 at 24 weeks) and safety data through week 24 will be reported.

Results

In total, 1027 patients were randomized. The primary end point PASI 100 at week 12 was met [215/520 ixekizumab (41%); 126/507 guselkumab (25%); P < 0·001]. All major secondary end points measured up to week 12 were met, including PASI 50 at week 1 and PASI 75 at week 2. Serious adverse event frequency was 3% for each group; no new safety signals were identified.

Conclusions

Ixekizumab was superior to guselkumab for rapidly improving signs and symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis by week 12. Adverse events were similar to previous ixekizumab and guselkumab studies. Compared with the IL-23 inhibitor guselkumab, ixekizumab can offer complete skin clearance more rapidly to patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. What's already known about this topic? Patients with plaque psoriasis desire both high levels of clearance and rapid onset of treatment effects. Ixekizumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody that selectively targets interleukin (IL)-17A, has demonstrated greater and faster skin clearance than etanercept and ustekinumab, with consistent long-term efficacy, safety and durability of response. Clinical trial data and systematic reviews have suggested that IL-17 inhibitors can improve a patient's psoriasis more rapidly than IL-23 inhibitors. What does this study add? The head-to-head study design directly compares the efficacy and speed of response of ixekizumab and the IL-23 inhibitor guselkumab in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The primary end point was met, showing superiority of ixekizumab over guselkumab for achieving complete skin clearance at week 12. The safety profile of ixekizumab was consistent with previous studies. Ixekizumab can deliver patients complete skin clearance and improved quality of life more rapidly than guselkumab.

Patients and Methods

Ethics

These secondary analyses derive from a study conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol was approved by each site's governing ethics body; patients provided written informed consent.

Study design

PsA patients in this double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, 2‐arm, multicenter trial were centrally randomized (2:1) to subcutaneous guselkumab or placebo (2). Study drugs were provided in identical prefilled syringes, and all patients received the same number of injections at the same time points. Patients randomized to guselkumab received guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 0, 4, 12, 20, 28, 36, and 44, and received placebo at week 24. Patients randomized to placebo received placebo at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 20 and received guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 24, 28, 36, and 44.

Patients with < 5% improvement in swollen joint count (SJC) and tender joint count (TJC) at week 16 early escaped to open‐label ustekinumab (Janssen Biotech), i.e. from placebo to ustekinumab or from guselkumab to ustekinumab, at weeks 16, 20, 32, and 44, according to approved country‐specific prescribing information. A final follow‐up visit occurred at week 56.

Patients

Eligible patients included adults with PsA according to the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (4) for ≥ 6 months who had ≥ 3 tender and ≥ 3 swollen joints, C‐reactive protein (CRP) level ≥ 0.3 mg/dl, ≥ 3% body surface area with plaque psoriasis, and an inadequate response to standard therapies (2). Patients who received 1 prior tumor necrosis factor inhibitor were permitted but limited to 20% of participants, following 8–12 weeks of washout. Stable doses of methotrexate (≤ 25 mg/week), oral corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone/equivalent), and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were permitted, but not required, through week 24. Sulfasalazine (≤ 3 gm/day) and leflunomide (≤ 20 mg/day) were permitted following week 24. Other disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologics were prohibited.

IL‐23, besides its influence on promoting proliferation and survival of IL‐17A‐producing Th17 cells, is found to be associated with stimulation of additional Th17 cytokines (e.g. IL‐22), which may also be produced by other cell types (e.g. Th22 cells, innate lymphoid type 3 cells and γδ T cells). 22, 23, 24 Therefore, selective blockade of IL‐23 may result in inhibition of pathogenic Th17 cells and preclude downstream production of multiple effector cytokines such as IL‐17A, IL‐22 and TNF‐α, 25 and may also enhance accumulation of regulatory T cells. 26 Because many cells other than Th17 produce IL‐17A and/or IL‐22 in response to IL‐23, inhibition of IL‐23 may impact the regulation of these pathogenic cells by IL‐23 and their cytokine production. 22, 23, 24 This may possibly explain the sustained effects of guselkumab observed in treating psoriasis and why longer dosing intervals are possible compared with other biologics such as anti‐TNF‐α and anti‐IL‐17 agents. 17

In conclusion, guselkumab demonstrated robust efficacy and a favorable safety profile in Japanese patients with moderate to severe plaque‐type psoriasis. Improvement in efficacy measures was maintained with a q8w dosing regimen through week 52. Overall, these findings suggest that guselkumab has potential as a novel therapeutic option in Japanese patients with psoriasis. The long‐term efficacy and safety of guselkumab treatment beyond 52 weeks will be further evaluated in the ongoing extension phase of this study.

### Guselkumab provides sustained domain-specific and comprehensive efficacy using composite indices in patients with active psoriatic arthritis [^29b90a05]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Active treatment period after week 24 through week 52

Among the guselkumab-randomized patients, composite response rates increased post-week 24 through week 52, with indications of the potential for higher response rates beyond week 52 (i.e. no plateau was reached by week 52 for PASDAS LDA/VLDA or MDA/VLDA). At week 52, 54% (Q4W) and 52% (Q8W) of guselkumab-randomized patients achieved DAPSA LDA; 55% (Q4W) and 53% (Q8W) achieved cDAPSA LDA; 45% (Q4W) and 42% (Q8W) achieved PASDAS LDA; and 36% (Q4W) and 31% (Q8W) achieved MDA (Fig. 1). For placebo-randomized patients who crossed over to guselkumab Q4W at week 24, response rates for DAPSA LDA, cDAPSA LDA, PASDAS LDA, and MDA at week 52 approached those achieved by guselkumab-randomized patients.

For the more stringent remission-related endpoints at week 52, 18% (Q4W and Q8W) achieved DAPSA remission; 21% (Q4W and Q8W) achieved cDAPSA remission; 17% (Q4W) and 20% (Q8W) achieved PASDAS VLDA; and 13% (Q4W) and 14% (Q8W) achieved VLDA (Fig. 2). Notably, VLDA was more difficult to attain than DAPSA remission and PASDAS remission when assessing longer-term treatment effect via these composite indices. In patients who crossed over from placebo to guselkumab Q4W at week 24, substantial increases in composite response rates were seen by week 52.

Across all composite indices, no notable differences in response rates were observed between the guselkumab Q4W and Q8W dosing regimens. Results were generally consistent in the individual DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2 studies (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2, available at Rheumatology online). Differences in response rates between DISCOVER-1 and DISCOVER-2 were generally smaller at week 52 than at week 24, although DISCOVER-1 response rates remained notably higher in patients randomized to guselkumab Q4W for DAPSA and cDAPSA LDA and remission, PASDAS LDA, and MDA (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2, available at Rheumatology online).

Guselkumab Q8W was ranked eighth in the network and had a comparable ACR 20 response to IL-17A inhibitors and subcutaneous TNF inhibitors as demonstrated by overlap in 95% CrI (Fig. 3). Similar results were observed for guselkumab Q4W in the full league table of results (Supplementary Fig. S18, available at Rheumatology online). Of note, guselkumab Q8W had a better ACR 20 response than ustekinumab 45 mg, abatacept and apremilast, as demonstrated by guselkumab ranking higher and lack of overlap in 95% CrI. Intravenous (IV) golimumab had a better ACR 20 response than guselkumab Q8W, as demonstrated by guselkumab ranking lower and lack of overlap in 95% CrI. Similar results were observed for ACR 50 and 70 response, although additional uncertainty in comparative effect estimates and variable treatment rankings was observed due to the lower baseline event rates associated with ACR 50 and 70 (Supplementary Figs S19 and S20, available at Rheumatology online). 3

In addition, Week 4 guselkumab plasma concentration (Week 4 of the study for those in the guselkumab arm of the study and Week 20 of the study for those in the placebo crossover arm) was also included in the regression model. Guselkumab plasma trough concentrations in both response groups were assessed prior to treatment between Weeks 4 and 156 after the start of guselkumab treatment. Plasma levels at Weeks 4, 8, 16, and 24 were measured 4 weeks after guselkumab treatment; plasma levels at Week 12 and every 8 weeks until Week 156 were measured 8 weeks after guselkumab treatment.

The odds ratios obtained from multiple logistic regression analysis indicate the level of association between each given factor and maintaining a PASI score of 0, with the Wald test to ascertain confidence intervals; p values of ≤ 0.05 indicated a statistically significant association, and p values of ≤ 0.1 identified potential parameters of interest. PASI scores over time, and time to achieving PASI = 0, were also reported. Data from patients assigned to either response group were analyzed as observed, without further imputation.

### Guselkumab dosing interval optimization in adult patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis switching from ustekinumab [^a0290790]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis (PSO) is an inflammatory disease that emerges as a dysregulation of the interleukin 23 (IL23)/Th17 axis. There are many biologic alternatives to treat PSO that are administered monthly, every 2 months and every 3months. Guselkumab (GUS) is a fully human monoclonal antibody, that selectively blocks IL-23 through binding to its p19 subunit. There is scarce evidence on dose optimization of GUS in psoriatic patients. Retrospective, observational case series review which includes patients with moderate-to-severe PSO who switched from ustekinumab to GUS as standard dosing or every 12weeks, regarding daily clinical practice of every dermatology unit. Clinical and demographic data from patients were included from February 2019 to October 2021. Analyses were performed "as observed" using GraphPad Prism version 8.3.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA, www.graphpad.com). A total of 30 patients were included in this study: 20 receiving GUS as standard of care (SC) and 10 receiving an optimized dosing (Q12W) (GUS every 12weeks without induction). The Q12W group presented greater percentage of comorbidities and was less refractory to previous biologic treatments. After receiving GUS as SC or Q12W, psoriasis area severity index and dermatology life quality index improved dramatically in both groups up to 52weeks. Survival was 87.2% and 100% for the SC and Q12W, respectively, and there were not safety signals. Our case series of 10 patients receiving GUS every 12weeks without induction showed a good effectiveness and safety profile accompanied by an excellent treatment survival. However, more studies are needed to provide strong evidence of dosing alternatives different than SC.

### Safety of guselkumab treatment for up to 5 years in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis: pooled analyses across seven clinical trials with more than 8600 patient-years of exposure [^1edfe132]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Guselkumab has demonstrated favourable safety and efficacy across individual clinical studies in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety of guselkumab in patients with psoriasis using pooled data from seven phase II/III studies (X-PLORE, VOYAGE 1, VOYAGE 2, NAVIGATE, ORION, ECLIPSE, Japan registration).

Methods

All studies, except NAVIGATE and ECLIPSE (active comparator-controlled only), included a 16-week placebo-controlled period; X-PLORE, VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 included both placebo and active controls. In most studies, guselkumab-treated patients received 100-mg subcutaneous injections at week 0, week 4, and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Safety data were summarized for the placebo-controlled period (weeks 0–16) and through the end of the reporting period (up to 5years). Incidence rates of key safety events were integrated post hoc, adjusted for the duration of follow-up and reported per 100 patient-years (PY).

Results

During the placebo-controlled period, 544 patients received placebo (165 PY) and 1220 received guselkumab (378 PY). Through the end of the reporting period, 2891 guselkumab-treated patients contributed 8662 PY of follow-up. During the placebo-controlled period, in the guselkumab and placebo groups, respectively, rates of adverse events (AEs) were 346/100 PY and 341/100 PY, and infections were 95.9/100 PY and 83.6/100 PY. Rates of serious AEs (6.3/100 PY vs. 6.7/100 PY), AEs leading to discontinuation (5.0/100 PY vs. 9.7/100 PY), serious infections (1.1/100 PY vs. 1.2/100 PY), malignancy (0.5 patients/100 PY vs. 0.0 patients/100 PY) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; 0.3/100 PY vs. 0.0/100 PY) were low and comparable between guselkumab and placebo. Through the end of the reporting period, safety event rates were lower than or comparable to the placebo-controlled period in guselkumab-treated patients: AEs, 169/100 PY; infections, 65.9/100 PY; serious AEs, 5.3/100 PY; AEs leading to discontinuation, 1.6/100 PY; serious infections, 0.9/100 PY; malignancy, 0.7/100 PY; and MACE, 0.3/100 PY. There were no cases of Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, opportunistic infection or active tuberculosis related to guselkumab.

Conclusions

In this comprehensive analysis of 2891 guselkumab-treated patients with psoriasis followed for up to 5years (8662 PY), guselkumab demonstrated favourable safety, consistent with previous reports. Safety event rates in guselkumab-treated patients were similar to those observed with placebo and were consistent throughout long-term treatment.

### Resolution of enthesitis by guselkumab and relationships to disease burden: 1-year results of two phase 3 psoriatic arthritis studies [^a22ea4cb]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients and study designs

The DISCOVER-1 (NCT03162796) and DISCOVER-2 (NCT03158285) studies, both multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies of guselkumab, enrolled adults with active PsA despite standard therapies [conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs), apremilast, NSAIDs]. In DISCOVER-1, the 381 participants had ≥ 3 tender and ≥ 3 swollen joints and CRP ≥ 0.3 mg/dl. The study allowed ∼30% of enrolled patients to have previously taken one or two TNFi. In DISCOVER-2, 739 biologic-naïve patients with ≥ 5 tender and ≥ 5 swollen joints and CRP ≥ 0.6 mg/dl were enrolled.

In both studies, patients were permitted to continue stable use of selected standard treatments, including NSAIDs or other analgesics up to the regional marketed dose approved; oral corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent dose); or one csDMARD, limited to MTX ≤ 25 mg/week, SSZ ≤ 3 g/day, HCQ ≤ 400 mg/day or LEF ≤ 20 mg/day. Patients also had to meet screening criteria for laboratory assessments and tuberculosis history, testing and treatment (for latent tuberculosis).

In both studies, patients were randomized to subcutaneous guselkumab 100 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W), guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks (Q8W), or placebo followed by crossover to guselkumab 100 mg Q4W at week 24 (Placebo→Q4W). Treatment continued through week 48 in DISCOVER-1, and through week 100 in DISCOVER-2. Efficacy data collected through week 52 are included in the current analyses.

The studies were conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Council for Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The protocols were approved by each site's governing ethical body. Additional study details have previously been reported.

### Real-life experience of guselkumab in patients with psoriasis [^47835416]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

High levels of efficacy were demonstrated in randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of guselkumab; however, real-life data are lacking. In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of guselkumab in a cohort of psoriasis patients heavily pretreated with biologic agents. Primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving ≥ psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) 90 response at week 24. The cohort included 33 patients of mean age 60 ± 13years. Guselkumab was initiated after a mean of 4.0 ± 1.0 prior biologics failed over a mean period of 7. 4 ± 3.8years. The mean duration of guselkumab treatment was 9.5 ± 3.7 months; 29 patients completed at least 24weeks of treatment. At week 24, 22 patients (76%) achieved response of PASI 75 or higher, 18 (62%) achieved PASI 90 or higher, five (17%) PASI 100, and seven (24%) ≤ PASI 50. No adverse effects were observed. This study confirms the efficacy and safety of guselkumab in real-world clinical practice, although for a lesser degree compared with clinical trials.

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: the GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^435b336c]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Though treatment de-escalation of biologics for psoriasis may be attempted in daily practice, evidence-based treatment guidelines and algorithms for suitable patients are limited. As part of a recent modified Delphi procedure, van der Schoot et alhighlighted the importance of clear criteria, supported by existing evidence, for clinicians to consider treatment de-escalation. The authors also noted the small volume of evidence on de-escalation of newer biologic therapies, such as IL-23 inhibitors. Similarly, Michielsens et alconcluded that further research into dose reduction is required, highlighting the need for randomized clinical trials including a standard-of-care treatment arm, such as in the GUIDE trial.

In the GUIDE trial, we identified a population of SRes who maintained psoriasis disease control with treatment de-escalation through dosing interval extension to every 16 weeks. Previous findings from GUIDE demonstrated that SDD and biologic-naive patients were more likely to achieve super response than those with LDD or prior biologic exposure. A post hoc analysis of pooled VOYAGE 1 and 2 clinical trial data also determined that SRes tended to be younger and have lower body weight and less severe disease at baseline. Nonetheless, further analyses of GUIDE data may provide insights into clinical and biomarker parameters predictive of super response. Our current findings suggest that early intervention with guselkumab increases the likelihood of achieving super response, and thus subsequently may be important to accommodate therapeutic strategies through dosing interval flexibility. The GUIDE clinical trial contributes critical prospective data to help address individual patient needs in everyday practice, and potentially improve long-term disease management and patient compliance with treatment.

Limitations

A potential limitation of this trial is the absence of a non-SRe dosing interval extension group to serve as a comparator. Consequently, it remains unclear whether dosing flexibility is feasible in this patient group. In addition, some biomarker analyses comprised only small groups of patients, such as the CD8-positive TRM cell count by dosing group analysis, which may affect the reliability of the findings.

### Guselkumab (Tremfya) [^a48aaba6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse Reactions in Adults with Psoriatic Arthritis

TREMFYA was studied in two placebo-controlled trials in adult subjects with psoriatic arthritis (748 subjects on TREMFYA and 372 subjects on placebo). Of the 748 subjects who received TREMFYA, 375 subjects received TREMFYA 100 mg at Week 0, Week 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter and 373 subjects received TREMFYA 100 mg every 4 weeks. The overall safety profile observed in adult subjects with psoriatic arthritis treated with TREMFYA is generally consistent with the safety profile in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis with the addition of bronchitis and neutrophil count decreased. In the 24-week placebo-controlled period, combined across the two studies, bronchitis occurred in 1.6% of subjects in the TREMFYA q8w group and 2.9% of subjects in the TREMFYA q4w group compared to 1.1% of subjects in the placebo group. Neutrophil count decreased occurred in 0.3% of subjects in the TREMFYA q8w and 1.6% of subjects in the TREMFYA q4w group compared to 0% of subjects in the placebo group. The majority of events of neutrophil count decreased were mild, transient, not associated with infection and did not lead to discontinuation. A similar risk of infection and serious infections was seen in placebo-controlled trials in subjects with psoriatic arthritis as in subjects with plaque psoriasis.

Adverse Reactions in Adults with Ulcerative Colitis

TREMFYA was studied up to 12 weeks in adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled induction trial (UC1) and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, induction dose-finding trial (UC3; NCT04033445). Long-term safety up to 44 weeks was evaluated in subjects who responded to induction therapy in trials UC1 or UC3 in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled maintenance trial (UC2). In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (UC4), subjects received subcutaneous TREMFYA at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 followed by one of two recommended subcutaneous TREMFYA dosing regimens for a total duration of up to 24 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

### Guselkumab provides sustained domain-specific and comprehensive efficacy using composite indices in patients with active psoriatic arthritis [^91f43263]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of guselkumab for the treatment of active PsA utilizing composite indices.

Methods

Data were pooled from the phase 3 DISCOVER-1 (n = 381) and DISCOVER-2 (n = 739) studies. In both studies, patients were randomized 1:1:1 to subcutaneous guselkumab 100mg every 4weeks (Q4W); guselkumab 100mg at week 0, week 4, then Q8W; or placebo Q4W with crossover to guselkumab 100mg Q4W at week 24. Composite indices used to assess efficacy through week 52 included Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA), Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score (PASDAS), minimal disease activity (MDA), and very low disease activity (VLDA). Through week 24, treatment failure rules were applied. Through week 52, non-responder imputation was used for missing data.

Results

Greater proportions of guselkumab- than placebo-treated patients achieved DAPSA low disease activity (LDA) and remission, PASDAS LDA and VLDA, MDA, and VLDA at week 24 vs placebo (all unadjusted P < 0.05). At week 52, in the guselkumab Q4W and Q8W groups, respectively, response rates were as follows: DAPSA LDA, 54.2% and 52.5%; DAPSA remission, 18.2% and 17.6%; PASDAS LDA, 45.3% and 41.9%; PASDAS VLDA, 16.9% and 19.5%; MDA, 35.9% and 30.7%; and VLDA, 13.1% and 14.4%. In the placebo-crossover-to-guselkumab group, response rates for all composite indices increased after patients switched to guselkumab, from week 24 through week 52.

Conclusion

Treatment with guselkumab provided robust and sustained benefits across multiple PsA domains through 1year, indicating that guselkumab is an effective therapy for the diverse manifestations of PsA.

Trial Registration

### Sustained response to guselkumab regardless of baseline characteristics in patients with active psoriatic arthritis and inadequate response to TNF inhibitors: results from the phase 3b COSMOS clinical trial [^3f4361c6]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

Eligible adults had a diagnosis of PsA according to the classification criteria for PsA at screening, including active disease (tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) both ≥ 3) and active (≥ 1 psoriatic plaque of ≥ 2 cm) or documented history of plaque psoriasis or current nail psoriasis, and had demonstrated lack of benefit or intolerance to one or two TNFi. Patients could continue stable baseline use of methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine or leflunomide, oral corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/other analgesics. Targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were prohibited before and during study participation. Patients with active tuberculosis were excluded; patients with latent tuberculosis received appropriate prophylaxis.

Trial design

COSMOS was a phase 3b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT03796858) conducted at 84 European sites from March 2019 to November 2020. The overall COSMOS trial design has been reported previously. As an overview, adults were randomised 2:1 to receive guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks through week 44 (final assessment at week 48), or to receive placebo at weeks 0, 4, 12 and 20 with crossover to receive guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 24, 28, 36 and 44. Patients with < 5% improvement from baseline in both TJC and SJC at week 16 qualified for early escape; those receiving guselkumab continued randomised treatment (including a placebo dose at week 16 to maintain blinding) while those in the placebo group received guselkumab at weeks 16 and 20, then every 8 weeks through week 44. Patients who met early escape criteria could also initiate or increase the dose of one permitted concomitant medication, up to the maximum dose allowed by protocol, at the physician's discretion.

Vdh-S score

Only nine studies reported a mean change from baseline in vdH-S score. An unadjusted FE model was used to inform results because the evidence network was composed entirely of single-study connections, making random effects models inappropriate and adjustment for baseline risk impossible (Supplementary Table S6, available at Rheumatology online). Guselkumab Q8W ranked ninth in the network and had a comparable change in vdH-S score relative to most other agents as demonstrated by overlap in 95% CrI. Guselkumab Q8W was worse than IV TNF therapies (i.e.g.olimumab and infliximab) as demonstrated by lower ranking and lack in overlap in 95% CrI (Fig. 4). Results were similar for guselkumab Q4W (Supplementary Fig. S21, available at Rheumatology online). 4

### Noninferiority of 16-week vs 8-week guselkumab dosing in super responders for maintaining control of psoriasis: the GUIDE randomized clinical trial [^d1c9261f]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Clinical findings in SRes were supported through assessment of immunologic parameters, including blood and skin biomarkers associated with psoriasis. The cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22, together with the keratinocyte-derived antimicrobial peptide BD-2, represent markers of disease activity and clinical response. We showed that IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and BD-2 serum levels were reduced as early as W4 with guselkumab treatment, and remained suppressed to W68. In turn, lesional skin CD8-positive TRM cells were normalized to nonlesional skin levels by W28. In line with clinical and patient-reported outcomes, no differences in immunologic parameters were observed between the every 8 weeks and every 16 weeks dosing groups at W68.

Our findings suggest that early skin clearance with guselkumab is accompanied by rapid and sustained suppression of TRM cells in lesional skin, after which an extended dosing interval effectively controlled disease activity in SRes. Importantly, the 16-week dosing interval evaluated in the GUIDE clinical trial corresponds to a duration far greater than 5 half-lives of guselkumab. Although it is currently unknown whether some SRes had higher blood levels of guselkumab throughout the dosing randomization period, our data suggest a link between TRM cells and maintenance of clinical response.

A new Delphi consensusdefines disease modification as sustained improvement in the disease course of psoriasis resulting from changes in pathophysiology that minimize the need for treatment. Based on this definition, data from the GUIDE trial suggest the potential for achieving disease modification with guselkumab treatment in SRes.

Although skin and quality-of-life improvements were generally greater in SRes than non-SRes, non-SRes also achieved highly favorable skin, quality-of-life, and immunologic outcomes, with 82.9% of non-SRes achieving the treatment goal of PASI lower than 3 at W28 and maintaining this level of response to W68. For more stringent clinical (eg, PASI = 0) and patient-reported outcomes, response rates continued to improve after W28; however, non-SRes generally took longer to achieve treatment targets than SRes. Consistent with this, normalization of CD8-positive TRM cell count was observed by W28 in SRes but not until W68 in non-SRes.

Statistical analyses

The sample size was estimated to have 98% power for testing the superiority of ixekizumab to guselkumab for the PASI 100 outcome at week 12 at a two‐sided 5% type I error rate (for details see File S2; see Supporting Information).

Efficacy analyses for the blinded treatment dosing period included all randomized patients according to the treatment to which they were assigned (intent‐to‐treat population). Safety data up to the week 12 database lock were summarized using the safety population (all randomized patients who received one or more dose of a trial drug) per the assigned treatments.

For the primary and major secondary end points, odds ratios and P ‐values were obtained using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test stratified by pooled site. Missing data were imputed using a nonresponder imputation method. A multiple testing strategy was implemented for primary and major secondary end points to control the overall familywise type I error rate at a two‐sided alpha level of 0·05. Exploratory analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. One interim analysis was planned and executed when all patients completed their week 12 visit or early termination visit. This paper presents the results of this interim analysis and is considered the primary report of the trial. Additional details regarding statistical analyses are in File S2 (see Supporting Information).

Safety data on terms related to cerebrocardiovascular events and suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were adjudicated by external clinical event committees (for details see File S2 in the Supporting Information). Because this study is ongoing, some efficacy and safety data are not described in this article to maintain study blinding. These details will be included in future publications. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03573323).

### Serious gastrointestinal-related adverse events among psoriasis patients treated with guselkumab in VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 [^19c4fff2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-interleukin (IL)-17 biologic agents used to treat psoriasis are associated with onset/exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Objectives

To determine the incidence of IBD or serious gastrointestinal-related adverse events (GI SAEs) in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated with guselkumab, an IL-23p19 inhibitor that indirectly inhibits IL-17, through 4 years in the phase 3 VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 trials.

Methods

Patients were randomized to guselkumab 100 mg every-8-weeks or placebo&rarr; guselkumab (week 16), or adalimumab. In VOYAGE 1, all patients received open-label guselkumab starting at week 52. In VOYAGE 2, eligible patients were treated with guselkumab or placebo based on clinical response starting at week 28 and received open-label guselkumab starting at week 76. Cumulative incidence rates of IBD and other GI SAEs were calculated as events per 100 patient-years (PY) through week 204. IBD was defined as AEs of Crohn&rsquo; s disease or ulcerative colitis. Data were summarized for all guselkumab-treated patients for years 1–4.

Results

Of 1721 guselkumab-treated patients, 1612 were exposed for &ge;1 year, 1545 for &ge;2 years, 1454 for &ge;3 years, and 661 for &ge;4 years. For all patients through week 204, the cumulative rate of GI SAEs was 0.45/100PY. Event rates remained stable with longer duration of exposure, ranging from 0.36 to 0.57/100PY. No new or exacerbated cases of IBD were reported.

Conclusions

No cases of IBD were observed and rates of GI SAEs were low through 4 years of treatment with guselkumab in two large trials of patients with psoriasis.

### Comparative effectiveness of guselkumab in psoriatic arthritis: updates to a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^56922159]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Skin efficacy

The network diagram for multi-PASI is shown in Supplementary Fig. S5, available at Rheumatology online. Thirty studies reported PASI data: 27 reported PASI 75, 23 reported PASI 90, and 11 reported PASI 100. For PASI 90, guselkumab Q8W and Q4W ranked second and first, respectively, among 23 interventions and were better than most agents, including all subcutaneous TNF and JAK inhibitors, ustekinumab 45 mg, apremilast and abatacept, as demonstrated by non-overlap in 95% Crls (Fig. 5). Both guselkumab doses were comparable to risankizumab and most IL-17A inhibitors for PASI 90, but point estimates consistently favoured guselkumab. Given the use of a multinomial model, all conclusions for guselkumab remained the same for PASI 75 and 100 (Supplementary Figs S9 and S10, available at Rheumatology online).

### Safety and efficacy of guselkumab in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: a randomized, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose study [^1b85323b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 pathway is central in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The favourable efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an IL-23-specific monoclonal antibody, has been demonstrated in global phase III studies of plaque psoriasis.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of single-dose subcutaneous guselkumab in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

Patients with ≥ 10% of total body surface area involvement and a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 12 were randomized (5: 1) to receive guselkumab or placebo in four cohorts of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose, single-centre study. Safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical response were monitored at baseline and specific time points over a 24-week follow-up period.

Results

To week 24, 55% (11/20) of patients in the guselkumab group and 50% (2/4) in the placebo group experienced ≥ 1 adverse event (AE). No deaths, serious AEs or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported. Maximum clinical response was seen at week 16 with PASI 75 (≥ 75% improvement from baseline PASI) response in two of five (10 mg), four of five (30 mg and 300 mg) and three of five (100 mg) patients; and PASI 90 (≥ 90% improvement from baseline PASI) in zero of five (10 mg), three of five (30 mg), two of five (100 mg) and three of five (300 mg) patients. Mean maximum serum concentration (C max) and area under the curve from time zero to infinity values increased in a dose-proportional manner with a mean terminal half-life of 15·6–17·6 days and median time to reach C max of 4–6 days.

Conclusions

Guselkumab was generally well-tolerated and exhibited sustained high levels of clinical response in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

### Low rates of radiographic progression associated with clinical efficacy following up to 2 years of treatment with guselkumab: results from a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of biologic-naïve patients with active psoriatic arthritis [^72f63925]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical efficacy and radiographic progression

The DISCOVER-2 primary endpoint was achieved; 64% of patients in both guselkumab groups had an ACR20 response at week 24 compared with 33% of placebo patients (p < 0.0001). In reading session 1 (major secondary endpoint analysis), least squares (LS) mean changes in total vdH-S scores from baseline at week 24 were significantly less in the Q4W group (0.29; p = 0.011) and numerically less in the Q8W group (0.52; p = 0.072) compared with placebo (0.95). Among patients evaluated in reading session 3, mean changes in total vdH-S scores from weeks 0 to 24 (table 2) were consistent with LS mean changes and absolute mean changes derived from reading sessions 1and 2, respectively, and mean changes from weeks 24 to 52 were consistent with those derived from reading session 2 (online supplemental table 2).

Table 2
Observed mean changes in PsA-modified vdH-S scores through week 100 in DISCOVER-2 patients evaluated in reading session 3*

Minimal radiographic progression was observed in guselkumab-randomised patients included in reading session 3 during both the first year (mean changes in total vdH-S from week 0 to 52: Q4W, 1.1; Q8W, 1.0), which was consistent with results from reading session 2, and also the second year (mean changes in total vdH-S from week 52 to 100: Q4W, 0.8; Q8W, 0.5)of guselkumab treatment, regardless of dosing regimen. Through 2 years, mean changes in total vdH-S score from weeks 0 to 100 were 1.7 in the Q4W group, 1.5 in the Q8W group and 1.5 in the placebo→Q4W group. Similar patterns of minimal progression through 2 years of guselkumab therapy were observed for both erosion and JSN scores (table 2).

### Efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an interleukin-23p19-specific monoclonal antibody, through one year in biologic-naive patients with psoriatic arthritis [^fdd303b2]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Through week 52, decreased neutrophil counts of NCI CTCAE grade 2 or higher (< 1.5 × 10 9 /liter) were infrequent, occurring in 3.7% of patients (9 of 243) who received guselkumab every 4 weeks from week 0 and 3.6% of patients (9 of 247) who received guselkumab every 8 weeks from week 0. Fewer than 1% of guselkumab‐treated patients (5 of 731) had decreased neutrophil counts of grade 3 or higher, including 4 with grade 3 values (< 1.0–0.5 × 10 9 /liter) and 1 with grade 4 values (< 0.5 × 10 9 /liter). These findings were generally transient and reversible, resolved spontaneously without treatment, and did not require discontinuation of study agent. No associated infections were seen, except a case of mild nasopharyngitis temporally associated with grade 2 neutropenia. Decreased white blood cell counts of NCI CTCAE grade 2 (< 3.0–2.0 × 10 9 /liter) occurred in 2.1% of patients (5 of 243) who received guselkumab every 4 weeks from week 0 and 2.4% of patients (6 of 247) who received guselkumab every 8 weeks from week 0; no guselkumab‐treated patient exhibited leukopenia of grade 3 or 4 (> 2.0 × 10 9 /liter) (Supplementary Table 4, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology website at).
