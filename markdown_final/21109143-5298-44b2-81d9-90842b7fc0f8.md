## Question

*D. Colposcopy directed cervical biopsy
A 39-year-old woman, who is a mother of 3 children and has completed her family, she is a
known case of endometrioma in the right ovary that has been removed 2 years ago. She came
to the clinic complaining of mild to moderate dysmenorrhea and deep pain during intercourse
along with her chronic lower abdomen pain. Pelvic ultrasonography revealed the presence of left ovarian
cyst measuring 6X7 cm that appeared to be an endometriotic cyst.
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
A. Removing the cyst when the size becomes more than 10 cm
B. Aspiration of the content of cyst under ultrasound guidance
C. Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
D. Removing the cyst laparoscopically with ablation of any endometriotic spot

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which management option is most appropriate for a 39-year-old woman with a 6–7 cm left ovarian endometrioma and symptomatic dysmenorrhea and deep dyspareunia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and whether imaging is sufficient. Then, I should verify the indications for surgery in an endometrioma of this size and symptom profile. Next, I will compare surgical approaches and techniques, especially excision versus drainage/ablation. After that, I need to consider patient-specific factors such as age, parity, and fertility goals. Finally, I will evaluate each answer choice against guideline-based care and choose the best option with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and the strength of imaging evidence. Ultrasound is highly accurate for ovarian endometrioma, with pooled sensitivity around 0.93 and specificity around 0.96, which supports a confident clinical diagnosis in this case without immediate recourse to diagnostic laparoscopy, especially when symptoms are classic and imaging is characteristic [^115RTd9k]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines align with this approach; contemporary guidance emphasizes clinical diagnosis supported by imaging and reserves surgery for specific indications, which fits this presentation [^113Xahfr] [^111XeyKb].

> Next, I should review indications for surgery in endometrioma. I need to ensure I'm not jumping to conclusions about size thresholds. While some older guidance used 10 cm as a threshold, more recent recommendations support intervention for endometriomas that are large, symptomatic, or growing, and many guidelines consider > 3 cm a reasonable threshold for surgical consideration when symptomatic, particularly to relieve pain and reduce recurrence risk [^115Z5oaN] [^113pmbph]. Given this patient's 6–7 cm cyst with dysmenorrhea and deep dyspareunia, surgery is indicated rather than continued observation, and I should confirm that this aligns with both ACOG and SOGC positions, which it does [^115Z5oaN] [^113pmbph].

> Now, I will examine surgical approach and technique. Wait, let me verify the comparative effectiveness of excision versus drainage/ablation. High-quality evidence and multiple guidelines consistently favor excisional cystectomy over drainage and ablation because excision reduces recurrence of endometrioma and pain symptoms and decreases the need for reoperation, with potential fertility benefits in subfertile patients, whereas drainage/ablation has markedly higher recurrence and symptom relapse rates [^1175sbab] [^116NmDbu] [^1116iKLz]. I should double-check that ACOG and ESHRE also recommend excision over ablation; yes, both recommend cystectomy as the preferred surgical approach when operating for endometrioma [^1151vTrU] [^1175sbab].

> Let me consider patient-specific factors. She is 39 years old, has completed childbearing, and presents with significant pain. Definitive management with cyst excision and concurrent treatment of endometriotic lesions is appropriate, and hysterectomy is not first-line unless pain is refractory and the patient desires it after counseling, so I should avoid prematurely recommending hysterectomy here [^1162Px3e]. I need to ensure that the plan also addresses recurrence prevention; postoperative hormonal suppression reduces recurrence and should be discussed, but the immediate next step is surgical excision of the endometrioma and visible disease, tailored to her goals and anatomy at the time of laparoscopy [^114ryJqD] [^111UybXm].

> I will now evaluate each option against this framework. Option A suggests waiting until the cyst exceeds 10 cm; hold on, that's outdated for a symptomatic patient, and continued observation risks ongoing pain, torsion, and progression, so deferring surgery solely on a 10 cm threshold is not appropriate here [^115Z5oaN] [^113pmbph]. Option B proposes ultrasound-guided aspiration; I should confirm recurrence data — aspiration alone has very high recurrence, often exceeding 80%, and is not recommended as definitive therapy, so this would be inadequate and likely to fail symptomatically [^1114Vaox]. Option C recommends total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; but wait, definitive castration is overtreatment as an initial step in a 39-year-old with a unilateral endometrioma and no refractory pain history, and guidelines reserve hysterectomy for selected patients after failed medical therapy or when specifically requested, not as first-line for a unilateral endometrioma [^1162Px3e] [^117VK8Rp]. Option D proposes laparoscopic removal of the cyst with ablation of endometriotic spots; I initially thought this aligned with best practice, but hold on, I should verify the technique — this option says "removing the cyst", which could imply excision, yet it explicitly pairs it with "ablation", which is less effective than excision for endometrioma; the better phrasing would be laparoscopic cystectomy with excision of additional endometriotic lesions, not ablation, so the technique as stated is suboptimal even if the approach is correct [^1175sbab] [^116NmDbu]. Given the choices, Option D is the closest to guideline-concordant care, but I need to emphasize that cystectomy, not ablation, should be the operative technique for the endometrioma itself [^1175sbab].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate next step is laparoscopic excision of the endometrioma with removal of additional endometriotic lesions, because this addresses pain, provides histologic diagnosis, minimizes recurrence, and is consistent with contemporary guideline recommendations. If the provided option must be selected as-is, Option D is the best available choice, but I should clarify that cystectomy rather than ablation of the endometrioma wall is the evidence-based technique to employ during laparoscopy [^1175sbab] [^115Z5oaN] [^113pmbph].

---

The most appropriate next step is **laparoscopic cyst excision with ablation of endometriotic spots** [^1175sbab] because the patient has a symptomatic 6–7 cm endometrioma [^115Z5oaN] and completed her family, and excision provides superior pain control, lower recurrence, and a definitive diagnosis compared with aspiration or ablation alone [^116NmDbu]. Medical therapy is less effective for cysts > 3 cm [^notfound], and observation risks progression or complications [^11482ve8]; hysterectomy is not indicated unless pain is refractory and the patient requests it [^1162Px3e].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

- **History and physical examination**: The patient presents with dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, and chronic lower abdominal pain, consistent with endometriosis [^113y1aRp]. A pelvic examination may reveal a fixed, tender adnexal mass and nodularity of the uterosacral ligaments, supporting the diagnosis [^116SJhqY].

- **Imaging**: Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is the first-line imaging modality for suspected endometriomas, with high sensitivity and specificity [^115RTd9k]. MRI is useful for complex cases or when deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is suspected [^113Xahfr].

- **Definitive diagnosis**: Histopathological confirmation via laparoscopic excision and biopsy is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis and exclusion of malignancy [^113wDsgK].

---

## Management options

| **Management option** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Observation | Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cysts < 5 cm | Non-invasive; avoids surgery | Risk of progression, rupture, torsion, malignancy |
| Medical therapy | Small cysts (< 3 cm), mild symptoms | Non-invasive; hormonal suppression | Limited efficacy for large cysts; side effects |
| Aspiration | Temporary relief; diagnostic | Minimally invasive | High recurrence (> 80%); not definitive |
| Laparoscopic excision | Symptomatic cysts > 3 cm, fertility preservation | Definitive; low recurrence; histopathology | Surgical risks; potential ovarian reserve impact |
| Hysterectomy with BSO | Refractory symptoms, no fertility desire | Definitive; low recurrence | Major surgery; menopausal symptoms |

---

## Evidence-based recommendation

Laparoscopic excision of the endometrioma with ablation of endometriotic spots is the **most appropriate next step** [^115Z5oaN] [^1175sbab] for this patient because:

- **Symptomatic cyst**: The cyst is 6–7 cm and causing significant symptoms (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain) [^115Z5oaN].

- **Completed family**: The patient has completed her family, but ovarian conservation is still desirable unless she specifically requests definitive surgery [^117VK8Rp].

- **Superior outcomes**: Excision provides better pain relief, lower recurrence, and a definitive diagnosis compared to aspiration or ablation alone [^116NmDbu].

- **Guideline support**: ESHRE and ACOG recommend excision over drainage or ablation for symptomatic endometriomas [^1175sbab] [^1151vTrU].

---

## Surgical technique and considerations

- **Preoperative preparation**: Evaluate ovarian reserve, discuss risks and benefits, and obtain informed consent.

- **Intraoperative technique**: Laparoscopic cystectomy with careful dissection, hemostasis, and preservation of ovarian tissue [^111qyUuE].

- **Postoperative management**: Consider hormonal suppression to reduce recurrence risk [^114ryJqD].

---

## Potential risks and complications

- **Surgical risks**: Bleeding, infection, injury to adjacent structures, anesthesia-related complications.

- **Ovarian reserve**: Potential impact on ovarian reserve, particularly in women desiring future fertility [^1176zTLw].

- **Recurrence**: Endometriosis recurrence is common; postoperative hormonal suppression may reduce this risk [^114ryJqD].

---

## Alternative management options

- **Observation**: Not recommended due to symptomatic nature and size of the cyst [^115Z5oaN].

- **Medical therapy**: Limited efficacy for large cysts; may be considered for mild symptoms or as adjunctive therapy [^112XdVLr].

- **Aspiration**: High recurrence rate; not definitive [^1114Vaox].

- **Hysterectomy with BSO**: Definitive but overly aggressive for this patient unless specifically requested [^1162Px3e].

---

Laparoscopic excision of the endometrioma with ablation of endometriotic spots is the **most appropriate next step** for this patient, providing definitive treatment, symptom relief, and a histopathological diagnosis while preserving ovarian function.

The management of endometriomas in women wishing to preserve their fertility is complex. While surgery can help to achieve pregnancy in some, it may also have a detrimental effect on a woman's ovarian reserve. The present article reviews the impact of endometriomas on fertility and the different management approaches that should be considered in women who wish to preserve their fertility. This study also reviews the role of assisted reproduction in the setting of endometriomas, and the evolving role of oocyte cryopreservation for this benign but progressive disease. Using evidence from the latest guidelines and major publications, we emphasize the need to consider the woman's future fertility when navigating the diverse range of management strategies available, and outline an evidence-based framework to help facilitate fertility-friendly discussion, counseling and management of this complex disease.

### Current strategies for endometriosis management [^1137Wa6q]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disorder that persists throughout the reproductive years. Although endometriosis is a surgical diagnosis, medical management with ovarian suppression remains the mainstay of long-term management with superimposed surgical intervention when needed. The goal of surgery should be excision or ablation of all visible disease to minimize risk of recurrence and need for repeat surgeries. When infertility is the presenting symptom, surgical therapy in addition to assisted reproductive technology can improve chances of conception; however, the treatment approach depends on stage of disease and other patient characteristics that affect fecundity.

### Surgical evaluation and treatment of the patient with chronic pelvic pain [^112xtP9z]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients with chronic pelvic pain is assisted by detailed history, physical examination, pain diary, and ultrasonography. The possibility of other contributing systems (eg, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal) should also be addressed and treatment initiated if present. A diagnostic surgical procedure is helpful in patients for whom medical management or whose severity of pain warrants an urgent diagnosis. Limited evidence exists to support adhesions, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, ovarian remnants, and hernias as being causes of chronic pelvic pain. In select patients, ovarian cystectomy, excision of endometriosis and ovarian remnants, adhesiolysis, hysterectomy, hernia repair, and presacral neurectomy may provide relief.

### Ten principles for safe surgical treatment of ovarian endometriosis [^111qyUuE]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To show a step-by-step laparoscopic approach for excision of an ovarian endometrioma following surgical principles for safety and maximal preservation of ovarian function.

Design

Video. Medical management of ovarian endometriomas is not recommended. Operative laparoscopy is the treatment of choice. Although considered a simple procedure, ovarian cystectomy requires a precise and correct technique in order to preserve ovarian function.

Setting

A private hospital.

Patient

An asymptomatic, 27-year-old woman with ultrasound imaging suggesting a 6.2 × 5.4 cm left endometrioma. Additional findings of endometriotic implants were noted in the posterior aspect of the left broad ligament, retrocervical region, Douglas pouch, and left round ligament.

Interventions

After trocar insertion, standard inspection of the pelvic cavity with identification of endometriosis lesions and adhesions was performed. The endometrioma was drained with direct trocar puncture to avoid spillage of the endometriotic contents. Cyst aspiration and saline cleaning were executed. After drainage, a cold cut was performed at the puncture site for better identification of the cyst capsule. Through gentle traction and countertraction, the capsule was peeled from the ovarian cortex, preserving as much ovarian tissue as possible followed by careful hemostasis with a bipolar instrument. The ovary is fixed, anatomy re-established, and concomitant pelvic endometriosis resected. We aim for complete surgical excision in order to avoid leaving disease behind. The ovarian edges were reapproximated using simple interrupted stitches.

Measurements and Main Results

The total procedure time was 40 minutes.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic endometrioma stripping offers an effective option for ovarian endometriosis treatment, reducing recurrence and being reproducible by gynecologic surgeons after proper training.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® endometriosis [^114UG9Ed]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a common condition impacting individuals assigned female at birth. Though incompletely understood, the disorder is caused by endometrial-like tissue located outside of the endometrial cavity, associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical presentation is variable, ranging from asymptomatic to severe pelvic pain and infertility. Treatment is determined by the patient's individualized goals and can include medical therapies to temporize symptoms or definitive surgical excision. Imaging is used to help diagnose endometriosis and for treatment planning. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Pathophysiology and clinical implications of ovarian endometriomas [^11482ve8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Endometriomas affect up to 6% of patients with ovaries and carry risks of chronic pain, infertility, pregnancy complications, and potential for malignant transformation. Two pathways of endometrioma formation have been proposed, endometriotic invasion or metaplasia of preexisting functional ovarian cysts and bleeding of ovarian endometriotic implants directly into the ovarian cortex, that may account for the phenotypic variability observed among endometriomas. Future research evaluating the recapitulation of these mechanisms at a molecular level is anticipated to shed light on the genesis of endometriomas, with likely implications for the prevention of endometrioma formation. Whether endometriomas of different phenotypes have identifiably disparate effects on fertility or risk of malignancy is an important clinical question that has not been fully explored.

Medical management may shrink endometrioma size but rarely leads to cyst resolution and forgoes the opportunity for pathologic diagnosis; therefore, surgical management is often indicated for purposes of diagnosis and symptom management. Benefits of surgery for fertility optimization and cancer risk reduction have been suggested by retrospective studies. The precise role of surgery for these goals is yet to be defined, particularly with regard to a stratification of benefit by cyst phenotype or size. Moving forward, continued attention to cyst phenotype or size in the design of studies on the management and implications of endometriomas will continue to better inform ability to make evidence-based clinical recommendations tailored to patients' unique clinical presentations.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for endometriosis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, SOGC 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain abdominal and transvaginal ultrasound to identify ovarian endometriomas and to evaluate for other causes of pelvic pain, even if the pelvic and/or abdominal examination is normal.
Obtain advanced ultrasound for endometriosis, including pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound with limited abdominal ultrasound, to assist in the detection of ovarian and deep endometriosis in patients at risk.

### Endometriosis and infertility: a committee opinion [^114d7yzc]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Endometrioma management before assisted reproduction indicates that for women with an asymptomatic endometrioma planning IVF/ICSI, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that removal will improve IVF success rates; however, if the endometrioma is large (> 4 cm), surgery should be considered to confirm the diagnosis histologically, improve access to follicles during oocyte retrieval, and possibly improve ovarian response. Surgical management should include resection or ablation, rather than drainage, with resection preferred, and patients should be informed that extensive ovarian surgery could compromise ovarian function and diminish the response to ovarian stimulation.

### Surgical management of endometriosis-associated pain [^115APepd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

General surgical guidelines are reasonable, but treatment frequently must be individualized. Laparoscopic coagulation can be used for many cases of superficial endometriosis. Resection seems to be associated with an increased resolution of endometriosis. Resection increases the difficulty of the procedure, the time of the operation, and the cost, however. When endometriosis is found coincidentally, it may need no treatment because many women have endometriosis as a self-limited disease. Distinguishing patients who need no treatment from patients who need intermediate or extensive treatment can be difficult. Care is needed to attempt to ensure that patients are neither overtreated nor undertreated.

### Excisional surgery versus ablative surgery for ovarian endometriomata [^1116iKLz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Endometriomata are endometriotic deposits within the ovary. The surgical management of these blood filled cysts is controversial. The laparoscopic approach to the management of endometriomata is favoured over a laparotomy approach as it offers the advantage of a shorter hospital stay, faster patient recovery and decreased hospital costs. Currently the commonest procedures for the treatment of ovarian endometriomata are either excision of the cyst capsule or drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst wall.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to determine the most effective technique of treating an ovarian endometrioma; either excision of the cyst capsule or drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst wall. The end-points assessed were the relief of pain, recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of symptoms and in women desiring to conceive the subsequent pregnancy rate, either spontaneous or as part of fertility treatment.

Search Strategy

The reviewers searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group specialised register of trials (searched 3rd March 2007), the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (1966-August 2007), EMBASE (1980- March 2007) and reference lists of articles, the handsearching of relevant journals and conference proceedings and by contacting leaders in the field of endoscopic surgery throughout the world. The Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL and CENTRAL.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of excision of the cyst capsule versus drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst in the management of ovarian endometriomata.

Data Collection and Analysis

Reviewers assessed eligibility and trial quality.

Main Results

No randomised studies of the management of endometriomata by laparotomy were found. Two randomised studies of the laparoscopic management of ovarian endometriomata of greater than 3cm in size, for the primary symptom of pain were included. Laparoscopic excision of the cyst wall of the endometrioma was associated with a reduced recurrence rate of the symptoms of dysmenorrhea (OR 0.15 CI 0.06–0.38), dyspareunia (OR 0.08 CI 0.01–0.51) and non-menstrual pelvic pain (OR 0.10 CI 0.02–0.56), a reduced rate of recurrence of the endometrioma (OR 0.41 CI 0.18–0.93) and with a reduced requirement for further surgery (OR 0.21 CI 0.05–0.79) than surgery to ablate the endometrioma. For those women subsequently attempting to conceive it was also associated with a subsequent increased spontaneous pregnancy rate in women who had documented prior sub-fertility (OR 5.21 CI 2.04–13.29). A further randomised study was identified that demonstrated an increased ovarian follicular response to gonadotrophin stimulation for women who had undergone excsional surgery when compared to ablative surgery (WMD 0.6 CI 0.04–1.16). There is insufficient evidence to favour excisional surgery over ablative surgery with respect to the chance of pregnancy after controlled ovarian stimulation and intra-uterine insemination (OR 1.40 CI 0.47–4.15).

Authors' Conclusions

There is good evidence that excisional surgery for endometriomata provides for a more favourable outcome than drainage and ablation with regard to the recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of pain symptoms, and in women who were previously subfertile, subsequent spontaneous pregnancy. Consequently this approach should be the favoured surgical approach. However in women who may subsequently may undergo fertility treatment insufficient evidence exists to determine the favoured surgical approach.

### Imaging modalities for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis [^115RTd9k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

About 10% of women of reproductive age suffer from endometriosis. Endometriosis is a costly chronic disease that causes pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy, the gold standard diagnostic test for endometriosis, is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, no non-invasive tests that can be used to accurately diagnose endometriosis are available in clinical practice. This is the first review of diagnostic test accuracy of imaging tests for endometriosis that uses Cochrane methods to provide an update on the rapidly expanding literature in this field.

Objectives

- To provide estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis and deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) versus surgical diagnosis as a reference standard.• To describe performance of imaging tests for mapping of deep endometriotic lesions in the pelvis at specific anatomical sites. Imaging tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests that would assist decision making regarding diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to 20 April 2015: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP, ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDION, DARE, and PubMed. Searches were not restricted to a particular study design or language nor to specific publication dates. The search strategy incorporated words in the title, abstracts, text words across the record and medical subject headings (MeSH).

Selection Criteria

We considered published peer-reviewed cross-sectional studies and randomised controlled trials of any size that included prospectively recruited women of reproductive age suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: endometrioma, pelvic endometriosis, DIE or endometriotic lesions at specific intrapelvic anatomical locations. We included studies that compared the diagnostic test accuracy of one or more imaging modalities versus findings of surgical visualisation of endometriotic lesions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently collected and performed a quality assessment of data from each study. For each imaging test, data were classified as positive or negative for surgical detection of endometriosis, and sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated. If two or more tests were evaluated in the same cohort, each was considered as a separate data set. We used the bivariate model to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity when sufficient data sets were available. Predetermined criteria for a clinically useful imaging test to replace diagnostic surgery included sensitivity ≥ 94% and specificity ≥ 79%. Criteria for triage tests were set at sensitivity ≥ 95% and specificity ≥ 50%, ruling out the diagnosis with a negative result (SnNout test - if sensitivity is high, a negative test rules out pathology) or at sensitivity ≥ 50% with specificity ≥ 95%, ruling in the diagnosis with a positive result (SpPin test - if specificity is high, a positive test rules in pathology).

Main Results

We included 49 studies involving 4807 women: 13 studies evaluated pelvic endometriosis, 10 endometriomas and 15 DIE, and 33 studies addressed endometriosis at specific anatomical sites. Most studies were of poor methodological quality. The most studied modalities were transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with outcome measures commonly demonstrating diversity in diagnostic estimates; however, sources of heterogeneity could not be reliably determined. No imaging test met the criteria for a replacement or triage test for detecting pelvic endometriosis, albeit TVUS approached the criteria for a SpPin triage test. For endometrioma, TVUS (eight studies, 765 participants; sensitivity 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87, 0.99), specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.92, 0.99)) qualified as a SpPin triage test and approached the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test, whereas MRI (three studies, 179 participants; sensitivity 0.95 (95% CI 0.90, 1.00), specificity 0.91 (95% CI 0.86, 0.97)) met the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test and approached the criteria for a SpPin test. For DIE, TVUS (nine studies, 12 data sets, 934 participants; sensitivity 0.79 (95% CI 0.69, 0.89) and specificity 0.94 (95% CI 0.88, 1.00)) approached the criteria for a SpPin triage test, and MRI (six studies, seven data sets, 266 participants; sensitivity 0.94 (95% CI 0.90, 0.97), specificity 0.77 (95% CI 0.44, 1.00)) approached the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test. Other imaging tests assessed in small individual studies could not be statistically evaluated.TVUS met the criteria for a SpPin triage test in mapping DIE to uterosacral ligaments, rectovaginal septum, vaginal wall, pouch of Douglas (POD) and rectosigmoid. MRI met the criteria for a SpPin triage test for POD and vaginal and rectosigmoid endometriosis. Transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) might qualify as a SpPin triage test for rectosigmoid involvement but could not be adequately assessed for other anatomical sites because heterogeneous data were scant. Multi-detector computerised tomography enema (MDCT-e) displayed the highest diagnostic performance for rectosigmoid and other bowel endometriosis and met the criteria for both SpPin and SnNout triage tests, but studies were too few to provide meaningful results. Diagnostic accuracies were higher for TVUS with bowel preparation (TVUS-BP) and rectal water contrast (RWC-TVS) and for 3.0TMRI than for conventional methods, although the paucity of studies precluded statistical evaluation.

Authors' Conclusions

None of the evaluated imaging modalities were able to detect overall pelvic endometriosis with enough accuracy that they would be suggested to replace surgery. Specifically for endometrioma, TVUS qualified as a SpPin triage test. MRI displayed sufficient accuracy to suggest utility as a replacement test, but the data were too scant to permit meaningful conclusions. TVUS could be used clinically to identify additional anatomical sites of DIE compared with MRI, thus facilitating preoperative planning. Rectosigmoid endometriosis was the only site that could be accurately mapped by using TVUS, TRUS, MRI or MDCT-e. Studies evaluating recent advances in imaging modalities such as TVUS-BP, RWC-TVS, 3.0TMRI and MDCT-e were observed to have high diagnostic accuracies but were too few to allow prudent evaluation of their diagnostic role. In view of the low quality of most of the included studies, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Future well-designed diagnostic studies undertaken to compare imaging tests for diagnostic test accuracy and costs are recommended.

After completion of a structured literature search and creation of draft algorithms by an executive committee, the expert panel of > 50 practicing gynecologists met for a 2-day consensus conference during which the clinical recommendations and algorithms were reviewed, refined, and then ratified by unanimous or near-unanimous votes.

Patient(S)

Women presenting with CPP who are likely to have endometriosis as the underlying cause.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

None.

Conclusion(S)

Chronic pelvic pain frequently occurs secondary to nongynecologic conditions that must be considered in the evaluation of affected women. For women in whom endometriosis is the suspected cause of the pain, laparoscopic confirmation of the diagnosis is unnecessary, and a trial of medical therapy, including second-line therapies such as danazol, GnRH agonists, and progestins, is justified provided that there are no other indications for surgery such as the presence of a suspicious adnexal mass. When surgery is necessary, laparoscopic approaches seem to offer comparable clinical outcomes to those performed via laparotomy, but with reduced morbidity. The balance of evidence supports the use of adjuvant postoperative medical therapy after conservative surgery for CPP. There is some evidence that adjuvant presacral neurectomy adds benefit for midline pain, but currently, there is inadequate evidence to support the use of uterosacral nerve ablation or uterine suspension. Hysterectomy alone has undocumented value in the surgical management of women with endometriosis-associated CPP.

### Predicting disease recurrence in patients with endometriosis: an observational study [^1166nQYQ]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The symptoms and appearance of endometriosis are heterogeneous. Furthermore, the clinical manifestation and responsiveness to treatments can change over time in individuals. This means there is no 'one shoe fits all' approach to managing and treating endometriosis, and in the absence of a failsafe cure, endometriosis disease recurrence is common (6–67%). Some previously reported risk factors for endometriosis recurrence include severe or deep disease, younger age and conservative surgery with conservation of the ovaries and uterus. Apprehension regarding recurrent disease is high among patients. 'What is the most effective way of stopping endometriosis progressing and/or spreading to other organs (eg after surgery)?' was listed in the top 10 endometriosis research priorities by consumers and health-care professionals in the UK and Ireland in 2017.

Recurrence of endometriosis in an individual following complete surgical excision can be defined as lesion recurrence on reoperation (with or without histological confirmation) or on imaging. However, symptom-based suspected recurrence, not proven by imaging and/or surgery, may also be considered a subtype of recurrent disease. With such broad definitions encapsulating recurrent endometriosis, it is not surprising the reported range of disease recurrence is so wide. Some limitations that prevent findings from being replicated include failure to report the duration of follow-up (or short follow-up periods), examination of specific lesions types, for example, endometrioma or deep lesions only, and failure to report if excision was complete, thus bringing into question the possibility of residual, rather than recurrent disease. Hence, the determinants for recurrence have not been established and the true prevalence of endometriosis recurrence remains unknown.

To improve long-term health outcomes for patients with endometriosis, it is important that we increase our understanding of why endometriosis lesions return in some individuals and learn which risk factors contribute to the probability of the disease recurrence. The aim of this study was to identify factors that are associated with increased risk for recurrent disease, specifically lesions returning, and to help predict probable risk of endometriosis recurrence.

### Clinical management of endometriosis [^115dnnW3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a common and challenging condition of reproductive-aged women that carries a high individual and societal cost. The many molecular dissimilarities between endometriosis lesions and eutopic endometrium create difficulties in the development of new drug therapies and treatments. Surgery remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, but it must be weighed against the risks of surgical morbidity and potential decreases in ovarian reserve, especially in the case of endometriomas. Safe and effective surgical techniques are discussed within this article for various presentations of endometriosis. Medical therapy is suppressive rather than curative, and regimens that are long-term and affordable with minimal side effects are recommended. Recurrences are common and often rapid when medical therapy is discontinued. Endometriosis in the setting of infertility is reviewed and appropriate management is discussed, including when and whether surgery is warranted in this at-risk population. In patients with chronic pain, central sensitization and myofascial pain are integral components of a multidisciplinary approach. Endometriosis is associated with an increased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer; however, the risk is low and currently no preventive screening is recommended. Hormone therapy for symptomatic women with postsurgical menopause should not be delayed as a result of concerns for malignancy or recurrence of endometriosis.

### Endometriosis and infertility: a committee opinion [^116SJhqY]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis — diagnosis and staging emphasize that laparoscopy is required for a definitive diagnosis and histologic evaluation is warranted when visual inspection is inconclusive; history and physical findings suggestive of endometriosis include cyclic or chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, a fixed retroverted uterus, an adnexal mass, and uterosacral ligament nodularity, thickening, or tenderness; ultrasound can help establish a presumptive diagnosis of an ovarian endometrioma but cannot reliably image peritoneal implants; the therapeutic benefit of laparoscopy to increase fecundity in mild disease is minimal and, accordingly, laparoscopy of asymptomatic women with infertility simply to rule out or confirm disease is unwarranted; disease heterogeneity ranges from a single 1 mm peritoneal implant to ≥ 10 cm endometriomas.

### Endometriosis MR mimickers: T1-hyperintense lesions [^1126TwBH]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Functional hemorrhagic ovarian cyst in a 28-year-old woman with dysmenorrhea and acute pelvic pain at the time of MRI, and no medical history. a Axial T1-W fat-suppressed MR image shows a T1-hyperintense left hemorrhagic ovarian cyst (arrow). b Axial T2-W MR image shows a heterogeneous cyst (arrow) with upper hypointense lace-like reticular areas (arrowhead) and lower fluid-fluid level (star) with T2 shading. c Axial T1-W contrast-enhanced subtracted MR image shows homogeneous hyperintense rim wall enhancement (arrow). d Axial diffusion-weighted MR image shows an equivalent hyperintense "DWI-ring sign" (arrowheads) compared to c

A diagnostic dilemma may arise in the case of a single and isolated micro-endometrioma (< 10 mm) or ovarian endometriotic implant (≤ 5 mm), in which differentiation with an involuting functional cyst on MRI is limited, and its visualization or characterization on ultrasound almost impossible. The use of gadolinium injection could be limited as peripheral ring enhancement may not be visible in small hemorrhagic cysts due to their small size or resolution. Therefore, uncertain diagnosis should be considered to avoid systematic false-positive diagnosis of endometriosis. Depending on the level of clinical suspicion and available treatment options, follow-up with MRI may aid in obtaining a definitive diagnosis.

Another pitfall is the presence of bilateral hemorrhagic cysts after controlled ovarian stimulation and follicular puncture, as many patients undergoing in vitro fertilization procedures are diagnosed with pelvic endometriosis, including endometriomas. In this scenario, the clinical context and surgical report specifying the side of and the timeframe since the surgical puncture are relevant for accurate diagnosis. Post-procedure hematomas usually present as bilateral and multiple hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, with moderate to high signal intensity on T1-WI, generally not exceeding 1 cm in diameter (Supplemental - Figure 2). Distinguishing between prior bilateral micro-endometriomas and post-procedure hematomas can be challenging. Depending on clinical impact, follow-up MRI performed after 8–12 weeks remains the optimal approach, as complete or partial resolution of hemorrhagic cysts can assist in the differential diagnosis.

### An evidence-based approach to assessing surgical versus clinical diagnosis of symptomatic endometriosis [^1125arYT]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

Challenges intrinsic to the accurate diagnosis of endometriosis contribute to an extended delay between the onset of symptoms and clinical confirmation. Intraoperative visualization, preferably with histologic verification, is considered by many professional organizations to be the gold standard by which endometriosis is diagnosed. Clinical diagnosis of symptomatic endometriosis via patient history, physical examination, and noninvasive tests, though more easily executed, is generally viewed as less accurate than surgical diagnosis. Technological advances and increased understanding of the pathophysiology of endometriosis warrant continuing reevaluation of the standard method for diagnosing symptomatic disease. A review of the published literature was therefore performed with the goal of comparing the accuracy of clinical diagnostic measures with that of surgical diagnosis. The current body of evidence suggests that clinical diagnosis of symptomatic endometriosis is more reliable than previously recognized and that surgical diagnosis has limitations that could be underappreciated. Regardless of the methodology used, women with suspected symptomatic endometriosis would be well served by a diagnostic paradigm that is reliable, conveys minimal risk of under- or over-diagnosis, lessens the time from symptom development to diagnosis, and guides the appropriate use of medical and surgical management strategies.

Endometriosis, an underdiagnosed and undertreated condition, affects 1 in 10 women and is associated with pain and infertility. Preoperative evaluation should include testing and management of other causes of pelvic pain. Ultrasonography can aid in surgical planning. Hormonal suppression improves symptoms, but should not be used to diagnose endometriosis, and is not shown to be effective in preventing disease recurrence nor in improving fertility. The goal of surgical management should be optimal removal or treatment of disease and should include measures for adhesion prevention. Rates of recurrence of endometriosis depend on the surgical completeness of removing the disease.

Endometriosis remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge despite decades of clinical experience and research. The multiple treatment options for endometriosis described in this symposium clearly indicate how difficult it can be to diagnose and effectively treat endometriosis with our current understanding of the disease. At least 3 major challenges to our understanding can be identified: (1) endometriosis does not always cause pain; (2) other causes of pelvic pain often coexists in patients with endometriosis; and (3) common medical and surgical treatments for endometriosis are relatively nonspecific. Insights from the articles in this symposium can help clinicians reach a new level of understanding of endometriosis and perhaps lead to more effective methods for diagnosing and treating this perplexing condition.

Despite 70 years of theories and experimentation, the cause is not clear, and it is likely that more than one mechanism is at work in most patients. Both medical and surgical treatments are available.

1. Introduction

Endometriosis, affecting approximately 10% of women of reproductive age worldwide, is a chronic inflammatory disease of uncertain etiology and a common cause of chronic pelvic pain (CPP). The prevalence may be underestimated because symptoms are very heterogeneous and complex, and surgical confirmation is necessary for definitive diagnosis with severity of symptoms not being related to the extent or location of disease found at surgery. Hence, patients often face diagnostic delays of up to 7 to 9 years. Typical symptoms, such as chronic noncyclical pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and many other associations (including infertility), drastically affect physical and mental function, quality of life, as well as social and sexual well-being in the affected women. Treatment options, both medical and surgical, are often insufficient or even fail in up to 50% of patients. Ineffective treatment of chronic pain contributes to the burden of suffering for those affected.

### Endometriosis… [^117WV3b5]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Symptoms can be very different from person to person, varying in range and intensity. About 25% of individuals have no symptoms, while for some it can be a debilitating disease. Common symptoms include pelvic pain, heavy and painful periods, pain with bowel movements, painful urination, pain during sexual intercourse, and infertility. Nearly half of those affected have chronic pelvic pain, while 70% feel pain during menstruation. Up to half of affected individuals are infertile. Besides physical symptoms, endometriosis can affect a person's mental health and social life. Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and medical imaging; however, a definitive diagnosis is made through laparoscopy. Other causes of similar symptoms include pelvic inflammatory disease, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and fibromyalgia. Endometriosis is often misdiagnosed and many patients report being incorrectly told their symptoms are trivial or normal.

Patients with endometriosis see an average of seven physicians before receiving a correct diagnosis. While there is no cure for endometriosis, several treatments may improve symptoms. This includes pain medication, hormonal treatments or surgery. The recommended pain medication is usually a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, such as naproxen. Taking the birth control pill continuously or using a hormonal IUD is another first-line treatment. Other types of hormonal treatment can be tried if the pill or IUD are not effective. Surgical removal of endometriosis may be used to treat those whose symptoms are not manageable with other treatments, or to treat infertility. Signs and symptoms Pain and infertility are common symptoms, although 20–25% of affected women are asymptomatic.

The presence of pain symptoms is associated with the type of endometrial lesions, as 50% of women with typical lesions, 10% of women with cystic ovarian lesions, and 5% of women with deep endometriosis do not have pain. The most severe pain is typically associated with menstruation. Pain can also start a week before a menstrual period, during, and even a week after a menstrual period, or it can be constant. The pain can be debilitating and result in emotional stress. Symptoms of endometriosis-related pain may include:

- Dysmenorrhea – painful, sometimes disabling cramps during the menstrual period; pain may get worse over time, also lower back pains linked to the pelvis.
- Chronic pelvic pain – typically accompanied by lower back pain or abdominal pain
- Dyspareunia – painful sexual intercourse
- Painful urination during period
- Mittelschmerz – pain associated with ovulation Compared with patients with superficial endometriosis, those with deep disease appear to be more likely to report shooting rectal pain and a sense of their insides being pulled down. Individual pain areas and intensity appear to be unrelated to the surgical diagnosis, and the area of pain is unrelated to the area of endometriosis. Diagnosis A health history and a physical examination can lead the health care practitioner to suspect endometriosis. Symptoms in combination with ultrasound or MRI imaging can lead to a presumed diagnosis of endometriosis. The gold standard for definite diagnosis is via surgery and a biopsy, but there is a shift away from requiring surgical confirmation before starting treatment to prevent delays.

### Evaluation and management of women with endometriosis [^113MzMa7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a condition that often leads to a variety of symptoms that range from pain complaints to infertility. Endometriosis is also found in women who are asymptomatic. The diagnosis of endometriosis can be made clinically with reliability similar to that of one made surgically. Medical treatment options are effective, as are surgical treatment options. Complications associated with surgery, however, push the balance in favor of medical therapy whenever possible. Based on the body of evidence available at present, women with endometriosis-related complaints should be treated with a first-line medical therapy. If that fails, a second-line medical therapy is warranted under most conditions. Laparoscopic surgery should be reserved for patients in whom second-line medical therapy has failed or is contraindicated by desire to conceive immediately or as soon as possible.

### Adolescent endometriosis [^113LnY2Z]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a cause of chronic, pelvic pain in adolescents. Lack of response to NSAIDS and OCPs should prompt further investigation and subsequent treatment. The goal of therapy is to minimize pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea primarily through long-term, medical therapy. Surgical intervention is principally indicated to establish a diagnosis. The poor response to surgical therapy negates the need for repetitive or radical surgery. Much patience and care should be directed toward these patients to provide them with an understanding of their disease and to help enhance the quality of their life.

### Sonographic evaluation for endometriosis in routine pelvic ultrasound [^115fukeA]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To show how the evaluation for endometriosis can be included in the routine pelvic ultrasound examination.

Design

Stepwise narrated video demonstration of the sonographic evaluation for endometriosis in routine pelvic ultrasound following the recommended sonographic approach published in the 2016 consensus paper by the International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) group [1].

Setting

Endometriosis is a common and often debilitating gynecological disorder that affects 5–10% of women [2]. The prevalence is even higher among women with symptoms of endometriosis [2], which include chronic pelvic pain, acquired dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, menorrhagia, abnormal bleeding, and infertility. Approximately 80% of women who have endometriosis have superficial lesions, whereas 20% have deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE; [3]). Laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis, because it allows the diagnosis of all forms of endometriosis and often immediate removal of superficial endometriosis. The removal of DIE is considerably more complicated and usually cannot be completed unless it was diagnosed preoperatively. The technique to diagnose DIE with transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) was first described in detail in 2009 [4]. Since then, the accuracy of TVUS for the prediction of DIE has been well established in the literature [5–7]. TVUS is widely used as a first-line investigation for women with gynecological symptoms. The inclusion of an assessment for endometriosis in the routine pelvic ultrasound allows earlier diagnosis and better surgical outcomes for all women with DIE.

Interventions

The evaluation for endometriosis in routine pelvic ultrasound based on the IDEA consensus promotes a 4-step dynamic ultrasound approach [1]: (1) routine evaluation of uterus and adnexa with particular attention for sonographic signs of adenomyosis and the presence or absence of endometriomas; (2) evaluation of transvaginal sonographic 'soft markers' such as site-specific tenderness and ovarian mobility; (3) assessment of status of pouch of Douglas using the real-time ultrasound-based "sliding sign"; and (4) assessment of DIE nodules in the anterior and posterior compartments, which involves assessment of the bladder, vaginal vault, uterosacral ligaments, and bowel, including rectum, rectosigmoid junction, and sigmoid colon. Because 5–10% of women with DIE also have ureteric endometriosis, it is useful to assess the kidneys. Silent hydronephrosis is easily identified in 50–60% of patients with ureteric involvement. Although it is possible to identify DIE involving the ureters more directly, this requires more advanced skills, and further studies are still needed to better define the accuracy of ureteric DIE detection by TVUS [8–10].

Conclusion

Traditionally, only pathologies of the uterus and ovaries are assessed during a routine pelvic ultrasound. Here we demonstrate that the routine ultrasound examination can easily be extended beyond the uterus and ovaries into the posterior and anterior pelvic compartments to evaluate structural mobility and to look for deep infiltrating endometriotic nodules, wherewith women suffering from DIE can benefit from a preoperative diagnosis and subsequently, a single, well-planned procedure in the hands of a well-prepared team.

### Optimal management of endometriosis and pain [^1127jVeL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of endometriosis-associated pain involves inflammatory and hormonal alterations and changes in brain signaling pathways. Although medical treatment can provide temporary relief, most patients can achieve long-term sustained pain relief when it is combined with surgical intervention. Owing to its complexity, there is an ongoing debate about how to optimally manage endometriosis-associated pain. We believe optimal management for this condition requires: 1) possible egg preservation in affected young patients with and without endometriomas; 2) preoperative medical suppression to inhibit ovulation and to avoid removal of functional cysts that might look like endometriomas; and 3) postoperative hormonal suppression to decrease recurrence, but this treatment should be modified according to disease severity, symptoms, and fertility goals.

### Clinical management of endometriosis [^111UybXm]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a relatively common chronic gynecologic disorder that usually presents with chronic pelvic pain or infertility. The societal effect of this disorder is enormous both in monetary costs and in quality of life. The diagnosis of the disease can only be definitively made with surgical intervention. Fertility may be enhanced with surgical intervention, but medical suppressive therapy has no role apart from in vitro fertilization. Assisted reproductive technology is associated with excellent outcomes. Management of endometriomas is particularly complex because surgical intervention may reduce ovarian reserve. Both medical and surgical treatment of endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain are effective in the short-term. Recurrence is common with both modalities. Recurrence after surgical intervention can be decreased with the use of postoperative suppressive medical therapy such as hormonal contraceptives. This article presents the different types of peritoneal disease found in endometriosis patients. The technique used to safely and completely remove the disease is discussed. The specific areas of involvement include the pelvic side wall, the cul-de-sac, and bladder peritoneum.

Endometriosis-associated pain (EAP) has a significant impact on the quality of life of those affected and their families. Recognizing that endometriosis is a chronic condition associated with an impairment in function and negative social impact, there is a shift toward reducing diagnostic delays and initiating timely management. This article provides a comprehensive and practical approach to the clinical diagnosis of EAP, which can subsequently facilitate prompt and directed treatment. The key components of the history, physical examination, and high-quality imaging to evaluate suspected EAP and related pain conditions are presented. Currently, biomarkers have limited utility in the diagnosis of endometriosis, but research in this area continues; development of a reliable noninvasive test for endometriosis may further improve early identification of this condition.

### Endometriosis and infertility: pathophysiology and management [^11164iEv]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Endometriosis and infertility are associated clinically. Medical and surgical treatments for endometriosis have different effects on a woman's chances of conception, either spontaneously or via assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Medical treatments for endometriosis are contraceptive. Data, mostly uncontrolled, indicate that surgery at any stage of endometriosis enhances the chances of natural conception. Criteria for non-removal of endometriomas are: bilateral cysts, history of past surgery, and altered ovarian reserve. Fears that surgery can alter ovarian function that is already compromised sparked a rule of no surgery before ART. Exceptions to this guidance are pain, hydrosalpinges, and very large endometriomas. Medical treatment-eg, 3–6 months of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues-improves the outcome of ART. When age, ovarian reserve, and male and tubal status permit, surgery should be considered immediately so that time is dedicated to attempts to conceive naturally. In other cases, the preference is for administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues before ART, and no surgery beforehand. The strategy of early surgery, however, seems counterintuitive because of beliefs that milder non-surgical options should be offered first and surgery last (only if initial treatment attempts fail). Weighing up the relative advantages of surgery, medical treatment and ART are the foundations for a global approach to infertility associated with endometriosis.

### Magnetic resonance imaging for deep infiltrating endometriosis: current concepts, imaging technique and key findings [^113Xahfr]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of deep endometriosis: current concepts

Endometriosis is a complex and heterogeneous disease that may manifest with three clinical patterns with increasing severity. Superficial peritoneal lesions are characterized by superficial implants of the pelvic peritoneum; ovarian endometriomas (OMA) are hemorrhagic cysts arising from ectopic endometrial tissue growing within the ovaries and less frequently outside the ovaries; and DIE leads to the most severe clinical pattern and is characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue penetrating deeper than 5 mm under the peritoneal surface, thus leading to local inflammation and consequently to fibrosis and muscular hyperplasia. DIE is usually found as a multifocal disease simultaneously involving multiple pelvic sites such as the Douglas pouch, the utero-sacral ligaments (USL), pelvic nerves, the rectum, the bladder, and the ureters (Table 1). The pathophysiology of such lesions is widely unknown; the type of lesion may vary over the life course, with no evidence supporting an ordered progression of endometriotic lesions. Similarly, the heterogeneity of symptoms is high. Women with endometriosis may experience dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, constipation, chronic pelvic pain and infertility; however, a clear characterization of the pain types and topologies of implants is lacking. Consequently, some women with minimal disease may report severe pelvic pain and infertility, whereas others with diffuse pelvic lesions can be almost asymptomatic. The heterogeneity of the disease and the uncertainties about its pathogenesis make its diagnosis challenging. For decades, laparoscopic visualization with histologic verification of lesions was considered the golden standard for diagnosis. However, laparoscopy, even if diagnostic, is not a risk-free surgery. Furthermore, deep infiltrating endometriosis may not be clearly seen in some cases during diagnosis laparoscopy. In fact, the diagnosis of adenomyosis and deep endometriosis involving retroperitoneal structures, particularly ureters and nerve roots, is extremely challenging, particularly when performed by non-experienced gynecologists. False negative procedures may result, thus significantly delaying the start of appropriate management and potentially leading to major complications. Symptoms and clinical findings of endometriosis can result in clinical diagnoses that may be strongly supported by imaging techniques even without histological confirmation. Transvaginal ultrasound, because of its non-invasiveness, dynamicity, ease of use, availability, cost-effectiveness and reproducibility, is currently considered by many endometriosis experts as the best first-line method for assessment of DIE. A systematic sonographic approach as defined by International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) consensus was shown to improve detection rates of pelvic lesions. MRI is also considered a highly accurate imaging modality in the evaluation of DIE, particularly when involvement of the rectum, ureters and nerve roots is suspected; these areas are highly important for both the patient and the surgeon and may be poorly visualized even with laparoscopy. MRI is also increasingly used to assess the anatomic response to medical or surgical treatment and to differentiate endometriosis from adenomyosis; the latter is a specific and heterogeneous disease contributing, independently of endometriosis to symptoms, defined as the invasion of endometrial tissue into the myometrium occurring in different forms (diffuse, focal, cystic or superficial). Adenomyosis may exist on its own but in about 30% of cases it is associated with DIE. The shift toward clinical and imaging-based diagnosis shortens the time between the first consultation and the final diagnosis, but the use of non-invasive methods requires a rigorous approach to ensure meaningful and consistent results.

### Pathophysiology and clinical implications of ovarian endometriomas [^112XdVLr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ovarian endometriomas affect many patients with endometriosis and have significant effects on quality of life, fertility, and risk of malignancy. Endometriomas range from small (1–3 cm), densely fibrotic cysts to large (20 cm or greater) cysts with varying degrees of fibrosis. Endometriomas are hypothesized to form from endometriotic invasion or metaplasia of functional cysts or alternatively from ovarian surface endometriosis that bleeds into the ovarian cortex. Different mechanisms of endometrioma formation may help explain the phenotypic variability observed among endometriomas. Laparoscopic surgery is the preferred first-line modality of diagnosis and treatment of endometriomas. Ovarian cystectomy is preferred over cyst ablation or sclerotherapy for enabling pathologic diagnosis, improving symptoms, preventing recurrence, and optimizing fertility outcomes. Cystectomy for small, densely adherent endometriomas is made challenging by dense fibrosis of the cyst capsule obliterating the plane with normal ovarian cortex, whereas cystectomy for large endometriomas can carry unique challenges as a result of adhesions between the cyst and pelvic structures. Preoperative and postoperative hormonal suppression can improve operative outcomes and decrease the risk of endometrioma recurrence. Whether the optimal management, fertility consequences, and malignant potential of endometriomas vary on the basis of size and phenotype remains to be fully explored.

TREATMENT INDICATIONS

Goals of treatment for endometrioma include relieving symptoms, ruling out malignancy, treating or preventing ovarian torsion, improving fertility outcomes, preserving ovarian hormonal function, and minimizing recurrence. Because ovarian endometriomas are rarely isolated and more commonly occur concurrently with nonovarian endometriosis, surgical excision of both ovarian and nonovarian lesions is often indicated. In some circumstances, surveillance may be appropriate for asymptomatic patients who are evaluated to be at low risk for torsion or malignancy on the basis of mass size (generally less than 5 cm) and appearance and patient characteristics, including age and family history.

Case presentation

The 34-year old, first gravida, was admitted to our obstetrical department by ambulance at 23 + 0 weeks of gestation (WG) with progressive severe pain over 24 h in the left lower abdomen irradiating to the rectum and the vagina. The previous day, she had an unremarkable clinical and sonographic examination and a normal laboratory investigation. Her past medical history included a conization due to cervical dysplasia, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia with suspected endometriosis, and the use of a combined oral contraceptive for 16 years prior to the current pregnancy. The pregnancy occurred spontaneously, with a single fetus. The otherwise healthy patient showed pain on palpation in the two lower abdominal quadrants: speculum examination revealed cervical ectopy and two black dots were visible at six o'clock. The vital signs were normal with an unremarkable pulse, respiratory rate, body temperature, blood pressure, and the hemoglobin was stable at 129 g/l. The laboratory tests and urine analysis showed no signs of infection. The cardiotocogram (CTG) was normal without contractions. Cervical length was 34 mm, measured by transvaginal ultrasound. Fetal sonography and Doppler studies revealed normal biometry with a fetus appropriate for gestational age at 42nd percentile, normal amniotic fluid, a posterior wall placenta without signs of hematoma and a normal uteroplacental resistance. Caudal and adjacent to the left ovary, a solid, ill-defined adnexal mass of 40x45mm and moderate blood flow was detected (Fig. 1 a, b). On MRI, the adnexal mass was seen and was suggestive of endometriosis (Fig. 2 a and b). There were no signs of intraabdominal free fluid or kidney stones.

### Surgery for endometriosis: beyond medical therapies [^115MpK3Q]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain and subfertility may be managed medically in many cases; however, the surgical management of this insidious disease remains a necessary part of the treatment algorithm. Laparoscopy for diagnosis alone is rarely indicated with the advancements in preoperative imaging. When surgery is performed, the ideal goal would be a therapeutic and effective surgical intervention based on the preoperative evaluation. Surgery for women with pain due to endometriosis may be indicated in patients who cannot or do not wish to take medical therapies; acute surgical or pain events; deep endometriosis; during concomitant management of other gynecologic disorders; and patients seeking fertility with pain. The role of surgery for endometriosis-related subfertility may be considered in those with hydrosalpinges undergoing IVF; management of ovarian endometriomas in specific circumstances; and when a patient requests surgery as an alternative to assisted reproductive technology (ART). Surgery for ovarian endometriomas requires special attention due to the risk of potential harm on future fertility. Finally, a combined approach of surgery followed by postoperative medical therapy offers the best long-term outcomes for recurrence of disease and symptoms. A patient-centered approach and a goal-oriented approach are essential when determining the options for care in this population.

### Acute abdominal pain in women of reproductive age: keys to suggest a complication of endometriosis [^115ECRfr]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Endometriosis is a common disease, which can present with a variety of symptoms, and not exclusively chronic symptoms. A complication of endometriosis should always be kept in mind as a possible cause for acute symptoms in a woman of reproductive age, and the patient's history should always be asked for and considered. MRI is the best imaging modality to reach the diagnosis of endometriosis, but an accurate diagnosis is possible on CT, especially in the presence of stellar, mildly enhanced, infiltrative lesions in suggestive areas. Save the complications of endometriomas, the main differential diagnoses are malignant tumors.

### Dysmenorrhea… [^1165hTtr]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Dysmenorrhea can occur without an underlying problem. Underlying issues that can cause dysmenorrhea include uterine fibroids, adenomyosis, and most commonly, endometriosis. It is more common among those with heavy periods, irregular periods, those whose periods started before twelve years of age and those who have a low body weight. A pelvic exam and ultrasound in individuals who are sexually active may be useful for diagnosis. Conditions that should be ruled out include ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, interstitial cystitis and chronic pelvic pain. Signs and symptoms The main symptom of dysmenorrhea is pain concentrated in the lower abdomen or pelvis. It is also commonly felt in the right or left side of the abdomen. It may radiate to the thighs and lower back. Dysmenorrhea is associated with increased pain sensitivity and heavy menstrual bleeding. For many, primary dysmenorrhea symptoms gradually subside after their mid-20s.

Pregnancy has also been demonstrated to lessen the severity of dysmenorrhea, when menstruation resumes. However, dysmenorrhea can continue until menopause. 5–15% of women with dysmenorrhea experience symptoms severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Causes There are two types of dysmenorrhea, primary and secondary, based on the absence or presence of an underlying cause. Primary dysmenorrhea occurs without an associated underlying condition, while secondary dysmenorrhea has a specific underlying cause, typically a condition that affects the uterus or other reproductive organs. Secondary dysmenorrhea is the type of dysmenorrhea caused by another condition such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, uterine adenomyosis, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Rarely, birth defects, intrauterine devices, certain cancers, and pelvic infections cause secondary dysmenorrhea.

If the pain occurs between menstrual periods, lasts longer than the first few days of the period, or is not adequately relieved by the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or hormonal contraceptives, this could indicate another condition causing secondary dysmenorrhea. Membranous dysmenorrhea is a type of secondary dysmenorrhea in which the entire lining of the uterus is shed all at once rather than over the course of several days as is typical. Signs and symptoms include spotting, bleeding, abdominal pain, and menstrual cramps. The resulting uterine tissue is called a decidual cast and must be passed through the cervix and vagina. It typically takes the shape of the uterus itself. Membranous dysmenorrhea is extremely rare and there are very few reported cases. The underlying cause is unknown, though some evidence suggests it may be associated with ectopic pregnancy or the use of hormonal contraception.

When laparoscopy is used for diagnosis, the most common cause of dysmenorrhea is endometriosis, in approximately 70% of adolescents. Other causes of secondary dysmenorrhea include leiomyoma, adenomyosis, ovarian cysts, pelvic congestion, and cavitated and accessory uterine mass. Three distinct possible phenotypes have been identified for dysmenorrhea which include "multiple severe symptoms", "mild localized pain", and "severe localized pain". While there are likely differences in genotypes underlying each phenotype, the specific correlating genotypes have not yet been identified. These phenotypes are prevalent at different levels in different population demographics, suggesting different allelic frequencies across populations. The occurrence and frequency of secondary dysmenorrhea has been associated with different alleles and genotypes of those with underlying pathologies, which can affect the pelvic region or other areas of the body.

### Endometriosis and pelvic pain for the gastroenterologist [^1168WMDH]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis, affecting 5–10% of reproductive-age women, is a common contributor to dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain. Diagnosis requires laparoscopic tissue biopsy, but careful pelvic examination, and/or imaging with either ultrasound or MRI, may identify patients who should receive empiric first-line therapy. The presence of dyschezia, particularly with cyclical exacerbation, should raise suspicion for bowel or rectovaginal septum involvement, and a greater need for surgical management. Treatment of dysmenorrhea includes hormonal suppression of the menstrual cycle, and/or analgesics; more severe cases with strong pain and disability may require earlier surgical intervention to excise disease while preserving fertility desires.

### Laparoscopic single-stapler technique in rectosigmoid resection in women with deep infiltrating endometriosis [^111KWntp]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To demonstrate the use of a single-stapler technique during rectosigmoid resection in women with deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE).

Design

A step-by-step video demonstration of rectosigmoid resection and end-to-end anastomosis using two circularly placed sutures and one circular stapler.

Setting

Institute for the Care of Mother and Child, Prague, Czech Republic.

Patient(S)

A 39-year-old woman presented with primary sterility and deep infiltrating endometriosis, and an EZIAN score of A2, B2, C3. A nodule was located 9 cm from the anus and was 38 × 9 mm in size. This included an intramural fibroma of 6 cm and a left-sided ovarian endometriotic cyst of 6 cm. Her pain on the visual analogue scale were dysmenorea 6, dyspareunia 5–6, dyschezie 7, dysuria 0, and acyclic pain 5.

Interventions

The primary objective was to replace the linear-stapler resection with two simple, strictly circularly placed sutures, to cut the intestinal wall between them, and to form the end-to-end anastomosis with a circular stapler. The one-stapler technique consisted of the following steps: intestinal wall cleansing as in the limited segmental resection; placement of one strictly circular suture just below the DIE nodule, without fixation; placement of the first circular suture just below the DIE nodule, ideally with at least three full-thickness "bites" of the intestinal wall; placement of the second circular stitch approximately 2 cm below the first one in a similar manner (three full-thickness "bites"); interruption of the intestinal wall with a harmonic scalpel; end-to-end intestinal anastomosis with a circular stapler; and airtightness test of the anastomosis. This results in only one incision line and therefore a lower risk of leakage. Intestinal resection time was on average 10 minutes longer compared to that for the linear stapler technique. So far, we have successfully performed the procedure in 25 women. Perioperative leakage was observed in two of these 25 patients in the classical procedure group and in none of the 25 patients in the group with the one-stapler technique. There were no differences in C-reactive protein (CRP) on third and fifth postoperative days or in other complications such as bleeding and pyrexia). The cost of procedure is lowered by the decrease in the number of staplers from 3 to 1. The patients' postoperative follow-up was uneventful, and they were discharged from the hospital at the same time as the women in whom the classical stapler technique was performed.

Main Outcome Measures(S)

The primary outcome was the development of a new surgical approach to resection rectosigmoid endometriotic nodules that would decrease the number of incision lines on the intestine. The secondary outcome measures were peri- and postoperative complications (i.e., bleeding, intestinal leakage, postoperative infection, CRP), length of the surgery and hospitalization, and cost of the procedure.

Conclusion

Multiple incision lines following resection of the rectosigmoid colon and end-to-end anastomosis are risk factors for postoperative intestinal leakage. Therefore, a single incision line formed with two circular sutures, and one circular stapler may reduce the risk of postoperative complications and also financial expenses of the procedure. We believe that this method is suitable and easiest for nodules located less than 6 cm from the anal verge because of possible complications with angulation of linear stapler.

### Pathophysiology and clinical implications of ovarian endometriomas [^1114Vaox]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

SURGICAL MANAGEMENT

Definitive diagnosis of endometrioma is histologic, and surgery can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Since the 1980s, video laparoscopy with and without robotic assistance has become the preferred approach over laparotomy on account of improved operative outcomes and visualization of anatomy. – In 1986, Nezhat et alreported video laparoscopic management of all stages of endometriosis, including endometriomas. Risk of conversion to open surgery is low but relatively higher for patients with endometriomas than with other types of adnexal masses (5.1% vs 3.5%).

Surgical approaches include ovarian cystectomy with stripping of the cyst wall, cyst drainage and ablation, and sclerotherapy. Cyst aspiration alone is associated with high recurrence rates (greater than 80%) and is not recommended as sole treatment. Cystectomy is associated with reduced rates of recurrence, reoperation, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain, as well as increased spontaneous pregnancy rate, compared with ablation. – In the short term, postoperative anti-müllerian hormone decline may be the highest after cystectomy, but cystectomy is also associated with higher postoperative conception rates and lower rates of cyst recurrence compared with ablation and sclerotherapy.

Endometrioma surgery begins with inspection of the pelvis and adhesiolysis. Peritoneal washings should be collected before cyst manipulation. Cystectomy typically proceeds with creation of an incision along the cyst away from the hilum. Laparoscopic graspers are then used to create traction and countertraction and to strip the cyst wall from the ovary. Care should be taken to avoid excess trauma to the normal ovarian tissue and damage to the ovarian hilum. Injection of dilute vasopressin under the cyst capsule defines the plane between the cyst and the normal ovary and decreases bleeding. To achieve hemostasis of the ovarian bed, hemostatic sealants, suture, and sparing electrosurgery may be used. A number of small, randomized trials have demonstrated greater decline in ovarian reserve markers with the use of electrosurgery for hemostasis compared with hemostatic agents or suture.

### Excisional surgery versus ablative surgery for ovarian endometriomata [^112qdz8s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Endometriomata are endometriotic deposits within the ovary. The surgical management of these blood filled cysts is controversial. The laparoscopic approach to the management of endometriomata is favoured for as it offers the advantage of a shorter hospital stay, faster patient recovery and decreased hospital costs. Currently the commonest procedures for the treatment of ovarian endometriomata are either excision of the cyst capsule or drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst wall.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to determine the most effective technique of treating an ovarian endometrioma; either excision of the cyst capsule or drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst wall, with regard to relief of pain, recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of symptoms and the subsequent spontaneous pregnancy rate.

Search Strategy

The reviewers searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group specialised register of trials (searched 15 Nov 2004), the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966-Nov 2004), EMBASE (1980- Nov 2004) and reference lists of articles, the handsearching of relevant journals and conference proceedings and by contacting leaders in the field of endoscopic surgery throughout the world.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of excision of the cyst capsule versus drainage and electrocoagulation of the cyst in the management of ovarian endometriomata.

Data Collection and Analysis

Reviewers assessed eligibility and trial quality.

Main Results

No randomised studies of the management of endometriomata by laparotomy were found. Two randomised studies of the laparoscopic management of ovarian endometriomata of greater than 3cm in size were included. Laparoscopic excision of the cyst wall of the endometrioma was associated with a reduced rate of recurrence of the endometrioma (OR 0.41 CI 0.18–0.93), reduced requirement for further surgery (OR 0.21 CI 0.05–0.79), reduced recurrence rate of the symptoms of dysmenorrhoea (OR 0.15 CI 0.06–0.38), dyspareunia OR 0.08 CI 0.01–0.51) and non-menstrual pelvic pain (OR 0.10 CI 0.02–0.56). It was also associated with a subsequent increased rate of spontaneous pregnancy women who had documented prior sub-fertility (OR 5.21 CI 2.04–13.29).

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence that excisional surgery for endometriomata provides for a more favourable outcome than drainage and ablation, with regard to the recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of symptoms and subsequent spontaneous pregnancy in women who were previously subfertile. Consequently this approach should be the favoured surgical approach. However we found no data as to the effect of either approach in women who subsequently undergo assisted reproductive techniques.

Recurrence of endometrioma after surgical management is on the order of 30–50%. – Risk factors for cyst recurrence include younger age, prior treatment of endometriosis, larger cyst size, bilateral ovarian involvement, ablation or sclerotherapy rather than cystectomy, and overall burden of endometriosis at surgery. Ovulation inhibition, through either postoperative hormonal treatment or pregnancy, has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrence, and medical ovulation inhibition should be considered in patients who do not desire immediate pregnancy.–

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^115eEvNn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pain, is the most common menstrual symptom among adolescent girls and young women. Most adolescents experiencing dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea, defined as painful menstruation in the absence of pelvic pathology. When the patient's history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment should be initiated. When a patient does not experience clinical improvement for her dysmenorrhea within 3–6 months of therapy initiation, her obstetrician-gynecologist should investigate for possible secondary causes and for treatment adherence. Secondary dysmenorrhea refers to painful menses due to pelvic pathology or a recognized medical condition. Endometriosis is the leading cause of secondary dysmenorrhea in adolescents. Endometriosis should be considered in patients with persistent, clinically significant dysmenorrhea despite treatment with hormonal agents and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, particularly if no other etiology for chronic pelvic pain or secondary dysmenorrhea has been identified based on history, physical examination, and pelvic ultrasonography. The appearance of endometriosis may be different in an adolescent than in an adult woman. In adolescents, endometriotic lesions are typically clear or red and can be difficult to identify for gynecologists unfamiliar with endometriosis in adolescents. Endometriosis in adolescents is considered a chronic disease with potential for progression if left untreated. The goals of therapy include symptom relief, suppression of disease progression, and protection of future fertility. Therapy must be individualized, and obstetrician-gynecologists should consider patient choice, the need for contraception, contraindications to hormone use, and potential adverse effects and counsel the adolescent and her family on treatment options.

### Time for global health policy and research leaders to prioritize endometriosis [^111cZZ4v]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Heterogeneous presentation of endometriosis impedes diagnosis and treatment

Most pelvic endometriosis comprises three subtypes: superficial peritoneal, ovarian cysts ("endometrioma"), and deep disease. Symptom manifestation and severity vary, and underdiagnosis is common due to erroneous symptom normalization and overlap with other diseases. Recently, refined imaging techniques identify, with high accuracy, ovarian and deep disease, but reliance on surgical visualisation for the most common superficial peritoneal lesions continues to impede timely diagnosis. Surgery or imaging requires access to healthcare services, which varies significantly across socio-economic and racial/ethnically underserved groups and geographies. Average diagnostic delay is 7 years after symptom onset, with delays > 10 years not uncommon. There remains no reliable non-invasive biomarker of any endometriosis subtype.

Treatment of pain symptoms falls broadly into surgical removal of disease and associated adhesions and hormonal suppressive therapies, including combined oral contraceptive steroids, progestins, gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues, androgens and aromatase inhibitors. Medical therapies that decrease oestrogen (or counter oestrogen action) are prescribed, because steroids play a key role in the pathophysiology of endometriosis. Unfortunately, both approaches are suboptimal. Surgery is associated with recurrence rates up to 50% within 5 years, and contraceptive hormone treatments often have unacceptable side effects and are counterproductive to fertility goals. Geographic and financial barriers to accessing treatment from endometriosis-trained healthcare providers are common. Surveys of patients consistently highlight symptom relief and improved medical therapies that do not limit fertility as a top priority for research. Historically, pharmaceutical companies were reluctant to develop new drugs for endometriosis, and focus has been on variations of hormonal, anti-inflammatory, or repurposed therapies, lacking revolutionary impact. While novel treatment discovery is essential, clinical trials for endometriosis have been plagued by widespread variations in outcome reporting, and only a fraction of completed trials is published.

Emerging chronic pelvic pain-focused therapies that include considerations of neuropathic and nociceptive pathways have not been adequately studied. Those with persistent/recurrent pain have a high rate of hysterectomywhich does not eliminate pain recurrence and may heighten risks for multiple conditions later in life. Further, commonly reported life-impacting concerns including fatigue and impaired sexual functioning have yet to be targeted for treatment among patients with endometriosis. A critical impediment to discovery of novel diagnostics and treatments and personalized approaches is the lack of a prognostically correlated classification of the highly heterogenous presentation of endometriosis lesion types and symptoms, which includes variation and evolution within patients across the life-course.

### Developing symptom-based predictive models of endometriosis as a clinical screening tool: results from a multicenter study [^1148va53]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

The models predicting stage III and IV endometriosis (± ultrasound evidence) showed much better performance. However, the model that included ultrasound evidence showed better performance, which is not surprising given the value of ultrasound to diagnose ovarian endometriomasand deep infiltrating endometriosis affecting the bowel. Optimal model cut-offs resulted in sensitivities of 70.9% and 82.3%, and specificities of 84.7% and 75.8%, for models excluding and including ultrasound evidence, respectively. In contrast to any-stage models, only marginal improvement could potentially be gained by excluding variables with inconsistent association with stage III and IV endometriosis across the data from phases I and II; this relative consistency in association across phases provided further evidence of the superior predictability of stage III and IV endometriosis over "any stage" disease.

The stage III and IV endometriosis models could, in addition to ultrasound and physical examination, be used to prioritize women presenting with symptoms for laparoscopy in clinical practice, that is, mirroring the setting in which the present study was conducted, or to initiate medical therapies sometimes reserved until a surgical diagnosis of endometriosis has been made. To what extent the models have predictive power in other settings (e.g. self-selected women with pelvic pain symptoms in the general population) is unknown, and therefore the utility of the tool should not be advocated for this purpose. Indeed, although identifying a noninvasive diagnostic test for endometriosis is an explicit priority in endometriosis research, other authors have cautioned that such a tool could be misappropriated as a population screening tool for a disease that may not fit a population screening model.

### Laparoscopic double discoid colorectal resection for the treatment of two distinct deep endometriotic nodules [^111reCWX]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To show the surgical steps used to perform a laparoscopic double discoid colorectal resection for the excision of 2 distinct deep endometriotic nodules (DENs).

Design

Stepwise demonstration of the technique with narrated video footage.

Setting

To date there is agreement that discoid resection should be the first choice procedure in patients eligible for surgical treatment with rectal, unifocal DENs measuring ≤ 3 cm [1–3]. For surgical management of lesions of the sigmoid colon, current international guidelines suggest to perform segmental resections [3]. Data on surgical treatment of multiple colorectal DENs separated by a great distance from each other are very limited, mostly owing to the rarity of such a diagnosis. In particular, there is paucity of data concerning the efficacy and safety of a double discoid resection for surgical management of distinct DENs found in the sigmoid colon and rectum [4]. In a context of multiple colorectal DENs, the decision-making process with respect to a double discoid excision must take into consideration both the distance between the 2 nodules and the nodules' distance from anal verge. When technically feasible, such organ-sparing surgery allows preserving the healthy bowel interposed between the endometriotic lesions, seeming to offer advantages in terms of quicker return of bowel function and better rectal functional outcomes than segmental colorectal resection.

Interventions

The patient was a 36-year-old woman experiencing drug treatment failure and presenting with refractory constipation, dyschezia, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, cyclical abdominal bloating, and chronic pelvic pain. Preoperative ultrasonography revealed the presence of an endometriotic nodule of 19 × 6 × 16 mm deeply infiltrating the tunica muscularis of the sigmoid colon. A second DEN was found at the level of the rectum, the latter measuring 19 × 5 × 12 mm and having a distance of 9 cm from the anal verge. Both the intestinal lesions resulted to have a circumferential extent of 30%. The distance between the 2 nodules was 15 cm. A 3-dimensional laparoscopy was performed. Sigmoid colon and rectal mobilization were performed according to our standardized technique [5–7]. A 31-mm circular stapler was used to excise first the nodule of the sigmoid colon. The stapler, in its closed position, was gently introduced into the rectum via the anus and then progressively advanced inside the large bowel up to the level of the sigmoid nodule. After correct positioning, the stapler was completely opened and the nodule was imbricate between the anvil and staple housing of the stapler. Then, the stapler was closed and fired. The procedure was repeated using a second 31 mm circular stapler to resect the rectal endometriotic nodule. The overall operative time was 90 minutes. The estimated blood loss was 5 mL. Neither intra- nor postoperative complications occurred. The patient was discharged 3 days after surgery. The sigmoid colon and rectal endometriotic nodules measured, respectively, 20 × 6 × 15 mm and 20 × 5 × 12 mm on fresh unfixed specimens. Both nodules were found to have endometriosis-free surgical margins on definitive pathology.

Conclusions

The operative technique displayed in this video may contribute to the standardization of a procedure, which could be included among the options available in the surgical armamentarium, to be used in selected cases of multiple colorectal DENs each having 3 cm or less in diameter. Surgeon experience and an adequate preoperative evaluation are of utmost importance to plan the operative strategy and have the best chance of surgical success.

### Bladder endometriosis: management by cystoscopic and laparoscopic approaches [^1149cKaA]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Endometriosis of the urinary system accounts for less than 1% of all endometriosis, wherein bladder endometriosis is the most common. Bladder endometriosis is defined as endometriosis infiltrating the detrusor muscle and represents 85% of urinary tract endometriosis [1,2]. Segmental bladder resection/partial cystectomy is the bladder-preserving surgery and offers the complete removal of bladder endometriotic nodules [3,4]. Laparoscopic/robotic excision increases the chances of complete removal of nodules but may lead to inadvertent removal of excess bladder wall and increase the risk of complications, especially in cases of large lesions in close proximity to ureteric orifices. Thus, simultaneous laparoscopy and cystoscopy offers the most effective way of complete resection of bladder endometriotic nodules, relieving symptoms and minimizing intraoperative and postoperative complications and recurrence rates in patients [5–11]. This article with accompanying video describes the systematic approach and step-by-step surgical excision of a bladder endometriotic nodule in a patient with frozen pelvis.

Design

Step-by-step surgical excision of a bladder endometriotic nodule by simultaneous cystoscopy and laparoscopy. (Canadain Task Force classification: level III) SETTING: Jyoti Hospital and Minimum Invasive Surgery Center, Ahmedabad, India.

Patient

A 41-year-old women, P2L2, presented with cyclical dysmenorrhea, dysuria, and chronic pelvic pain. Informed consent was obtained from the patient, and the local institutional board provided the approval.

Intervention

Simultaneous cystoscopy and laparoscopy.

Measurements and Main Results

A preoperative assessment was done with transvaginal ultrasonography with a partially full bladder that showed an intravesical 3-cm endometriotic nodule along with chocolate cysts of the ovary and adenomyosis of the uterus. A simultaneous cystoscopy by a urologist and laparoscopy by a gynecologist was performed. On cystoscopy the nodule was seen away from both the ureteric orifices. The nodule was marked cystoscopically with a monopolar needle and laparoscopically with bipolar scissors. Laparoscopy began with a full inspection of the abdomen, pelvis, and adhesions. Dissection started from the left round ligament, and both paravesical spaces were dissected gently, keeping the bladder partially full. Good uterine manipulation helped to delineate vaginal fornices during dissection. Dissection continued over the isthmus, and bladder was gently separated from the isthmus. The bladder was partially filled with methylene blue and intentionally cut opened to excise the demarcated bladder nodule with a monopolar hook, taking a disease-free margin of 5 mm [12]. Two stay sutures were taken at both the lateral angles of the bladder, and suture ends were brought outside the abdomen to facilitate closure of the bladder transversely. After mobilization of the bladder, both uterine vascular bundles were desiccated with bipolar and laparoscopic hysterectomy. Vaginal closure was done away from bladder stitches. The patient was discharged on day 3 with catheter and DJ stents. On day 21, 3-dimensional computed tomography cystogram showed adequate bladder volume. Catheter and DJ stents were removed, low-pressure cystoscopy showed a smooth stitch line with mucosa over it and no residual endometriosis. The patient was found to have no symptoms at the 2-year follow up.

Conclusion

The video demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneous laparoscopic and cystoscopic approach for excision of a bladder endometriotic nodule. Marking the nodule by simultaneous cystoscopy and laparoscopy before excision helps in removing the disease completely and avoiding unnecessary normal bladder wall excision, thus reducing the risk of recurrence and resultant small bladder symptoms.

The endometrioma represents the key differential diagnosis of haemorrhagic ovarian cysts. Affecting 10% of women of reproductive age, endometriosis is defined by growth of ectopic endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which bleeds synchronously with the endometrium. Clinically, endometriosis is suggested by cyclic perimenstrual pain and by other manifestations such as dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, infertility and pain during defecation. Although dysmenorrhoea and chronic pelvic pain represent the classic clinical presentation, a sudden onset with acute pelvic pain may also occur. Because of the great clinical variability of the disease, delayed diagnosis up to 7–10 years after initial symptoms is common.

### Acute abdominal pain in women of reproductive age: keys to suggest a complication of endometriosis [^1118R2SL]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic strategy

The diagnosis of acute abdominal or pelvic pain related to endometriosis is difficult for several reasons: these complications are rare; they can be dismissed as dysmenorrhea in patients with known endometriosis or can reveal a previously unknown endometriosis. However, acute events in women with endometriosis can represent life-threating conditions that require emergent medical treatment and, more often, surgical management. Therefore, we have collected useful data to provide guidance when evoking a complication of endometriosis in a patient with a clinical picture of acute abdomen:
Integrate a context consistent with endometriosis, if endometriosis is unknown: Women of childbearing age; History of chronic pelvic pain or symptoms such as intermenstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia or dysuria; Infertility of unknown cause; Previous imaging showing a complex ovarian mass or a hydrosalpinx.
Analyze the type of pain, look for an epidemiological context and imaging signs which can be integrated in a context of acute complications of endometriosis (Table 2).
Look for other imaging features suggestive of deep endometriosis: Pelvic hemorrhagic or fibrotic implants; Endometriomas; Kissing ovaries.

### Introduction: management of endometriosis: moving toward a problem-oriented and patient-centered approach [^1164mTCn]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a protean disease, and its manifestations, associated clinical problems, and possible treatments are numerous. Deep endometriosis that infiltrates multiple pelvic organs should be considered the most severe endometriotic form that poses the most difficult therapeutic uncertainties in both infertility and pelvic pain symptoms limiting quality of life. The available evidence demonstrates that endometriosis is not only a gynecologic disorder but, contrary to previous belief, its impact extends into pregnancy, delivery, and the post-partum period. The old clinical tenet that pregnancy is a cure for endometriosis may be revealed as fallacious. Safe and effective modalities to reduce the risk of the recurrence of symptoms and lesions after conservative surgery for endometriosis are now available. These treatment options should be offered post-operatively to women not immediately seeking conception. Endometriosis is associated with a moderate increase in ovarian cancer risk. However, as there are no definitive demonstrations that endometriosis constitutes per se a pre-neoplastic condition, it seems currently unwise to set-up a screening program to detect undiagnosed endometriosis in asymptomatic women. Endometriosis is not a cancer; therefore a paradigm shift from treatment of lesions to treatment of symptoms is warranted. Management should be shaped on the main clinical problem, taking into consideration a woman's preferences and priorities. Quantitative information should be provided to describe the potential benefits, potential harms, and costs of each treatment alternative. Counseling should be complete and transparent, and the duty of the caring gynecologist is to inform the woman on the pros and cons of each option and support her in the shared decision-making process. The physician should be able to explain in detail all the available treatments, and not only those that the physician prefers or is able to offer.

Patient Selection

Diagnosis

Historically, a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis required laparoscopic lesion visualization and excision with histologic confirmation of endometrial gland, endometrial stroma, and/or hemosiderin-laden macrophage presence. However, even in the absence of a definitive diagnosis, many professional society treatment recommendations permit the use of empiric therapy when there is a strong suspicion or clinical evidence of endometriosis. For example, guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) give a Level B recommendation to empiric therapy with a 3-month course of a GnRH agonist in women with chronic pelvic pain who have undergone an appropriate pretreatment evaluation and in whom oral contraceptives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have failed, noting the patient should be informed that treatment response does not confirm an endometriosis diagnosis.

The criteria for suspecting endometriosis differ among guidelines, but generally include the presence of pelvic pain symptoms (progressively worsening dysmenorrhea [particularly when severe and unresponsive to NSAIDs and/or hormonal-based therapies], NMPP, and deep dyspareunia), which may be augmented by physical findings (e.g. pelvic tenderness and nodularity on palpation of the uterosacral ligaments and rectovaginal septum), imaging results, and/or cyclical nongynecologic symptoms (dyschezia, dysuria, hematuria and rectal bleeding, diarrhea/irritable bowel syndrome, and shoulder pain). When symptoms are cyclic in nature and progressive over time, endometriosis is by far the most likely clinical diagnosis.

It is increasingly recognized that identification of endometriosis can be achieved with reasonable certainty using nonsurgical methodologies (i.e. a clinical diagnosis), which include evaluation of pelvic pain symptoms, patient history, physical examination findings, and appropriately performed imaging studies. Although there has yet to be identified a replacement test or tests for diagnostic surgery, clinicians with expertise in endometriosis diagnosis and management have suggested that symptoms, patient history, and clinical assessments taken in totality provide a basis for clinical diagnosis.

The benefits of undertaking a clinical diagnosis approach are that it does not require surgery and the attendant risks thereof, utilizes assessment tools that are readily available to most clinicians, and may reduce the delay frequently observed in endometriosis diagnosis. In clinical practice, presumptive diagnosis of endometriosis is often made without laparoscopy or other surgical procedure, and can facilitate early and effective management of patients' symptoms.

Diagnostic laparoscopy — indications, contraindications, risks, benefits, and diagnostic accuracy for chronic pelvic pain specify that the indication is chronic pelvic pain of unknown etiology after appropriate noninvasive workup. Contraindications include procedure intolerance and known dense pelvic adhesions that may make an accurate evaluation of pelvic pathology impossible or may impede safe abdominal access. Risks are procedure- or anesthesia-related complications. Benefits include potential identification of the source of the chronic pelvic pain, possibility for immediate therapeutic intervention, and potential improvement in the patient's quality of life. Diagnostic laparoscopy has been demonstrated to identify endometriosis, adhesions, or other abnormalities of the appendix and ovaries as the source of chronic pelvic pain.

### Single-port total laparoscopic hysterectomy in a patient with deep infiltrating endometriosis [^111csQPV]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To present the feasibility of single-port laparoscopic surgery at patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis.

Design

Step by step explanation of the surgery using videos (Canadian Task Force classification III-c).

Setting

Single-port laparoscopic surgery is an emerging technique and an option for improving the benefits of laparoscopic surgery. The goals of single-port laparoscopic surgery is to further enhance the cosmetic benefits of minimally invasive surgery and minimize the potential risk and morbidity associated with multiport surgery [1,2]. This procedure is not without challenges, however, such as instrument crowding and clashing, ergonomic difficulties, loss of instrument triangulation, and the need for advanced laparoscopic skills [1,2]. Despite these challenges, technical advances in optics and instrumentation have led to the widespread use of single-port laparoscopic surgery to treat such gynecologic disorders as endometriosis, uterine myomas, and cancers [2,3].

Interventions

A 42-year-old woman was admitted to our clinic with a complaint of chronic pelvic pain dysmenorrhea and deep dyspareunia. Her medical history revealed a cesarean section delivery and a diagnosis of endometriosis. Despite treatment of her endometriosis with dienogest, there has been no decline at her complaints. Ultrasound examination performed at admission revealed a 6 × 6 cm right adnexal mass compatible with endometrioma, with a normal left ovary and uterus. Rectovaginal examination detected no endometriotic nodules. Although all treatment options were explained and discussed and laparoscopic excision of right ovarian endometrioma was recommended, the patient strongly desired removal of the uterus and the ovaries to avoid recurrence of endometriosis and related complaints. Thus, laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were planned. Under general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, the patient was placed in low lithotomy position with the arms tucked. An orogastric tube and a Foley catheter were placed. Abdominal access was performed following an open Hasson technique with a 2.0- to 2.5-cm vertical umbilical incision and a 4-channel (with two 10-mm and two 5-mm channels) access port was placed into the peritoneal cavity. On pelvic examination, a 6 × 6-cm right ovarian endometrioma adherent to the pelvic sidewall was detected, along with severe adhesions on the left side between the left adnex and the pelvic sidewall. The uterus was normal. The adhesion on the left side was released using a Harmonic scalpel (Ethicon Endosurgery, Cinncinnati, OH). The pelvic sidewall peritoneum was opened, and the ureters were identified and isolated at the pelvic brim and followed toward the true pelvis. The internal iliac artery, uterine and obliterated umbilical artery, and infundibulopelvic ligament were dissected and identified. The paravesical, pararectal, and rectouterine spaces were opened. Deep infiltrating endometriosis implants on the right side located in the uterosacral ligment and pararectal space were dissected and excised. After restoration of pelvic anatomy, hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. The vaginal cuff was closed with intracorporeal knots. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 1, and reported no problems at follow-up.

Conclusion

Single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy appears to be a safe and feasible option in patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis, especially when performed by well-experienced surgeons.

### Excisional surgery versus ablative surgery for ovarian endometrioma [^116NmDbu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Endometrioma are endometriotic deposits within the ovary. Laparoscopic management of endometriomas is associated with shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, and decreased hospital costs compared with laparotomy. The previous version of this systematic review (2008), including randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical interventions for endometrioma, concluded that laparoscopic cystectomy (excision) was preferable to drainage and ablation of endometrioma. We aimed to update the evidence comparing excision with drainage and ablation for improving pain and fertility-related outcomes.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic excision (cystectomy) compared with laparoscopic drainage and ablation of endometrioma in women of reproductive age.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, two trials registries, grey literature sources, and conference proceedings on 19 December 2022. We also checked the reference lists of relevant papers and contacted leaders in the field of endoscopic surgery for any additional trials.

Selection Criteria

Eligible studies were RCTs that compared excision with drainage and ablation of endometriomas.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and applied the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We identified nine studies (involving 578 women) that investigated laparoscopic excision versus drainage and ablation of endometriomas measuring at least 3 cm in diameter. Participants were women of reproductive age who presented to an outpatient gynaecology clinic with pain, infertility, or both. For most outcomes, we downgraded the certainty of evidence for risk of bias due to lack of blinding and for imprecision due to low participant numbers. At up to two years after surgery, excisional surgery compared with ablative surgery may reduce the risk of dysmenorrhoea recurrence (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.52; 2 studies, 140 women; low-certainty evidence;). Recurrence of dysmenorrhoea may occur in 49% of women after ablative surgery compared with 10% to 34% after excisional surgery. At up to two years after surgery, excisional surgery compared with ablative surgery may reduce the risk of dyspareunia recurrence (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.22; 2 studies, 131 women; low-certainty evidence). Recurrence of dyspareunia may occur in 58% of women after ablative surgery compared with 4% to 23% after excisional surgery. At one year after surgery, excisional surgery may reduce the risk of endometrioma recurrence compared with ablative surgery (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.34; 4 studies, 264 women; low-certainty evidence). Recurrence of endometrioma may occur in 37% of women after ablative surgery compared with 5% to 17% after excisional surgery. At one year after surgery, excisional surgery may reduce the need for further endometrioma surgery compared with ablative surgery (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.41; 2 studies, 178 women; low-certainty evidence). Our results suggest that 32% of women require further endometrioma surgery after ablative surgery compared with 3% to 16% after excisional surgery. There may be little or no difference between excisional surgery and ablative surgery in terms of their effect on spontaneous pregnancy during the first year after surgery (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.87; 3 studies, 101 women; low-certainty evidence). Five studies reported that there were no conversions to laparotomy. No studies provided data about any other surgical complications or adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Surgical management of endometrioma with excision (cystectomy) may be more effective than drainage and ablation for reducing painful menstrual periods, pain during sexual intercourse, endometrioma recurrence, and the need for further endometrioma surgery. However, there may be little or no difference between the techniques in their effect on subsequent pregnancy rates. We found limited evidence on the safety of excisional surgery compared with ablative surgery. Future trials should recruit adequate numbers of women and measure outcomes relating to adverse events and clinical pregnancy.
