## Question

Twenty people pre-bought plane tickets at a price of $155 per ticket. Thirty people bought their plane tickets at the gate and they each paid $200 for their ticket. How many more dollars did the people at the gate pay for their tickets than those passengers that pre-bought their tickets?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many more dollars the 30 passengers who bought tickets at the gate paid compared to the 20 passengers who pre-bought their tickets, given the individual prices of $200 and $155 respectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total cost for the pre-booked group. Then, I should calculate the total cost for the gate-purchase group. Next, I will find the absolute difference between the two totals. Finally, I will verify the arithmetic and state the answer clearly with units.

> Let me first confirm the pre-booked total. Twenty passengers at $155 each equals 20 times 155, which is $3,100. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 20 × 155 = 3,100. Yes, that's correct.

> Next, I should calculate the gate-purchase total. Thirty passengers at $200 each equals 30 times 200, which is $6,000. Hold on, I should double-check: 30 × 200 = 6,000. Correct.

> Now, I need to find the difference. The gate group paid $6,000 minus the pre-booked group's $3,100, which equals $2,900. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the difference might be $2,800, but that would be a mistake; 6,000 − 3,100 is indeed $2,900, not $2,800. I should confirm the subtraction one more time to be sure: 6,000 − 3,100 = 2,900. Yes, that's right.

> Final answer: The passengers who bought at the gate paid $2,900 more in total than those who pre-bought their tickets.

---

The passengers who bought at the gate paid **$2,900 more** in total than those who pre-bought their tickets. This is calculated by finding the difference in total cost between the two groups: the gate buyers paid $6,000 (30 × $200) versus $3,100 (20 × $155) for the pre-bought tickets, yielding a difference of $2,900.

---

## Calculation

- **Total cost for pre-bought tickets**: 20 passengers × $155 = $3,100
- **Total cost for gate tickets**: 30 passengers × $200 = $6,000
- **Difference**: $6,000 − $3,100 = $2,900

---

## Conclusion

The passengers who bought at the gate paid **$2,900 more** in total than those who pre-bought their tickets.

a Total costs per flight per passenger and b change in cost per flight per passenger relative to business as usual to achieve either CO 2 or climate neutrality in 2050 for representative short-, medium-, and long-haul flights under the Direct Air Carbon Capture and Utilization ("DACCU") and Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage ("DACCS") pathways.

We also assessed the impact on the cost of flying relative to the expected future cost of flying in a business-as-usual scenario with continued use of fossil kerosene (Fig. 4b). The projected increase in ticket prices for flights in 2050 ranges between approximately 40–50% for DACCU and 30–40% for DACCS to achieve CO 2 neutrality, rising to up to 60% (DACCU) and 75% (DACCS) to achieve climate neutrality. However, the increase in price is not the same for all flights, since the contribution of fuel costs to ticket prices varies for different routes, as the price is adjusted to demand and to endure competition. While the increases in price due to a complete neutralization of the climate effects of a flight may seem substantial, they lie well below the range of current variance in prices. Indeed, the difference in price between buying a ticket two weeks or two months in advance is, on average, 400% for the London-Berlin route, over 100% for the London-New York route, and 70% for the London-Perth route.

### How spending decisions shape happiness in everyday life [^112XWHNm]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Subjective well-being

Subjective well-being (SWB) is defined as including three components: high life satisfaction, high positive affect, and low negative affect. On each survey, participants completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale, rating their agreement with statements such as "I am satisfied with my life" on a scale from "strongly disagree" (1) to "strongly agree" (7). Participants also completed the Scale of Positive and Negative Experience, reporting how frequently in the last month they experienced six positive feelings (e.g. "Happy") and six negative feelings (e.g. "Sad") on a scale from "very rarely or never" (1) to "very often or always" (5). The three components were standardized and combined to form a score for subjective well-being.

Spending categories

At the end of each of the three months, participants completed a spending diary, providing detailed descriptions of all purchases they made with the Mystery Experiment money. For every purchase, participants were told to "describe in detail what you spent the money on (please include details like what, where, when, and why)". By asking participants for free descriptions, we were able to avoid revealing our interest in specific spending categories we examined. Two independent coders then placed their open-ended responses into 26 spending categories (see Supplementary Methods for full coding details). We began with a set of basic spending categories created by a bank, such as utilities, housing, transportation, and education. We then created additional categories to capture key constructs based on the scholarly literature, including time-saving purchases and experiences. Coders evaluated whether each purchase did belong (1) or did not belong (0) to each of the 26 categories, and the two coders' evaluations were highly consistent in both higher and lower-income countries (kappa 0.83–0.98, Supplementary Table S1). For example, the purchase of "Hamilton" tickets for the family was categorized as a gift and also as an experience. A third coder evaluated any disagreements between the initial coders and recoded any systematic errors. Of the 26 categories, 9 categories were rarely used (i.e. contained fewer than 50 purchases in the category). Leading scholars have argued that 50 is a minimun cell size to ensure statistical power. Therefore we excluded these categories from analysis, leaving 17 spending categories (see Supplementary Table S2 for descriptive statistics of the eliminated categories).

Generosity: Onsite

To measure generosity onsite, we used a modified dictator game. In the classic version of the game, participants are given a monetary endowment and then given the opportunity to donate a portion of it to an anonymous stranger. In order to make the game suitable for gift economies, we initially modified the game such that participants were endowed with five or six tickets that could each be redeemed for a prize from a "mystery box". In reality, the mystery box contained a variety of items that would be of value to eventgoers, including ring pops, snap bracelets, and earplugs (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Without knowing the exact items in the box, participants decided how many tickets they wanted to give to another event participant (chosen at random by the experimenters) by placing the desired number of tickets inside an envelope and handing it to the experimenter. In initial onsite tests of this measure (Burning Man 2015 and Burning Nest, N = 246), each ticket was exchangeable for a single item. Data from these samples indicated that participants gave away an average of 72% of their endowment. We were concerned this would limit our ability to detect changes in generosity due to ceiling effects, so for subsequent data collection, we modified the measure to promote more self-interested choices by informing subjects that more desirable items in the mystery box cost more tickets, and increased the number of initially endowed tickets to ten. This was successful, leading to an average donation of 62%. All reported analyses of onsite generosity are based on samples using the modified ten-ticket dictator game.

Generosity: online follow-ups

In online follow-up surveys, participants were endowed with a ten "virtual tickets" redeemable for the chance to win a $50 Amazon gift card. Participants decided the number of tickets they wanted to keep for themselves versus donate to another study participant (selected at random by the experimenters).

Tuberculosis testing for travelers — pre-travel risk-based screening and test selection: People in congregate settings or planning prolonged stays in high-transmission areas "should have a pre-travel test for M. tuberculosis infection", and "Screening for asymptomatic M. tuberculosis infections before and after travel should be carried out for travelers at risk of acquiring TB at their destinations". Because using TST or an IGRA "in very-low-prevalence populations will probably produce more false positives than true positives", "Pre-travel testing should be limited to people who are likely to be exposed" (including routine contact with patients or "homeless shelters, prisons, refugee camps"), while "People at low risk for exposure to TB, who comprise most travelers, do not need to be screened before or after travel". For logistics, "For travelers who do not have enough time to complete a 2-step TST before departure, an IGRA is preferred over a single-step TST", and if an IGRA is used in a low-risk traveler with concern for a false positive, "a second test can be used, which confirms TB infection only if both tests are positive".

### Comparing the levelized cost of electric vehicle charging options in Europe [^114EAqDo]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

European policymakers are steadily embracing EVs as a major alternative fuel vehicle option, amongst others through the European battery alliance –. Rapidly decreasing battery costs, combined with a breadth of public policy support for EVs, has dramatically reduced the initial purchase cost — a major barrier to vehicle adoption in the technology's beginnings. As such, the cost of using EVs will likely gain importance, especially as car manufacturing companies continue to ramp up production, advancing the EV market from niche to mass. While operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for EVs are markedly lower than that of gasoline or diesel cars –, fuel costs play an important role in the cost of using EVs, and by extension in their competitiveness with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV).

However, comparing fuel costs of ICEVs and EVs is not trivial. While gasoline and diesel costs to consumers are quite transparent (i.e. the pump price at gas stations), EV charging costs to consumers are not as straightforward, as they depend on a variety of factors including charging location, charging speed, time of charging, or even other pricing mechanisms such as charging subscription packages –. It is therefore not always immediately clear what charging cost an EV owner should expect when pulling up to a charging station. For transport modelers and researchers, considering these wide-ranging differences in charging costs is key for accurate EV adoption projections. For policy-makers seeking to promote low-carbon mobility, understanding EV charging option nuances is important for informed policy intervention. Exploring charging cost in detail is therefore highly relevant.

Here we model the levelized cost of charging electric vehicles in 30 European countries and for all charging options that are relevant for EV passenger transport to address this research gap. We compile a cost component database and develop a systematic modeling framework to estimate country-specific levelized cost of charging (LCOC) of different power levels and charging sites. Importantly, detailed charging cost components are disaggregated and estimated to better understand potential cost differences and derive actionable policy implications. Taking into account cost of capital and sales margins of commercial operators, the LCOC represents the long-term average cost to the consumer and is thus compared to average costs of conventional fuels. The results underline high cost variance between modelled countries and charging options. We discuss and derive insights for transport modelers, EV users as well as policy makers for how to appropriately address EV charging prices.

### Langer's illusion of control and the cognitive model of disordered gambling [^112jKZAo]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Although the cognitive account draws heavily upon erroneous thoughts, other accounts of illusory control rely upon behavioural principles from associative learning. People often face learning environments in which they must gauge whether their behaviours trigger a desired outcome (e.g. an evening at the casino, or the earlier example of the elevator 'door close' button). In these settings, high rates of responding and high rates of positive outcomes are seen to fuel 'illusory correlations' or exhibit 'superstitious conditioning', and within this framework instructions that encouraged analytical thinking were effective at reducing the illusion of control with relevance to the educational programmes discussed above. Using this kind of procedure, people with gambling problems were seen to over‐estimate the effectiveness of a hypothetical new medication in treating an illness, witnessed during a series of observations. The effect was striking because the procedure bore no resemblance to gambling, leading the authors to conclude that control biases in people with gambling problems are 'domain‐general' tendencies.

A recent study by Klusowski et al. revisits one of the key tenets in Langer: does the simple act of choosing the ticket transform the odds of success in the mind of the ticket owner? In a paper that is also notable for its strong open science credentials, 17 pre‐registered experiments are reported, with more than 10 000 participants in total. Experiments 1–9 randomized participants to choice and no‐choice groups on tasks involving dice numbers or trays of identical‐appearing chocolates that might be different flavours. The results were eerily reminiscent of the original Ladouceur studies. When participant sampling does not select for gambling involvement and taking measures of confidence or risk‐taking on trivial guessing tasks, the illusion of control was ethereal. In their later experiments, Klusowski et al. switched to a task where a prize was hidden in one of several boxes. Here, a minority of participants in the choice condition rated their chosen box as being more likely to win. Critically, by taking these ratings both before and after the choice (experiments 16 and 17), Klusowski et al. generate a major insight: the participant's choice is a behavioural artefact of a pre‐existing belief that one of the boxes is more favourable than the rest.

### Comparing the levelized cost of electric vehicle charging options in Europe [^111BtRdt]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

With rapidly decreasing purchase prices of electric vehicles, charging costs are becoming ever more important for the diffusion of electric vehicles as required to decarbonize transport. However, the costs of charging electric vehicles in Europe are largely unknown. Here we develop a systematic classification of charging options, gather extensive market data on equipment cost, and employ a levelized cost approach to model charging costs in 30 European countries (European Union 27, Great Britain, Norway, Switzerland) and for 13 different charging options for private passenger transport. The findings demonstrate a large variance of charging costs across countries and charging options, suggesting different policy options to reduce charging costs. A specific analysis on the impacts and relevance of publicly accessible charging station utilization is performed. The results reveal charging costs at these stations to be competitive with fuel costs at typical utilization rates exhibited already today.

Medical evacuation insurance — medical evacuation from a resource-poor area to a hospital delivering definitive care might be necessary despite having travel health insurance. The total cost of a medevac varies by location, ranging from USD 25,000 for transport within North America to over USD 250,000 for more distant and remote locations, and costs increase when the patient being evacuated is critically ill or needs complex infection control measures. The decision to medically evacuate is at the discretion of the insurance company; it is not made at the request of the traveler, and typically, the traveler must be hospitalized with anticipation that multiple additional days of hospitalization will be required or specialized surgery or treatment is needed that is not of comparable quality at the current destination. Some medical evacuation companies have more extensive experience working in some parts of the world than others; travelers should ask about a company's resources in each region of travel, especially if planning trips to hard-to-reach locations, and if the health risks are too high, a traveler might want to postpone or cancel their international trip.

Medical tourism — pre-travel consultation — Medical tourists should take steps before they travel to reduce risk of an adverse health outcome. At a minimum, those considering medical tourism should have a discussion with their primary healthcare professional in the United States well in advance of travel, and medical tourists also could consult a travel medicine specialist for travel advice tailored to their specific health needs and destination 4–6 weeks before travel. Medical tourists should be up to date on all routine vaccinations, especially hepatitis B virus immunization. If consulted, the travel medicine specialist should discuss current medical conditions and ensure that the medical tourist will have a sufficient supply of all regular medications to last the duration of their trip. Medical tourists should discuss the plan for addressing complications related to the treatment or procedure with both their US healthcare professional and the healthcare professional performing the treatment or procedure outside the United States, and in addition, medical tourists should check their domestic health insurance plan carefully to understand what services, if any, are covered outside the United States. Travelers might need to purchase supplemental medical insurance coverage, including medical evacuation insurance, and medical tourists also should be aware that if complications develop, they might not have the same legal recourse as they would if they received their care in the United States. Remind medical tourists to request copies of their overseas medical records in English and to provide this information to any healthcare professionals they see subsequently for follow-up, and encourage medical tourists to disclose their entire travel history, medical history, and information about all surgeries or medical treatments received during their trip.

### Effectiveness of primary care gatekeeping: difference-in-differences evaluation of a pilot scheme in China [^115cYb4z]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Statistical analysis

Difference-in-differences (DiD) regression analysiswas used to estimate the effects of the pilot, with the two pilot townships serving as a treatment group and the 15 others as a comparison group. Such quasi-experimental methods are increasingly used in the evaluation of the impacts of complex interventions. Our analytical models allowed for flexible time trends using a binary variable for each quarter year and allowed for time-invariant differences between townships by including a binary variable for each township. In addition, we controlled for characteristics of the township, including proportion of female enrollees and mean age. Specifications of empirical models are provided in the online supplementary appendix 1. We clustered standard errors at the township level. We ran a pretrend test to check for potential differences in the prepilot trends of visits and expenditures between pilot and non-pilot areas. We were unable to reject the null hypothesis of a difference in pretrends (see the online supplementary appendix 2). We used Stata V.15.1 for the analysis.

Patient and public involvement

We did not directly engage patients or the public in the development of the research question and outcome measures. Our research question was informed by the importance of primary care in contributing to population health demonstrated in previous studies, as well as the suggested importance of gatekeeping in maintaining the function of primary care in both research papers and policy debates. Our outcome measures were selected to reflect patients' actual care-seeking behaviours in terms of overall expenditures and visits. This allowed the study to explore the patients' priorities, experience and preferences regarding care seeking in response to the gatekeeping pilot and to feed such information back to policy-makers, who may improve policies to better respond to patient needs and preferences.

The paper relies on claims data. Patients were not involved in the recruitment to or conduct of the study. A preliminary version of the results has already been communicated to the local policy-makers. This study is not a randomised trial. It is an observatory in its nature, as we had not participated in the development of the intervention, nor did we assign the participants to treatment or control groups. All decisions had been made by the local government officials. As a result, the study represented a potential mechanism to collect important information on the actual response of patients to the gatekeeping policy. The results will be further communicated with policy-makers in China at both central and local levels, including those in the pilot area, and disseminated to the public through social media.

Health insurance while traveling — discussion checklist outlines clinician and traveler actions. Travel medicine specialists should "Identify potential medical needs abroad, including health risks based on itinerary and destination, duration of travel, method of transportation (e.g., air-, land-, or water-based), lodgings or accommodations, and planned activities" and "Discuss the differences between travel disruption, travel health, and medical evacuation insurance", and advise that "Travelers should be prepared to pay out of pocket at the time services are rendered, in some instances even before care is received, and then provide insurers with copies of bills and invoices to initiate reimbursement afterward", and that "Travelers should plan for potential emergencies in advance by identifying healthcare professionals at the destination who see international travelers". Traveler responsibilities include, before travel, to "Review domestic health insurance policies to determine what medical services are or are not covered overseas", "Purchase supplemental travel health insurance coverage based on potential medical needs and health risks", and "Identify medical service providers at destination", and to "Check with the insurance company to confirm that they reimburse for out-of-pocket payments made to healthcare professionals abroad… travelers must pay up front (with cash or credit card) for all services received". During travel, travelers should "Carry insurance policy identity cards (including travel health insurance or medical evacuation insurance) and insurance claim forms while traveling" and "Keep copies of all summary records, charges, and receipts for medical care received". After travel, travelers should "Promptly seek medical attention upon return to the United States and at the first sign of any unexpected complications from care received internationally" and "Submit charges and receipts to the insurance provider".

Health care abroad — insurance and payment considerations advises that travelers "should research their policy thoroughly and identify potential healthcare professionals and facilities at their destination that are 'in-network' for their insurance coverage", and notes that "The US embassy or consulate website for each city that has a US diplomatic post has a list of local hospitals and doctors that can also be used for identifying potential healthcare professionals and facilities abroad". It cautions that "Nationalized healthcare services at a given destination do not necessarily cover healthcare costs of nonresidents", and that "Even with a supplemental travel health insurance policy, receiving medical care abroad usually requires a cash or credit card payment at the point of service, which can result in expenditures of thousands of dollars". US citizens paying for care abroad "should obtain copies of all charges and receipts and, if necessary, contact a US consular officer, who can assist the traveler with transferring funds from the United States".

International business traveler — In 2017, approximately 4.8 million US residents traveled overseas for business; despite the slowdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Global Business Travel Association predicted in 2023 that business travel, although recovering more slowly than leisure travel, would exceed pre-pandemic levels by 2024. Globalization and offshore manufacturing have expanded travel to an increasing number of countries worldwide, including many countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America; some companies are using webconferencing and online and hybrid meetings to cut travel budgets, and such approaches have the benefit of cost savings and a lower carbon footprint. Business travelers include people traveling for conventions, research, work-related training, and volunteer work, and some combine work with tourist activities by bringing a friend or family member or by extending their business trip to include a leisure component. For business travelers, the likelihood of an adverse health event increases with the number of trips made to at-risk areas, the length of time spent at the destination, and lifestyle at the destination. Many international business travelers take multiple trips each year.

### Anomalous supply shortages from dynamic pricing in on-demand mobility [^114t9TXM]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Dynamic pricing in on-demand mobility.

a Schematic illustration of dynamic pricing. The total price separates into the base cost of the product or service and a supply and demand-dependent surge fee. Three fundamental mechanisms underlying price changes are (i) changes of the base cost, (ii) demand exceeding current supply levels, and (iii) supply shortage compared to current demand. Price adaptations (ii) and (iii) are intended to drive the system back to a supply–demand equilibrium. b The total fare for Uber ride-hailing services similarly decomposes into base cost and surge fee. Base cost depend on trip duration and reflect current traffic conditions while surge fees result from supply–demand imbalances. Both effects are illustrated here for trips from Reagan National Airport (DCA) to Washington Union Station in Washington, DC, USA. During commuting hours base cost increase because of longer expected trip duration during rush-hour (gray shading). The slower speed effectively reduces the supply of available drivers as they spend more time in traffic and naturally causes accompanying surge fees. During late evening and nighttime, the total fare exhibits repeated price surges triggered by supply–demand imbalances (dashed box) not reflected in the demand dynamics (passenger capacity of airplanes landing in DCA), consistent with recent reports on supply-driven price surges. The identical magnitude of the price surges is the result of Uber limiting the maximum surge fee in response to these reports. c Supporting the previous observation, no apparent correlation exists between the surge fee and the demand dynamics during the evening hours (20:00–02:00), even at 5 and 38 min delays, the two local maxima of the correlation function (see Supplementary Note 1 for a more detailed analysis).

Here, we quantitatively demonstrate the existence of these imbalances by comparing price time series and demand estimates for ride-hailing services. In a game theoretic analysis we reveal the incentive structure for drivers to induce anomalous supply shortages as a generic feature of dynamic pricing. This observation suggests that similar dynamics should emerge independent of the location or industry. Comparing price time series for 137 locations in 59 urban areas across six continents we find price dynamics reflecting anomalous supply shortages in several cities around the world.

### Economic evaluation of cost and time required for a platform trial vs conventional trials [^116ah2zJ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

The main strength of our work is the use of simulations based on a real-life example. Using STAMPEDE as an example allowed for a fair comparison of platform trial vs conventional trials with respect to number of interventions and their timing of evaluation. However, this study is subject to several limitations. We assumed that there was an infinite eligible population in our simulations, when in reality, trials often compete for participants from a limited relevant pool of patients. Different platform trials have had national-level buy-in with different stakeholders encouraging recruitment into these large trials over conventional trials, but potential recruitment benefits were not evaluated. We chose to fix the total number of interventions to be 10 across all 3 scenarios. In real life, it is possible that readouts from early clinical trial investigations could affect the decision to add an intervention into an existing platform trial or start a new trial; however, we did not consider such possibility. As costs and setup time are often not reported for conventional and platform trials, we chose to empirically elicit expert opinions based on a systematically compiled list of experts derived from a previous landscape analysis of master protocols. However, the survey response rate was low at 11.0%, resulting in high uncertainties. It was important to have a minimal number of questions for the survey, so we did not include an exhaustive list of items that would normally be used for trial budgeting. It is possible that consideration of other elements could have affected our results.

### Cost-effectiveness of chikungunya vaccination with the live attenuated vaccine in U.S. territories [^112gQ7kH]. NPJ Vaccines (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 6
Modeled vaccination strategies

a Year 1 includes 20% of all adults (aged 18+) and years 2–30 include 20% of individuals in each new cohort of adults aged 18 years.

b The total coverage rate accounts for the routine vaccinations from all prior years. In the baseline model, 42% of adults are additionally vaccinated during the outbreak year.

In 2024, for both vaccination strategies, the model started with an estimated number of people who were immune from prior infection acquired during the last outbreak (i.e. baseline seroprevalence). Each year, the baseline seroprevalence decreases as people in the model die and the proportion of people who were not alive during the prior outbreak increases. For the routine vaccination program, the number of individuals who were vaccinated each year added to the number who were already immune in the population. During the outbreak year, seroprevalence rates rise steeply from interim infections and reactive outbreak vaccinations.

Because of our assumption that there was no pre-vaccination screening, some people who were vaccinated (in either strategy) already have naturally acquired immunity. We assumed that the percentage of people who were vaccinated but have naturally acquired immunity was the same as the percentage in the general population who have naturally acquired immunity.

### Financial incentives for quitting smoking in pregnancy: are they cost-effective? [^116JfDb5]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Base‐case analysis

The incentives arm was more costly than control in the short term; this difference was driven by neonatal costs (£1723 versus 982 incentives and control arms, respectively) (Table 4). Intervention costs are higher in the incentives arm compared to control (£268 versus 91), with £152 of those costs relating to vouchers.

TABLE 4
Short‐term costs breakdown (unadjusted).

However, adjusted results found the difference in total costs to be £637 (95% CI = £−872 to 2160); while there was a trend for higher total costs in the incentives arm, the 95% CI straddled zero (Table 5). Late‐pregnancy quit rate was higher in the incentives arm compared to control arm (0.268 versus 0.123), a difference of 0.144 (95% CI = 0.094–0.194). The incremental cost per late‐pregnancy quitter was £4400. QALYs were slightly higher in the incentives arm compared to the control arm (0.339 versus 0.335), a difference of only 0.004, and a 95% CI which again crossed zero, (95% CI = −0.163 to 0.175). The incremental cost per QALY was £150 000, which would not be considered cost‐effective given the UK willingness‐to‐pay threshold of £20 000/QALY.

TABLE 5
Short‐term analysis results.

Uncertainty is illustrated on the cost‐effectiveness plane and CEAC (Figure 2). Bootstrapped samples cover all four quadrants of the cost‐effectiveness plane showing uncertainty in both cost and QALY results. There is less uncertainty in costs than QALYs; most samples indicate higher costs in the incentives arm compared to control (above horizontal axis). CEACs are used to explore the incremental cost‐effectiveness of an intervention at different willingness‐to‐pay thresholds. At the £20 000 willingness‐to‐pay threshold (the NICE accepted threshold) the CEAC shows a 36% chance of incentives being cost‐effective in the short term, increasing to 40% at £30 000, and not rising above 47% up to £120 000 in the willingness‐to‐pay threshold. Therefore, offering financial incentives to this population is unlikely to be considered cost‐effective in the short term.

### Tobacco company agreements with tobacco retailers for price discounts and prime placement of products and advertising: a scoping review [^1125261S]. Tobacco Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Miscellaneous and generous incentives

Contracts also commonly incentivise retailers with monetary rewards or vouchers. The reported cash equivalence for retailer incentives varied greatly between $20/month in urban US cities in 1991and $20 000/year reported in 2001 in the USA, with one study reporting the median incentive value at $930/year in the USA between 2013 and 2014. Contractual relationships also provided retailers with professional support or education from manufacturers in the USA and Australia. This included one-on-one meetings, help with designing and merchandising new stores, and off-site events to educate the retailers on new products available and how to best promote them. Generous incentives were given to well-preforming retailers in the UK, Australia and, the USA. These included tickets for sports, music, and movie events; lavish parties in which tobacco products were promoted and gifted to guests and staff; and once-in-a-lifetime experiences such as paddle boarding around glaciers, driving Lamborghinis and Ferraris, travelling to Fiji on all-expenses paid trips to view tobacco growing and manufacturing, and sweepstakes to win a Cadillac.

Manufacturer control and retailer compliance

Three-quarters of the retailers interviewed in one US study reported that manufacturers were in complete control of their tobacco displays and promotional materials. A retailer in another US study described the interaction with a manufacturer representative, reporting, 'it's almost like it's not my store… I was overwhelmed, she [the representative] walks in one day and throws some books on my counter and tells me, "I'll tell you what you are going to do"'.
According to an interview in one US study, most retailers participate in multiple incentive programmes. In multiple studies, contracts were viewed as necessary evils for US retailers to stay in business, with one retailer reporting, 'We don't make a lot of money on cigarettes but we make a lot of money on displays'. or this reason, retailers upheld contracts even though they were controlling and demanding'. hey're trying to control my business', a retailer reported in one study, and, 'It's not an offer, it's a mandatory thing. It has to be the way they want it', reported another.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 5 health care abroad [^112wy5ja]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Travel disruption insurance, travel health insurance, and medical evacuation insurance — coverage considerations for international travelers — are presented as specialized policies that can substantially reduce out-of-pocket costs for medical care received abroad when purchased in advance; each provides different types of coverage in the event of an illness or injury and may be purchased together (bundled) or purchased separately and used in combination with, or separate from, domestic health insurance. Specialized insurance policies might be particularly beneficial to travelers with preexisting medical conditions, those who are pregnant, over the age of 65, and those planning extended time abroad (< 1 year), while for expatriates and those planning > 1 year abroad there may be alternative options available; besides protection against costs, the insurance might also help travelers obtain medical care abroad or keep relatives informed in the event of a medical emergency, and basic accident or travel health insurance might be necessary for travelers with certain itineraries.

### Companies inadvertently fund online misinformation despite consumer backlash [^115iBm58]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

To address external validity concerns, we incorporate additional exit outcomes in the paper, showing that treated individuals switched to lower preference products (Table 1, columns 3 and 4) and products across categories (Table 1, columns 5 and 6) after our information interventions by 8 and 5 percentage points, respectively. We also show in Supplementary Table 8 that as the difference between participants' highest weighted and second highest weighted gift card choice increases, their switching behaviour decreases. This shows that the weights assigned by participants to their gift card options are capturing meaningful and costly differences in value, highlighting the external validity of our findings. More generally, our pre-registered heterogeneity analysis lends credence to the study's external validity. In line with expectations, we find that less frequent users and more politically liberal individuals are likelier to switch (see Extended Data Table 3 for the full set of pre-registered heterogeneity results). Moreover, we find that the cost of switching gift cards varies based on participants' observable characteristics. For example, treated participants who reported not using any of the misinformation news outlets in our survey lost 50% of the median value (US$12.50) of their initial top choice gift card whereas treated participants who reported reading such outlets lost 33.3% of the median value (US$8.33) of their initial top choice gift card. Participants' text responses also indicate that they believed their choices to be consequential (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). As an example, while explaining their choice of gift card, one participant stated, "Because I would most likely use this gift card on my next visit to… and it is less likely that i would use the others". Regarding the petition outcome, one participant stated "The source of this problem seems to be from the digital advertising platforms, so I'd rather sign the petition that stops them from putting ads on misinformation websites".

Results

Across 630 448 individuals with at least 1 claim for any of the 3 drugs (mean [SD] age, 73.6 [6.3] years; 396 573 males [62.9%]; 233 875 females [37.1%]), total out-of-pocket spending was $244 296 641 (empagliflozin: $122 843 585; sacubitril/valsartan: $76 347 630; dapagliflozin: $45 105 426) (Table). The median (25–75 percentiles) out-of-pocket costs per 30-day supply in the ICL phase were roughly 3 times those in the pre-ICL phase (empagliflozin: $144 [$131-$146] vs $46 [$40-$47]; dapagliflozin: $141 [$130-$142] vs $47 [$40-$47]; sacubitril/valsartan: $153 [$140-$155] vs $47 [$42-$47]; all differences significant at P < .001). Out-of-pocket costs were the lowest in the catastrophic phase.

### Cost effectiveness of strategies to combat road traffic injuries in sub-saharan Africa and south east Asia: mathematical modelling study [^112JkUFs]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Uncertainty analysis

Baseline DALYs have been discounted (at a rate of 3%) and subjected to an age weighting function that attaches greater value to the middle years of life and less to the young and old; results without these weights were also assessed. A series of (one-way) sensitivity analyses were performed on a number of variables for which particular uncertainty exists (such as the proportion of vehicles stopped each year at checkpoints, which is a key determinant of effective coverage in the population). Cost and outcome data (together with coefficients of variation amounting to 20–25% above and below baseline values) were also subjected to a probabilistic uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo simulation (1000 runs were made using a truncated normal distribution). The likelihood that interventions would fall below a defined set of cost effectiveness thresholds was evaluated: WHO-CHOICE denotes as "cost effective" an intervention that produces a healthy year of life for less than three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and as "very cost effective" an intervention that produces a healthy year of life for less than the GDP per capita.

### Economic evaluation of cost and time required for a platform trial vs conventional trials [^111ydA9x]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

When the cost and time were broken down to the initial interventions (interventions 1–5) that were available at the beginning vs subsequent interventions (interventions 6–10) that could be added to the platform or be evaluated independently, we still observed higher cost and duration in conventional trial scenarios. For the evaluation of the initial interventions, scenario 2 had a smaller magnitude of relative differences against the platform trial in both cost and time than scenario 3. The median (IQR) increase in trial cost for the scenario 2 was 28.0% (5.5%-50.1%) and 158.4% (136.9%-184.1%) for scenario 3. The median (IQR) increase in trial duration was also smaller for scenario 2 (36.1% [30.8%-41.5%]) than scenario 3 (526.3% [429.4%-657.9%])

For the subsequent interventions, we assumed that they could either be added into the platform trial or be evaluated independently using 2-group trials in either of the 2 conventional trial scenarios (Figure 4). Compared with the platform trial, the median (IQR) increase in costs for conventional trials was 12.6% (2.1%-22.6%), and 226.7% (206.8%-246.7%) for trial duration. The magnitude of the relative differences in cost and time were smaller for the subsequent interventions than the initial interventions because the platform trial had fewer active groups after starting off as a 6-group trial.

### The cigarette market in Brazil: new evidence on illicit practices from the 2019 national health survey [^111k4qCP]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

By combining two questions 'The last time you bought manufactured cigarettes for yourself, how many cigarettes did you buy?' and 'In total, how much money did you pay for this purchase?', we were able to estimate the price paid per pack of 20 cigarettes. To establish a boundary between legal brands sold with discount and legal brands that did not pay taxes (domestic tax evasion), we defined a 'threshold price' (TP) based on the R$ 5.00 minimum price established by law (MLP) multiplied by the relative difference between the average price per pack paid by smokers of legal cigarettes who bought more than one pack in their last purchase and the average price paid by those who bought only one pack (−10%, based on preliminary PNS database analysis). Thus, legal brands approved by ANVISA (brand-legal) that were sold below the TP, that is, below R$ 4.5 per pack, were also added to the size of the illicit market (overall-illicit). Previous research found that the sum of the costs of production and distribution, the retail margins and the taxes that are supposed to be paid for these legal brands was very close to MLP. Thus, if we assume that firms cannot simply stop paying the non-tax components, then most of 'brand-legal' sold below TP (or MLP) were somehow introduced on the market without paying taxes. The crux is that these are either publicly traded companies (in this case, largely British American Tobacco holding 80% of the cigarette market share in 2018)which have to be responsive to shareholders or small companies that lack the kind of capital to sustain a price discounting strategy widely and deeply. Among users of manufactured cigarettes (9.9% of the Brazilian population), individuals who reported having bought single sticks were excluded from the analysis (around 4% of them) because it was impossible to define a valid criterion for the cut-off price point.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios: uses and pitfalls [^117XXw5V]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is a formal method of comparing alternative medical interventions with regard to their resource utilization (costs) and outcomes (effectiveness). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is an informative measure generated from such an analysis and represents the ratio of the difference in cost between two medical interventions to the difference in outcomes between the two interventions. Thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio summarizes the additional cost per unit of health benefit gained in switching from one medical intervention to another. Although incremental cost-effectiveness ratios have limitations, when used in the proper context, these ratios serve as one of the important tools needed to help guide decisions about allocating scarce resources across competing medical programmes.

### Low cost satellite constellations for nearly continuous global coverage [^111EohHx]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Satellite services are fundamental to the global economy, and their design reflects a tradeoff between coverage and cost. Here, we report the discovery of two alternative 4-satellite constellations with 24- and 48-hour periods, both of which attain nearly continuous global coverage. The 4-satellite constellations harness energy from nonlinear orbital perturbation forces (e.g. Earth's geopotential, gravitational effects of the sun and moon, and solar radiation pressure) to reduce their propellant and maintenance costs. Our findings demonstrate that small sacrifices in global coverage at user-specified longitudes allow operationally viable constellations with significantly reduced mass-to-orbit costs and increased design life. The 24-hour period constellation reduces the overall required vehicle mass budget for propellant by approximately 60% compared to a geostationary Earth orbit constellation with similar coverage over typical satellite lifetimes. Mass savings of this magnitude permit the use of less expensive launch vehicles, installation of additional instruments, and substantially improved mission life.

### Cost-effectiveness of 9-valent HPV vaccination for patients treated for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in the UK [^112VwbNs]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Model Outputs

Cost-effectiveness was estimated by calculating the relative differences in total costs and QALYs for 9vHPV vaccination in conjunction with posttreatment surveillance vs posttreatment surveillance alone over the model time horizon to yield an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per QALY gained. A willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of £20 000 (US $26 200) per QALY gained, in accordance with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidelines, was used to interpret the ICER. Additionally, the JCVI requires that the estimate of likelihood that the true ICER exceeds £30 000 (US $39 300) per QALY is no more than 10%. As a result, a WTP threshold of £30 000 per QALY was used for the PSA.

Sensitivity Analyses

In a series of 1-way deterministic sensitivity analyses (eTable 16 in Supplement 1), each input parameter was varied to plausible (based on existing evidence or expert option) upper and lower bounds, while remaining variables retained their baseline value. Results were plotted in a tornado diagram. PSA was undertaken in which 1000 simulations were performed to estimate the overall uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness results (eTable 16 in Supplement 1). The results of these simulations were used to form a scatterplot of incremental effectiveness presented on a cost-effectiveness plane, and the probability that each treatment was cost-effective at different levels of WTP per QALY was presented using a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.

### Cost-effectiveness of e-cigarettes compared with nicotine replacement therapy in stop smoking services in england (TEC study): a randomized controlled trial [^117Sve4H]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary analysis

The analysis was undertaken according to a pre‐specified analysis plan 21. The primary analysis was an incremental cost‐effectiveness analysis on an intention‐to‐treat basis from an NHS and PSS perspective during the 12‐month trial period 22. The total costs consisted of treatment cost and the costs to the SSS and NHS (smoking cessation services cost outside the trial and health‐care services use costs) during the 12‐month period. The difference in costs between arms was estimated by a generalized linear regression model controlling for the costs to the SSS and NHS at baseline, age, gender, study site, entitlement of free prescriptions and FTCD at baseline. The effectiveness was presented in terms of QALYs, the difference in which was estimated by a generalized linear regression model controlling for utility value at baseline, age, gender, study site, entitlement of free prescriptions and FTCD at baseline. By dividing the difference in total costs by the difference in QALYs, an incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated to measure the additional cost per QALY gained by EC, compared with NRT. It was then measured against the NICE recommended willingness‐to‐pay (WTP) threshold of £20 000 and £30 000 per QALY gained 22. Neither costs nor QALYs were discounted, as they were collected within 1 year.

Uncertainty surrounding the ICER was assessed through a non‐parametric bootstrap re‐sampling technique 23. Bootstrap randomly drew individuals from the original sample by arm to construct a slightly different replicate sample with the same sample size. Each bootstrap iteration then estimated the incremental costs and QALYs based on the replicate sample of that iteration. A cost‐effectiveness plane (CEP) and cost‐effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) were plotted with 5000 bootstrapped estimates 24.

Cost-effectiveness evidence synthesis and meta-analysis — when synthesizing CEAs, "careful attention should be paid to similarities and differences among the studies" across key elements, and if proceeding with meta-analysis, "costs and outcomes should be meta-analyzed separately (ie, ICERs should not be directly combined across studies)".

### The costs of improving health emergency preparedness: a systematic review and analysis of multi-country studies [^115iBFzh]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Initially, we planned to convert all cost data from before 2020 to constant United States Dollars (US$) 2020 by using gross domestic product (GDP) implicit price deflators from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, due to two studies reporting their estimates in US$ 2021, we have used the available first quarter (Q1) 2021 seasonal figures to account for the most recent available estimates. The base years and currencies for cost data were obtained from studies. If a study did not report the base year for their cost estimates, we used its year of publication.

We examined the distribution of national-level and global-level costs across studies. This involved mapping activities as being "national" or "global", based on studies' descriptions and our interpretation during data extraction. We considered costs to be global if they were to, as defined by the 2013 Lancet Commission on Investing in Health, support "global functions" that go beyond the boundaries of individual nations to address transnational issues. These functions include the provision of global public goods (e.g. research and development (R&D) on new tools to tackle neglected diseases), management of negative regional and global cross-border externalities (e.g. outbreak preparedness), and fostering of global health leadership and stewardship (e.g. convening for negotiation). We acknowledge that national and global health security are closely intertwined and that national capacities are critical to effective global functions, and vice-versa.

In our results, we present the distributions of national-level costs across the World Bank's four income groups — low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income countries — based on the findings reported by studies. We also present summaries of the distribution of capital and recurrent costs, as well as factors noted by included studies that were driving preparedness costs, according to study reporting.

We planned not to conduct assessments of bias using a risk of bias tool (e.g. Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool), acknowledging the already known variability in approaches and that we were evaluating studies' estimated market costs and we were not including estimates of the consequences of interventions. Instead, our conclusions were informed by summarising and comparing the different methods used by studies, but not questioning their validity. We also acknowledge the conceptual nature of this topic area could mean significant variance in studies' approaches to describing activities and estimating costs.

### Cost analysis of liver acquisition fees before and after acuity circle policy implementation [^113yc9oT]. JAMA Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Acuity circles (AC) liver allocation policy was implemented to eliminate donor service area geographic boundaries from liver allocation and to decrease variability in median Model of End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score at transplant and wait list mortality. However, the broader sharing of organs was also associated with more flights for organ procurements and higher costs associated with the increase in flights.

Objective

To determine whether the costs associated with liver acquisition changed after the implementation of AC allocation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This single-center cost comparison study analyzed fees associated with organ acquisition before and after AC allocation implementation. The cost data were collected from a single transplant institute with 2 liver transplant centers, located 30 miles apart, in different donation service areas. Cost, recipient, and transportation data for all cases that included fees associated with liver acquisition from July 1, 2019, to October 31, 2020, were collected.

Exposures

Primary liver offer acceptance with associated organ procurement organization or charter flight fees.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Specific fees (organ acquisition, surgeon, import, and charter flight fees) and total fees per donor were collected for all accepted liver donors with at least 1 associated fee during the study period.

Results

Of 213 included donors, 171 were used for transplant; 90 of 171 (52.6%) were male, and the median (interquartile range) age of donors was 41.0 (30.0–52.8) years in the pre-AC period and 36.9 (24.0–48.8) years in the post-AC period. There was no significant difference in the post-AC compared with pre-AC period in median (range) MELD score (24 [8–40] vs 25 [6–40]; P = 0.27) or median (range) match run sequence (15 [1–3951] vs 10 [1–1138]; P = 0.31), nor in mean (SD) distance traveled (155.83 [157.00] vs 140.54 [144.33] nautical miles; P = 0.32) or percentage of donors requiring flights (58.5% [69 of 118] vs 56.8% [54 of 95]; P = 0.82). However, costs increased significantly in the post-AC period: total cost increased 16% per accepted donor (mean [SD] of $52 966 [13 278] vs $45 725 [9300]; P < .001) and 55% per declined donor (mean [SD] of $15 865 [3942] vs $10 217 [4853]; P < .001). Contributing factors included more than 2-fold increases in the proportions of donors incurring import fees (31.4% [37 of 118] vs 12.6% [12 of 95]; P = 0.002) and surgeon fees (19.5% [23 of 118] vs 9.5% [9 of 95]; P = 0.05), increased acquisition fees (10% increase; mean [SD] of $43 860 [3266] vs $39 980 [2236]; P < .001), and increased flight expenses (43% increase; mean [SD] of $12 904 [6066] vs $9049 [5140]; P = 0.002).

Conclusions and Relevance

The unintended consequences of implementing broader sharing without addressing organ acquisition fees to account for increased importation between organ procurement organizations must be remedied to contain costs and ensure viability of transplant programs.

### Incentives for smoking cessation [^112eqUbW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Material or financial incentives are widely used in an attempt to precipitate or reinforce behaviour change, including smoking cessation. They operate in workplaces, in clinics and hospitals, and to a lesser extent within community programmes. In this third update of our review we now include trials conducted in pregnant women, to reflect the increasing activity and resources now targeting this high-risk group of smokers.

Objectives

To determine whether incentives and contingency management programmes lead to higher long-term quit rates.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, with additional searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. The most recent searches were in December 2014, although we also include two trials published in 2015.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials, allocating individuals, workplaces, groups within workplaces, or communities to experimental or control conditions. We also considered controlled studies with baseline and post-intervention measures. We include studies in a mixed-population setting (e.g. community-, work-, institution-based), and also, for this update, trials in pregnant smokers.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author (KC) extracted data and a second (JH-B) checked them. We contacted study authors for additional data where necessary. The main outcome measure in the mixed-population studies was abstinence from smoking at longest follow-up, and at least six months from the start of the intervention. In the trials of pregnant smokers abstinence was measured at the longest follow-up, and at least to the end of the pregnancy.

Main Results

Twenty-one mixed-population studies met our inclusion criteria, covering more than 8400 participants. Ten studies were set in clinics or health centres, one in Thai villages served by community health workers, two in academic institutions, and the rest in worksites. All but six of the trials were run in the USA. The incentives included lottery tickets or prize draws, cash payments, vouchers for goods and groceries, and in six trials the recovery of money deposited by those taking part. The odds ratio (OR) for quitting with incentives at longest follow-up (six months or more) compared with controls was 1.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 1.69; 17 trials, [20 comparisons], 7715 participants). Only three studies demonstrated significantly higher quit rates for the incentives group than for the control group at or beyond the six-month assessment: One five-arm USA trial compared rewards- and deposit-based interventions at individual and group level, with incentives available up to USD 800 per quitter, and demonstrated a quit rate in the rewards groups of 8.1% at 12 months, compared with 4.7% in the deposits groups. A direct comparison between the rewards-based and the deposit-based groups found a benefit for the rewards arms, with an OR at 12 months of 1.76 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.53; 2070 participants). Although more people in this trial accepted the rewards programmes than the deposit programmes, the proportion of quitters in each group favoured the deposit-refund programme. Another USA study rewarded both participation and quitting up to USD 750, and achieved sustained quit rates of 9.4% in the incentives group compared with 3.6% for the controls. A deposit-refund trial in Thailand also achieved significantly higher quit rates in the intervention group (44.2%) compared with the control group (18.8%), but uptake was relatively low, at 10.5%. In the remaining trials, there was no clear evidence that participants who committed their own money to the programme did better than those who did not, or that contingent rewards enhanced success rates over fixed payment schedules. We rated the overall quality of the older studies as low, but with later trials (post-2000) more likely to meet current standards of methodology and reporting. Eight of nine trials with usable data in pregnant smokers (seven conducted in the USA and one in the UK) delivered an adjusted OR at longest follow-up (up to 24 weeks post-partum) of 3.60 (95% CI 2.39 to 5.43; 1295 participants, moderate-quality studies) in favour of incentives. Three of the trials demonstrated a clear benefit for contingent rewards; one delivered monthly vouchers to confirmed quitters and to their designated 'significant other supporter', achieving a quit rate in the intervention group of 21.4% at two months post-partum, compared with 5.9% among the controls. Another trial offered a scaled programme of rewards for the percentage of smoking reduction achieved over the course of the 12-week intervention, and achieved an intervention quit rate of 31% at six weeks post-partum, compared with no quitters in the control group. The largest (UK-based) trial provided intervention quitters with up to GBP 400-worth of vouchers, and achieved a quit rate of 15.4% at longest follow-up, compared to the control quit rate of 4%. Four trials confirmed that payments made to reward a successful quit attempt (i.e. contingent), compared to fixed payments for attending the antenatal appointment (non-contingent), resulted in higher quit rates. Front-loading of rewards to counteract early withdrawal symptoms made little difference to quit rates.

Authors' Conclusions

Incentives appear to boost cessation rates while they are in place. The two trials recruiting from work sites that achieved sustained success rates beyond the reward schedule concentrated their resources into substantial cash payments for abstinence. Such an approach may only be feasible where independently-funded smoking cessation programmes are already available, and within a relatively affluent and educated population. Deposit-refund trials can suffer from relatively low rates of uptake, but those who do sign up and contribute their own money may achieve higher quit rates than reward-only participants. Incentive schemes conducted among pregnant smokers improved the cessation rates, both at the end-of-pregnancy and post-partum assessments. Current and future research might continue to explore the scale, loading and longevity of possible cash or voucher reward schedules, within a variety of smoking populations.

### Cost-effectiveness of a stepwise approach vs standard care for diabetes prevention in India [^111YmZiK]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Abbreviations: ICER, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; INR, Indian rupees; INT $, international dollars; QALY, quality-adjusted life-year; VAS-ALY, visual analog scale–adjusted life-year.

Adding the costs for screening and recruitment would translate to INR 1912 (INT $145) per 1 percentage point diabetes risk reduction, INR 191 090 (INT $14 539) per diabetes case prevented, INR 196 960 (INT $14 986) per QALY gained, and INR 161 149 (INT $12 261) per VAS-ALY gained from a multipayer perspective.

Figure 2 illustrates the ICER planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves of diabetes prevention from a multipayer perspective. The probability that the intervention would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of INR 464 200/QALY (INT $22 000/QALY) was 0.91 from a multipayer perspective. This probability would decrease to 0.78 if the screening costs were included. The ICER planes per 1 percentage point diabetes risk reduction and per 1 VAS-ALY gained with and without screening costs from a multipayer perspective appear in eFigure 1 in the Supplement. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves to achieve a 1 percentage point diabetes risk reduction and 1 VAS-ALY gained with and without screening costs appear in eFigure 2 in the Supplement.

Figure 2.
Incremental Cost-effectiveness Planes and Acceptability Curves of Stepwise Diabetes Prevention vs Routine Care From a Multipayer Perspective in the Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program (D-CLIP)

Costs were estimated with a generalized γ regression model with a log-link. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated through a linear model. Both models were adjusted for age and sex. Adjusted mean differences for costs and health effects between the control and intervention group were estimated using 500 bootstrap replications to describe the uncertainty around incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. QALYs were measured as the area under the quality-of-life curve during the 3 years of follow-up. Quality of life was defined as the utilities of health states that were assessed through the EuroQol–5-Dimension–3 Level questionnaires. Costs are expressed in 2019 international dollars, after applying Indian price inflation and the purchasing power parity conversion for the year 2019 ($1 = INR 18.4). All costs were discounted at a 5% rate.

### Anomalous supply shortages from dynamic pricing in on-demand mobility [^117ALe6V]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Airport demand

We estimate the demand for ride-hailing services as proportional to the number of seats of all arriving airplanes (implying a constant fraction of potential Uber customers). To create a continuous time series from the discrete arrival events of individual airplanes we compute a 5 min moving average to create equidistant records every minute. This also slightly reduces the strong variations between minutes with and without arrivals.

Because we have much more frequent but not equally spaced data for the Uber price estimates, we use the same procedure and compute a 5 min moving average of the surge fee for every minute. This leaves us with the same granularity of the data as for the deplanements.

Using these data, we compute the cross-correlation between the Uber surge fee estimates and the deplanement data at the corresponding airport. In Fig. 1c we show the scatterplot at the timelag (deplanement earlier than surge) where this correlation is maximal for the illustrated window from 20:00 to 02:00 of the surge fee.

Comparison of surge dynamics

To compare and characterize the surge dynamics for different trips we normalize the absolute surge fee time series by the base cost at that time, yielding an effective surge factor. For these normalized time series, we compute the per minute changes Δ p between consecutive time points (time t in minutes),

To quantify and compare the statistical properties of the surge factor time series we split the price changes into three contributions. We take any data point with Δp² < 10⁻⁷ to belong to a Dirac delta distribution at zero (not shown in the histograms) and fit a Gaussian mixture model with two Gaussian distributions to the remaining data. Taking both distributions to have a mean of zero (no price change on average) yieldswhere the weight w surge defines the surge contribution and the standard deviation σ surge is the normalized surge strength used to characterize the surge dynamics.

Two player game — minimal theoretical model

The results presented in the manuscript (Fig. 2 b) are obtained with normalized parameters p base = 1 and, allowing up tobefore no customer orders a ride at the maximum surge fee. See Supplementary Note 3 for a detailed description.

### Health care resource use and economic burden in patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation [^113Njsp6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The increases in all‐cause and HCM‐related health care costs and resource use following the diagnosis of AF were preserved after adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, and septal reduction therapy (Tables 6 and S4). Adjusted all‐cause total costs increased from $23 540 [95% CI, $15 824–$35 018] PPPY pre‐AF diagnosis to $30 549 [95% CI, $20 844–$44 774] post‐AF diagnosis (P = 0.031) and adjusted HCM‐related total costs increased from $11 745 (95% CI, $8413–$16 397) PPPY to $14 483 (95% CI, $10 583–$19 820), although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.050). As with the nonadjusted analyses, the largest magnitude increases in adjusted all‐cause and HCM‐related costs from pre‐ to post‐AF diagnosis related to the outpatient and hospital settings, although it should be noted that the increases in adjusted outpatient costs were not statistically significant.

### Anomalous supply shortages from dynamic pricing in on-demand mobility [^113jQ4Lc]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Dynamic multiplayer game

For the dynamic multiplayer game, we consider a single origin location with N = 160 drivers. Upon completing a trip, drivers return to the origin location after a total round-trip time t s uniformly distributed inminutes. We increase the round-trip time from the base valuemin tomin in the morning and afternoon (starting at 08:00 and increasing linearly up to the maximum at 9:30 and back to the base value until 11:00. Similarly in the afternoon from 15:00 to the maximum at 18:00 and back until 20:00).

The base cost p base depend linearly on the round-trip time asUSD as the round-trip time changes during the day. Similar to the two-player game, we take a linear price dependence for the surge pricing asbased on the number N idle of online drivers at the trip origin and the number of drivers N thresh before the surge fee becomes non-zero. We take, where λ = 2 requests per minute describes the demand modeled as a Poisson process in time. We model responses of the price to the current system state (number of available drivers and round-trip time) as instantaneous.

The behavior of customers and drivers is as follows: Each customer i is assigned a uniformly random maximum pricethey are willing to pay, where we takeUSD. When the customer makes a request, they check the current total fare. If the current total fare is smaller than, the customer orders the ride. If the total fare is higher or no drivers are online and idle, the customer waits and checks again every 2 min. After 10 min without ordering a ride, the customer leaves the system.

At every point in time the drivers decide whether to switch their app off or on. They make this decision based on the (mean field) optimal strategy to optimize their collective payoff. A driver switches off their app only if two conditions are fulfilled: first, if there are sufficiently many drivers available and willing to be offline to induce a non-zero surge fee. Second, if the price is less than the (mean field) optimal value for the drivers given the current system state. Each driver remains offline for at most 20 min. After this time, the driver only considers going offline again after serving a customer (drivers try to obtain similar individual profits whereas their optimal strategy based on maximizing their collective profit would be for some drivers to be always offline).

Comparison of Simulated Setup Requirements

Comparisons of setup time for a single platform trial vs a multigroup trial and a 2-group trial are shown in Figure 2 A and Figure 2 B, respectively. The mean (SD) simulated setup time for a platform trial was 1.31 (0.45) years. The mean (SD) simulated setup time for a platform trial (1.31 [0.45] years) was longer than a multigroup trial (0.78 [0.25] years) and a 2-group trial (0.65 [0.22] years) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The mean (SD) simulated setup cost was also higher for a platform trial ($2.24 million [$1.22 million]) than a multigroup trial ($1.59 million [$0.82 million]) and a 2-group trial ($1.09 million [$0.51 million]).

Figure 1 — comparative value of interventions — categorizes value by clinical net benefit and incremental cost for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with intervention versus comparator, where the incremental cost dimension reflects the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained. For favorable clinical net benefit, higher cost corresponds to high value (< $100 000), intermediate value ($100 000 to $200 000), or low value (> $200 000) with the intervention more effective and more costly; lower cost corresponds to high value with the intervention more effective and less costly (cost-saving). For unfavorable clinical net benefit, higher cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and more costly (cost-dominated), and lower cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and less costly.

### WHO-led consensus statement on vaccine delivery costing: process, methods, and findings [^116jHXvH]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommended costing terminology and principles

After reviewing the definitions of costing terms, the following definitions of costing terms are recommended:
Vaccine delivery costs Costs associated with delivering immunization programs to target populations, exclusive of vaccine costs.
Vaccine cost At a minimum includes the cost of the vaccine and diluent (if applicable); the analysis should include accounting for wastage rates; the analyst should specify whether this also includes injection supplies (syringes), international shipment, insurance, and customs/duties.
Financial cost Monetary outlays, with straight-line depreciation for capital goods; does not include opportunity costs for use of resources or donated goods and services from sources other than the payer(s) defined in the analysis. Definition is dependent on perspective since monetary outlays are specific to the payer(s) defined in the analysis.
Economic cost The value of all resources utilized, regardless of the source of financing. Includes opportunity costs for use of existing resources and any donated goods or services from any source. Capital costs are annualized and discounted.
Undepreciated financial cost Financial costs without depreciation of capital costs (note: such costs have been termed "initial investment" in some costing tools and referred to as fiscal costs in previous analyses.)
Recurrent cost Value of resources that last less than one year. Start-up activity costs may include recurrent costs.
Capital cost Value of resources lasting more than one year such as equipment, buildings, and trainings. Start-up activity costs may include capital costs.
Incremental cost Cost of adding a new service/intervention or a package of services/interventions over and above an existing program; inclusion of existing resources will depend on assumptions made about excess capacity (i.e. whether resources are underemployed; if there are no slack resources (e.g. all personnel time is fully allocated before the addition of the new service/intervention), then their use for the new service or intervention incurs an opportunity cost that should be included — either by measurement or assumption).
Full cost Baseline cost as well as the additional/incremental cost of the new intervention, including vaccine cost.
Cost projection Estimation of future costs of both recurrent and capital inputs.
Prospective data collection Direct observation of resource use during intervention implementation; i.e. data are collected concurrently with intervention implementation.
Retrospective data collection Data collection after resource use is completed.
Start-up cost Cost of initial one-time programmatic activities. Examples may include initial micro-planning, initial training activities, and initial sensitization/social mobilization/information, education, and communication (IEC); does not include routine or repeated programmatic activities such as refresher training or annual microplanning. Start-up activities may include both recurrent and capital costs; they are defined by the non-repeating nature of the activity, not the type of input.
Micro-costing Focuses on granular accounting of input prices and quantities; disaggregates costs of particular output into specific goods and services consumed.
Bottom-up costing Measures input quantities at the client (e.g. per vaccination administered) or activity level.
Top-down costing Divides overall program cost or expenditures, often including those at administrative levels above service delivery level, by number of outputs to calculate unit cost.
Perspective The point of view considered for costs (and benefits, if included) in a costing study, by whom the costs were incurred. Payers are the disbursing agents for a good or service, and may differ from the original source of funding. A provider perspective includes costs incurred by health service providers (can be limited to the government), a payer perspective includes costs to the payer(s), such as government or an external partner, while the societal perspective includes all costs incurred by providers as well as clients.
Shared cost Shared resources that are not used only for immunization, but also for other productive activities.

Clinician–industry interactions — prevalence among physicians and pediatric-specific exposure — include reported prevalence data and pediatric-specific exposure metrics. A 2007 survey of US physicians revealed that 94% reported at least some relationship with the industry; 83% accepted gifts from the industry in the form of food or beverages in the workplace, 78% accepted drug samples, 28% accepted some kind of payment for consulting, speaking, serving on an advisory board, or enrolling patients in clinical trials, 26% took advantage of free or subsidized continuing medical education (CME) events, 15% accepted travel expenses to attend meetings, and 7% accepted gifts in the form of tickets to cultural or sporting events, and in that same survey, pediatricians reported meeting with industry representatives an average of 8 times per month. According to 2015 Open Payments data, approximately 40% of primary care pediatricians have received payments from the industry, most commonly for food and beverages, averaging $95 per physician; however, 559 nonspecialist pediatricians each received more than $10 000 during the year. In older surveys from 1988 and 1994, more than half of physicians named commercial sources, such as industry representatives, as the most influential source in deciding whether to prescribe a new drug, and in a 2000 survey, nearly half reported eating food provided by pharmaceutical representatives, 48% reported providing drug samples to patients on a daily basis, and 76% reported that pharmaceutical representatives were, to some extent, a valuable source of information.

### Towards universal coverage: examining costs of illness, payment, and coping strategies to different population groups in southeast Nigeria [^116RZwYq]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

This study investigated the costs of illness to households in different socio-economic status (SES) groups and geographic places of abode in addition to the mechanisms that the different population groups used to pay for health services and cope with payments. A cross-sectional descriptive study of 3,200 households selected from six communities in two states was conducted using interviewer-administered pre-tested questionnaires. An SES index was used to divide the households into quartiles, and χ(2) analysis was used to determine the relationship of SES and geographic abode of households with cost of illness, payment mechanism, and coping strategies. The results show that malaria was the illness that most people had. The average cost of transportation for malaria was 86 Naira ($0.6 US), and the total cost of treatment was 2,819.9 Naira ($20 US); of this cost, drug costs alone contributed more than 90%. Out of pocket was the main method of payment. Treatment costs differed by geographic location and socio-economic status. Policy measures should establish targeted mechanisms to protect the general population, especially rural dwellers and poorer households, against the financial burden of direct healthcare payments.

Between-groups healthcare costs comparison

Analysis of both CG and IG total healthcare costs showed a daily total cost reduction of $2,049 in the IG compared to the CG, (regression model coefficient CG: $8,522, 95% CI = ($7,539, $9,505), p < 0.001, and IG: -$2,049, 95% CI = (−$3,440, −$659), p = 0.0094), as depicted in Table 4. To account for the difference in group size, a linear regression analysis of the total encounter costs per patient was performed as well. The daily total cost per patient decreased by $9 in the IG compared to the CG, (regression model coefficient CG: $50, 95% CI = ($44, $55), p < 0.001, and IG: −$9, 95% CI = (−$17, −$0.5), p = 0.0402). Similar analyses were performed for both the inpatient encounter costs and the outpatient encounter costs. The model coefficients for each study group and the corresponding p values are listed in Table 4.

Finally, the linear regression models used for inferential analysis were also used to calculate the annualized cost per patient in each group. In summary, the annualized total cost reduction per patient in the IG vs. CG was 20% (3.5 K,14.2 K, p = 0.04). It was primarily driven by 31% lower annualized inpatient cost per patient of the IG compared with the CG (3.7 K,11.8 K, p = 0.02). The annualized outpatient cost per patient was 4% higher in the IG compared to the CG (, 6.1 K vs. $5.8 K, p = 0.10). However, this finding was not statistically significant.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Assessing the quality of economic evidence for guideline value statements requires formal appraisal; the page notes that quality can vary substantially and that each study should undergo a careful quality assessment before incorporation. Factors that determine quality include the population studied, choice of intervention, comparator and outcomes, and overall methodological rigor; generalizability may be limited if the study population differs demographically, clinically, or socioeconomically from the target population, and incorrect assumptions about risks, comparators, or costs can also affect quality.

Table 1
Summary of online and proposed transmission lines, the corresponding link name we associate, and the total cost and source

Figure 10 shows the value estimate accounting for market depth and the cost of geographically similar transmission projects for the 26 projects (22 unique links). The figure breaks out our results for the three types of links we study: cross-interconnect, interregional, and within-region transmission lines. Figure 10b shows the range of cost and value estimates in units of $/MW-yr and shows variation both across the types of links as well as within a given link. Across all 26 projects studied, only 3 projects had cost ranges that exceeded the value estimate range. Figure 10a converts the absolute cost and value estimates into a value-to-cost ratio. We find that all cross-interconnect projects have value-to-cost ratios that exceed 4, suggesting that energy market value alone could motivate transmission development to link these areas. All these lines are in fact being privately proposed by merchant developers. The failure and challenge of developing some of these lines imply non-economic constraints. For instance, merchant developers often must seek customers to subscribe to their proposed lines, but those customers can be utilities that might own and operate their own transmission lines and thus not want to participate in such a competitive development process. For interregional lines within a common interconnection, value-to-cost ratios are smaller (median value of 1.6) with all of the ten lines having value-cost ratios > 1. Within-region lines have the lowest value-to-cost ratios with four of the eleven lines assessed having value-to-cost ratios < 1 and the seven others > 1. Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7 present results for sensitivity cases under different depreciation rates and where the value estimate range is based on a market size (as defined by net demand) that is 50% smaller than the market used here.

### Evaluation of a predevelopment service delivery intervention: an application to improve clinical handovers [^1155e7D4]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2012). Medium credibility.

Limitations of this study

This study is an ex ante evaluation and, therefore, by definition, encompasses many unavoidable uncertainties. This is the first study we know of to attempt an ex ante health economic assessment of a proposed service delivery intervention. It builds on methods we have developed for the device industry. The main problem we have encountered is the large number of potential adverse events, and many of the limitations stem from this conundrum. Since there is little literature to guide us in this area, we had to break new ground, and we do not claim to have provided the definitive solution. The approach we have taken is to group adverse events by severity and duration. This approach is associated with many challenges:
Baseline rates of preventable adverse events have to be apportioned across the categories, and this had to be induced from indirect evidence as described.
Ideally, separate Bayesian densities for effectiveness estimates should be elicited for each group — we assumed a common effect across groups. Severe and minor errors are not well correlated, and adverse event categories may be affected differently by a given intervention.
Different utilities are needed for each group, and these do not appear to be available in the literature — for example, they are not available in the Tufts database. We imputed EQ5D scores in an ad hoc way and translated these into utilities by applying the standard conversion factor (tariff). Clearly, it would have been preferable to obtain these estimates from a more representative sample of respondents. If the idea of categorising endpoints catches on and a classification system can be agreed upon, then a formal study of utilities associated with different types of adverse events (and according to how they arise) would be needed.
Cost savings are very different for each category. Hoonhout et al 's study hypothecated costs on categories of adverse events, but the categories he used did not map precisely onto the categories we used (based on the Harvard Medical Practice Study). Furthermore, the costings in Hoonhout et al 's study omitted costs of long-term care, loss of earnings, and litigation.
The average life expectancy of people who survive with permanent disability was difficult to ascertain, and there will always be a problem in estimating life-years lost in people who die following adverse events.

At the very least, our paper demonstrates the need to develop a consensus on the intellectual framework for assessing the outcomes of complex service and safety interventions, and then to set up epidemiological studies to collect data in the requisite form.

### Cost-effectiveness of the ReDIRECT / counterweight-plus weight management programme to alleviate symptoms of long COVID [^111Xyezu]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis

Figures 4a, c present ICER planes of the bootstrapped results from the National Health Service and Personal Social Services (NHS/PSS) perspective and societal perspective, respectively, while Fig. 4b, d present cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) from the NHS/PSS and societal perspectives, respectively. In Fig. 4a, c, the diagonal lines crossing through the planes represent the £30,000/QALY cost-effectiveness threshold indicated for use by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), with the corresponding CEACs - Fig. 4b, d - showing the probability of weight management being considered cost-effective at different cost-effectiveness thresholds. Figure 4b shows that at a threshold of £20,000/QALY, there would be approximately 72% probability of the intervention being considered cost-effective, increasing to 89% at a threshold of £30,000/QALY. From a broader societal perspective, Fig. 4d shows that there would be a 93% probability of the intervention being considered cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000/QALY, increasing to 96% at a threshold of £30,000/QALY. Further, Fig. 4c, d indicate that the intervention may be cost-saving when a societal perspective is adopted, with a 74% probability of being cost-saving at a threshold of £0/QALY.

### CD4 cell count and viral load monitoring in patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy in Uganda: cost effectiveness study [^114WnAjn]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Cost inputs

The cost of monitoring is predominantly in the consumable test kit. For CD4 counts, the kit constitutes $3.80 (£2.40, €2.70) of the total $4.68 unit cost and for viral load $27.20 of the total $29.64. The remaining costs are capital, primarily for the test machines, staff, and other costs — such as labelling stickers.

Rates of change of ART from first to second line treatment affect the cost of monitoring strategies. From the trial, the rate of change is highest for clinical (1.8% per year) and similar for clinical/CD4 (0.4%) and clinical/CD4/viral load (0.7%). The annual cost of treatment is $104 for first line ART (stavudine 150 mg, lamivudine 40 mg, and nevirapine 200 mg in a fixed dose pill) and $995 for second line ART (tenofovir 300 mg, didanosine 400 mg, and lopinavir 133.3 mg, and ritonavir 30 mg in a fixed dose pill). Different antiretroviral treatment for people coinfected with tuberculosis and the addition of shipping and other ancillary costs raises the average loaded regimen costs for first and second line ART to $125 and $1119 a year, respectively. Furthermore, the cost of first line treatment rises over time (2–4% per month) because of changes in antiretroviral drugs within this regimen.

Table 1 also shows the costs per person year of use of health services in the trial. Differences across monitoring strategies are highest for laboratory monitoring, reflecting quarterly testing: $18.74 for CD4 and $137.30 for CD4 and viral load. The cost of ART varies noticeably by monitoring strategy because of large differences in regimen costs combined with modest differences in change rates. Observed use of diagnostic tests and treatment for opportunistic illnesses varied little (despite sharply different morbidity rates; see sensitivity analyses). Though inpatient costs were higher in the clinical strategy, with daily costs of less than $5 (as is common in the WHO CHOICE database for sub-Saharan Africa) the absolute values are low. Finally, differences in total costs of the arms during the trial reflect differential mortality and thus different total number of person years of receipt of ART.

### Measuring the illicit cigarette market in the absence of pack security features: a case study of South Africa [^111RzC9F]. Tobacco Control (2022). Medium credibility.

Price threshold

The price threshold method identifies a price point that separates legal cigarettes from illegal cigarettes. In the market, the final price of cigarettes is the sum of manufacturing costs, taxes (excise, Value Added Tax (VAT) and possibly other duties), distribution costs (producer, wholesaler, and retailer), and profits. A price threshold is determined, below which it is impossible to sell the product and cover all costs. The price threshold method has previously been used in South Africa, Brazil, and Colombia.

The crucial variable for the price threshold method is the price paid by smokers the last time they bought cigarettes. In the absence of minimum price legislation, it is possible that companies sell fully tax-paid cigarettes at a price below the price threshold (eg, in order to gain market share), but such a pricing strategy would be unsustainable for any length of time.

In South Africa, a specific excise tax is applied to every pack of 20 cigarettes, irrespective of brand, price or other features. In 2017, the excise tax on a pack of 20 cigarettes was R14.30 and the 14% VAT on excise was R2.00 (total tax of R16.30). Evidence from the South African tobacco industry suggests that in 2017, it cost R2.50 to produce a pack of cigarettes. If one adds the 14% VAT on R2.50 (R0.35), the total is R19.15. Information on distribution costs and profits (at the producer, wholesale and retail level) were unavailable. These expenses (and the VAT on them) are not included in the price threshold calculation. The price threshold was set at R20 per pack of 20 cigarettes (R1 per stick). Reporting illicit trade estimates by packaging type (single, 10-pack, 20-pack, 30-pack, carton) is important especially in countries where single sticks are widely available, as illicit trade estimates may differ by packaging type. In South Africa, the proportion of cigarettes sold for R1 or less per stick is highest for cartons, while the proportion is similar for those sold in packs of 20 cigarettes and those sold as singles.

### Cigarette excise tax structure and cigarette prices in nine sub-saharan African countries: evidence from the global adult tobacco survey [^1113QZfW]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2017 Gambia Tobacco Survey, our source of data on cigarette prices for the Gambia, is a nationally representative survey of tobacco use among people aged 18 years and older. The total sample size for completed individual interviews is 1211. Like the GATS, the 2017 Gambia Tobacco Survey has various modules, one of which provides data identical to that of the GATS on cigarette purchases and prices paid.

We calculate cigarette prices in each country from the following questions in the GATS: 'The last time you bought cigarettes for yourself, how many cigarettes did you buy?', from which we obtain the unit of purchase (individual cigarettes, packs or cartons) and the number of cigarettes in each unit. From the question 'How much did you pay for this purchase?' we obtain the overall purchase amount in local currency. For each smoker, we then calculate the price per stick by dividing the reported purchase cost by the number of cigarettes in the purchase. We then multiplied the single-stick price by 20 to estimate the price per 20 sticks. We ran an identical process for the Gambia based on identical questions given in the 2017 Gambia Tobacco Survey data.

To compare prices and their distributions across countries, we convert the derived prices in local currencies into constant 2019 international dollars using the purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factors and the consumer price index of the country. PPP conversion factors and the consumer price index for each country are obtained from the World Bank Development Indicators database. To account for extreme outliers in our constructed price variable, we drop any observation that is greater than 30 international dollars since these prices are unrealistically high and are likely to reflect data capture or reporting errors (table 1). Subsequently, we drop any observation greater than 3 SD from the mean price in each country (table 1).

Data on the tax structures in place at the time of each survey are obtained from the WHO Country Reports that inform the biannual WHO Report on the Global Epidemic and the WHO FCTC Convention Secretariat implementation reports, which form the basis of the Global Progress Report released every second year since 2008. These tax structures were further verified using information from journal articles and reports. As summarised in table 2, the following excise systems are applied in our sample of countries:

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Table 2. Reference case for high-quality CEAs — design and scope — states that both trial-based economic evaluations or population-based economic evaluations can be used to inform economic value statements. The reference case should adopt a health care sector perspective, with results from the societal perspective or a modified societal perspective reported if relevant data are available. The analytic horizon should be long enough to fully capture meaningful differences in health outcomes and costs, and the reference case should consider adopting a lifetime analytic horizon with sensitivity analyses that examine the effect of varying the time horizon and key assumptions. The reference case study population should be as similar as possible to the target population, with subgroup analyses that explore variation in cost effectiveness in key subpopulations reported when findings are meaningfully different. The intervention should be clearly defined, including mode of implementation, any essential concurrent diagnostics or therapies, and a follow-up protocol if relevant. The reference case should consider all appropriate comparator(s) that are indicated and accessible, and it is not appropriate to exclusively compare with a comparator known to have high costs or low effectiveness ("comparator gaming").

### The advertised price of cigarette packs in retail outlets across Australia before and after the implementation of plain packaging: a repeated measures observational study [^1122dFrY]. Tobacco Control (2015). Low credibility.

Store sample and selection

In May 2012, stores were selected from 16 sampling areas within Australia's two largest cities — Melbourne and Sydney — and eight areas in each of the cities of Adelaide and Perth. Sampling areas were selected by stratifying all postcodes within the metropolitan boundaries of each city into four SES categories using the Socioeconomic Indices for Areas 2011 Index of Relative Disadvantage, then randomly selecting equal numbers of postcodes from each SES category in each city. Each of these postcodes formed the primary postcode of that sampling area. For efficiency during store selection, a nearby secondary postcode was selected for each area, matched by SES category. Therefore, each sampling area was comprised of two postcodes.

Maps of each sampling area identifying potentially useful shopping strips and centres were created. Fieldworkers were instructed to visit the largest shopping strip in the primary postcode and, using a rigorous set of walking rules, sample all potentially eligible stores until either their store quotas were met or they had sampled the entire shopping strip. In the latter situation, the second largest shopping area in the primary postcode was then sampled, and so on. If all shopping strips were exhausted in the primary postcode, the sampling procedure was continued in the secondary postcode. Potentially eligible stores were:
Supermarkets: large grocery chains;
Convenience stores: small independent supermarkets and branded chain convenience stores with a broad range of products and extended opening hours;
Small mixed-businesses: milk bars (Melbourne), delis (Adelaide and Perth), corner stores and general stores;
Petrol stations: any store that sold petrol, including those branded as convenience stores or supermarket chains;
Newsagents/lottery outlets: stores that sold newspapers, magazines and stationery as their primary business and/or lottery tickets and services.

Quotas were set at nine stores per area, including one of each store type in every area wherever possible. We visited a total of 796 stores, of which a total of 375 (47.1%) did not meet the eligibility criteria in that they did not sell tobacco (n = 129, 16.2%), had no visible price board (n = 225, 28.3%), or displayed fewer than three single cigarette pack prices (n = 21, 2.6%), leaving 421 stores in the sample.
