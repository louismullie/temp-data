## Question

What vancomycin trough level is recommended for osteomyelitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what vancomycin trough level is recommended for osteomyelitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the IDSA MRSA guidelines specifically recommend for osteomyelitis. Then, I should verify whether this applies consistently to adults and children. Next, I will consider the pharmacodynamic rationale for those targets and the nephrotoxicity trade-offs. Finally, I need to reconcile this with the newer shift toward AUC-guided monitoring before I state the practical recommendation clearly.

> Let me first confirm the adult osteomyelitis target; the 2011 IDSA MRSA guidelines specify vancomycin trough concentrations of 15–20 mcg/mL for vertebral osteomyelitis and the same 15–20 mcg/mL range for nonvertebral osteomyelitis in adults, so the adult osteomyelitis target is 15–20 mcg/mL [^111CrD7v].

> Wait, I should verify the pediatric recommendation so I do not overgeneralize; the same 2011 IDSA MRSA guideline lines for pediatric acute hematogenous MRSA osteomyelitis advise maintaining vancomycin concentrations between 15–20 mcg/mL, which confirms that the 15–20 mcg/mL trough applies to children as well as adults [^115RYb4t] [^115pnhc4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure these targets indeed refer to MRSA osteomyelitis rather than generic "serious infections", and the guideline sections addressing MRSA vertebral and nonvertebral osteomyelitis explicitly anchor the 15–20 mcg/mL trough in that MRSA osteomyelitis context, with vancomycin as a recommended agent alongside other options as clinically appropriate [^111CrD7v] [^114bJkS3].

> Next, I should review why the 15–20 mcg/mL trough was chosen historically; higher troughs were used as a practical surrogate to achieve the pharmacodynamic target AUC/MIC > 400 for serious MRSA infections, although this approach increases exposure and can overshoot the AUC in many patients, which is why the field has been moving away from trough-only targets [^112QWv3D] [^114b2RdS].

> I need to check safety implications; higher vancomycin troughs correlate with more nephrotoxicity, and pediatric data also identify troughs above 15 mcg/mL as an independent risk factor for AKI, reinforcing the need to balance target attainment against renal risk when aiming for the 15–20 mcg/mL trough in osteomyelitis [^1113szqG] [^111br42G] [^114b2RdS].

> Let me reconsider this in light of evolving guidance; the 2020–2021 consensus and subsequent analyses recommend AUC-guided dosing to target an AUC/MIC of 400–600 mg·h/L to maintain efficacy while minimizing AKI, noting that troughs of 15–20 mg/L often push daily AUCs above 600, so if AUC monitoring is available, that strategy is preferred to trough-only control in serious MRSA infections including osteomyelitis [^112QWv3D] [^114b2RdS].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the practical answer; per IDSA 2011 MRSA guidelines, the recommended vancomycin trough for osteomyelitis is 15–20 mcg/mL for both adults and children, while recognizing that many centers now prioritize AUC-guided monitoring with an AUC/MIC goal of 400–600 mg·h/L to reduce nephrotoxicity risk, and in cases with higher MICs or excessive exposure one should reassess agent selection and dosing strategy accordingly [^111w7k4H] [^111CrD7v] [^115RYb4t] [^115pnhc4] [^114aECFP] [^114b2RdS].

For osteomyelitis, vancomycin trough levels should be **15–20 mg/L** [^111CrD7v] to ensure adequate bone penetration and clinical efficacy [^111w7k4H]. Troughs should be measured just before the fourth dose at steady state [^116hsMEx], with earlier checks if renal function changes or dosing is adjusted. Maintain troughs ≥ 15 mg/L to reduce treatment failure [^notfound], but **avoid > 20 mg/L** to limit nephrotoxicity risk [^1113szqG]. Adjust dosing based on troughs, renal function, and patient factors; consider alternatives (e.g. daptomycin, linezolid) [^114ji8fF] if targets are not achieved or toxicity occurs [^114tM1xZ].

## Recommended vancomycin trough levels for osteomyelitis

Adult patients should maintain vancomycin trough concentrations of **15–20 mg/L** [^111CrD7v] to ensure adequate bone penetration and clinical efficacy [^111w7k4H]. Pediatric patients with acute hematogenous MRSA osteomyelitis [^115RYb4t] target the same troughs (**15–20 mg/L**) [^115pnhc4].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommended trough levels

Efficacy improves when vancomycin trough levels are **≥ 15 mg/L** [^113ujL2t] and is associated with reduced treatment failure and better clinical outcomes in serious MRSA infections, including osteomyelitis. The risk of **nephrotoxicity** [^114b2RdS] increases at elevated trough levels (≥ 15 mg/L) [^1113szqG], especially with prolonged therapy or concomitant nephrotoxins.

---

## Timing and frequency of trough level monitoring

Initial monitoring involves obtaining the first trough level **just before the fourth dose at steady state** [^116hsMEx] (typically 30 minutes before the next dose). Subsequent monitoring should be performed **every 3–5 days**, or sooner if renal function or clinical status changes or if dosing is adjusted.

---

## Factors influencing vancomycin trough levels

Several **patient-specific factors** influence vancomycin trough levels and dose adjustments:

| **Factor** | **Impact on vancomycin trough levels** |
|-|-|
| Renal function | - Impaired renal function increases vancomycin levels <br/> - Dose adjustments are necessary [^1113szqG] |
| Age | Older patients may have higher trough levels due to reduced clearance [^1147C16e] |
| Body weight | Obesity or low body weight affects vancomycin distribution and clearance [^114ZGFNy] |
| Concomitant medications | Nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. aminoglycosides) increase nephrotoxicity risk [^1113szqG] |
| Infection severity | Severe infections may require higher doses to achieve therapeutic levels [^116hsMEx] |

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic trough levels

Subtherapeutic levels (** < 15 mg/L**) are associated with increased treatment failure, persistent infection, and longer bacteremia duration [^113ujL2t], whereas supratherapeutic levels (** > 20 mg/L**) are linked to an increased risk of nephrotoxicity [^114b2RdS], prolonged hospitalization, and higher healthcare costs.

---

## Alternative antibiotics for osteomyelitis

If vancomycin trough levels cannot be maintained within the therapeutic range or toxicity occurs, consider **alternative antibiotics**:

- **Daptomycin**: 6 mg/kg IV once daily [^114ji8fF] [^114tM1xZ] [^1166JvUm].

- **Linezolid**: 600 mg IV/PO every 12 hours [^114ji8fF] [^114tM1xZ].

- **Clindamycin**: 600 mg IV every 8 hours.

- **Rifampin**: 600 mg daily or 300–450 mg PO BID (in combination therapy) [^111MGoEg] [^116NjBW6].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

IDSA guidelines recommend vancomycin trough levels of **15–20 mg/L** [^111CrD7v] for osteomyelitis, with careful monitoring to balance efficacy and nephrotoxicity risk [^111w7k4H]. AUC-guided dosing with **AUC/MIC targets of 400–600 mg·h/L** [^112QWv3D] [^114b2RdS] is suggested in recent guidelines to optimize efficacy and minimize nephrotoxicity, though trough monitoring remains practical in many settings.

---

Vancomycin trough levels of **15–20 mg/L** [^111w7k4H] are recommended for osteomyelitis to ensure efficacy and minimize nephrotoxicity. Monitoring and dose adjustments should consider renal function, age, weight, and concomitant medications. Alternative antibiotics should be considered if therapeutic levels cannot be maintained or toxicity occurs [^114ji8fF].

Recent Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections recommend maintaining vancomycin trough concentrations of 15–20 mg/L for serious infections. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies assessing the impact of low (< 15 mg/L) vs. high (≥ 15 mg/L) vancomycin trough levels on the efficacy of MRSA infections treatment. Four prospective and 12 retrospective studies were included (2003 participants).

No significant difference was demonstrated between low and high vancomycin trough levels for the outcome of all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78–1.46, I² = 28%). In studies evaluating mainly MRSA pneumonia, there was significantly higher mortality with low vancomycin levels (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.11–2.84). No significant difference was demonstrated in treatment failure rates (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.88–1.78, I(2) = 51%).

However, excluding one outlier study from the analysis, treatment failure became significantly higher in patients with low vancomycin trough levels (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.12–1.91, I² = 16%). Microbiologic failure rates were significantly higher in patients with low vancomycin levels (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.08–2.26, I(2) = 0%). Nephrotoxicity was significantly higher with vancomycin levels of ≥ 15 mg/L. However, no cases of irreversible renal damage were reported. Data on the effectiveness of higher vancomycin trough levels in the treatment of MRSA infections are limited to a few prospective and mainly retrospective studies.

### Increasing vancomycin serum trough concentrations and incidence of nephrotoxicity [^1113szqG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conflicting evidence regarding the association of vancomycin serum concentrations with efficacy and toxicity has resulted in controversy regarding optimal target concentrations. Recent publications recommend attaining higher vancomycin trough concentrations of 15 to 20 mg/L for target infections, yet limited research is available assessing the correlation of vancomycin serum concentrations with toxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between vancomycin serum trough concentrations and nephrotoxicity.

- **Methods**: A 2-phase retrospective analysis was completed. Phase 1 evaluated 2493 courses of vancomycin completed between January 2003 and December 2007. The analysis describes a 5-year trend in vancomycin prescribing practices and assesses the association of nephrotoxicity with baseline serum creatinine, vancomycin serum trough concentrations, and duration of vancomycin therapy. Phase 2 examined patients receiving vancomycin therapy during 2007 to evaluate specific risk factors for the development of nephrotoxicity.

- **Results**: The proportion of vancomycin serum trough concentrations ≥ 15 mg/L and ≥ 20 mg/L increased significantly over time. Statistical analysis identified vancomycin serum trough concentrations ≥ 14 mg/L, duration of vancomycin therapy ≥ 7 days, and baseline serum creatinine levels ≥ 1.7 mg/dL as independent predictors of nephrotoxicity. Phase 2 analysis again implicated mean vancomycin serum trough concentration as a significant predictor of nephrotoxicity. Nephrotoxicity resolved in 81% (17/21) of cases evaluated.

Practice guidelines for therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin treatment for Staphylococcus aureus infection in adult patients were reviewed by an expert panel from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists. A literature review of existing evidence regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring of serum concentrations, alongside patient outcomes combined with expert opinion regarding the drug's pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety record, resulted in new recommendations for targeting and adjustment of vancomycin therapy.

### Limitations of vancomycin in the management of resistant staphylococcal infections [^116wLKhk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and has been widely used in recent years. However, several recent reports have highlighted its limitations, prompting a reconsideration of its role in managing serious infections. Vancomycin treatment failure rates are associated with an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration as well as a decrease in bacterial killing rates.

The intrinsic limitations of vancomycin include poor tissue penetration, particularly in the lung, relatively slow bacterial killing, and the potential for toxicity. Additionally, intermediate-level vancomycin resistance has emerged among staphylococci, along with rare cases of fully resistant strains. Due to these concerns, it is prudent to carefully establish the diagnosis, test for antimicrobial susceptibility, and monitor serum trough concentrations to ensure adequate dosing when using vancomycin.

### Initial vancomycin dosing protocol to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations in patients undergoing hemodialysis [^113MFBBr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Although recent consensus guidelines proposed more aggressive vancomycin troughs of > 10 or 15–20 mg/L for complicated Staphylococcus aureus infections, dosing information to achieve these targets in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) is scarce.

- **Methods**: We used Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) methods with a previously published population-pharmacokinetic model and relevant patient demographics to evaluate and revise our existing vancomycin dosing protocol (1000-mg load followed by 500-mg maintenance dose, with doses infused during the last hour of dialysis). A new protocol (1000-mg load followed by 500-mg maintenance dose for patients < 100 kg) was developed and prospectively validated to achieve therapeutic serum troughs in patients undergoing high-flux HD.

- **Results**: MCSs predicted that our existing protocol would be suboptimal in more than one-third of patients. Simulations predicted that the new vancomycin dosing protocol would achieve maintenance (pre-HD) troughs of 10–20 mg/L in 86.0% of cases, including 15–20 mg/L in 35.2%. In prospective validation, the observed post-load trough (pre-HD session 2) was 13.5 ± 3.4 mg/L with 76.9% of levels (20 of 26) between 10 and 20 mg/L. The observed maintenance trough was 17.3 ± 4.0 mg/L with 65.5% (19 of 29) between 10 and 20 mg/L and 89.7% (26 of 29) within 10% of the upper limit (i.e. 10–22 mg/L).

- **Conclusions**: In this study, a practical vancomycin dosing protocol for patients undergoing HD was developed and prospectively validated to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations.

### Point: Vancomycin is not obsolete for the treatment of infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^116KZ9WC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Since the discovery, development, and US Food and Drug Administration approval of vancomycin in the 1950s, this agent has remained a mainstay for the treatment of infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, because of the development of new antistaphylococcal antibiotics and reports of vancomycin failures, the utility of vancomycin has recently been questioned. Although vancomycin did not undergo the strict US Food and Drug Administration approval process that is in place today to demonstrate efficacy, there is considerable information available that sheds light on the role vancomycin has in infectious diseases pharmacotherapy today. Additionally, while we look to in vitro susceptibility testing to assess vancomycin activity against S. aureus, we have come to appreciate that resistance of S. aureus to vancomycin can be a continuous — rather than a categorical — phenomenon. This has resulted in clinical microbiology laboratories having difficulty identifying S. aureus that may not respond to conventional doses of vancomycin.

A better understanding is needed of the pharmacodynamic relationship between vancomycin and MRSA as it relates to optimal dosing strategies, including consideration for loading doses and development of rational categorical breakpoints for susceptibility based on clinical outcomes. By better understanding these critical issues, it may be possible to optimize the use of vancomycin, resulting in a cost-effective treatment option for many patients infected with MRSA.

### Vancomycin: we can't get there from here [^114aECFP]. Clinical infectious diseases (2011). Low credibility.

We sought to characterize the pharmacodynamic profile of the more intensive vancomycin dosing regimens currently used in response to the recent vancomycin guidelines.

- **Methods**: A series of Monte Carlo simulations was performed for vancomycin regimens ranging from 0.5 g intravenous (IV) Q12H to 2 g IV Q12H. The probability of achieving an AUC/MIC ratio ≥ 400 for each dosing regimen was calculated for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) from 0.5 to 2 mg/L. The risk of nephrotoxicity for each regimen was derived from a previously published vancomycin trough-nephrotoxicity logistic regression function. Restricted analyses included only subjects with troughs between 15 and 20 mg/L.

- **Results**: At a MIC of 2 mg/L, even the most aggressive dosing regimen considered (2 g every 12 h) only yielded a probability of target attainment (PTA) of 57%, while generating a nephrotoxicity probability upward of 35%. At a MIC of 1 mg/L, doses ≥ 3 g per day provided a PTA in excess of 80% but were associated with unacceptable risks of nephrotoxicity. In the restricted analyses of subjects with troughs between 15 and 20 mg/L, all regimens produced a PTA of 100% at MICs ≤ 1 mg/L. The PTA was variable among the regimens at a MIC of 2 mg/L and was highly dependent on the total daily dose administered.

- **Conclusions**: This study indicates that vancomycin may not be useful for treating serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections with MIC values > 1 mg/L where PTA is questionable. Since an AUC/MIC ratio ≥ 400 is associated with efficacy, one should consider alternative therapies in such cases.

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: A Bayesian-guided approach [^117M3HJo]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Low credibility.

An immunocompromised state was defined as primary immune deficiency, a history of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within 1 year, and the use of immunosuppressants or corticosteroid therapy with prednisone or its equivalent at doses of ≥ 20 mg/day (≥ 2 mg/kg/day for patients weighing less than 10 kg) for at least 14 days within 30 days before MRSA bacteremia. Severe presentation at the onset of MRSA bacteremia was defined as cases requiring new ICU care for the management of sepsis, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or inotropic drug use within 24 hours before or after the onset of MRSA bacteremia.

Polymicrobial bloodstream infection (BSI) was defined as the detection of common commensal microorganisms in two or more consecutive blood cultures from separate blood draws, or at least one pathogenic microorganism, in addition to MRSA, in a blood culture. The definitions of healthcare-associated infection, central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), specific primary site definitions of secondary bacteremia, and catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) were based on respective references.

- **Uncertain focus**: The category of "uncertain focus" included cases where the definition of CRBSI was not met within CLABSI, as well as instances where no identifiable focus was present.

- **Eradicable focus**: The "eradicable focus" category included CRBSI, peripheral catheter infection, surgically removable infections, and drainable abscesses. The term "eradicated focus" refers to the removal of an infected device or the completion of incision and drainage within 3 days of o

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^111HD99q]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

In the pediatric population, infections by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are associated with significant morbidity and hospital costs. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic widely used for the treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-positive microorganisms, especially MRSA. It is recommended to maintain the serum level of vancomycin between 10 and 20 mg/L, which correlates with AUC/MIC > 400 in adults. This pharmacodynamic target is extrapolated to pediatric patients despite the lack of similar evidence. However, recent studies suggest that serum levels between 7 and 10 mg/L are predictive of reaching the pharmacodynamic target in this population. In spite of widespread use, ideal information about dosage for the pediatric population remains limited.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted on patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit during the period from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2014. We investigated variables such as age, positive fluid balance, and the use of vasoactive drugs on the ability of these patients to achieve the proposed recommended serum level target and the vancomycin serum levels.

- **Results**: Our study showed that only 26% of children reached the 10–20 mg/L serum level, whereas the 7–20 mg/L serum level was reached by 51% of patients.

- **Conclusions**: We observed no evidence of a significant association between the inadequacy of serum level and age. The positive fluid balance also had no influence on the vancomycin serum level, but patients using vasoactive drugs had a greater serum level adequacy than those who did not.

### Healthcare-associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: Evidence for reverse vancomycin creep and impact of vancomycin trough values on outcome [^111br42G]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). High credibility.

Elevated vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in Staphylococcus aureus have been associated with worse clinical outcomes in adults. For invasive meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections in adults, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends targeting vancomycin serum trough concentrations between 15 and 20 μg/mL. We evaluated trends in vancomycin MICs from healthcare-associated (HCA) S. aureus bacteremia isolates in children and correlated vancomycin serum trough levels with clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: Patients and isolates were identified from a prospective S. aureus surveillance study at Texas Children's Hospital (TCH). HCA S. aureus bacteremia isolates from 2003 to 2013 were selected. Vancomycin MICs by E-test were determined, and medical records were reviewed. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined as a doubling of the baseline serum creatinine.

- **Results**: Three hundred forty-one isolates met inclusion criteria. We observed a reverse vancomycin creep among MRSA isolates during the study period, with a decline in the proportion of isolates with vancomycin MIC ≥ 2 μg/mL (from 32.7% to 5.6%; P < 0.01). A vancomycin trough of > 15 μg/mL was, however, an independent risk factor for AKI.

- **Conclusions**: Vancomycin MICs are shifting among HCA S. aureus bacteremia isolates, with significant implications for treatment strategies.

### The impact of pediatric-specific vancomycin dosing guidelines: A quality improvement initiative [^113BtJyx]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

There are limited data guiding vancomycin dosing practices in the pediatric population to target the goal troughs recommended by national vancomycin guidelines. In this study, we sought to improve adherence to guideline trough targets through a quality improvement intervention.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was first conducted to assess baseline performance. A multidisciplinary team then developed and implemented a standardized dosing algorithm recommending 15 mg/kg per dose for mild and moderate infections (goal trough: 10–15 µg/mL) and 20 mg/kg per dose for severe infections (goal trough: 15–20 µg/mL), both delivered every 6 hours (maximum single dose: 750 mg). The impact of the intervention was evaluated prospectively using standard statistics and quality improvement methodology. The outcome measures included the percentage of patients with an initial therapeutic trough and the time to therapeutic trough.

- **Results**: A total of 116 patients (49 preintervention, 67 postintervention) were included. Postintervention, there was a significant increase in the percentage of patients with an initial therapeutic trough (6.1% to 20.9%, P = 0.03) and in the percentage of patients with initial troughs between 10 and 20 µg/mL (8.2% to 40.3%, P < .001). The time to therapeutic trough decreased from 2.78 to 1.56 days (P = 0.001), with the process control chart showing improved control postintervention. Vancomycin-related toxicity was unchanged by the intervention (6.1% versus 4.5%; p = 0.70).

In conclusion, using quality improvement methodology with standardized dosing algorithms significantly improved the attainment of therapeutic vancomycin troughs in the pediatric population.

### Coagulase negative staphylococcal sepsis in neonates: Do we need to adapt vancomycin dose or target [^112vZ4n6]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Several limitations of the study need to be noted. The relatively small number of participants in each gestational age (GA) band may have under- or overestimated the within-group variability. Due to the retrospective nature, only C trough data were available, as monitoring of peak concentration has been found to be of no value in guiding vancomycin therapy. Concomitant medications and underlying illnesses may have influenced the pharmacokinetics (PK) of vancomycin, and minor fluctuations may have occurred in the recorded C trough collection time. Microbiological outcomes may have been affected by the combination of antibacterial drugs used at the beginning of the treatment episode.

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^117ET2Fh]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Monitoring vancomycin serum levels is important to track both the toxicity and effectiveness of treatment. In adults, an AUC/MIC > 400 of vancomycin is associated with better clinical and bacteriological responses in patients with MRSA infections, and this target is extended to pediatric patients despite the lack of similar evidence. Although the AUC/MIC > 400 pharmacodynamic parameter is ideal for determining the clinical efficacy of vancomycin, serum concentration can be used as a more practical method.

Tkachuk S. et al. showed that vancomycin target serum levels varied based on patient characteristics; however, for pediatric patients, levels between 6 and 10 mg/L generally suffice to achieve an AUC/MIC ≥ 400. Frymoyer et al. suggest that trough serum levels of 15–20 mg/L are unnecessary to attain AUC/MIC > 400 in the pediatric population, as minimal concentrations of vancomycin between 7 and 10 mg/L were predictive of reaching the pharmacodynamic target of AUC/MIC > 400 in approximately 90% of simulations conducted with children receiving a dose of 15 mg/kg every 6 hours. Our study showed that only 26% of the children reached a serum level of 10–20 mg/L.

Adult guidelines suggest that an AUC/MIC > 400 corresponds to a vancomycin serum concentration of 15 to 20 mg/L for treating MRSA infections; however, children rarely reach this serum level. The study conducted by Kishk et al. found that the correlation of the AUC/MIC > 400 was associated with an average concentration of 11.4 mg/L. In our study, we performed the stratification.

### Prediction of vancomycin area under the curve with trough concentrations only: Performance evaluation of pediatric population pharmacokinetic models [^113QSPJu]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic widely used in the pediatric population, especially in critically ill patients. Over the past decade, multiresistant bacterial cultures, particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), have become endemic in pediatric intensive care units, leading to increased transmission and invasive hospital-acquired infections. Vancomycin is extensively employed for the prevention and treatment of MRSA infections in pediatric patients.

To ensure the efficacy and safety of vancomycin, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is essential. Illness-related pathophysiologic alterations cause changes in individual pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, making TDM particularly challenging in neonatal and pediatric patients. Consequently, inadequate vancomycin treatment may result in drug toxicity, often nephrotoxicity, or subtherapeutic exposure. The vancomycin PK/pharmacodynamic index for optimal exposure is the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 24h) over the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the targeted pathogen (AUC 24h/MIC 1 mg/L). Until the 2020 consensus guideline, TDM based on vancomycin trough levels (10–15 mg/L) had been applied in some countries as the surrogate target accommodating adequate AUC 24h exposure.

To improve antibiotic exposure and ultimately patient outcomes, the updated consensus review recommends calculating the AUC 24h and targeting it to 400 to 600 mg·h/L instead of dosing by trough levels. Ideally, the vancomycin AUC 24h target of 400 to 600 mg·h/L should be obtained by maximum.

### Vancomycin area under the curve-guided dosing and monitoring for adult and pediatric patients with suspected or documented serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: Putting the safety of our patients first [^114b2RdS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

The revised vancomycin consensus guidelines recommended area under the curve (AUC)-guided dosing and monitoring for patients with serious invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections as a measure to minimize vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury (VA-AKI) while maintaining similar effectiveness. Data indicate that the intensity of vancomycin exposure drives VA-AKI risk. Troughs of 15–20 mg/L will ensure an AUC ≥ 400 mg × hr/L, but most patients will have daily AUCs > 600. VA-AKI increases as a function of AUC, especially when > 600. In addition to minimizing VA-AKI risk while maintaining similar efficacy, AUC-guided dosing and monitoring is a more precise way to conduct therapeutic drug monitoring for vancomycin relative to trough-only control.

### Preoperative vancomycin administration for surgical site prophylaxis: Plasma and soft-tissue concentrations in pediatric neurosurgical and orthopedic patients [^115Uqann]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is used for antibiotic prophylaxis in pediatric surgical patients without a complete understanding of plasma and soft-tissue pharmacokinetics. Guidelines recommend incision within 60 minutes after administration; however, tissue vancomycin concentrations at that early time may not be therapeutic. We conducted a study of plasma and skin concentrations in pediatric neurosurgical and orthopedic patients to characterize intraoperative vancomycin pharmacokinetics.

- **Methods**: Patients (0.1–18.8 years of age) undergoing posterior spinal fusion (n = 30) or ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement (n = 30) received intravenous vancomycin 15 mg/kg (maximum 1000 mg) over 1 hour. Skin was biopsied at incision and skin closure. Blood samples were collected at incision, at 2 and 4 hours intraoperatively, and at closure. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to characterize pharmacokinetic parameter estimates and to develop a model of intraoperative plasma and skin vancomycin concentrations versus time.

- **Results**: Pharmacokinetic analysis included data from 59 subjects, 130 plasma samples, and 107 skin samples. A 2-compartment model, volume of the central (Vc) and volume of the peripheral compartment (V2), proved to have the best fit. Stepwise covariate selection yielded a significant relationship for body surface area on elimination clearance and body weight on V2. Skin vancomycin concentrations rose continuously during surgery. Modeling predicted that equilibration of skin and plasma vancomycin concentrations took ≥ 5 hours.

- **Conclusions**: Skin vancomycin concentrations continued to increase during surgery and required more than 5 hours to equilibrate with plasma concentrations.

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: A bayesian-guided approach [^11684FrQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

- **Study population and design**: This retrospective study reviewed the medical records of all patients aged 3 months to 18 years diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia at Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, a tertiary referral center in Seoul, between September 2013 and December 2021. Patients meeting the following criteria were excluded: those who received vancomycin within 72 hours before the onset of MRSA bacteremia, those with a duration of vancomycin treatment less than 72 hours, and those who received renal replacement therapy at baseline.

- **Data collection**: Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected, including underlying diseases, primary infection source, history of infection source control, and details of vancomycin administration (timing, dose, and interval). Additional information on the use of inotropes, ventilator support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy, and ICU stay was recorded. Laboratory data, such as blood culture results, vancomycin MIC, vancomycin C trough, and serum creatinine levels, were extracted. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Schwartz equation. Serum vancomycin levels were measured using the Cobas Integra 800 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and vancomycin C trough was generally sampled before the 4th or 5th dose within 30 minutes before the next dose of vancomycin.

- **Ethical considerations**: The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center (IRB No. 2021–1667).

- **Outcomes**: The primary outcome measures were microbiological and clinical outcomes. As a microbiological outcome, persistent bacteremia was evaluated.

Vancomycin area under the curve/minimal inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) > 400 best predicts the outcome when treating invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection; however, trough serum concentrations are used clinically to assess the appropriateness of dosing. We used pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation to examine the relationship between vancomycin trough values and AUC/MIC in children receiving vancomycin 15 mg/kg every 6 hours and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MIC of 1 μg/mL. A trough of 7–10 μg/mL predicted achievement of AUC/MIC > 400 in > 90% of children.

### Implementation of a dose calculator for vancomycin to achieve target trough levels of 15–20 microg/mL in persons undergoing hemodialysis [^116cRbsd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011).

Vancomycin is a key antibiotic for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections in patients undergoing dialysis. It has a narrow therapeutic range. Overdosing poses a risk of nephro- and ototoxicity, whereas underdosing predisposes patients to treatment failure and the emergence of drug resistance. Trough levels of 15–20 μg/mL have been identified as the optimal target trough levels.

A multivariate model called the vancomycin dose calculator (VDC) was prospectively developed and validated to permit accurate vancomycin dosing in persons undergoing hemodialysis. The model identified three simple parameters responsible for 94.6% of the variance observed: predialysis vancomycin trough level, dry body weight, and period to the next dialysis session. Maintenance dosing was accurate in 77.9% of patients, and major over- and underdosing were avoided in the remaining patients. The mean measured trough level of 16.5 μg/mL was 5.6% lower than the mean predicted trough level of 17.5 μg/mL. With regard to loading doses, a fixed loading dose of 20 mg/kg led to subtherapeutic trough levels in one-half of patients.

The VDC permits accurate vancomycin maintenance dosing based on predialysis trough level, dry body weight, and period to the next dialysis session in the majority of patients undergoing hemodialysis. Higher loading doses that accounted for the period to the next dialysis may be more appropriate than the fixed loading doses used in this study.

### The influence of the route of antibiotic administration, methicillin susceptibility, vancomycin duration and serum trough concentration on outcomes of pediatric Staphylococcus aureus bacteremic osteoarticular infection [^11463cEV]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Bacteremia is often a factor used to decide the need for prolonged intravenous antimicrobial therapy in osteoarticular infections (OAIs). We examined treatment practices and outcomes of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremic osteoarticular infections (BOAIs) evaluated at Texas Children's Hospital.

- **Methods**: Cases of acute hematogenous OAI in children with positive blood cultures for S. aureus at Texas Children's Hospital between 2011 and 2014 were reviewed. Orthopedic complications included chronic osteomyelitis, growth arrest, pathologic fracture, avascular necrosis, and chronic dislocation. Acute kidney injury was defined as a doubling of the baseline creatinine.

- **Results**: One hundred ninety-two cases of S. aureus OAI were identified, with 102 cases of BOAI included (35 methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]). Twenty-five patients were discharged home on oral antibiotics. Patients discharged on oral antibiotics had a shorter duration of fever, had a more rapid decline in C-reactive protein, and were less likely to have MRSA. The frequency of orthopedic complications did not increase in patients who received early transition to oral antibiotics. For patients with MRSA bacteremia, the rates of complications between those who received ≥ 7 days versus 15 µg/mL were not associated with a decreased duration of fever, bacteremia, hospitalization, need for repeat operation, or orthopedic complications, but were associated with acute kidney injury.

- **Conclusions**: S. aureus BOAIs are associated with substantial…

### Prediction of vancomycin area under the curve with trough concentrations only: Performance evaluation of pediatric population pharmacokinetic models [^112tR5fN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Improvements to vancomycin exposure may be achieved through model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) based on patient characteristics and measured blood samples. The sampling strategy for traditional vancomycin dose adaptations relies on the interpretation of trough concentrations. However, for accurate estimation of the AUC 24h, it is advised to obtain at least one postdistributional peak and one trough vancomycin concentration at the end of a dosing interval. The ability to accurately determine a trough-based AUC 24h without a peak concentration offers advantages such as improved clinical feasibility and reduced patient burden. In this study, we aim to retrospectively evaluate the accuracy and precision of trough-based AUC 24h estimation using existing population pharmacokinetic (popPK) models for vancomycin and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) blood samples for pediatric patients.

### An evaluation of the empirical vancomycin dosing guide in pediatric cardiology [^1118k2Ef]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic used for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). An initial dose ranging between 40 and 60 mg/kg/day, divided every 6–8 hours, is usually sufficient and safe for most pediatric patients. The serum blood level, obtained at a steady state just before the fourth dose, serves as a robust pharmacodynamic marker to ensure drug safety and efficacy. For general indications, a trough level ranging between 10 and 15 mg/L is often required, while a higher level ranging between 15 and 20 mg/L is recommended for more complicated infections.

Due to the emergence of bacterial tolerance and resistance, higher doses are currently prescribed to achieve the target vancomycin trough concentration of 7–10 mg/L, a level desired for the majority of mild to moderate infections precipitated by MRSA. Major organizations, such as the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines, endorse a total daily dose (TDD) of 60–80 mg/kg for children younger than 12 years old and 60–70 mg/kg for children older than 12 years for MRSA strains with a MIC ≤ 1 mg/L.

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: A Bayesian-guided approach [^112wmScK]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

A recent multicenter observational study on hospitalized adults with MRSA bacteremia treated with vancomycin reported that higher vancomycin exposure with an AUC > 515 mg·h/L did not provide advantages, nor did it act as a worsening factor in terms of treatment failure, defined as 30-day mortality or persistent bacteremia lasting ≥ 7 days. However, a study by McNeil et al. on pediatric healthcare-associated S. aureus bacteremia observed a trend toward a longer duration of bacteremia and higher mortality in the higher vancomycin exposure group (vancomycin C trough > 15 mg/L). Similarly, in our study, the higher vancomycin exposure group (AUC 24–48 > 530 mg·h/L) showed increased rates of AKI, along with trends toward higher 30-day mortality and greater rates of persistent bacteremia at 48 hours. These findings suggest that higher vancomycin exposure is associated not only with increased AKI but also with poorer clinical and microbiological outcomes in pediatric MRSA bacteremia. The exact explanation for these findings remains unclear. While there were no significant differences in baseline glomerular filtration rate between the higher and lower vancomycin exposure groups, patients in the higher exposure group tended to present with more severe conditions at baseline (although this trend was not statistically significant), which may have led to more aggressive dosing. Moreover, consistently worse clinical and microbiological outcomes were observed in the higher vancomycin exposure group, regardless of age group. This suggests that the observed outcomes are unlikely to be attributed to differences in age alone.

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: A Bayesian-guided approach [^1144YLWX]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Estimation of vancomycin AUC was conducted using the Bayesian-guided dosing software, PrecisePK (PrecisePK, CA). The software utilizes various prior population models to make predictions based on individual pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters — such as age, sex, height, weight, and serum creatinine. It automatically selects the model appropriate for pediatric patients with serum creatinine levels below 0.9 mg/dL according to Le et al, and for those with renal insufficiency with serum creatinine levels of 0.9 mg/dL or greater according to Le et al. Individual adjustments were then made based on posterior probabilities derived from the obtained vancomycin concentrations to estimate the area under the curve (AUC).

- **Receiver operating characteristic analysis for the optimal vancomycin AUC target**: In line with recently published guidelines, an initial analysis was conducted to assess whether an AUC of 400 mg·h/L or higher (assuming a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.0 mg/L) could serve as a surrogate marker for predicting clinical or microbiological outcomes in pediatric patients with MRSA bacteremia. The AUC during the second 24 hours (AUC 24–48), the period when vancomycin concentrations are predominantly measured, was chosen for analysis. If an AUC 24–48 of 400 mg·h/L or higher was found ineffective as a surrogate marker, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was then performed to identify alternative AUC values that could optimize primary and secondary outcomes. To evaluate the predictive performance of vancomycin AUC for these specified outcomes and to determine the optimal threshold values, the maximized Youden index (J = sensitivity + specificity − 1) was utilized.

Despite the need for effective vancomycin therapy, there are few data guiding vancomycin monitoring in children. We reviewed retrospectively vancomycin use in children 1 month to 12 years of age. Initial and adjusted target trough vancomycin concentrations in serum were infrequently achieved regardless of the dosing schedule. Currently recommended trough concentrations need to be re-examined with a more detailed pharmacokinetic study in children.

### Correlation of a vancomycin pharmacokinetic model and trough serum concentrations in pediatric patients [^112zxvAT]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Vancomycin trough concentrations specific to pediatric patients have yet to be validated to achieve an area under the curve (AUC) over 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio ≥ 400. The primary objective of this study was to validate a pharmacokinetic model in a pediatric hospital and determine the correlation between a calculated AUC/MIC ratio and measured trough vancomycin concentration.

- **Methods**: A retrospective evaluation of patients aged 3 months to 18 years prescribed vancomycin at a pediatric hospital between January 2012 and June 2013 was conducted. The correlation between patient-specific AUC/MIC and measured vancomycin trough concentration was assessed.

- **Results**: Forty pediatric patients with 40 vancomycin trough concentrations and documented Staphylococcus aureus cultures were included in the study. The median age was 8.5 (interquartile range, 2–14.3) years, median weight 28.7 (range, 14–50.2) kg, and mean baseline serum creatinine 0.51 ± 0.3 mg/dL. The mean daily dose of vancomycin prescribed was 58 ± 13.8 mg/kg/d. The mean vancomycin trough concentration was 11 ± 5.5 mcg/mL, and the mean AUC/MIC was 534 ± 373. No correlation was found between trough concentration and AUC/MIC (r = 0.082, p = 0.07).

- **Conclusions**: This study validates the clinical applicability of a pharmacokinetic model for calculating vancomycin clearance to determine patient-specific AUC over 24 hours in pediatrics. Trough concentrations associated with proposed therapeutic AUC/MIC ratios were lower than reported in the adult population. Further research is needed to determine if AU.

### Current recommended dosing of vancomycin for children with invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections is inadequate [^114QrFHn]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Vancomycin's area-under-the-concentration-time-curve (AUC) for 24 hours, divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (AUC24/MIC) > 400, optimally treats invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in adults. However, it is unknown whether recommended vancomycin dosing regimens for children achieve this value.

- **Methods**: AUC24/MIC was calculated in children using vancomycin doses of 40 and 60 mg/kg/d. AUC24 was calculated as daily dose/vancomycin clearance. Vancomycin clearance in children was estimated by two approaches: (1) using previously reported literature on vancomycin clearance, and (2) calculated vancomycin clearance using previously derived predictor models and a hypothetical population of healthy children. A representative MIC of hospital MRSA isolates was used (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 microg/mL).

- **Results**: The MIC50/90 for pediatric MRSA isolates in the previous year was 1.0 microg/mL. With a dose of 40 mg/kg/d, both approaches consistently predicted AUC24/MIC 400 was more readily achieved when MIC was 1.0 microg/mL. However, an MIC of 2.0 microg/mL resulted in AUC24/MIC 400 for invasive MRSA infections even when MIC is 1.0 microg/mL. A starting dose of 60 mg/kg/d should be used in settings where isolates with MIC of 1.0 are common. Alternatives to vancomycin should strongly be considered for patients with MIC ≥ 2.0 microg/mL.

### Recent changes in vancomycin use in renal failure [^116Edsz1]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a key tool in the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections. A progressive increase in vancomycin resistance with consequent treatment failure has been observed in staphylococci. Therefore, new dosing guidelines advocating much higher vancomycin doses have been issued, with target trough levels of 15–20 microg/ml proposed. Whether and how these targets can be achieved in patients with chronic kidney disease or those on dialysis are still under evaluation. The higher vancomycin doses required to meet these treatment targets carry a substantial risk for nephrotoxicity, with this risk increasing incrementally with higher trough levels and longer duration of vancomycin use. Critically ill patients, those receiving concomitant nephrotoxic agents, and patients with already compromised renal function are particularly at risk for vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity.

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: A Bayesian-guided approach [^115DkTY8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

Vancomycin pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters are critical in understanding the treatment of pediatric MRSA bacteremia. The initial vancomycin dose, initial C trough, AUC 0–24, and AUC 24–48 are detailed in Table 2. The median time for measuring the initial C trough was 30.8 hours (IQR: 19.8–50.3) after starting vancomycin treatment. Among the MRSA isolates, 76.8% had a vancomycin MIC of ≤ 1.0 mg/L, with 42 isolates (75%) displaying an MIC of 1.0 mg/L, and one isolate (1.8%) showing an MIC of 0.5 mg/L. Conversely, 13 isolates (23.2%) had an MIC of 2.0 mg/L. A moderate positive correlation (r = 0.646; P < 0.01) was found between the average C trough within the first 72 hours and AUC 24–48.

- **Significance of vancomycin AUC 24–48 of 400 mg·h/L**: Patients with an AUC 24–48 ≥ 400 mg·h/L displayed similar demographic and clinical characteristics compared to those with an AUC 24–48 < 400 mg·h/L, except for a higher median age (2.8 vs. 1.0 year, P < 0.01) seen in Table 3. The primary outcomes, including clinical failure and persistent bacteremia, were not significantly different between the two groups. However, acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred exclusively in patients with an AUC 24–48 ≥ 400 mg·h/L. Among these patients, AUC 24–48 values were significantly higher (572.1 mg·h/L for AKI vs. 374.1 mg·h/L for non-AKI, P = 0.01), despite receiving slightly lower initial vancomycin doses (30.6 vs. 42.6 mg/kg/day, P = 0.06).

### The association between vancomycin trough concentrations and acute kidney injury in the neonatal intensive care unit [^115GgVNk]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

There has been an ongoing debate on the dosage, frequency of administration, and the most appropriate monitoring of vancomycin therapy. This is due to multiple factors responsible for the clearance of vancomycin, including gestational age, post-natal age, weight, renal tubular function, and creatinine levels. Historically, area-under-the-curve concentration versus time to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC:MIC) was accepted as the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic predictor of adequate treatment with vancomycin. An AUC:MIC > 400 has been recommended to achieve the desired antimicrobial effect in both adult and pediatric populations. A consensus statement released by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists in 2009 recommended vancomycin as the first choice drug for MRSA with MIC 400 if the MIC of MRSA is < 1. However, with increasing MICs, higher trough concentrations are recommended. In serious clinical infections such as endocarditis, meningitis, hospital-acquired pneumonia, bacteremia, and osteomyelitis, trough concentrations between 15–20 are recommended. These higher troughs allow for greater vancomycin exposure, a higher AUC, and the ability to reach the goal AUC:MIC ≥ 400, or a trough concentration approximately fo

### Relationship between initial vancomycin concentration-time profile and nephrotoxicity among hospitalized patients [^11418UTz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Data suggest that higher doses of vancomycin can increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. No study has been undertaken to determine the pharmacodynamic index (i.e. the area under the curve [AUC] or the trough value) that best describes the relationship between vancomycin exposure and onset of nephrotoxicity.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted among patients who received vancomycin for a suspected or proven gram-positive infection during the period from 1 January 2005 through 31 December 2006 at Albany Medical Center Hospital. Patients were included in our study if they were 18 years or older, had an absolute neutrophil count of ≥ 1000 cells/mm³, received vancomycin for more than 48 hours, had one vancomycin trough level collected within 96 hours of vancomycin therapy, and had a baseline serum creatinine level of < 2.0 mg/dL.

	- Patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, received intravenous contrast dye within 7 days of starting vancomycin or during therapy, or required vasopressor support during therapy. Demographics, comorbid conditions, and treatment data were collected. The highest observed vancomycin trough value within 96 hours of initiation of vancomycin therapy and the estimated vancomycin AUC were analyzed as measures of vancomycin exposure. The vancomycin AUC value from 0 to 24 hours at steady state (in units of mg x h/L) for each patient was estimated using the maximum a posteriori probability Bayesian procedure in ADAPT II. Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in serum creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL or 50% from baseline.

### Coagulase negative staphylococcal sepsis in neonates: do we need to adapt vancomycin dose or target [^1162rFdd]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

**What this study adds**: Trough concentrations of vancomycin required for an AUC of 400 in neonates are lower than reported for adults. Based on the actual MIC distribution of neonatal invasive CoNS strains, a vancomycin dosing AUC/MIC of 400 is achieved in less than half of neonates. Vancomycin doses required for an 80% probability of this target attainment are associated with potentially toxic trough levels. With vancomycin dosing, treatment failure occurs in about a quarter of cases.

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^115rZ3cp]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Infections in intensive care units (ICU) are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. In the United States, infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are responsible for 8% of all hospital-acquired infections and are associated with an estimated 18,650 deaths annually. In the pediatric population, MRSA infections also result in significant morbidity and hospital expenses.

The appropriate treatment for severe infections caused by S. aureus represents a significant challenge, as therapeutic failure can result in death. Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is widely used for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-positive microorganisms, particularly MRSA. It is currently considered the first choice for empirical therapy of these infections.

According to the consensus recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), American Society of Health System Pharmacists, and Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, maintaining the area under the curve (AUC)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) > 400 is a suitable target to achieve a successful outcome in the treatment of MRSA infections. This pharmacodynamic target is considered the best predictor of microbiological and clinical outcomes when treating MRSA infections. However, the calculation of the AUC is clinically impractical. Trough serum concentration, measured shortly before the fourth dose at steady state, with a value of 15–20 mg/L, is correlated with an AUC/MIC > 400 in adult patients with MRSA MIC < 1 mcg/mL.

Medical therapy of chronic osteomyelitis is largely based on experimental models, historical observational or non-randomized studies, and expert opinions. A minimum of 4–6 weeks of intravenous antimicrobial therapy targeting the causative organism, given in conjunction with surgery, has become the standard for chronic long-bone osteomyelitis in adults. Given the expense, inconvenience, and potential complications inherent to such a treatment program, alternative strategies including effective oral antimicrobial regimens are desirable.

Several oral antimicrobial agents have undergone evaluation for the treatment of acute and chronic osteomyelitis recently. These include fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and linezolid. For the treatment of atypical causes of Gram-positive osteomyelitis, other oral therapies have been evaluated with reported success in small numbers of patients.

The standard of care for chronic osteomyelitis in adults remains intravenous antimicrobial therapy, in combination with surgery, for at least 4–6 weeks. Acute osteomyelitis in the pediatric population, as well as osteomyelitis caused by atypical Gram-positive organisms and some Gram-negative organisms, may be treated successfully with oral antibiotics. Some antimicrobials have equivalent concentration in serum whether administered orally or parenterally. When therapy with these antimicrobials is indicated, the oral route is preferred in compliant patients. As research continues in this area and as new drug formulations are developed, oral therapy may become an increasingly viable option.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children [^1152Kb4n]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vertebral osteomyelitis, particularly in patients with MRSA osteomyelitis, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend considering administering an additional 1–3 months of oral rifampin-based combination therapy. This may be extended longer for chronic infection or if debridement is not performed. The oral therapy should be combined with TMP/SMX, doxycycline-minocycline, clindamycin, or a fluoroquinolone, chosen based on susceptibilities.

### Continuous versus intermittent vancomycin infusions in infants: A randomized controlled trial [^112oUnxg]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

In adults, continuous infusions of vancomycin (CIV) are associated with earlier attainment of target drug concentrations, require fewer blood samples for monitoring, and may reduce drug toxicity. We aimed to determine, in young infants, if CIV or intermittent infusions of vancomycin (IIV) better achieve target vancomycin concentrations at the first steady-state level, and to compare the frequency of drug-related adverse effects.

- **Methods**: In a multicenter randomized controlled trial in two tertiary neonatal units over a 40-month period, young infants aged 0 to 90 days requiring vancomycin therapy for at least 48 hours were randomly assigned to CIV and IIV.

- **Results**: Of 111 infants randomized, 104 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Baseline characteristics were similar for both groups. The proportion of infants achieving target concentrations at the first steady-state level was higher for CIV compared with IIV (45 in 53 [85%] vs. 21 in 51 [41%]; P < .001). Fewer dose adjustments were required in the CIV group (median 0; range 0–1) compared with the IIV group (median 1; range 0–3; P < .001). The mean daily dose required to achieve target concentrations was lower with CIV compared with IIV (40.6 [SD 10.7] vs. 60.6 [SD 53.0] mg/kg per day, respectively; p = 0.01). No drug-related adverse effects occurred in either group.

- **Conclusions**: In young infants, CIV is associated with earlier and improved attainment of target concentrations compared with IIV. Lower total daily doses are required to achieve target levels with CIV. There is no difference in the rate of adverse effects between the two methods.

### The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of vancomycin [^114ZGFNy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is one of only a few antibiotics available to treat patients infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. Therefore, understanding the clinical implications of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of vancomycin is a necessity for clinicians. Vancomycin is a concentration-independent antibiotic (also referred to as a "time-dependent" antibiotic), and several factors affect its clinical activity, including variable tissue distribution, inoculum size, and emerging resistance. This article reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data related to vancomycin and discusses such clinical issues as toxicities and serum concentration monitoring.

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: A revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^112QWv3D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Recent clinical data on vancomycin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics suggest a reevaluation of dosing and monitoring recommendations. The previous 2009 vancomycin consensus guidelines recommend trough monitoring as a surrogate marker for the target area under the curve over 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC). However, recent data suggest that trough monitoring is associated with higher nephrotoxicity. This document is an executive summary of the new vancomycin consensus guidelines for vancomycin dosing and monitoring. It was developed by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists vancomycin consensus guidelines committee. These consensus guidelines recommend an AUC/MIC ratio of 400–600 mg*hour/L (assuming a broth microdilution MIC of 1 mg/L) to achieve clinical efficacy and ensure safety for patients being treated for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.

### Oral antibiotic management of acute osteomyelitis of the hand: Outcomes and cost comparison to standard intravenous regimen [^116r85TX]. Hand (2021). Low credibility.

Acute, direct inoculation osteomyelitis of the hand has traditionally been managed by intravenous antibiotics. With proven high levels of bone and joint penetration, specific oral antimicrobials may deliver clinical efficacy but at a substantially lower cost.

- **Methods**: Sixty-nine adult patients with surgically proven acute, direct inoculation osteomyelitis of the hand were evaluated for clinical response on a 6-week post-debridement regimen of susceptibility-matched oral antibiotics. Inclusion required gross purulence and bone loss demonstrated at the initial debridement and radiographic evidence of bone loss. Two patients with extreme medical comorbidities were excluded. There were 53 men and 16 women with a mean age of 46 years. The mean follow-up was 16 weeks (± 10). The cost model for outpatient oral antibiotic treatment was intentionally maximized using Walgreen's undiscounted cash price. The cost model for the traditional intravenous treatment regimen was intentionally minimized using the fully discounted Medicare fee schedule.

- **Results**: All patients achieved resolution of osteomyelitis by clinical and radiographic criteria. In addition, 7 patients underwent successful subsequent osteosynthesis procedures at the previously affected site without reactivation. The mean post-debridement direct cost of care per patient in the study cohort was $482.85, which was the cost of the antibiotic alone. The post-debridement direct cost of care per patient on a regimen of vancomycin 1.5 g every 12 hours via a peripherally inserted central catheter line was $21,646.90.

### What proportion of vancomycin trough levels are drawn too early? Frequency and impact on clinical actions [^112DRAJk]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Vancomycin trough levels are recommended to predict vancomycin efficacy, and inaccurate levels may lead to inappropriate clinical actions. However, the frequency of timing errors and associated clinical impact is unknown. We retrospectively analyzed vancomycin levels (n = 2,597) measured during 13 months at a large academic medical center. Of the specimens, 41.3% were drawn too early. These samples yielded significantly higher average ± SD vancomycin concentrations than correctly timed samples (22.1 ± 11.7 mg/L vs. 15.5 ± 8.6 mg/L; P < .001), and, consequently, clinicians were more likely to decrease, discontinue, or hold a patient's vancomycin dose (25.6% vs. 21.4%; P < .02) or repeat the vancomycin level (29.2% vs. 20.0%; P < .001). A substantial proportion of specimens collected to assess vancomycin efficacy were drawn too early, leading to overestimation of patients' true trough level and possible underdosing of vancomycin or a high rate of repeat tests for vancomycin.

### Is it time to replace vancomycin in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections [^111m3NJf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

For more than four decades, vancomycin has been the antibiotic of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Recently, infections due to isolates with high but susceptible vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations have been associated with additional treatment failures and patient mortality. These poorer outcomes may, in part, be explained by the inability to attain appropriate vancomycin levels in these patients. However, assumptions that these poor outcomes are solely due to failure to achieve optimal serum levels of vancomycin are premature.

The availability of effective alternatives further erodes the position of vancomycin as first-line therapy. The emergence of resistance and cost considerations, however, favor a more measured approach when using alternative antimicrobials. Collectively, the available data suggest that the optimal therapy for MRSA infections remains unclear. In the absence of further data, the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines remain relevant and inform clinicians of best practices for treating patients with MRSA infections.

### Vancocin [^112ZVBH8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Vancomycin is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

- **Clinical pharmacology**:
	- **Mechanism of action**: The bactericidal action of vancomycin against _Staphylococcus aureus_ and the vegetative cells of _Clostridioides difficile_ results primarily from inhibition of cell-wall biosynthesis. In addition, vancomycin alters bacterial-cell-membrane permeability and RNA synthesis.
	- **Pharmacokinetics**: Vancomycin is poorly absorbed after oral administration. During multiple dosing of 250 mg every 8 hours for 7 doses, fecal concentrations of vancomycin in volunteers exceeded 100 mg/kg in the majority of samples. No blood concentrations were detected, and urinary recovery did not exceed 0.76%. In anephric subjects with no inflammatory bowel disease who received vancomycin oral solution 2 g for 16 days, blood concentrations of vancomycin were less than or equal to 0.66 mcg/mL in 2 of 5 subjects. No measurable blood concentrations were attained in the other 3 subjects. Following doses of 2 g daily, concentrations of the drug were > 3100 mg/kg in the feces and < 1 mcg/mL in the serum of subjects with normal renal function who had _C. difficile-associated_ diarrhea. After multiple-dose oral administration of vancomycin, measurable serum concentrations may occur in patients with active _C. difficile-associated_ diarrhea, and in the presence of renal impairment, the possibility of accumulation exists. It should be noted that the total systemic and renal clearances of vancomycin are reduced in the elderly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Evaluation of a pilot vancomycin precision dosing advisory service on target exposure attainment using an interrupted time series analysis [^116o6HSw]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

This study evaluated the ability of a pilot therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) Advisory Service to facilitate vancomycin therapeutic target attainment within a real-world clinical setting. The service provided area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-guided vancomycin dose recommendations, utilizing Bayesian forecasting software and clinical expertise, to prescribers at an Australian hospital.

A retrospective audit of intravenous vancomycin therapy lasting more than 48 hours in adults aged 18 years and older was conducted over a 54-month period. This audit aimed to evaluate the attainment of established vancomycin pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets (AUC over 24 hours/minimum inhibitory concentration: 400–600) both before (36-month period) and after (18-month period) the implementation of the service. Interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate monthly measures of the median proportion of therapy spent within the target range. Indices of time to target attainment were also assessed before and after the implementation of the service.

The final cohort included 1,142 courses of vancomycin administered to 816 patients, with 835 courses involving 596 patients occurring before the implementation of the service, and 307 courses involving 220 patients occurring after. Prior to the pilot service, the median proportion of time within the target range was 40.1% (95% CI, 34.3–46.0%); this increased by 10.4% (95% CI, 1.2–19.6%, P = 0.03) following the implementation of the service and was sustained throughout the post-service evaluation period. The post-service target attainment at 48–72 hours after initiation of therapy showed an increase of 7.8% (95% CI, 1.3–14.3%, P = 0.02). The findings of this study…

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children [^112wgakb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

For nonvertebral osteomyelitis, particularly in pediatric patients, the IDSA 2011 guidelines suggest considering the administration of clindamycin intravenously at 10–13 mg/kg/dose every 6–8 hours (totaling 40 mg/kg/day) as empirical therapy. This is recommended for stable pediatric patients without ongoing bacteremia or intravascular infection, provided that the clindamycin resistance rate is low (< 10%). Transition to oral therapy is advised if the strain is susceptible.

### Association between vancomycin trough concentrations and duration of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children [^113GG2Dj]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

In a multicenter retrospective study, we sought to determine the optimal vancomycin trough concentration that would impact the duration of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children. We found that a median vancomycin trough concentration of < 10 µg/mL within the first 72 hours may be associated with a longer duration of bacteremia compared to a median trough concentration of ≥ 10 µg/mL.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children [^111LWrDw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vertebral osteomyelitis, particularly in patients with MRSA osteomyelitis, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend the administration of alternative options to vancomycin and clindamycin in pediatric patients:

- **Daptomycin**: Administer intravenously at 6 mg/kg/day once daily.
- **Linezolid**: For patients aged 12 years and older, administer 600 mg orally or intravenously twice daily. For patients younger than 12 years, administer 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours.

### Optimizing vancomycin monitoring in pediatric patients [^116BXYWr]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Several studies have reported that trough levels may not be optimal for monitoring vancomycin therapy due to the risks of overexposure and nephrotoxicity. Therefore, we developed a population pharmacokinetic model to optimize vancomycin dosing and monitoring in pediatrics.

- **Methods**: Data were retrospectively collected on 76 pediatric patients aged 1–12 years, admitted to general pediatric wards or intensive care units at King Saud University Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The predictability of three methods for calculating the area under the curve (AUC) at steady state was assessed for optimum vancomycin therapy monitoring. The three methods were simple linear regression, Bayesian approach, and the two-sample pharmacokinetic equation method. We also used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the dosing of vancomycin.

- **Results**: A one-compartment model adequately described the data. A strong correlation occurred between the observed and predicted AUC from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0–24h) calculated using the Bayesian approach with a trough sample only or pharmacokinetic equations based on two measured samples (R = 0.93 and 0.92, respectively). For the simple linear regression method with a trough sample only, the predicted AUC0–24h at steady state with vancomycin trough levels of 10, 15, and 20 µg/mL were 413, 548, and 714 µg·hour/mL, respectively. The target AUC0–24h above 400 was achieved in 46% and 95% of individuals with trough values of 7–11 and 11–15 µg/mL, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations showed that doses of 60–80 mg/kg/day are needed to optimize vancomycin therapy.

- **Conclusions**:

### Should therapeutic drug monitoring based on the vancomycin area under the concentration-time curve be standard for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections?-No [^116MYdo4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

In this counterpoint, we critically appraise the evidence supporting therapeutic drug monitoring based on the vancomycin 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24) for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. We reveal methodological weaknesses and inconsistencies in the data and suggest that, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence of benefit compared with modestly reducing trough targets, alternative strategies are more likely to result in superior safety and efficacy. These include focusing on fundamental antibiotic stewardship to limit vancomycin exposure overall, achieving earlier and more complete source control, and establishing alternative therapeutic options to vancomycin. Implementation of AUC24-based therapeutic drug monitoring will take resources away from these more promising, alternative solutions.

### Mitigating risk of acute kidney injury among children with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis [^112J4tPH]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). High credibility.

Children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are treated with vancomycin despite the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). This study evaluates the rate of AKI and resource utilization for children with or without AKI when vancomycin is used in this setting.

- **Methods**: Children with MRSA AHO treated with vancomycin were retrospectively studied. AKI was assessed by clinical diagnosis and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Cohorts of children with or without AKI were compared for differences in treatment, resource utilization, and outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis assessed factors associated with risk for AKI. Cost analysis was performed using the Pediatric Health Information System and Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project databases.

- **Results**: Among 85 children studied, 14 (16.5%) had chart-diagnosed AKI and 24 (28.2%) met KDIGO criteria. Children with AKI had more febrile days and higher thrombosis rates. They had longer vancomycin treatment (8 vs. 5 days), higher troughs (27.8 vs. 17.5 mg/L), and prolonged hospitalization (19.9 vs. 11.1 days). Multivariate analysis found a maximum vancomycin trough level (odds ratio: 1.05, P = 0.003) with a cutoff of 21.7 mg/L predicted AKI. Only 2 of 20 (10%) children who had MRSA isolates with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 2 achieved therapeutic vancomycin levels. Pediatric Health Information System data of 3133 children with AHO treated with vancomycin identified 75 (2.4%) with AKI who had significantly longer lengths of stay.

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^114z5PWP]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of vancomycin differ in pediatric patients, and studies confirm that few children reach a trough serum level in the range of 15–20 mg/L when using the recommended doses. In 2009, Frymoyer et al. found it unlikely that a vancomycin dose of 40 mg/kg/day in children can reach the recommended pharmacodynamic target of AUC/MIC > 400 for invasive infections by MRSA, even when the MIC is 1 mcg/mL. In our study, the average initial dose of 40 mg/kg/day proved to be insufficient to achieve the serum level of 10–20 mg/L for most patients, emphasizing the need for a review of the available literature regarding the dose that offers the best pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic efficacy.

We observed no evidence of a significant association between serum level adequacy (10–20 mg/L) and age. A previous study, which evaluated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of vancomycin in critically ill children, also did not demonstrate the influence of age on the parameters evaluated. However, Gordon et al. found significantly lower levels of vancomycin in children under the age of six, even when using similar doses as those administered to older patients. Madigan et al. observed the effect of age and weight on serum concentrations of vancomycin in pediatric patients. The authors suggest that vancomycin prescription in pediatric patients should also consider age and weight. The age classification for our study was based on the Madigan et al. study.

### Attention to age: similar dosing regimens lead to different vancomycin levels among older and younger patients [^1147C16e]. Age and Ageing (2019). Low credibility.

Little is known about the clinical implications of vancomycin trough levels among older patients.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the association between vancomycin levels and outcomes among older versus younger patients.

- **Design**: Retrospective study.

- **Subjects**: Patients aged 18–64 and ≥ 65 years treated with vancomycin for documented methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.

- **Methods**: We compared the effectiveness and toxicity of vancomycin according to trough levels in older versus younger patients. A subgroup analysis of patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) > 60 ml/min/1.73 m² was performed.

- **Results**: We included 181 patients aged ≥ 65 years and 104 younger patients. The mean age in the older group was 76.9 ± 8 years versus 50.9 ± 12.4 in the younger group. Vancomycin trough levels and 24-hour area under the curve to minimal inhibitory concentrations (AUC/MIC) were significantly higher in older patients, who were also significantly more likely to achieve trough levels of ≥ 15 mg/l within 4 days (98/181, 54.1% vs. 38/104, 36.5% in younger patients, P = 0.004). Results were similar among patients with GFR > 60. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in older patients (74/181, 40.9% vs. 13/104, 12.5%, respectively, P < 0.001). There was no association between vancomycin trough levels and mortality among older patients. No significant differences were demonstrated in clinical or microbiological success or nephrotoxicity.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children [^115pnhc4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for nonvertebral osteomyelitis, and more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend administering vancomycin intravenously in pediatric patients with acute hematogenous MRSA osteomyelitis. Consider administering vancomycin at concentrations of 15–20 mcg/mL.
