## Question

Work up for 12 year old with 1 week fever and cough

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating a 12-year-old with 1 week of fever and cough. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is acute versus chronic cough. Then, I should verify the initial history and physical examination priorities, including red flags and epidemiologic clues. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis for a 12-year-old with acute cough and fever. After that, I need to check which diagnostic tests are indicated now versus later, including when to obtain a chest radiograph. Then, I will outline initial management, including antivirals, antibiotics, and supportive care. Finally, I should define follow-up checkpoints, escalation triggers, and special considerations like pertussis, COVID-19, and tuberculosis, making sure each step aligns with pediatric guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions. A 12-year-old with cough and fever for 1 week has an acute cough by pediatric definitions, where acute is less than 4 weeks, so this is not chronic cough and chronic-cough algorithms do not directly apply here, though some principles about "specific cough pointers" still inform when to image or escalate testing [^115g2Tzt] [^113dD3d4].

> I need to check the key elements of history that change pretest probabilities and guide testing. I should confirm fever pattern and peak, cough characteristics including paroxysms, whoop, and post-tussive vomiting, sick contacts, travel, animal or farm exposures, immunization status including pertussis and influenza, and any wheeze or asthma history, because these features shift the likelihood toward viral URI, influenza, pertussis, atypical pneumonia, or environmental triggers [^115FqgNe] [^117TRvfL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the physical examination priorities. I will assess general appearance and activity level, which in pediatrics often reflect cardiorespiratory sufficiency and can help risk-stratify severity, then document temperature, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, lung auscultation for focal crackles or wheeze, and signs of respiratory distress such as retractions or nasal flaring, because these findings guide the need for imaging and escalation [^115qTqWE] [^111S9KGg].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis for a 12-year-old with 1 week of fever and cough. Common etiologies include viral upper respiratory infection, viral bronchitis, influenza, early pertussis, atypical bacterial pneumonia such as Mycoplasma or Chlamydia, and early community-acquired bacterial pneumonia; less common but important considerations include COVID-19, early tuberculosis in the right epidemiologic context, and noninfectious mimics like asthma exacerbation or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, so I should keep a broad but prioritized list based on seasonality, exposures, and evolving signs [^115FqgNe] [^117TRvfL] [^113AHhyj] [^112psjX1].

> Wait, let me verify when to obtain a chest radiograph, because I should avoid unnecessary imaging. In immunocompetent children with acute cough, routine chest radiography is not indicated; imaging is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty, hypoxemia, significant respiratory distress, focal lung findings, persistent high fever beyond 48–72 hours without improvement, or failure to improve after 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy, so I need to ensure one of these triggers is present before ordering a CXR [^111S9KGg] [^116vZRCr] [^1163uiaW].

> I should double-check the role of labs. Routine CBC, CRP, or procalcitonin is not recommended for uncomplicated acute cough in immunocompetent children; however, if pneumonia is suspected or the child is ill-appearing, selective testing may be reasonable, and I must remember that in adults CRP can aid pneumonia diagnosis whereas procalcitonin adds little, so extrapolation to pediatrics should be cautious and symptom-guided [^notfound] [^116LGbGn].

> Next, I should review microbiologic testing indications. If influenza is suspected and within the therapeutic window, influenza PCR or rapid testing can guide antiviral use; if pertussis is suspected based on paroxysmal cough, whoop, or post-tussive vomiting, PCR testing is appropriate; if COVID-19 is suspected based on exposure or compatible features, SARS-CoV-2 testing should be considered; and if tuberculosis is a concern due to risk factors or persistent symptoms, targeted TB testing can be justified [^112FFUZj].

> Let me think about initial management. Supportive care remains first-line for most viral etiologies, including antipyretics, hydration, and age-appropriate cough management while avoiding codeine-containing medications in children; if influenza is suspected and within 48 hours of symptom onset, oseltamivir at weight-based pediatric dosing can shorten illness by about 1.5 days; antibiotics are not indicated for viral URIs or bronchitis in the absence of pneumonia features, and if bacterial pneumonia is suspected clinically or by CXR, amoxicillin is a reasonable first-line agent for typical pathogens in this age group, with macrolides reserved for suspected atypicals or beta-lactam allergy [^1135GYQg] [^111sFCkr] [^112ToRHQ] [^111FPYdz].

> I need to ensure I have clear follow-up and safety-netting. If the child is well-appearing, afebrile, and improving, watchful waiting with return precautions is appropriate; if not improving within 48–72 hours, I should reassess and consider obtaining a chest radiograph and escalating evaluation; if new red flags emerge such as hypoxemia, respiratory distress, chest pain, hemoptysis, weight loss, or persistent high fever, I should expedite imaging and consider hospitalization or specialty referral [^111S9KGg] [^115qTqWE].

> But wait, what if pertussis is on the table. I should confirm the classic features: paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and post-tussive vomiting; absence of fever makes pertussis more likely, whereas fever and non-paroxysmal cough argue against it; in children, post-tussive vomiting is only moderately sensitive and specific, so clinical gestalt plus PCR testing when suspected is prudent, and macrolide therapy is indicated when the diagnosis is likely or confirmed [^117TRvfL] [^112QvZaw] [^114T29Fd].

> Hold on, I should verify COVID-19 considerations. Children may have milder or atypical presentations, with lower rates of fever and cough than adults and more gastrointestinal symptoms; testing is reasonable when exposure or compatible features are present, and management is largely supportive with attention to isolation guidance and public health recommendations [^112psjX1].

> I will now examine tuberculosis risk. TB should be considered with persistent cough beyond 2–3 weeks, weight loss, night sweats, or epidemiologic risks such as travel to endemic areas or close contact; in children, radiographic patterns may differ and miliary or extrapulmonary disease can occur, so a low threshold for targeted testing is warranted when risk factors or persistent symptoms are present [^113AHhyj].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Start with careful history and exam to classify severity and identify specific cough pointers; avoid routine imaging and labs in well-appearing children; provide supportive care and consider antivirals for influenza within 48 hours; reserve antibiotics for suspected bacterial pneumonia or pertussis; and set explicit follow-up checkpoints at 48–72 hours to reassess trajectory and trigger CXR or escalation if needed, aligning with pediatric primary care and emergency care guidance [^111S9KGg] [^115FqgNe] [^115qTqWE].

For a 12-year-old with 1 week of fever and cough, the workup should be **guided by clinical severity and exam findings** [^111S9KGg]. Most cases are viral, so **supportive care is first-line** unless red flags are present [^111yfqeo]. Obtain a **chest X-ray** if there is respiratory distress, hypoxia, focal lung findings, or no improvement after 48–72 hours of therapy [^111S9KGg] [^111FPYdz]. Use **rapid influenza testing** when influenza is suspected, and reserve CBC, CRP, or blood cultures for severe or atypical cases [^112FFUZj]. Antibiotics are not routine; give them if bacterial pneumonia is suspected or confirmed [^111S9KGg]. Reassess in 48–72 hours, and if the child worsens or fails to improve, broaden the workup to include CBC, CRP, blood cultures, and consider pertussis or tuberculosis testing [^111FPYdz] [^113AHhyj].

## Management strategies

### Supportive care

Supportive care is appropriate for most viral illnesses and includes antipyretics (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) for fever control, hydration to maintain fluid balance, and rest with activity as tolerated. Cough management may include honey for children older than 1 year and avoidance of codeine-containing medications because of potential respiratory depression [^1135GYQg].

---

### Antiviral therapy

Antiviral therapy is indicated for confirmed or strongly suspected influenza; **oseltamivir** 2 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days, started within 48 hours of symptom onset, reduces illness duration by about 1.5 days [^111sFCkr].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are indicated for suspected or confirmed bacterial pneumonia or pertussis; **amoxicillin** is first-line for typical bacterial pneumonia, while **macrolides** (azithromycin or clarithromycin) are used for atypical pathogens or pertussis [^notfound].

---

### Follow-up and reassessment

Follow-up should occur within 48–72 hours to assess clinical improvement; if there is no improvement, broaden the diagnostic workup and consider hospitalization or specialist referral.

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation

- **Respiratory distress**: Tachypnea, retractions, nasal flaring, grunting, or hypoxia (SpO2 < 92%) [^111S9KGg].

- **Severe illness**: Lethargy, poor feeding, dehydration, or signs of sepsis [^notfound].

- **Persistent high fever**: Temperature ≥ 39°C lasting > 5 days.

- **Focal lung findings**: Crackles, decreased breath sounds, or signs of consolidation [^111ukg7W].

- **Failure to improve**: No clinical improvement after 48–72 hours of initial management [^111FPYdz].

---

## Conclusion

A 12-year-old with 1 week of fever and cough should be evaluated with a **focused history and physical examination**, with further testing guided by severity and clinical course. Most cases are viral and managed supportively, but **obtain a chest X-ray** for respiratory distress, hypoxia, focal lung findings, or lack of improvement after 48–72 hours [^111S9KGg]. Use rapid influenza testing when suspected, and reserve CBC, CRP, blood cultures, and targeted testing for severe or atypical cases. Antibiotics are not routine; give them when bacterial pneumonia or pertussis is suspected or confirmed. Reassess within 48–72 hours, and broaden the workup if the child fails to improve.

Cough and fever in infants and children are frequent but nonspecific symptoms. Several usual differential diagnoses are under consideration and imaging is often necessary to help arrive at an accurate diagnosis and ensure proper management. A broad spectrum of underlying disorders may be present. Radiologists must remain cognizant of the potential for immune dysfunction and underlying structural abnormalities. A clear understanding of up-to-date imaging evaluation recommendations and characteristic imaging features can assist radiologists and clinicians in arriving at the most accurate diagnosis in a timely manner and help ensure proper management and necessary follow-up imaging assessment.

Evaluation principles in children with chronic cough: For children aged ≤ 14 years, we recommend that (a) common etiologies of chronic cough in adults are not presumed to be common causes in children and (b) their age and the clinical settings (eg, country and region) are taken into consideration when evaluating and managing their chronic cough (Level 1B). Initial evaluation entails performing a thorough clinical assessment, a chest radiograph (CXR) and/or spirometry, followed by deciding whether any investigations and/or treatment are appropriate and/or required.

### Fever, rash, and cough in a 7-year-old boy [^113vpQNh]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

A 7-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, congestion, abdominal pain, myalgias, and morbilliform rash. Several aspects of the patient's history, including recent travel, living on a farm, exposure to sick contacts, and new medications, resulted in a wide differential diagnosis. Initial laboratory testing revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated atypical lymphocytes, but did not reveal any infectious causes of illness. He was discharged from the hospital, but then represented to the emergency department a day later with worsening rash, continued fever, abdominal pain, and poor intake. He was then admitted. A more comprehensive laboratory evaluation was initiated. During this hospital course, the patient's physical examination changed when he developed head and neck edema, and certain laboratory trends became clearer. With the assistance of several specialists, the team was able to reach a more definitive diagnosis and initiate treatment to appropriately manage his condition.

Q14. A 60-year-old patient with a history of CAD presents to the emergency department with chest pain and cough lasting for 2 days. The right-sided thoracic chest pain is persistent, moderate in intensity, non-radiating, and increases in intensity during inspiration. The last episode of chest pain started 8 h prior to admission and the patient is still mildly symptomatic in the emergency department. He is haemodynamically stable and the physical examination is unremarkable. The 12-lead ECG shows T-wave inversion in lead I and aVL, which were already noted in the ECG performed last year. The initial hs-cTn I Architect concentration is very low/undetectable at 2 ng/L (ULN < 26 ng/L). The emergency department intern, a bright young physician who wants to become a cardiologist, challenges you by saying that 'it is obvious that the chest pain does not represent acute MI and no additional investigations or blood tests in this respect are needed'. Is she right?

Yes. NSTEMI, based on the delay between symptom onset and blood test, can be reliably ruled-out with a single very low level of hs-cTn T/I. In addition, unstable angina is extremely unlikely since prolonged ischaemia is expected to lead to some degree of cTn elevation. An alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia/bronchitis should be considered.

Q15. You are supervising the emergency department/chest pain unit (CPU) and see an 80-year-old patient with a history of CAD, prior MI, and hypertensive heart disease presenting with persistent moderate right-sided thoracic chest pain ongoing for 7 h that increases in intensity during exercise and inspiration. In addition, he has mild fever and an increasing productive cough over the last 3 days. He is haemodynamically stable and the initial physical examination reveals rales over the base of the right lung. ECG shows T-wave inversion in V3–V6, which were already noted on the ECG performed 3 years ago. A chest X-ray shows an infiltrate in the right lung suggestive of pneumonia. Your intern is about to order blood cultures (plus legionella and pneumococcus antigen in the urine) and prescribe antibiotics when the hs-cTn T level is reported from the laboratory as elevated. Your intern now asks you if the patient needs treatment for pneumonia, NSTEMI, or both.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113dD3d4]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Classification and evaluation of pediatric cough — at first presentation, specific cough overlaps with non-specific cough and the latter overlaps with 'expected cough'. 'Expected cough' refers to coughing illness reflective of common upper respiratory viral infections in an otherwise child where the cough duration is usually < 2 weeks but may be longer in a small minority. Children with a chronic cough should be reevaluated until a diagnosis is found with resolution of the cough (if possible). The presence of any specific cough pointer indicates an etiology of chronic cough and when any of these symptoms and signs are present, the cough is referred to as 'specific cough'. In some children, the quality of cough is recognizable and suggestive of specific etiology. Non-specific cough is more likely to resolve without specific treatment and it is characterized by a dry/nonproductive cough in the absence of specific cough pointers with normal CXR and spirometry. Contributing exacerbating factors such as tobacco smoke exposure and parental expectations should also be evaluated, irrespective of the underlying etiology.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112QvZaw]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The decision to treat a suspected case of pertussis with antibiotics is usually based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation. The current guideline focuses on making the clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough in adults and children.

Methods

The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework were used. The Expert Cough Panel based their recommendations on findings from a systematic review that was recently published on the topic; final grading was reached by consensus according to Delphi methodology. The systematic review was carried out to answer the Key Clinical Question: In patients presenting with cough, how can we most accurately diagnose from clinical features alone those who have pertussis-associated cough as opposed to other causes of cough?

Results

In adults, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 4 clinical features: paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever. Both paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity (93.2% [95% CI, 83.2–97.4] and 81.8% [95% CI, 72.2–88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [95% CI, 14.7–28.1] and 18.8% [95% CI, 8.1–37.9]). Inspiratory whooping and posttussive vomiting had a low sensitivity (32.5% [95% CI, 24.5–41.6] and 29.8% [95% CI, 18.0–45.2]) but high specificity (77.7% [95% CI, 73.1–81.7] and 79.5% [95% CI, 69.4–86.9]). In children, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 1 clinical feature in children (0–18 years): posttussive vomiting. Posttussive vomiting in children was only moderately sensitive (60.0% [95% CI, 40.3–77.0]) and specific (66.0% [95% CI, 52.5–77.3]).

Conclusions

In adults with acute (< 3 weeks) or subacute (3–8 weeks) cough, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children with acute (< 4 weeks) cough, posttussive vomiting is suggestive of pertussis but is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test. Guideline suggestions are made based upon these findings and conclusions.

Chest radiography for acute cough in adults — A Cochrane review of chest radiographs for acute lower respiratory tract infections included two RCTs with a combined 2,024 patients (1,502 adults, 522 children), and the conclusion was that chest radiography did not improve clinical outcomes (duration of illness); for adults with acute cough illness, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routinely obtaining a chest radiograph in addition to clinical judgment to make management decisions, and because the overall proportion with significant radiographic findings is very small, the benefit, if any, is likely very small. Clinical algorithms to identify the subset of patients with a higher risk of underlying pneumonia are needed to help guide the decision to order chest radiographs in this population.

Fever is the most common reason that children and infants are brought to emergency departments. Emergency physicians face the challenge of quickly distinguishing benign from life-threatening conditions. The management of fever in children is guided by the patient's age, immunization status, and immune status as well as the results of a careful physical examination and appropriate laboratory tests and radiographic views. In this article, the evaluation and treatment of children with fevers of known and unknown origin are described. Causes of common and dangerous conditions that include fever in their manifestation are also discussed.

Case presentation

The patient is a 12-year-old male with flu-like symptoms including dry cough and rhinorrhea for three weeks before his admission at our center. His parents stated that the patient has had no fever or chills since his symptoms started. They also mentioned that the patient and his parents all had flu-like symptoms for the past 3 weeks, which resolved for his parents, but the patient's symptoms became more severe. Based on the patient and his parents' past medical history, he had no history of recurrent respiratory infections, hospitalization, immunodeficiency, recurrent pneumonia or otitis media, sepsis, or contact with a patient suspected or infected with tuberculosis.

The patient was then visited by his doctor who prescribed Azithromycin (500 mg per day) for 5 days, and then due to no improvement was changed to co-Amoxiclav (Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid, 625 mg every 8 h) for 7 days. However, no improvement was achieved.

After three weeks, the patient was brought to our center due to the progression of his symptoms and developing dyspnea. In our initial evaluation, the patient's symptoms were severe coughs, nasal flaring, respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 35, and decreased O₂ saturation (85%). He was also afebrile. Significant findings in his initial physical exam included obesity (Weight = 96Kg, Height = 160 cm, Body Mass Index = 37.5 kg/m²) and no breathing sound in his left lung.

His initial laboratory test results showed an increased White Blood Cells (W.B.C) count (19.2 × 10³/mm³) with a lymphocyte differentiation of 16%, high platelet (Plt) count (593 × 10³/mm³), high Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) (80 mm/h), and a slightly increased amount (+ 1) of C-Reactive Protein (CRP; evaluated with Bionic CRP kit, Tehran, Iran) which suggests that the patient had an active inflammation. The patient also had a positive D-Dimer test (0.6 mcg/ml) and a low hemoglobin level (11.6 g/dl). The results of his Ventricular Blood Gas (VBG) were also suggestive of a primary respiratory alkalosis (pH = 7.46, pCO₂ = 29.5, HCO₃ = 21.3 mmol/L). Renal tests were unremarkable.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^114Jz5tR]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of chronic cough

Chronic pediatric cough is generally defined as a cough lasting for > 4 weeks. The exception is the BTS, which defines chronic pediatric cough as lasting for > 8 weeks, while acknowledging that there is a gray area between acute and chronic, and that 'relentlessly progressive' cough should be investigated after 3 weeks. Certain pediatric cough guidelines recommend characterizing chronic cough into wet/productive or dry, because this distinction affects diagnosis and treatment pathways, with wet cough often having an infectious etiology. Guidelines also make the distinction between 'specific' cough, which is associated with a condition recognized to cause cough, thereby forming the basis for specific treatment, and 'non-specific' cough, in which no underlying condition has yet been found.

The most common causes of chronic pediatric cough are generally thought to be protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), asthma, and post-infectious cough. In a study of children with acute respiratory illness and cough presenting at an emergency department, 20.4% had persistent cough 4 weeks later; 6.6% were subsequently diagnosed with PBB, and 4.3% with a new chronic respiratory disease. PBB is most common in children aged < 6 years, and, in many cases, onset of symptoms occurs before the age of 1 year. Less common, but more serious, are lung disorders (such as cystic fibrosis) and immune deficiency. Habit cough is a repetitive, chronic cough with no identified underlying organic reason; habit cough is more common in older children, peaking at around 10 years of age. Chronic cough may also be caused or exacerbated by exposure to airborne irritants, such as tobacco smoke, allergens, and traffic pollution.

With regard to diagnosis, chronic cough in children should be seen as a symptom of an underlying disease and, therefore, should be subject to careful and systematic evaluation for the presence of specific diagnostic indicators. Diagnosis should involve a detailed patient history, thorough physical examination, chest X-ray, and, if the child is old enough and cooperative, spirometry. Sputum cultures should be attempted in cases of wet chronic cough; further investigations (such as bronchoscopy and serological laboratory assessments) may be required, after giving consideration to patient discomfort and the potential for adverse events. Habit cough can be diagnosed from clinical characteristics; the key diagnostic feature is that coughing stops when the child is asleep.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111oZbpS]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

CHEST guideline — adult clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough: For adult patients complaining of acute cough (< 3 weeks in duration) or subacute cough (3–8 weeks), we suggest that clinicians should specifically assess for the 4 key characteristics of paroxysmal cough, posttussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever in ruling in or out a clinical diagnosis of pertussis (Grade 2C). For adult patients complaining of acute or subacute cough, we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough is unlikely to be due to pertussis if the patient has a fever or the cough is not paroxysmal in nature (Grade 2C), and we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough is likely to be caused by pertussis if there is posttussive vomiting or is associated with an inspiratory whooping sound (Grade 2C). Fever is defined as any body temperature above the normal of 98.6°F (37°C).

### The accuracy of clinical symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of serious bacterial infection in young febrile children: prospective cohort study of 15 781 febrile illnesses [^115JS8uY]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This large prospective cohort study of young children presenting with a febrile illness to an emergency department in Australia has shown that urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and bacteraemia occur in about 7% of illnesses in children who present with fever, but in only 66–81% of cases are the children administered antibiotics at the time of their first presentation.

Our study has shown that the low rate of antibiotic administration is not caused by failure to consider the diagnosis of serious bacterial infection. Urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and bacteraemia were almost always considered as possible causes of febrile illness, as shown by the ordering of the appropriate tests in approximately 95% of children with serious bacterial infection. Nor is the lack of treatment the result of the symptoms and signs elicited by physicians in this setting having poor diagnostic value. We found that many clinical features widely considered to be indicative of serious bacterial infection — such as overall appearance of the child, urinary symptoms for urinary tract infection, and cough for pneumonia — were highly discriminatory for both ruling in and ruling out infection.

### Cough [^117H4Xxr]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The management of cough in children should be etiologically based. This requires that all children with cough should be carefully evaluated and managed differently than adults because the etiologic factors and treatment in children are significantly different than that in adults. In all children with cough, exacerbation factors should be sought and intervention options for cessation advised or initiated. Parental expectations and specific concerns should also be sought and addressed.

The patient's cough resolved in 6 weeks after empiric treatment with oral steroids, inhaled steroids, and bronchodilators. A follow-up chest radiograph done at 6 weeks showed persistent abnormalities, and she was referred for a pulmonary evaluation. She denied any fevers, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, wheezing, loss of appetite, or weight loss at that time. She had no significant medical problems and was not on any medications at that time. She was a nonsmoker. She worked in an office setting and denied any occupational or recreational exposures or recent travels. There was no family history of lung diseases or cancer.

### Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS [^113tN6tT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical Description of SARS

Clinical Signs and Symptoms

The median incubation period for SARS appears to be approximately 4–6 days; most patients become ill within 2 to 10 days after exposure. Some evidence suggests that the incubation period may be as long as 14 days in some persons.

The most common initial symptom is fever, often accompanied by headache, myalgia, malaise, chills, and rigor (,–). In some patients, headache, myalgia, and malaise precede the onset of fever by up to 1 day, and fever may have resolved by the time respiratory symptoms appear. Respiratory symptoms typically do not begin until 2–7 days after illness onset, although they are among the initial symptoms in up to 30% of patients (,–). The most common respiratory complaints are lower respiratory tract symptoms, including nonproductive cough and dyspnea; productive cough is reported in up to 25% of patients (,–). In some series, < 10% of patients reported upper respiratory complaints, but in others the reported prevalence of rhinorrhea or sore throat is as high as 25% among patients with SARS. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms has varied by report, but nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or a combination of these symptoms has been reported in up to 25% of patients with SARS at the time of initial evaluation. In one series, diarrhea developed in 73% of patients at some point in the course of illness. Fever and diarrhea have been the dominant initial symptoms in some patients. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV appears to be uncommon.

Elderly patients and those with underlying chronic illnesses such as renal failure may not have typical symptoms of SARS. For patients in this group who have strong epidemiologic risk factors for SARS, the diagnosis should be considered in almost any change in health status, even if the patients do not exhibit typical clinical features.

Physical Findings

Tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxemia have been reported in 40% to 75% of patients upon admission to the hospital (,–) but may be less common in patients who are evaluated earlier in the course of illness as outpatients. Upon auscultation of the lungs, rales or rhonchi have been detectable in most patients in some series, and less commonly in others. Some researchers have observed a lack of lung sounds despite marked infiltration on chest radiography. As many as 15%–44% of patients may have a normal measured body temperature when first evaluated.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^115tTXNH]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosis in children emphasizes differentiating it from uncomplicated viral upper respiratory infection (URI): Uncomplicated viral URIs typically last 5 to 7 days, with respiratory symptoms peaking by days 3 to 6, fever and constitutional symptoms disappearing in the first 24 to 48 hours, and some resolving signs persisting after day 10. Persistence without improvement of nasal discharge (of any quality) or daytime cough (which may be worse at night), or both, suggests acute sinusitis, yet only a minority (~6%–7%) of children with URI symptoms meet criteria for persistence. An alternative presentation is worsening ("double sickening") with substantial acute worsening of respiratory symptoms or a new fever often on the sixth or seventh day after initial recovery. A severe-onset presentation is concurrent high fever (temperature > 39°C) and purulent nasal discharge for the first 3 to 4 days of an acute URI. Bad breath, fatigue, headache, and decreased appetite are not specific indicators, and physical examination, sinus percussion, and transillumination are not helpful; nasopharyngeal cultures do not reliably predict the etiology.

### Fever of unknown origin: a clinical approach [^115ChBjx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Fevers of unknown origin remain one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in medicine. Because fever of unknown origin may be caused by over 200 malignant/neoplastic, infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, and miscellaneous disorders, clinicians often order non-clue-based imaging and specific testing early in the fever of unknown origin work-up, which may be inefficient/misleading. Unlike most other fever-of-unknown-origin reviews, this article presents a clinical approach. Characteristic history and physical examination findings together with key nonspecific test abnormalities are the basis for a focused clue-directed fever of unknown origin work-up.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115g2Tzt]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic cough — definition and general approach: For children aged ≤ 14 years, we suggest defining chronic cough as the presence of daily cough of more than 4 weeks in duration. For children aged ≤ 14 years, we recommend that (a) common etiologies of chronic cough in adults are not presumed to be common causes in children and (b) their age and the clinical settings (eg, country and region) are taken into consideration when evaluating and managing their chronic cough. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend using pediatric-specific cough management protocols or algorithms, we recommend taking a systematic approach (such as using a validated guideline) to determine the cause of the cough, and we recommend basing the management or testing algorithm on cough characteristics and the associated clinical history such as using specific cough pointers like presence of productive/wet cough.

### Unusual presentation of miliary tuberculosis in a 12-year-old girl: a case report [^111y9QQf]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present case report, the miliary TB evidence was presented in a 12 years old girl. Miliary TB has been more prevalent in middle age and older people than children. Also, 60% of the cases are male with a mean age of 55 years in studies. Although the mean age of miliary TB patients has increased, the rates remain relatively low in children. In the present study, the unusual miliary TB pattern was seen in a 12 years old girl. The miliary TB in young patients is reported in TB-endemic countries. Based on the results of a retrospective descriptive study in South Africa, 32.7% of children were TB meningitis. Also, the recent study reported 43.3% of children drug resistant was the main reason for hospitalization. But, in our case, the girl had no drug resistance. Approximately 13% of the TB cases suffer from HIV infections. TB becomes more generalized and affects more than one organ when progressive immunosuppression occurs. However, the present case didn't have HIV infection as co-infection or other immunodeficiency condition. Corticosteroid therapy can reactivate cryptic TB. Song et al. reported a 36-year-old man who underwent corticosteroid therapy and two weeks later, he experienced an acute exacerbation of miliary TB. But in our study, the patient had no history of recent corticosteroid therapy. Considering increased the number of BCG-vaccinated children and improving the diet status of children, we see the modified clinical profile of neurotuberculosis including TB meningitis nowadays with wide varieties of clinical manifestations according to the site of the brain lesion. The clinical presentation of neurotuberculosis may be nonspecific leading to delayed treatment and poor clinical outcome. The present case had diffuse multiple rim-enhancing nodules in both cerebral, cerebellar hemispheres and brainstem in the brain. The brain and central nervous systems are two target organs of mycobacterium tuberculosis that cause serious and dangerous forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The most obvious initial clinical symptoms of our case were fever, weight loss, anorexia and seizure. Other studies reported fever, cough, seizure, diarrhea, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, jaundice, anorexia and weight loss as the most common clinical presentations in children. A male three-months Brazilian infant was admitted with nocturnal fever, sweating and coughing 10 days before hospitalization and he was not responsive to antibiotic therapy. The results of the chest X-ray showed bilateral miliary TB and also CNS TB based on the CT-scan report. Similar to our case, the recent case showed early diagnosis and treatment in endemic areas. Delayed diagnosis in miliary TB patients can cause serious complications including cranial nerve involvement, convulsions and death as a seizure occurred in our case. Machida et al.'s report showed 1% of TB patients had CNS involvement which is about a high mortality rate and permanent neurological sequelae. Fortunately, in the present case, follow-up interventions showed no neurological sequelae and she was in good general condition. Multiple diagnostic tests are provided to detect miliary TB, including PCR, sputum smear and acid-fast staining, in addition to histopathological findings but radiology plays a major role in this regard. In this case, despite the absence of respiratory symptoms and non-significant lung involvement in chest X-ray, extensive lung involvement was seen including diffuse multiple miliary nodules. Also, a chest CT scan revealed some scattered micronodules in a random distribution in both lungs associated with patchy consolidation in lower lobes in favor of pulmonary TB. Additionally, in the brain, some central hypo-intense with hyper-intense rim nodules in the pons, right cerebral peduncles and lentiform nucleus, multiple diffuse rims enhancing nodules in both cerebral, cerebellar hemispheres and brainstem were obvious.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — hospitalized adults and pediatric predictors show variable accuracy and age-specific features. In hospitalized patients, fever with cough or sore throat had a sensitivity of 43% for patients without asthma and only 20% for asthmatic patients. Infants and young children with influenza may not always have fever and may present with a wide range of signs and symptoms, may present with fever and suspected sepsis, and diarrhea can occur in up to 28% of infants and young children with influenza. In young children 1–5 years, fever > 38°C, chills, headache, malaise, and sore eyes were significantly associated with a positive RT-PCR test result. In pediatric patients, fever (≥ 38°C), headache, cough, and absence of abnormal breathing sounds had a positive predictive value of 57.1%. Among children aged ≤ 5 years, adding rhinorrhea to the fever and cough case definition achieved a better balance between sensitivity (83%) and specificity (47%), and among pediatric outpatients aged ≤ 13 years with respiratory infections, fever was the only reliable predictor of culture-confirmed influenza virus infection.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112FFUZj]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Adult outpatients with acute cough — conclusions and practice suggestions emphasize that there should be an assessment of clinical symptoms and signs, and those suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to improve diagnostic accuracy. Measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels strengthens both the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumonia, whereas there was no added benefit of measuring procalcitonin levels in this setting. Microbiological diagnostic testing should be considered when the results may indicate a change in therapy. For outpatient adults with acute cough, we suggest the use of empiric antibiotics when pneumonia is suspected based on epidemiologic and clinical features in settings in which imaging cannot be performed, but where there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, we do not suggest the routine use of antibiotics. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for or against specific nonantibiotic, symptomatic therapies. For suspected influenza, we suggest that initiating antiviral treatment within 48 hours of symptoms could be associated with decreased antibiotic use and hospitalization and improved outcomes.

### Diagnosis of COVID-19 in children: the story evolves [^112psjX1]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The presenting features of COVID-19 differ in children from adults, with lower rates of fever and cough and more prominence of vomiting and diarrhoea. Currently, haematological, biochemical and radiological findings in children infected with COVID-19 are not diagnostic and do not consistently predict severe disease.

Prospective research is required to help identify any patient groups who are at risk of developing severe infection and features which may be used to identify these children early in the disease course.

Methods

Study design and participants

This studywas a prospective, prognostic cohort study recruiting participants between July, 2011, and June, 2013; the design of this study has been described previously. Briefly, general practitioners and prescribing nurse practitioners (referred to from here on as clinicians) working in general practitioner practices were trained by four UK university hubs (Bristol, London, Oxford, and Southampton). In order to minimise confounding by indication, clinicians who self-reported prescribing antibiotics in 30% or less of children with respiratory tract infections were invited to recruit and in order to minimise recruitment bias in the study, were asked to identify a priori their preferred recruitment strategy (consecutive or first eligible on the day).

Children were eligible for recruitment if they were aged between 3 months and 16 years and presented with the main symptom of acute (≤ 28 days) cough with other respiratory tract infection symptoms (such as fever and coryza). Children with an infected exacerbation of asthma and those who were severely unwell (eg, requiring same-day hospital assessment or admission) were included. Children were excluded if they presented with a non-infective exacerbation of asthma, were at high risk of serious infection (immunocompromised, for example with cystic fibrosis), required a throat swab for clinical management (which were taken for research purposes in a subgroup of children), had been previously recruited to the study or recently participated in other research, or had temporarily registered at the practice.

Procedures

Clinicians were asked to record reasons for not inviting potentially eligible children to participate in the study and to report a global illness severity (successfully used in a previous studyand scored from zero to ten) for those invited but declining participation. After receiving informed consent from the children's parents (and assent from children aged ≥ 11 years), clinicians completed a structured online (or paper) case report form (appendix). This form recorded eight sociodemographic and four past medical history items, 33 parent-reported symptoms (including symptom severity of either mild, moderate, or severe in the previous 24 h), 14 physical examination signs (including vital signs and global illness severity), and the prescription of antibiotics. Children were assessed for current asthma at medical notes review, which was deemed present if asthma was noted in the medical notes and asthma medication was issued in the previous 12 months. All baseline data, except for asthma, were collected blinded to the main outcome.

Case Presentation

A 44-year-old woman with a history of dyslipidemia and chronic anemia from uterine fibroids was admitted to the general medicine department of a tertiary hospital for a prolonged fever of 2 months' duration. The patient reported multiple visits to her local general practitioner, with tympanic temperatures up to 38.2 °C, where she was treated with 2 courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics in view of associated sore throat, nonproductive cough, and generalized lethargy. Although her respiratory symptoms abated within a few days of her initial presentation, her fever and lethargy persisted. Initial chest radiograph was unremarkable. Subsequent CT scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis detected an enlarged subcarinal lymph node measuring 3.7 cm × 1.7 cm and a mildly enlarged pre-carinal lymph node measuring 2.0 × 1.5 cm, with a mean attenuation of 66–77 Hounsfield Units (HU), and no central necrosis or calcification. No significant abnormalities were detected in the abdomen or pelvis. The patient was then referred to the respiratory department for further evaluation.

### Acute urticaria as the initial presentation of COVID-19 in a pediatric patient [^112Bmb2S]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 5-year-old Hispanic girl with no significant medical history was seen for the evaluation of acute urticaria. Approximately 1 month previously, the patient developed hives after returning home from her father's house, where she spent the weekend. Her initial symptoms were hives across her entire body, sparing her face (Fig 1). She was treated with oral and topical diphenhydramine at the recommendation of her pediatrician. Her hives were moderately pruritic, and they worsened after she showered. Two days after her hives began, she developed fever, with her temperature reaching 101.6 °F. Her fever was treated with acetaminophen, but it continued to persist along with her hives for the next 3 days.

Fig 1

As her symptoms continued to worsen, she presented to the emergency department 5 days after her symptoms began but was treated for idiopathic urticaria with H1 blockade and discharged home. Two days later, she developed a cough. She returned to the emergency department 11 days after her initial presentation because of her persistent hives, fevers, and cough. Her SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test result was positive, and she underwent additional evaluation for COVID-19 (Table I). Her prothrombin time was 14.1 seconds, international normalized ratio was 1.08, activated partial thromboplastin time was 36 seconds, fibrinogen level was 329 mg/dL, and D-dimer level was 0.75 μg/mL. In addition, her C-reactive protein level was 1.08 mg/dL, troponin level was < 0.02 ng/mL, ferritin level was 88 ng/mL, and N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide level was 25 pg/mL. As the patient was clinically stable, she was discharged home with supportive care. She continued to receive acetaminophen and was transitioned to cetirizine instead of diphenhydramine. Her symptoms persisted for the following week before resolving and have not reoccurred.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition in which physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively explore a patient's presentation. The Morning Report section continues this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and clinical course, inviting readers to develop a differential diagnosis and uncover the final diagnosis alongside the authors. This report details the story of a previously healthy 7-year-old boy who presented with 10 days of fever after travel to Bangladesh. Through targeted history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing, an illness script is developed. As the case progresses, the differential diagnosis is refined until a final diagnosis is established.

### Guidelines for the use of chest radiographs in community-acquired pneumonia in children and adolescents [^115CBR6h]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

In clinical practice

It is important to remember that practice guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia in children are designed to assist practitioners in making decisions about appropriate care for specific clinical circumstances. Harris et al. made the distinction between the developed and developing world regarding the use of chest radiographs in this context, in that community-acquired pneumonia presenting in the developed world can be verified by the radiologic finding of consolidation while in the developing world there might be difficulties in obtaining a radiograph. However with the institution of more radiographic equipment in developing countries, guidelines need to address the practice-related benefits of this imaging modality rather than its availability (Fig. 3). Time pressures facing clinicians at the front line, difficulties in distinguishing which children require admission, restricted bed numbers for admissions, imaging-resource limitations, perceptions regarding risk from procedures, novel imaging modalities and the probability of other causes for the child's presentation all need to be factored into a guideline. More important, the these factors can be location-specific, related to a specific period and changed according to successful immunisation campaigns, and also might depend on the changing likelihood of complications. Other drivers that often weigh in to actual practice, depending on the setting, include cost-effectiveness and the fear of litigation. Not all guidelines designed for the developed world can therefore be applied to the developing world and practice guidelines require regular review in the context of new information.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® pneumonia in the immunocompetent child [^116vZRCr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is one of the most common acute infections and the single greatest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. In uncomplicated, community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent patients, the diagnosis is clinical and imaging has no role. The first role of imaging is to identify complications associated with pneumonia such as pleural effusion, pulmonary abscess, and bronchopleural fistula. Radiographs are recommended for screening for these complications and ultrasound and CT are recommended for confirmation. The second role of imaging is to identify underlying anatomic conditions that may predispose patients to recurrent pneumonia. CT with intravenously administered contrast is recommended for this evaluation. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Oseltamivir [^111sFCkr]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)

One double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trial was conducted in pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years (median age 5 years) who had fever (at least 100ºF) plus one respiratory symptom (cough or coryza) when influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Of 698 subjects enrolled in this trial, 452 (65%) were influenza-infected (50% male; 68% Caucasian). Of the 452 influenza-infected subjects, 67% were infected with influenza A and 33% with influenza B.

Efficacy in this trial was determined by the time to alleviation or resolution of influenza signs and symptoms, measured by a composite endpoint that required the following four individual conditions be met: i) alleviation of cough, ii) alleviation of coryza, iii) resolution of fever, and iv) parental opinion of a return to normal health and activity. Oseltamivir phosphate treatment of 2 mg per kg twice daily, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, reduced the total composite time to freedom from illness by 1.5 days compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in male and female pediatric subjects.

Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age)

Two open-label trials evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in influenza-infected pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age). Subjects received oseltamivir phosphate at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days depending on subject age. These clinical trials were not designed to evaluate clinical efficacy or virologic response.

Of the 136 subjects under the age of 1 year enrolled and dosed in the trials, the majority of the subjects were male (55%), white (79%), non-Hispanic (74%), full term (76%) and infected with influenza A (80%). Pharmacokinetic data indicated that a dose of 3 mg per kg twice daily in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age provided oseltamivir phosphate concentrations similar to or higher than those observed in older pediatric subjects and adults receiving the approved dose and provided the basis for approval [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Not too sick, not too well: reducing the diagnostic void in pediatric emergency medicine [^115qTqWE]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The Phoenix score, with its focus on evidence of organ dysfunction is an important progression in our approach to recognising true sepsis. However to achieve this the Phoenix score requires extensive blood work. In pediatrics the ideal is to avoid the trauma of venepunture wherever possible. We therefore need a way of deciding when organ dysfunction is very unlikely. One model that works well for recognition of the well child is to focus on activity and behaviour. In paediatric practice these features give valuable clinical information about the current metabolic status and end organ function of the child being assessed. While non-specific features such as cough and fever support a process of differential diagnosis (upper or lower respiratory tract infection) the behaviour and actions of the child give important information about the clinical effects of the infection regardless of what the diagnosis is. A child with fever and a cough who is seen to be running around, eating, drinking, playing and chatting is demonstrating metabolic and cardiorespiratory sufficiency. Arguably this supersedes the distinction between upper and lower respiratory infection as a lower respiratory tract infection with minimal clinical effect can be managed conservatively in a similar way to upper respiratory tract infection.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^1128uXE6]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis background and prior evidence indicate that currently, the diagnosis is clinical with emphasis on excluding differential diagnoses, and the CHEST 2006 guidelines recommended that acute bronchitis be diagnosed only if there was no evidence of pneumonia, the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD. Previous retrospective cohort studies found that at initial presentation just over one-third would also meet criteria for asthma, and that 3 years after diagnosis 34% fulfilled criteria for either asthma or chronic bronchitis; in a retrospective study of 46 patients with at least two similar physician-diagnosed episodes of acute bronchitis, 65% episodes were found to have mild asthma. It is not known whether routine ordering of investigations such as chest x-rays, sputum cultures, or serum inflammatory markers at initial presentation adds value, and although acute bronchitis is considered self-limiting, there remains data to suggest that practitioners frequently prescribe both antibiotics and other medication.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^111x78mT]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Lung ultrasound (LUS) in critically ill adults with fever — LUS cannot visualize the entire lung and in mechanically ventilated patients evaluation is even more limited, and in immunocompromised individuals LUS may be insufficient to rule out pulmonary parenchymal disease and CT imaging is preferable. In experienced hands, LUS can be superior or complementary to conventional chest radiography for evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, or other thoracic processes and potentially carry a lower risk because patient transport would not be needed. It can be considered when sufficient expertise is available as a safe imaging modality in patients with fever and an abnormal chest radiograph, regardless of respiratory symptoms, whereas the role of LUS without an abnormal chest radiograph has not been studied in clinical trials and its role is unclear; in such situations, its use could be considered on case-by-case basis.

Recurrent fever of unknown origin is mostly caused by rather rare diseases and many cases remain unexplained. The very limited literature data do not allow one to construct a diagnostic algorithm. A number of general principles should be kept in mind before starting the investigation for this rare subtype of fever of unknown origin.

### A 70-year-old man with cough and recurrent respiratory infections [^115WFfUv]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 70-year-old man was referred for evaluation of recurrent respiratory infections requiring antibiotics and chronic cough over 3 years. Two months prior to presentation, he started to develop blood-tinged sputum but not frank hemoptysis. He otherwise denied any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. He had dyspnea during the respiratory infections but not otherwise. His medical history was significant for chronic rhinitis without sinusitis and a low serum IgM level. He was a never smoker and a farmer but otherwise had no significant or specific exposures or travel history. His family history was significant for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in his mother.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111Baq8a]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to procalcitonin, ACCP 2019 guidelines recommend to avoid obtaining procalcitonin measurement routinely in adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia.
