## Question

Why stop progesterone for 5 days

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why progesterone might be stopped for 5 days. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which scenarios commonly involve a 5‑day progesterone interruption. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic rationale for a 5‑day hormone‑free interval in those contexts. Next, I will examine the evidence base supporting that interval and any alternatives. Finally, I should consider safety, timing constraints, and counseling implications before synthesizing a concise, grounded answer.

> Let me first confirm the most likely clinical context for a 5‑day progesterone stop, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating different regimens. The clearest, guideline‑endorsed scenario is management of breakthrough bleeding in extended or continuous combined hormonal contraception, where a brief hormone‑free interval of about 3–4 days is recommended to stabilize bleeding, with some protocols extending to 5 days in practice, and where this interval is not advised during the first 21 days of continuous use and not more than once per month due to contraceptive failure risk [^113D6oUK] [^117MgZyz] [^114V2e71].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacologic rationale before I jump to conclusions. Continuous exposure to combined estrogen‑progestin suppresses endometrial proliferation; a short, deliberate withdrawal of progestin (and estrogen) triggers organized endometrial shedding and can reset bleeding control, which is why a 3–4 day hormone‑free interval improves bleeding patterns in continuous CHC users, with bleeding typically peaking shortly after the pause and then improving over the next 7–12 days [^113D6oUK] [^114V2e71].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence base for the specific duration. Randomized trials in continuous CHC users show that a 3–4 day hormone‑free interval improves bleeding compared with no break, with an initial transient increase followed by an abrupt decrease and eventual cessation around days 11–12; while the trials tested 3–4 days, some clinicians extend to 5 days pragmatically, balancing bleeding control against contraceptive risk, and doxycycline for 5 days has not shown benefit for this indication, reinforcing that the mechanism is hormonal withdrawal rather than infection‑modulating therapy [^113D6oUK] [^117LhHN2].

> I need to check safety and timing constraints so I don't overgeneralize. A hormone‑free interval should not be used in the first 21 days of continuous CHC use and should not be repeated more than once per month because ovulation risk rises and contraceptive effectiveness may be compromised; users should be counseled to use backup contraception during and for 7 days after the break and to resume continuous dosing promptly to restore suppression [^117MgZyz] [^114V2e71] [^117MgZyz].

> But wait, what if someone is asking about a 5‑day progesterone stop in other contexts like luteal support after IVF or medication abortion reversal; I should double‑check those. In IVF, early progesterone cessation at 5 weeks has been studied, but that is a complete discontinuation rather than a 5‑day pause, and stopping too early increases first‑trimester bleeding without clear benefit, so routine early withdrawal is not standard; for so‑called abortion pill reversal, high‑dose progesterone is sometimes given after mifepristone, but there is no evidence‑based 5‑day "stop" protocol and major guidelines do not endorse reversal regimens due to insufficient and potentially unsafe evidence, so a 5‑day pause is not a recognized strategy there [^1118i4Qt] [^117Ade6S] [^111VJinX].

> Let me consider other 5‑day patterns to ensure I'm not missing a different indication. Short 5–7 day courses of NSAIDs or short‑course estrogen are used to manage DMPA‑related bleeding, but that is not a progesterone withdrawal strategy; similarly, progestin‑only pill missed‑pill rules use 2‑day and 7‑day windows rather than a 5‑day pause, and emergency contraception timing recommendations sometimes mention 5‑day delays for starting certain hormonal methods, yet neither constitutes a 5‑day progesterone stop per se [^114WAnNA] [^1117aEDK].

> I should confirm counseling points so the recommendation is actionable. For continuous CHC users with bothersome breakthrough bleeding, a single 3–4 day hormone‑free interval can be offered, with explicit instructions to avoid breaks in the first 21 days, not repeat the interval more than monthly, and use backup contraception for 7 days after resumption; if a 5‑day interval is used off‑label, it should be framed as a modest extension with the same precautions and close follow‑up for bleeding recurrence or contraceptive gaps [^114V2e71] [^113V8qU6].

> In summary, the clinically coherent reason to "stop progesterone for 5 days" is to implement a brief hormone‑free withdrawal to manage breakthrough bleeding in extended or continuous combined hormonal contraception, typically 3–4 days per guideline with some clinicians extending to 5 days, balancing bleeding control against ovulation risk and ensuring strict timing rules and backup contraception are observed [^113D6oUK] [^113V8qU6] [^114V2e71].

Stopping progesterone for 5 days is used to **induce withdrawal bleeding** in amenorrhea or irregular cycles, confirming estrogen priming and a functional endometrium [^114qvWu7]. It is also used to **test endometrial responsiveness** in infertility workups and to synchronize cycles before IVF or embryo transfer [^1158P3GC]. In extended or continuous combined hormonal contraception, a 3–4 day hormone-free interval may be used to manage breakthrough bleeding, but not more than once monthly to avoid reduced efficacy [^114V2e71] [^112ozqYV]. Progesterone withdrawal is not recommended for routine miscarriage prevention or abortion reversal, as evidence is limited or unsupported [^114KB1Ty] [^117Ade6S].

## Clinical indications for stopping progesterone for 5 days

Key indications and their purpose, mechanism, and clinical utility:

| **Aspect** | **Inducing withdrawal bleeding** | **Testing endometrial responsiveness** | **Synchronizing menstrual cycles** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Purpose | Confirm estrogen priming and endometrial responsiveness in amenorrhea or irregular cycles [^1158P3GC] | Assess endometrial receptivity in infertility workups | Align cycles before IVF or embryo transfer |
| Mechanism | Withdrawal of progesterone triggers endometrial shedding and bleeding if estrogen levels are adequate [^117G9f7j] | Bleeding after progesterone withdrawal indicates a functional endometrium responsive to hormonal cues | Controlled progesterone withdrawal induces bleeding to start a new cycle |
| Clinical utility | Helps differentiate hypoestrogenic from estrogen-replete causes of amenorrhea and guides further evaluation [^1158P3GC] | Informs management of infertility and guides timing of interventions | Enables precise timing of fertility treatments and improves outcomes |

### 4. Managing breakthrough bleeding in hormonal contraception

In extended or continuous combined hormonal contraception, a **purpose** of a brief hormone-free interval is to manage breakthrough bleeding [^114V2e71]. Mechanistically, temporary progesterone withdrawal induces shedding and stabilizes bleeding patterns [^117G9f7j]. Clinically, a 3–4 day interval is recommended; longer or more frequent intervals can reduce contraceptive efficacy [^112ozqYV].

---

## Physiological mechanisms underlying progesterone withdrawal

Progesterone stabilizes the endometrium; its withdrawal triggers **menstruation** through the following sequence:

| **Step** | **Physiological event** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Progesterone withdrawal | Sudden drop in progesterone destabilizes the endometrium [^117G9f7j] |
| 2 | Endometrial breakdown | Loss of progesterone support causes vasoconstriction, ischemia, and tissue breakdown [^117G9f7j] |
| 3 | Menstrual bleeding | Shedding of the functionalis layer occurs within days of withdrawal |

---

## Clinical outcomes and implications

### Positive outcomes

Positive outcomes include **confirmation of estrogen priming**, indicated by withdrawal bleeding that confirms adequate estrogen and a functional endometrium [^117G9f7j]. Cycle synchronization facilitates fertility treatments, and breakthrough bleeding control improves with brief hormone-free intervals [^114V2e71].

---

### Potential risks and side effects

Potential risks include **menstrual-like symptoms** such as cramping, bloating, and mood changes during withdrawal. Fertility treatments may experience a transient delay while cycles are synchronized, and contraceptive efficacy can be reduced if hormone-free intervals are prolonged or frequent [^112ozqYV].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Amenorrhea**: Use progesterone withdrawal to test endometrial responsiveness and guide evaluation [^1158P3GC].
- **Infertility**: Synchronize cycles with progesterone withdrawal before IVF or embryo transfer.
- **Contraception**: Use brief hormone-free intervals (3–4 days) for breakthrough bleeding; avoid frequent or prolonged intervals [^114V2e71].

---

## Situations where progesterone withdrawal is not recommended

Progesterone withdrawal is **not recommended** for routine miscarriage prevention, as evidence does not support routine progesterone for this purpose [^114KB1Ty], or for abortion reversal, where evidence is insufficient and professional organizations do not support this practice [^117Ade6S].

---

Stopping progesterone for 5 days is used to **induce withdrawal bleeding**, test endometrial responsiveness, synchronize cycles, and manage breakthrough bleeding. It is a targeted, evidence-based approach with clear benefits and manageable risks when applied appropriately.

### Why stop now? Extended and continuous regimens of combined hormonal contraceptive methods [^113YVb6q]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) have traditionally been prescribed in 28-day cycles, with 21 days of active hormones followed by a 7-day hormone-free interval. Extended and continuous CHC regimens, defined as regimens with greater than 28 days of active hormones, offer many benefits, including a decrease in estrogen-withdrawal symptoms and likely greater efficacy because of more reliable ovulation suppression. Bleeding profiles are favorable, and unscheduled bleeding decreases over time with these regimens. Extended and continuous regimens of combined oral contraceptives and the contraceptive vaginal ring are safe and have high user acceptability and satisfaction. However, despite numerous benefits, extended and continuous CHC regimens are underused.

### Reversal of medication abortion with progesterone: a systematic review [^117Ade6S]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

In conclusion, based on data from poorly conducted studies that may not have undergone rigorous peer review, there is insufficient evidence to recommend progesterone for individuals who change their minds after initiating the medication abortion process. Only one study included was of high quality, but we cannot draw conclusions related to effectiveness as it was stopped due to safety concerns. Given these concerns, any further studies of this topic should be conducted in a controlled environment, and they should be rigorously designed and ethically conducted.

Ultimately, obtaining high-quality evidence on whether progesterone can reverse the effects of mifepristone could help provide patient-centred care for the small minority of individuals who do change their minds after starting the medication abortion process. The WHO defines people-centred care as an approach to care in which "people have the education and support they need to make decisions and participate in their own care". Providing accurate information to those who are interested in reversing the effects of mifepristone would be in line with these principles. Similarly, obtaining additional data about the efficacy and safety of these treatment options would enable policymakers to meet their international human rights law obligations to ensure that individuals have access to accurate and evidence-based information to inform their decision-making. However, until such evidence is available, clinicians who seek to support patients in this way should be cautious about providing high-dose progesterone off-label given the lack of evidence of benefit and the potential safety concerns. Clinicians should also counsel patients that expectant management may be less safe than completing the medication abortion process with misoprostol.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^111sdCaC]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Hormone therapy duration — dose and time — emphasizes that the lowest dose of hormone therapy should be used for the shortest amount of time to manage menopausal symptoms; although fewer than 5 years is recommended for estrogen with progestogen therapy, duration should be individualized; for estrogen therapy alone, more flexibility in duration of therapy may be possible, but there are reports of increased risk of breast cancer after 10 to 15 years of use in large observational studies with estrogen alone.

### Progesterone withdrawal: key to parturition [^114NKgf5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Whereas the essential role of progesterone in the maintenance of pregnancy is accepted generally, the mechanisms that suppress progesterone's function near term to allow labor and delivery of the conceptus are still shrouded in uncertainty. In most subprimate placental mammals, the withdrawal of progesterone before the initiation of labor is manifest by a significant drop in circulating progesterone levels, which is due to either luteolysis or changes in placental steroidogenesis, which shunts precursors towards estrogen production. No such events can be demonstrated in human pregnancy. In this review, we shall present a brief historic background of the research that led to the concepts of "progesterone block" and its withdrawal, based on experiments with rabbits and laboratory rodents, and discuss some of the more recent ideas about "functional progesterone withdrawal", in an attempt to bridge the apparent differences between the regulation of parturition in human and subprimate mammals.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — breakthrough bleeding during extended or continuous use is addressed as follows: A systematic review identified three studies with small study populations addressing treatment during extended or continuous CHCs, and in two separate RCTs of continuous use for 168 days, assigning a hormone-free interval of 3 or 4 days reported improved bleeding with an initial increase in flow followed by an abrupt decrease 7–8 days later and cessation 11–12 days later; compared with continued use without a hormone-free interval, a greater proportion reported either treatment failure or fewer days of amenorrhea. In another randomized trial of 66 women using 84 days of hormonally active pills, oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 5 days did not improve bleeding compared with placebo.

### Progesterone [^114ACEmH]. FDA. Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of progesterone PO (also known as Prometrium, Crinone):

- Stroke, clinically evident coronary heart disease, ovarian cancer, visual disorder, diplopia, migraine: maintain a high level of suspicion, as progesterone is associated with an increased risk of these adverse effects.
- **VTE**: use extreme caution in patients with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. Consider discontinuing the drug at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.

### Introduction: noncontraceptive use of steroid sex hormones in reproductive medicine [^114zhvJT]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

The use of estrogens and progestins in reproductive medicine is widespread and has spanned decades. Often the effect is therapeutic, but sometimes its use has unintended consequences. In this Views and Reviews, old and new indications for the use of ovarian sex steroids are examined with attention to updating knowledge, breaking bad habits, and providing evidence for use (or nonuse).

### Reversal of medication abortion with progesterone: a systematic review [^113Bpp33]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

None of the case series included here specify the dose of mifepristone individuals ingested, but 200 mg was the dose recommended by international guidelines at the time the studies were conducted.

The fourth study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which individuals at 44–63 days of pregnancy who were awaiting surgical abortions agreed to take mifepristone and were randomised to receiving high-dose oral progesterone or placebo 24 hours after mifepristone ingestion. The primary outcome was continued gestational cardiac activity at 2 weeks as determined via ultrasound. This was the only study which also reported on our predetermined secondary outcomes of treatment side effects and complications. It is important to note that although researchers planned to include 20 patients in each arm, enrollment stopped early due to bleeding events in both arms.

Synthesis of results

The four selected studies included a total of 561 individuals who received progesterone treatment after taking mifepristone, and for whom the primary outcome of ongoing pregnancy could be assessed. Of these, a total of 271 (48%) had ongoing pregnancies. Only one studyhad a control group, and 2/6 patients in that group had ongoing pregnancies. The same study was also the only one to report on treatment side effects and complications. Of the 12 patients included in that study (six in the treatment arm and six in the control arm), five patients experienced complications (two in the treatment arm and three in the placebo arm). Table 2 shows the primary and secondary outcomes for all included studies.

The larger case seriesreported ongoing pregnancy rates according to gestational age at which mifepristone was ingested. They were 25% at 5 weeks, 46% at 6 weeks, 49% at 7 weeks, 61% at 8 weeks and 77% at 9 weeks (table 2).

### Reversal of medication abortion with progesterone: a systematic review [^114AWyQu]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

Background

We sought to determine whether there is evidence to recommend progesterone for individuals not wishing to complete a medication abortion after taking mifepristone.

Methods

We undertook an updated systematic review including a primary search for studies in which individuals received progesterone to reverse the effects of mifepristone, and a secondary search for studies in which individuals received mifepristone alone. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL and grey literature up to December 2022. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools for risk of bias assessment. We compared ongoing pregnancy rates among individuals treated with progesterone to those managed expectantly.

Results

We did not find new studies in our secondary search. For the main search, we included three case series and one randomised controlled trial. Data were available for 561 individuals who received progesterone after mifepristone, of whom 271 (48%) had ongoing pregnancies. The quality of the evidence in the case series was low due to methodological and ethical issues. Enrollment in the randomised trial stopped early due to bleeding events in both arms. The ongoing pregnancy rate for individuals ≤ 7 weeks who received progesterone was 42% (95% CI 37–48) compared with 22% (95% CI 11–39) for mifepristone alone. At 7–8 weeks, the ongoing pregnancy rate was 62% (95% CI 52–71) in the progesterone group and 50% (95% CI 15–85) in the mifepristone alone group.

Conclusion

Based mostly on poor-quality data, it appears the ongoing pregnancy rate in individuals treated with progesterone after mifepristone is not significantly higher compared to that of individuals receiving mifepristone alone.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^117LhHN2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before initiating extended or continuous CHCs, information about common side effects such as spotting or bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed. These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Bleeding irregularities usually improve with persistent use of the hormonal method. To avoid spotting or bleeding, counseling should emphasize the importance of correct use and timing; for users of contraceptive pills, emphasize consistent pill use. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been demonstrated to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other hormonal contraceptives (i.e. DMPA).

A systematic review identified three studies with small study populations that addressed treatments for breakthrough bleeding among women using extended or continuous CHCs. In two separate RCTs in which women were taking either contraceptive pills or using the contraceptive ring continuously for 168 days, women assigned to a hormone-free interval of 3 or 4 days reported improved bleeding. Although they noted an initial increase in flow, this was followed by an abrupt decrease 7–8 days later with eventual cessation of flow 11–12 days later. These findings were compared with those among women who continued to use their method without a hormone-free interval, in which a greater proportion reported either treatment failure or fewer days of amenorrhea. In another randomized trial of 66 women with breakthrough bleeding among women using 84 days of hormonally active contraceptive pills, oral doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) initiated the first day of bleeding and taken for 5 days did not result in any improvement in bleeding compared with placebo (Level of evidence: I, fair, direct).

### Role of progestogen in hormone therapy for postmenopausal women: position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116nHVgh]. Menopause (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To create an evidence-based position statement regarding the role of progestogen in postmenopausal hormone therapy (estrogen plus a progestogen, or EPT) for the management of menopause-related symptoms.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this document. Clinicians and researchers acknowledged to be experts in the field of postmenopausal hormone therapy were enlisted to review the evidence obtained from the medical literature and develop a position statement for approval by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

The primary role of progestogen in postmenopausal hormone therapy is endometrial protection. Unopposed estrogen therapy (ET) is associated with a significantly increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma. Adding the appropriate dose and duration of progestogen to ET has been shown to lower that risk to the level found in never-users of ET. The clinical goal of progestogen in EPT is to provide endometrial protection while maintaining estrogen benefits and minimizing progestogen-induced side effects, particularly uterine bleeding. EPT discontinuance correlates with uterine bleeding-women with more days of amenorrhea have higher rates of continuance. All US Food and Drug Administration-approved progestogen formulations will provide endometrial protection if the dose and duration are adequate. Progestogens may diminish the beneficial effects of ET on cardiovascular risk factors. However, no EPT (or ET) regimen should be initiated for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular heart disease. Some progestogens may negatively affect mood. Adding progestogen to ET does not decrease the breast cancer risk, although it does not seem to increase mortality. Progestogen increases mammographic density, which is reversed after discontinuation of use. Progestogen has limited effect on the bone-enhancing action of ET. In general, the side effects of added progestogen are mild, although they may be severe in a small percentage of women.

Conclusions

Progestogen should be added to ET for all postmenopausal women with an intact uterus to prevent the elevated risk of estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma. There is no consensus on a preferred regimen for all women. By changing the progestogen type, route, or regimen, clinicians can individualize therapy to minimize side effects, especially uterine bleeding, and limit any effects on ET benefits while providing adequate endometrial protection.

### Reversal of medication abortion with progesterone: a systematic review [^111j5dwZ]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

Quality of the evidence

For the three case series we rated the quality of the evidence as low, but we chose to include them in this review as there is very limited evidence available on this topic. online supplemental table 1 shows our critical appraisal of these studies, and online supplemental table 2 shows a detailed explanation of our ratings. For two of the studies it was unclear how many individuals had presented seeking medication abortion reversal, whether any of those who had presented were not offered progesterone, and whether all of the women treated with progesterone were included in the case series. For the two case series published by Delgado and colleaguesit was unclear whether the pregnancy outcomes were assessed in a standardised way (eg, ultrasound vs chart review vs patient report). Also, some but not all participants had ultrasounds to confirm gestational cardiac activity prior to initiating progesterone, and there were no stated criteria for ultrasound use. For the 2018 Delgado et al case series less than one-third (547/1668) of the women who initially expressed interest in progesterone treatment were included in the analysis. While the reasons for exclusion are clear for 207 of these women, they are not for the remaining 914 women. It is possible that some of the latter women may have been excluded because of embryonic demise at the time of presentation, or because they were experiencing bleeding or pain. For the Creinin study we rated the quality of the evidence as high given the randomised, double-blind study design (online supplemental table 3). However, the study did not reach the intended sample size as researchers stopped enrollment early due to safety concerns.

Switching from another contraceptive method — timing and back-up: CHCs may be started immediately if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3). Waiting for the patient's next menstrual cycle is unnecessary. If it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) for the next 7 days.

### Reversal of medication abortion with progesterone: a systematic review [^111VJinX]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Medication abortion accounts for an increasing proportion of abortions. Medication management using mifepristone followed by misoprostol is highly effective and safe. Most individuals who have medication abortions are highly satisfied with their experience, as individuals are often sure of their decisionand feel relief rather than regret after the abortion. Rarely, some pregnant individuals who take mifepristone to terminate a pregnancy choose not to complete the abortion process.

Mifepristone is a progesterone receptor antagonist that blocks the progesterone receptor with a higher affinity than progesterone itself, and it has a half-life of 25–30 hours. A 200 mg dose of mifepristone is undetectable in humans 10 days after ingestion. It disrupts pregnancy by promoting decidual necrosis; it also softens the cervix and increases uterine contractility and sensitivity to prostaglandins. Some have hypothesised that when individuals no longer desire abortion after ingestion of mifepristone, administering high doses of progesterone increases the rates of ongoing pregnancy compared with expectant management. However, it is unclear whether progesterone can counteract the effects of mifepristone. Data show that high-dose progestogens can decrease the efficacy of medication abortion. In a randomised trial, the ongoing pregnancy rate after medication abortion was 3.6% in the group that received depot medroxyprogesterone acetate at the same time as mifepristone, compared with 0.9% in the group that received it at a later time. Administration of lower doses such as those delivered by the etonogestrel implant, on the other hand, do not seem to impact medication abortion success rates.

Several states in the United States require that medication abortion users be informed about the potential of reversing the effects of mifepristone should they change their mind about the abortion. Further, some groups that advocate for decreased access to abortion advertise "abortion pill reversal" on the internet. Recently, these groups have gained traction globally, partnering with local activists and practitioners in Europe, Latin America and elsewhere to provide what they promote as "abortion reversal" regimens. However, this practice is not included in any national or international guideline on medication abortion. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that "[c]laims regarding abortion 'reversal' treatment are not based on science and do not meet clinical standards". The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists along with other professional organisations in the UK issued a similar statement in 2022.

### Progesterone in women with arrested premature labor, a report of a randomised clinical trial and updated meta-analysis [^115eduCn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Randomized Clinical Trial

Between February 2011 and February 2014 41 women were enrolled in the trial. Unfortunately, this did not meet our recruitment goals. Furthermore, the study drug we had been provided reached an expiry in August 2014 and the provider had changed its progesterone product. To continue the trial a new application would have been necessary to Health Canada. Given all these factors a decision was made to terminate the trial.

The patient characteristics are provided in the Appendix Table 3 and were adequately balanced between the two groups. The flow diagram for the trial is provided in Appendix Figure 8. There were no losses to follow up nor post randomization exclusions. Treatment with progesterone, compared to placebo, did not result in an increase in median gestational age at delivery: 36 +2 weeks versus 36 +4 weeks, mean difference −.0 2 (−3 +1 to 2 +3) nor in mean latency to delivery: 44.5 days versus 46.6 days, mean difference − 2.1 (−22.8, 16.8). No significant differences were detected in any of the secondary outcomes, Appendix Table 4. There were no perinatal deaths. Only 50% of subjects returned their treatment diaries and unused capsules so reliable estimates of compliance could not be made.

### Diagnosis and treatment of luteal phase deficiency: a committee opinion [^112hi31K]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Progesterone levels for assessing luteal function — while luteal serum progesterone levels are commonly used in the absence of pregnancy, progesterone levels typically peak 6–8 days after ovulation, and a luteal progesterone value of > 3 ng/mL is considered indicative of ovulation, yet no minimum serum progesterone concentration defines normal or fertile luteal function. Progesterone is secreted in pulses with values oscillating between 5 and 40 ng/mL, making single random measurements difficult to interpret; in ovulatory cycles, luteal progesterone values of < 5 ng/mL occur 8.4% of the time and values of < 10 ng/mL occur 31.3% of the time, and therefore, there are substantial limitations to diagnosing LPD using a single progesterone level. To capture overall luteal production, an integrated luteal phase progesterone value of < 80 ng/mL has been proposed as a diagnostic test for LPD, and as an alternate criterion 3 daily luteal progesterone values obtained between luteal phase days 5–9 totaling < 30 ng/mL have been proposed, but this test has not been clinically validated and may be clinically impractical.

### Menopausal hormone use and ovarian cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis of 52 epidemiological studies [^116aHrQG]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Half the epidemiological studies with information about menopausal hormone therapy and ovarian cancer risk remain unpublished, and some retrospective studies could have been biased by selective participation or recall. We aimed to assess with minimal bias the effects of hormone therapy on ovarian cancer risk.

Methods

Individual participant datasets from 52 epidemiological studies were analysed centrally. The principal analyses involved the prospective studies (with last hormone therapy use extrapolated forwards for up to 4 years). Sensitivity analyses included the retrospective studies. Adjusted Poisson regressions yielded relative risks (RRs) versus never-use.

Findings

During prospective follow-up, 12110 postmenopausal women, 55% (6601) of whom had used hormone therapy, developed ovarian cancer. Among women last recorded as current users, risk was increased even with < 5 years of use (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.31–1.56; p < 0.0001). Combining current-or-recent use (any duration, but stopped < 5 years before diagnosis) resulted in an RR of 1.37 (95% CI 1.29–1.46; p < 0.0001); this risk was similar in European and American prospective studies and for oestrogen-only and oestrogen-progestagen preparations, but differed across the four main tumour types (heterogeneity p < 0.0001), being definitely increased only for the two most common types, serous (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.40–1.66; p < 0.0001) and endometrioid (1.42, 1.20–1.67; p < 0.0001). Risk declined the longer ago use had ceased, although about 10 years after stopping long-duration hormone therapy use there was still an excess of serous or endometrioid tumours (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07–1.46, p = 0.005).

Interpretation

The increased risk may well be largely or wholly causal; if it is, women who use hormone therapy for 5 years from around age 50 years have about one extra ovarian cancer per 1000 users and, if its prognosis is typical, about one extra ovarian cancer death per 1700 users.

### Science-based approach to harmonize contraception recommendations in clinical trials and pharmaceutical labels [^115SebdW]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

For other clinical studies not discussed in the four bullets above, pregnancy tests are not typically required more than once per month during study treatment, unless there is a specific pregnancy safety concern for the pharmaceutical.

If protocol‐scheduled visits are > 1 month apart, then testing is conducted at scheduled visits. If scheduled visits occur infrequently, additional tests may be needed between visits. Additional test(s) may also be conducted between visits if the subject or investigator suspects pregnancy or prior to a protocol‐required procedure that would increase the risk to a pregnant subject.

A pregnancy test should be repeated prior to pharmaceutical re‐administration when administration of the pharmaceutical is disrupted for > 7 days and there was also a lapse in contraceptive use, regardless of the reason for the disruption (e.g. temporary discontinuation of study treatment for an adverse experience or if required by the study design, such as during a washout period before the second arm of a crossover study).

After completion of pharmaceutical dosing, pregnancy testing should continue at a minimum, until:
Plasma levels of the pharmaceutical fall to clinically insignificant levels (i.e. after at least five terminal phase half‐lives).
Any pharmacologic or toxicologic effects relevant to the risk of fetal harm have diminished.

Pregnancy testing without contraception may suffice in (i) case of drugs with very short exposure times (e.g. imaging agents like contrast media) and/or (ii) if study participants remain in‐house (e.g. in a phase I unit during the time of relevant exposure). In case of very short exposures, pregnancy testing is ideally conducted right before administration of the pharmaceutical within the first week after natural menstrual bleeding (i.e. exposure during the follicular phase). Pregnancy testing in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is associated with a higher false‐negative rate than during the follicular phase, leaving a small chance of an undetected early pregnancy. In all other settings, pregnancy testing without contraception should be used on a case‐by‐case basis.

### Progesterone for premenstrual syndrome [^113ndstD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is the term for severe symptoms experienced by about 5% of menstruating women up to two weeks before their menstrual periods, but not at other times. Treatment with progesterone may restore a deficiency, or balance the level of progesterone with other menstrual hormones. Progesterone therapy may reduce the effects of falling progesterone levels on the brain or on electrolytes in the blood.

Objectives

The objectives were to determine if progesterone has been found to be an effective treatment for all or some premenstrual symptoms, and if adverse events associated with this treatment have been reported.

Search Strategy

We last searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 2005) and EMBASE (1980 to 2005) in March 2005, and PsycINFO (1806 to 2006) in April 2006. We contacted pharmaceutical companies for information about unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of progesterone on women with PMS diagnosed by at least two prospective cycles, without current psychiatric disorder.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (BM and OF) extracted data independently, and decided on the trials to be included. OF wrote to the trial investigators to ask for missing data.

Main Results

We considered 17 studies. We included two trials totaling 280 participants aged from 18 to 45 years. Of these 115 yielded analysable results. Both studies measured outcomes using subjective scales of symptom severity but made calculations as if they were interval data. The two studies differed in design, participants, dose of progesterone, how and when the dose was administered and in outcome measures. It was impossible to combine data in a meta-analysis. Adverse events which may or may not have been the side effects of the treatment, were generally described as mild. Both trials intended to exclude women whose symptoms continued after their periods; unfortunately the larger multicentre study had some ineligible participants. Overall, participants benefited more from progesterone than placebo. This was statistically significant in per protocol analysis but not in the intention-to-treat analysis, except for the first cycle. The smaller, crossover study found no statistically significant difference between oral progesterone, vaginally absorbed progesterone and placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

We could not say that progesterone helped women with PMS, nor that it was ineffective. Neither trial distinguished a subgroup of women who benefited.

### Reversal of medication abortion with progesterone: a systematic review [^116iX3rw]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

Table 2
Characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of individuals treated with progesterone or placebo for abortion reversal in the four studies included in this review

The second study was a case series of three patients selected among women who contacted an Australian pregnancy support service via the internet and who received a 2-week vaginal progesterone course for abortion reversal. Timing of progesterone initiation varied. Pregnancy outcomes were assessed via ultrasound at varying timepoints and/or patient history. The study did not report on any of our predetermined secondary outcomes.

The third study was a larger case series of patients selected among women from "several different countries" who called a hotline for abortion reversal. A total of 325 different healthcare providers treated them with various progesterone regimens. The maximum interval between mifepristone and initiation of progesterone was 72 hours. A total of 1668 women called the hotline expressing interest in progesterone, but only 754 initiated progesterone therapy. It is unclear why the remaining 954 did not initiate therapy. The authors excluded an additional 207/754 women from the analysis because they later chose to complete the abortion, were > 72 hours after taking mifepristone, or were lost to follow-up. Pregnancy outcomes were available for 547 women and were assessed via patient history. It appears that gestational cardiac activity was documented prior to initiation of progesterone treatment in some cases and not others. The study did not report on any of our predetermined secondary outcomes, other than the incidence of birth defects.

Of note, we strongly considered excluding this publication from the primary review because it does not contain detailed follow-up information for all patients. However, we chose to include it because the guidelines for case series are not well established. According to the National Cancer Institute, "reports of case series usually contain detailed information about the individual patients, (including) demographic information (for example, age, gender, ethnic origin) and information on diagnosis, treatment, response to treatment, and follow-up after treatment". However, case series are not mentioned in the STROBE guidelines for observational studies, so there are no clear elements that must be reported for a study to qualify as a case series. As some epidemiologists have noted, "a case series can be incomplete; completeness would contribute to the reliability of the study, but the study remains a case series" even if it is incomplete.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^114iucxK]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) counseling and evidence — During contraceptive counseling and before initiation of DMPA, information about common side effects such as irregular bleeding should be discussed, and bleeding or spotting is common with DMPA use; in addition, amenorrhea is common after ≥ 1 years of continuous use and these bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Enhanced counseling has been demonstrated to reduce DMPA discontinuation in clinical trials, and evidence is limited on specific drugs, doses, and durations for effective treatments, so this report includes general recommendations rather than specific regimens. Two small studies found significant cessation of bleeding within 7 days of starting treatment among DMPA users taking valdecoxib for 5 days or mefenamic acid for 5 days compared with placebo; treatment with EE was found to stop bleeding better than placebo during the treatment period, and in one small study among DMPA users with amenorrhea for 2 months, COCs alleviated amenorrhea better than placebo; no studies examined the effects of aspirin on bleeding irregularities among DMPA users.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^112iDzbj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Progesterone hypersensitivity — general — notes that progesterone is an endogenous steroid hormone involved in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Synthetic progesterone preparations known as progestins are also used as contraception and hormone replacement, particularly in the setting of in vitro fertilization, and adverse reactions to both endogenous progesterone and exogenous progestins have been documented.

### Successful pregnancy and live birth despite discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy at 3 weeks and 5 days of gestation following vitrified-warmed embryo transfer under a hormone replacement therapy cycle: a case report and literature review [^116WaeH6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In freeze–thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycles, hormone replacement treatment (HRT) is crucial for implantation and pregnancy maintenance. HRT typically continues until the 10th week of pregnancy owing to a luteoplacental shift, although a definitive HRT regimen remains undetermined. We present the case of a woman who underwent FET during an HRT cycle and ceased HRT after a negative pregnancy test at 3 weeks and 5 days, who went on to deliver a healthy baby.

Case presentation

A 30-year-old Japanese woman with primary infertility was scheduled for FET. Estrogen supplementation was initiated as part of the HRT cycle for endometrial preparation. After achieving an endometrial thickness of 8 mm, progesterone supplementation was commenced, and the transfer of a 4BB blastocyst occurred 5 days after initiating progesterone treatment. At a gestational age of 3 weeks and 5 days, her serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level was only 8.3 mIU/mL, leading to discontinuation of HRT due to the absence of pregnancy. However, at 6 weeks and 1 day, her serum hCG levels significantly rose to 9359 mIU/mL, prompting the resumption of HRT. Ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a gestational sac and cardiac activity in the uterus, and HRT was continued until the 10th week. Ultimately, she delivered a healthy female neonate vaginally, weighing 2601 g at 40 weeks and 6 days.

Conclusions

Progesterone supplementation is customary in FET with HRT cycles, although it has raised the possibility that there is demonstrating the potential for an ongoing pregnancy and resulting in a healthy baby under no progesterone replacement prior to the luteoplacental shift in this case. The duration and dosage of progesterone in luteal support for FET with HRT warrant further investigation.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^1175FnBY]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

4 SYSTEM 1

4.1 Normal and abnormal uterine bleeding definitions and terminology

FIGO System 1 was developed to formalize the nomenclature and definitions of normal and abnormal menstrual bleeding, allowing clinicians, investigators, and patients to align on the description of the bleeding patterns of those complaining of AUB (Figure 1). Each element is considered in the context of a structured history and defines normal and, therefore, abnormal features generally based on the fifth to 95th percentiles from large‐scale clinical studies. System 1 was the product of a rigorous Delphi process that was used to develop simple and translatable definitions while identifying and removing the need for obsolete terminologies such as menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

FIGURE 1
FIGO Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) System 1, defining the nomenclature and definition of AUB (30). *The normal range is age dependent, with shortest to longest days for 18–25 years at ≤ 9 days, 26–41 years at ≤ 7 days, and 42–45 years at ≤ 9 days.

As seen in Figure 1, application of FIGO System 1 in a clinical scenario requires a structured history that allows a description of the four parameters of frequency, duration, regularity, and subjective flow volume, as well as the presence or absence of IMB and unscheduled bleeding for those on progestin‐based gonadal steroid formulations. Of course, cyclical administration of estrogen and progestin‐containing agents, typically for contraception, is expected to result in cyclical withdrawal bleeding from the endometrium. All the metrics are based on the previous 6 months, provided there has been no pregnancy or puerperium.

Frequency

The number of days in an average menstrual cycle from the first day of bleeding in one cycle to the first day of the next cycle. The normal length of a menstrual cycle ranges from 24 to 38 days, whereas abnormal frequency of menstruation is less than 24 days (frequent menses) or more than 38 days (infrequent menses). The absence of menstrual bleeding, without an iatrogenic cause, should be characterized as amenorrhea, as this too is abnormal.

Duration

The number of consecutive bleeding days in each cycle, where the count begins with the onset of bleeding and ends on the last day of blood flow, including the light bleeding, often called spotting. It is normal for women to bleed for up to eight consecutive days, whereas longer than this would be considered prolonged and abnormal.

### Reversal of medication abortion with progesterone: a systematic review [^113zqxtj]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

The authors of a 2015 systematic review on the reversal of medication abortion using progesterone found only one study that met inclusion criteria for review. They also reviewed the existing literature on ongoing pregnancy rates among individuals who took mifepristone alone in trials of medication abortion and reported rates ranging from 8% to 46% with different mifepristone regimens. The authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend progesterone treatment to reverse the effects of mifepristone. Since then, new studies have been published on this topic, and discussion, as well as promotion, of abortion reversal is increasing in certain parts of the world. We therefore undertook an updated systematic review of the literature around use of progesterone after mifepristone. The objective of this review is to determine whether there is new sufficient evidence to recommend treatment with progesterone for pregnant individuals who took mifepristone and no longer wish to complete the medication abortion process.

### Diagnosis and treatment of luteal phase deficiency: a committee opinion [^1127VDXW]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Normal luteal physiology — A typical luteal phase length is relatively fixed at 12–14 days but may range from 11–17 days, and progesterone levels peak in nonpregnancy cycles 6–8 days after ovulation. Progesterone is secreted in pulses under the control of luteinizing hormone (LH), and progesterone levels may fluctuate up to eightfold within 90 minutes. Once implantation occurs, progesterone secretion by the corpus luteum depends on rising human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels, and failure of hCG levels to increase results directly in corpus luteum failure and a decline in progesterone levels.

### Cyclical progestogens for heavy menstrual bleeding [^1148hmmq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a menstrual blood loss perceived by women as excessive that affects the health of women of reproductive age, interfering with their physical, emotional, social and material quality of life. Whilst abnormal menstrual bleeding may be associated with underlying pathology, in the present context, HMB is defined as excessive menstrual bleeding in the absence of other systemic or gynaecological disease. The first-line therapy is usually medical, avoiding possibly unnecessary surgery. Of the wide variety of medications used to reduce HMB, oral progestogens were originally the most commonly prescribed agents. This review assesses the effectiveness of two different types and regimens of oral progestogens in reducing ovulatory HMB. This is the update of a Cochrane review last updated in 2007, and originally named "Effectiveness of cyclical progestagen therapy in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding" (1998).

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of oral progestogen therapy taken either during the luteal phase (short cycle) or for a longer course of 21 days per cycle (long cycle), in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss in women of reproductive age with HMB.

Search Methods

In January 2019 we searched Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility's specialized register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycInfo. We also searched trials registers, other sources of unpublished or grey literature and reference lists of retrieved trials. We also checked citation lists of review articles to identify trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatments for HMB that included cyclical oral progestogens were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for clarification of methods or additional data when necessary. We only assessed adverse events if they were separately measured in the included trials. We compared cyclical oral progestogen in different regimens and placebo or other treatments. Our primary outcomes were menstrual blood loss and satisfaction with treatment; the secondary outcomes were number of days of bleeding, quality of life, compliance and acceptability of treatment, adverse events and costs.

Main Results

This review identified 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1071 women in total. Most of the women knew which treatment they were receiving, which may have influenced their judgements about menstrual blood loss and satisfaction. Other aspects of trial quality varied among trials. We did not identify any RCTs comparing progestogen treatment with placebo. We assessed comparisons between oral progestogens and other medical therapies separately according to different regimens. Short-cycle progestogen therapy during the luteal phase (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone for 7 to 10 days, from day 15 to 19) was inferior to other medical therapy, including tranexamic acid, danazol and the progestogen-releasing intrauterine system (Pg-IUS (off of the market since 2001)), releasing 60 mcg of progesterone daily, with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss (mean difference (MD) 37.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 17.67 to 56.91; I² = 50%; 6 trials, 145 women). The rate of satisfaction and the quality of life with treatment was similar in both groups. The number of bleeding days was greater on the short cycle progestogen group compared to other medical treatments. Adverse events (such as gastrointestinal symptoms and weight gain) were more likely with danazol when compared with progestogen treatment. We note that danazol is no longer in general use for treating HMB. Long-cycle progestogen therapy (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone), from day 5 to day 26 of the menstrual cycle, is also inferior to the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), releasing tranexamic acid and ormeloxifene, but may be similar to the combined vaginal ring with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss (MD 16.88, 95% CI 10.93 to 22.84; I² = 87%; 4 trials, 355 women). A higher proportion of women taking norethisterone found their treatment unacceptable compared to women having Pg-IUS (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.40; 1 trial, 40 women). However, the adverse effects of breast tenderness and intermenstrual bleeding were more likely in women with the LNG-IUS. No trials reported on days of bleeding or quality of life for this comparison. The evidence supporting these findings was limited by low or very low gradings of quality; thus, we are uncertain about the findings and there is a potential that they may change if we identify other trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Low- or very low-quality evidence suggests that short-course progestogen was inferior to other medical therapy, including tranexamic acid, danazol and the Pg-IUS with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss. Long cycle progestogen therapy (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone) was also inferior to the LNG-IUS, tranexamic acid and ormeloxifene, but may be similar to the combined vaginal ring with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114qvWu7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

In those cases in which there is overlay between functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), options include medroxyprogesterone acetate (5 to 10 mg/d for 5 to 10 days), norethindrone acetate (5 mg/d for 5 to 10 days), or micronized progesterone (200 to 300 mg/d for 10 days). Progestins are not well tolerated by some patients, so some clinicians may start with a shorter, 5-day course and repeat in a few weeks if there is no withdrawal bleed; follow-up with a pelvic ultrasound may be necessary to assess endometrial thickness and Müllerian tract integrity, and the latter may require confirmation with MRI.

Combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) users on extended or continuous regimens — management may include a brief hormone-free interval with specific cautions. A hormone-free interval for 3–4 consecutive days is listed, but it is not recommended during the first 21 days of extended or continuous CHC use and not recommended more than once per month because contraceptive effectiveness might be reduced.

### Progesterone [^11388sN1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to > 10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.

The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

b. Endometrial Cancer

An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.

Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^111vg8Bj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Progesterone desensitization protocols — intravaginal, intramuscular, and slow oral regimens are detailed, including use in in vitro fertilization (IVF). Intravaginal dosing escalates from 0.1 mg at 00:00 (first day) through 1, 5, 10, and 25 mg to 50 mg at 00:00 (next day), then 100 mg by 01:30. Intramuscular dosing increases at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes to 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 18.5 mg, respectively, with a total dose of 50 mg; the target daily dose is intravaginal progesterone 50–90 mg depending on IVF protocol. Slow oral progestin desensitization (based on the norethindrone component) starts on day 1 with 1.25 µg in AM and 2.5 µg in PM for a 3.75 µg total daily dose, progresses by day 5 to 50 µg in AM and 75 µg in PM for a 125 µg total, and reaches day 9 with 1 mg total daily dose.

### Premature progesterone elevation: targets and rescue strategies [^1164AkLx]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

Progesterone elevation during the late follicular phase of ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization negatively impacts the assisted reproductive technology-outcome. The evidence available supports an advanced endometrial maturation and a direct negative effect on its receptivity. On the other hand, some retrospective analysis suggests an impairment of oocyte and embryo quality. Recent publications confirm that enhanced follicle-stimulating hormone-stimulation towards the end of the follicular phase of ovarian stimulation is the main course of progesterone elevation. A key element in preventing this event is the individualization of ovarian stimulation according to the patient's ovarian reserve and the adaption of the stimulation dosage during late follicular phase according to the patient's response. Additional measures as corticosteroid administration, avoidance of prolonged stimulation and cycle segmentation with freeze-all-policy can be discussed.

### Effects of acute estradiol and progesterone on perimenstrual exacerbation of suicidal ideation and related symptoms: a crossover randomized controlled trial [^115Kj8As]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Condition and cycle phase coding

See Fig. 1 for a visual depiction of experimental design, including laboratory visit scheduling, cycle phase coding, and a detailed explanation of experimental conditions. Days relative to positive luteinizing hormone test (LH+0) were coded such that day LH+1 corresponded to the day of ovulation, and so forth. Days relative to menses onset (MO + 0) were coded such that day the day before the onset of menses corresponded to day MO-1, and the second day of menstrual bleeding corresponded to MO+1. An experimental interval was defined as the 23 days starting the day after ovulation (LH+2, where LH+0 is the day of the positive urine LH surge test with a sensitivity of 40 mIU/ml) through the fourth day after stopping medication (LH+24, where the last day ON medication is LH 20). Each experimental interval day was coded for condition (0 = PBO or 1 = EP). Because we wanted experimental cycle phase (i.e. time) to have shared hormonal meaning between and within individuals despite natural variation in luteal phase lengths, we used both days relative to positive LH test and days relative to menses onset to code each experimental interval day as belonging to one of the following experimental cycle phases (see Fig. 1). First, the pre-medication early luteal phase was coded as days LH+2 through LH+6; in the normal cycle, these days generally correspond to rising E2 and P4. Second, the experimental midluteal phase was coded as the days from the start of medication (LH+7) through day MO-4; these days generally correspond to high/stable E2 and P4. Third, the experimental perimenstrual phase was coded as days −3, −2, −1, 0, and 1 relative to menses onset (day 1); these days generally correspond to the steep E2 and P4 withdrawal that triggers the onset of menses. Fourth, the experimental early follicular phase was coded as the days from day 2 following menses onset (MO+2) through the final day of medication (LH+20); these days generally represent low E2 and P4. Fifth, and finally, the medication withdrawal days of the post-medication late follicular phase (phase = 5) were coded as the first day off study medication through the end of the experimental interval (LH+21 to LH+24); in the normal cycle, these days generally represent higher and rapidly rising E2. Thus, each phase was coded to best preserve its hormonal meaning; most importantly, the five-day perimenstrual phase, which occurred fully within the 2 weeks of medication administration in all cases, corresponded to endogenous steroid withdrawal across all experimental intervals.

### Mifepristone [^11497sX3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY

Mifepristone is a potent antagonist of progesterone and cortisol via the progesterone and glucocorticoid (GR-II) receptors, respectively. The antiprogestational effects will result in the termination of pregnancy. Pregnancy must therefore be excluded before the initiation of treatment with mifepristone and prevented during treatment and for one month after stopping treatment by the use of a non-hormonal medically acceptable method of contraception unless the patient has had a surgical sterilization, in which case no additional contraception is needed. Pregnancy must also be excluded if treatment is interrupted for more than 14 days in females of reproductive potential.

WARNING: TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Mifepristone has potent antiprogestational effects and will result in the termination of pregnancy. Pregnancy must therefore be excluded before the initiation of treatment with mifepristone, or if treatment is interrupted for more than 14 days in females of reproductive potential.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111FNApr]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) — hormone therapy dosing, timelines, and discontinuation guidance — Compared with placebo, estrogen therapy (ET) alone or estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) reduced weekly symptom frequency by 75% (95% CI, 64.3–82.3). Lower-dose regimens — oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) 0.3 mg, oral 17β-estradiol ≤ 0.5 mg, or an estradiol patch 0.025 mg — may take 6 to 8 weeks to provide adequate symptom relief. The lowest dose-approved estradiol weekly patch (0.014 mg/d) appears effective for VMS but is FDA approved only for prevention of osteoporosis. Progestogen-only options reported effective for VMS include medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 10 mg, oral megestrol acetate 20 mg, and micronized progesterone (MP) 300 mg. VMS return in approximately 50% of women after hormone therapy is discontinued, and there is no consistent evidence that gradual tapering is superior to abrupt stopping.

### Trial protocol OPPTIMUM – does progesterone prophylaxis for the prevention of preterm labour improve outcome? [^114kUrWm]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Childhood outcome

The primary childhood outcome is the Bayley III score, a continuous measure. This outcome will, by definition, not be available on babies who have died. Thus deaths need to be incorporated into the analysis, since the number of deaths may be sufficiently large as not to be negligible, and/or there may be a difference in the number of deaths between the two randomised groups. We will therefore use a two-stage statistical model that jointly models the treatment effect in both deaths and survivors, with deaths modelled using a binomial test and survivors modelled using a generalised linear model. The two parts are then combined to form the appropriate test statistic. Secondary analyses that adjust the estimated treatment effect for covariates felt to be of importance will be used as appropriate. Note that we will not be adjusting for gestational age in our analysis of childhood outcomes. The hypothesised mechanism of action of progesterone is to increase gestational age by reducing the proportion of women giving birth prematurely. To adjust for a post randomisation covariate (gestational age) which is a direct measure of the treatment effect, in a model that is estimating the consequence of that treatment effect (in terms of developmental outcome) is not statistically sound.

A fully detailed Statistical Analysis Plan will be prepared prior to unblinding.

Planned subgroup analyses

In order to determine whether a reduced or improved response to progesterone can be predicted, subgroups of the ITT population will be formed according to the following factors:

- reason for risk of preterm delivery (spontaneous preterm birth yes / no and any preterm birth yes / no)

- previous pregnancy of at least 14 weeks (yes / no)

- cervical length at 18–24 weeks gestation (≤ 25 mm / > 25 mm and ≤ 15 mm / > 15 mm)

- chorioamnionitis diagnosed on pathology (yes / no)

Ethical issues, including: Ethics committee approval

The study has been approved by the Scotland (A) Research Ethics Committee, reference number 08/MRE00/6.

Interim analyses and stopping rules

Interim unblinded analyses will be performed on safety, efficacy and possibly futility criteria for the purposes of review by the independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) only. Masking will be maintained and analysis of obstetric and neonatal outcomes will be deferred until conclusion of the two-year childhood assessments. Thus no interim analyses will be revealed to investigators, participants, or anyone other than the DMC members (and statistical advisors) until completion of the two-year childhood assessments.

### Successful pregnancy and live birth despite discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy at 3 weeks and 5 days of gestation following vitrified-warmed embryo transfer under a hormone replacement therapy cycle: a case report and literature review [^117TKatd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In freeze-thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycles, hormone replacement treatment (HRT) is crucial for implantation and pregnancy maintenance. HRT typically continues until the 10th week of pregnancy owing to a luteoplacental shift, although a definitive HRT regimen remains undetermined. We present the case of a woman who underwent FET during an HRT cycle and ceased HRT after a negative pregnancy test at 3 weeks and 5 days, who went on to deliver a healthy baby.

Case Presentation

A 30-year-old Japanese woman with primary infertility was scheduled for FET. Estrogen supplementation was initiated as part of the HRT cycle for endometrial preparation. After achieving an endometrial thickness of 8 mm, progesterone supplementation was commenced, and the transfer of a 4BB blastocyst occurred 5 days after initiating progesterone treatment. At a gestational age of 3 weeks and 5 days, her serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level was only 8.3 mIU/mL, leading to discontinuation of HRT due to the absence of pregnancy. However, at 6 weeks and 1 day, her serum hCG levels significantly rose to 9359 mIU/mL, prompting the resumption of HRT. Ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a gestational sac and cardiac activity in the uterus, and HRT was continued until the 10th week. Ultimately, she delivered a healthy female neonate vaginally, weighing 2601 g at 40 weeks and 6 days.

Conclusions

Progesterone supplementation is customary in FET with HRT cycles, although it has raised the possibility that there is demonstrating the potential for an ongoing pregnancy and resulting in a healthy baby under no progesterone replacement prior to the luteoplacental shift in this case. The duration and dosage of progesterone in luteal support for FET with HRT warrant further investigation.

### Early progesterone cessation after in vitro fertilization / intracytoplasmic sperm injection: a randomized, controlled trial [^1118i4Qt]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of stopping progesterone (P) support at week 5 versus week 8 on ongoing pregnancy rate after in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled trial.

Setting

University-affiliated infertility center.

Patient(S)

A total of 220 patients with intrauterine pregnancy demonstrated by transvaginal ultrasound after IVF/ICSI.

Intervention(S)

Luteal phase support with micronized vaginal P was suspended at week 5 or at week 8.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Ongoing pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, and number of bleeding episodes.

Result(S)

Progesterone levels were similar on the day of the first pregnancy ultrasound exam (149 ± 108 vs. 167 ± 115 ng/mL). Significantly more bleeding episodes were observed in the first trimester in the group with early cessation of P supplementation (18.0 ± 2.6 vs. 7.2 ± 1.3 episodes). Miscarriage rates among singleton pregnancies were similar in the two groups (5/80 vs. 6/79).

Conclusion(S)

Vaginal P supplementation after IVF/ICSI can be safely withdrawn at 5 weeks' gestation, because cycle outcome was similar to conventional luteal phase support up to 8 weeks of pregnancy.

Clinical Trial Registration Number

NCT01177904.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: emergency contraception [^1117aEDK]. Contraception (2023). High credibility.

Society of Family Planning — post–emergency contraception initiation of routine contraception and pregnancy testing: We recommend routine hormonal contraception be initiated as soon as desired following LNG ECP use, with abstinence or a nonhormonal contraceptive method used as back-up for seven days or until the next menstrual period/withdrawal bleed, whichever occurs first. Following UPA ECPs, we recommend generally delaying initiation of routine hormonal contraception for five days and abstinence or a nonhormonal contraceptive method used as back-up for an additional seven days or until the next menstrual period/withdrawal bleed, whichever occurs first, and the specific timing should be individualized through shared decision-making. We recommend against withholding or delaying ECPs for pregnancy testing, and we recommend offering urine pregnancy testing for post-EC pregnancy assessment as needed.

### Micronized vaginal progesterone to prevent miscarriage: a critical evaluation of randomized evidence [^111w7BdT]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Click Supplemental Materials under article title in Contents at

Progesterone is essential for the establishment and maintenance of a pregnancy. Withdrawal of progesterone in early pregnancy typically results in a miscarriage, and antiprogesterone drugs are powerful inducers of abortion. The central role of progesterone in early pregnancy led clinicians and researchers to hypothesize that progesterone deficiency could be a cause of some miscarriages. This hypothesis has resulted in numerous clinical trials of progesterone supplementation in women at high risk of miscarriage. The 2 groups of women at particular risk of miscarriage are those who have a history of recurrent miscarriage and those who are bleeding in early pregnancy. The first randomized trial in women with recurrent miscarriage was published in 1953, and 11 trials followed in the subsequent decades. The first trial in women with threatened miscarriage was published in 1987, and since then 7 further trials have been conducted. However, these trials used different progestogens and were small and methodologically weak, producing heterogenous and unreliable results. Policy makers have therefore been unable to make evidence-based recommendations on the use of progestogen supplementation to improve outcomes in these cohorts of women. For instance, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reviewed the evidence in 2015 and concluded that "For threatened early pregnancy loss, the use of progestins is controversial, and conclusive evidence supporting their use is lacking. Women who have experienced at least three prior pregnancy losses, however, may benefit from progesterone therapy in the first trimester". Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence concluded in 2012 that "a very large multicentre randomised controlled trial of women receiving treatment with either progesterone/progestogen or placebo for threatened miscarriage should be conducted". The PROMISE (PROgesterone in recurrent MIScarriagE) and PRISM (PRogesterone In Spontaneous Miscarriage) trials were conducted to generate robust evidence on the role of progesterone therapy to prevent miscarriage and increase the live birth rate.

In this review, we critically evaluate the results from the PROMISE and PRISM trials to assess what they add to our existing knowledge. We move beyond statistical inference to provide a full scientific inference by taking into account the context, biological rationale, biological gradient, external evidence, and consistency across the studies. We assess the evidence for key prespecified subgroup effects using robust guidelines. Finally, we provide our recommendations for clinical practice.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^117MgZyz]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — dose timing definitions and risk context: A dose is considered late when < 24 hours have elapsed since the dose should have been taken, and a dose is considered missed if ≥ 24 hours have elapsed since the dose should have been taken. For combined oral contraceptives (COCs), the recommendations only apply to late or missed hormonally active pills and not to placebo pills. Extending the hormone-free interval (e.g., missing hormonally active pills either directly before or after the placebo or pill-free intervals) is considered to be a particularly risky time to miss CHCs, and seven days of continuous CHC use is deemed necessary to reliably prevent ovulation. Recommendations are provided for late or missed pills (Figure 1), the patch (Figure 2), and the ring (Figure 3).

Although providing guidance to patients regarding duration of hormone therapy represents a topic surrounded by controversy, clinicians often encounter this issue in practice. As pointed out in the NAMS 2012 Hormone Therapy (HT) Position Statement, determining the optimal duration of HT is challenging both for clinicians and for patients. This Practice Pearl addresses clinical situations for which long-term HT might be appropriate and provides practical guidance regarding prudent therapeutic choices for women using HT for an extended duration.

### Reassessing preterm birth prevention after the withdrawal of 17-α hydroxyprogesterone caproate [^111TkQdF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently withdrawn approval for 17-α hydroxyprogesterone caproate for prevention of recurrent preterm birth, and recent studies have called into question benefits of the pessary in the setting of a short cervix. Obstetric health care professionals are once again left with limited remaining options for preterm birth prevention. This narrative review summarizes the best current evidence on the use of vaginal progesterone, low-dose aspirin, and cerclage for the prevention of preterm birth; attempts to distill possible lessons learned from studies of progesterone and pessary, as well as their implementation into practice; and highlights areas where inroads into preterm birth prevention may be possible outside of the progesterone-aspirin-cerclage paradigm.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^114V2e71]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — counseling and management of bleeding irregularities emphasize that bleeding changes generally decrease with continued CHC use. If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition and, if found, treat the condition or refer for care. If the patient wants treatment, advise the patient to discontinue CHC use (i.e., a hormone-free interval) for 3–4 consecutive days; a hormone-free interval is not recommended during the first 21 days of using the continuous or extended CHC method, and a hormone-free interval is not recommended more than once per month because contraceptive effectiveness might be reduced. During contraceptive counseling and before initiating extended or continuous CHCs, information about common side effects such as spotting or bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed; these bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome and usually improve with persistent use of the hormonal method, and counseling should emphasize the importance of correct use and timing and, for users of contraceptive pills, consistent pill use.

Figure 5 — recommended actions after late or missed progestin-only pills (POP): For norethindrone or norgestrel POPs, if one hormonal pill is missed (> 3 hours since a pill should have been taken), take one pill as soon as possible and continue taking pills daily, one each day, at the same time each day, even if it means taking two pills on the same day; abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) until pills have been taken correctly, on time, for 2 consecutive days; emergency contraception should be considered (with the exception of ulipristal acetate [UPA]) if the patient has had unprotected sexual intercourse. For drospirenone (DRSP) POPs, if one hormonal pill is late or missed (< 48 hours since a pill should have been taken), take the late or missed pill as soon as possible and continue taking one pill a day until the pack is finished; no additional contraceptive protection is needed. If two or more consecutive hormonal pills have been missed (≥ 48 hours since a pill should have been taken), take the last missed pill as soon as possible and continue taking one pill a day until the pack is finished (one or more missed pills will remain in the pack); abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) until hormonal pills have been taken for 7 consecutive days; emergency contraception should be considered (with the exception of UPA) if hormonal pills were missed during the first week and unprotected sexual intercourse occurred during the previous 5 days, and may also be considered (with the exception of UPA) at other times as appropriate.

### Successful pregnancy and live birth despite discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy at 3 weeks and 5 days of gestation following vitrified-warmed embryo transfer under a hormone replacement therapy cycle: a case report and literature review [^1128zbJk]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

In the present case, despite the discontinuation of HRT at 3w5d into the HRT cycle, which is thought to be disadvantageous to CL formation, the pregnancy continued and resulted in successful delivery. To our knowledge, this is a rare report showing that placental steroid hormone production at approximately 4 weeks of gestation can support implantation and invasion on the maternal side.

In FET treatment during the HRT cycle, providing adequate hormonal support is crucial, given the absence of the CL. Typically, in the HRT cycle, it is essential to maintain the continuous administration of both estradiol and progesterone until the luteoplacental shift, which typically occurs around the 10th week of gestation. Furthermore, in the HRT cycle, progesterone supplementation should align with the increased progesterone production observed during the early stages of pregnancy under the influence of hCG, similar to the NC. However, the progesterone preparations approved for use in ART do not contain specific formulations tailored to FET protocols. Consequently, the appropriate dose, duration of progesterone supplementation, and preferred route of administration remain topics of ongoing debate.

The appropriate dosage of luteal replacement in the HRT cycle remains debatable. Some studies have suggested that progesterone supplementation should be increased to match the rising progesterone levels observed during the early weeks of pregnancy, similar to the NC. This is because low serum progesterone levels on the day of ET are associated with reduced ART success rates; however, conflicting findings have been reported in the literature. For example, Yarali et al. reported that women with serum progesterone levels below 8.75 ng/mL on day 5 of vaginal progesterone administration in FET cycles were not significantly rescued by a daily bolus of 25 mg subcutaneous progesterone, and this did not result in an improvement in ongoing pregnancy rates compared to the non-rescue groups. Additionally, Alvarez et al. reported that daily subcutaneous progesterone injections in cases with inadequate P 4 levels the day before euploid FET (P 4 < 10.6 ng/ml) did not lead to improved ongoing pregnancy rates or reduced miscarriage rates.

### Cyclical progestogens for heavy menstrual bleeding [^113qwG3Q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Excessively heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) or menorrhagia is an important cause of ill health in women. Eighty per cent of women treated for HMB have no anatomical pathology, which makes medical therapy, with the avoidance of possibly unnecessary surgery, an attractive alternative. Of the wide variety of medications used to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding, oral progestogens are the most commonly prescribed. This review assesses the effectiveness of two different regimens of oral progestogens in reducing ovulatory HMB.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of oral progestogen therapy taken either during the luteal phase or for a longer course of 21 days in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss in women of reproductive years with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched April 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2007) and EMBASE (1985 to April 2007). Attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of review articles. In most cases, the first author of each included trial was contacted.

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of oral progestogen therapy versus placebo or other medical treatments in women of reproductive years with regular heavy periods measured either objectively or subjectively and with no pathological or iatrogenic causes for their heavy menstrual blood loss.

Data Collection and Analysis

Seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The review authors extracted the data independently. Odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes were estimated from the data.

Main Results

No RCTs comparing progestogen treatment with placebo were identified. Comparisons between oral progestogens and other medical therapies were assessed separately according to dosage regimen. Progestogen therapy during the luteal phase was significantly less effective at reducing menstrual blood loss when compared with tranexamic acid, danazol and the progesterone-releasing intrauterine system (IUS). Duration of menstruation was significantly longer with the progesterone IUS when compared with oral progestogen therapy but significantly shorter with danazol treatment. Adverse events were significantly more likely with danazol when compared with progestogen treatment. Progestogen therapy from day 5 to day 26 of the menstrual cycle was significantly less effective at reducing menstrual blood loss than the IUS. A significantly higher proportion of norethisterone (NET) patients taking progestogens found their treatment unacceptable compared to IUS patients. However, the adverse effects of breast tenderness and intermenstrual bleeding were more likely in women with the IUS.

Authors' Conclusions

Progestogens administered from day 15 or 19 to day 26 of the cycle offer no advantage over other medical therapies such as danazol, tranexamic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the IUS in the treatment of menorrhagia in women with ovulatory cycles. Progestogen therapy for 21 days of the cycle results in a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss, although women found the treatment less acceptable than intrauterine levonorgestrel. This regimen of progestogen may have a role in the short-term treatment of menorrhagia.

### Progestogen for preventing miscarriage in women with recurrent miscarriage of unclear etiology [^115pHjR9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Progesterone, a female sex hormone, is known to induce secretory changes in the lining of the uterus essential for successful implantation of a fertilized egg. It has been suggested that a causative factor in many cases of miscarriage may be inadequate secretion of progesterone. Therefore, clinicians use progestogens (drugs that interact with the progesterone receptors), beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous miscarriage. This is an update of a review, last published in 2013. Since publication of the 2018 update of this review, we have been advised that the Ismail 2017 study is currently the subject of an investigation by the Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine. We have now moved this study from 'included studies' to 'Characteristics of studies awaiting classification' until the outcome of the investigation is known.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of progestogens as a preventative therapy against recurrent miscarriage.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (6 July 2017) and reference lists from relevant articles, attempting to contact trial authors where necessary, and contacted experts in the field for unpublished works.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing progestogens with placebo or no treatment given in an effort to prevent miscarriage.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Twelve trials (1,856 women) met the inclusion criteria. Eight of the included trials compared treatment with placebo and the remaining four trials compared progestogen administration with no treatment. The trials were a mix of multicenter and single-center trials, conducted in India, Jordan, UK and USA. In five trials women had had three or more consecutive miscarriages and in seven trials women had suffered two or more consecutive miscarriages. Routes, dosage and duration of progestogen treatment varied across the trials. The majority of trials were at low risk of bias for most domains. Ten trials (1684 women) contributed data to the analyses. The meta-analysis of all women, suggests that there may be a reduction in the number of miscarriages for women given progestogen supplementation compared to placebo/controls (average risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.00, 10 trials, 1684 women, moderate-quality evidence). A subgroup analysis comparing placebo-controlled versus non-placebo-controlled trials, trials of women with three or more prior miscarriages compared to women with two or more miscarriages and different routes of administration showed no clear differences between subgroups for miscarriage. None of the trials reported on any secondary maternal outcomes, including severity of morning sickness, thromboembolic events, depression, admission to a special care unit, or subsequent fertility. There was probably a slight benefit for women receiving progestogen seen in the outcome of live birth rate (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13, 6 trials, 1411 women, moderate-quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effect on the rate of preterm birth because the evidence is very low-quality (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.41, 4 trials, 256 women, very low-quality evidence). No clear differences were seen for women receiving progestogen for the other secondary outcomes including neonatal death, fetal genital abnormalities or stillbirth. There may be little or no difference in the rate of low birthweight and trials did not report on the secondary child outcomes of teratogenic effects or admission to a special care unit.

Authors' Conclusions

For women with unexplained recurrent miscarriages, supplementation with progestogen therapy may reduce the rate of miscarriage in subsequent pregnancies.

### Progesterone for premenstrual syndrome [^115GGqqq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

About 5% of women experience severe symptoms called premenstrual syndrome (PMS), only in the two weeks before their menstrual periods. Treatment with progesterone may restore a deficiency, balance menstrual hormone levels or reduce effects of falling progesterone levels on the brain or on electrolytes in the blood.

Objectives

The objectives were to determine if progesterone has been found to be an effective treatment for all or some premenstrual symptoms and if adverse events associated with this treatment have been reported.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO to February 2011. We contacted pharmaceutical companies for information about unpublished trials, for the first version of this review. The search strings are in Appendix 2.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of progesterone on women with PMS diagnosed by at least two prospective cycles, without current psychiatric disorder.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (BM and OF) extracted data independently and decided which trials to include. OF wrote to trial investigators for missing data.

Main Results

From 17 studies, only two met our inclusion criteria. Together they had 280 participants aged between 18 and 45 years. One hundred and fifteen yielded analysable results. Both studies measured symptom severity using subjective scales. Differing in design, participants, dose of progesterone and how delivered, the studies could not be combined in meta-analysis. Adverse events which may or may not have been side effects of the treatment were described as mild. Both trials had defects. They intended to exclude women whose symptoms continued after their periods. When data from ineligible women were excluded from analysis in one trial, the other women were found to have benefited more from progesterone than placebo. The smaller study found no statistically significant difference between oral progesterone, vaginally absorbed progesterone and placebo, but reported outcomes incompletely.

Authors' Conclusions

The trials did not show that progesterone is an effective treatment for PMS nor that it is not. Neither trial distinguished a subgroup of women who benefited, nor examined claimed success with high doses.

### Progesterone in women with arrested premature labor, a report of a randomised clinical trial and updated meta-analysis [^115VMf7t]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Still, alternative explanations should be considered for the negative results of both our trial and the meta-analysis. One typical issue, low power, is not one we feel is likely. Although latency to delivery is not necessarily, by itself, a clinically important endpoint, it should be a sensitive indicator of biologic effect. That we observe no discernible effect on latency in our trial and the summary of the high quality trials support a conclusion that progesterone is ineffective. It does remain a possibility that an effective progesterone dose has yet to be determined and future trials of increased doses may show positive results. Unfortunately, although our review found a fair number of studies that used higher doses of both vaginal and intra-muscular progesterone, none of these was high quality trial. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov only identified one additional, terminated, and unreported trial that used 400 mg vaginal progesterone which recruited 7 subjects (NCT00946088). Poor patient compliance is also a potential explanation for our results. Regrettably, in our study, we were unable to reliably comment on compliance, as too few subjects returned their pill diaries or unused medications. This did not seem to be unique to our trial as very few of the studies reported any measures of patient compliance. While in the case of treatment with intra-muscular 17-hydroxyprogesterone caporate, poor compliance may be evident to the investigators, the same cannot be said of vaginal or oral routes.

### An overview of menopausal oestrogen-progestin hormone therapy and breast cancer risk [^1143uh8p]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

For cohort studies, the true duration of EPT use is underestimated in current hormone users. This is because EPT use is assessed at baseline but continues for an unknown proportion of individuals for at least some further period until censoring time. Therefore, an additional duration of use should be added for current hormone users in the cohort studies considered. For example, in the cohort study of, they reported OR's of 1.11 and 1.76 for < 5 and ⩾5 years of EPT use. We considered these categories as referring to 2.5 and 7.5 years of EPT use. Using these duration figures, we estimated OR 1 as 1.079. But the ORs of 1.11 and 1.76 do not relate to 2.5 and 7.5 years of use, but to this amount of use plus the mean duration of use after recruitment to the study until the end of follow-up. The mean length of follow-up in this study was 5.9 years and assuming that current users of EPT remained users during follow-up, this changes the values to be used in estimating OR 1 from 2.5 and 7.5 years to 5.45 (2.5 plus the midpoint of the average follow-up, i.e. 5.9/2 or the average exposure during follow-up) and 10.45 (7.5 + 5.9/2) years, respectively. This changes our estimate of OR 1 from 1.079 to 1.052, a 34% decline in our estimate of excess risk. This is, of course, a slight exaggeration of the change since some current users at baseline will stop use during follow-up. For all cohort studies included in the analysis, we calculated risk per year of use based on this conservative method. We applied this method to all prospective studies reporting risk for current EPT use except for the study by, in which this adjustment had already been applied.

Risk estimates reported in the study bywere converted to risks per year of use since the OR 1 s reported in the study excluded never users of EPT. This was done in order for these estimates to be comparable to the relative risks reported in the other studies.

### Effects of acute estradiol and progesterone on perimenstrual exacerbation of suicidal ideation and related symptoms: a crossover randomized controlled trial [^111nv8Cx]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Female suicide attempts peak peri-menstrually-around the onset of menses-when the ovarian steroids estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) fall rapidly. Given preclinical evidence that withdrawal from either E2 or P4 can provoke behaviors consistent with elevated suicide risk, we hypothesized that withdrawal from one or both of these steroids contributes to perimenstrual exacerbation of suicidal ideation (SI) and related symptoms. In a randomized, controlled, double-blind crossover experiment (NCT03720847), a transdiagnostic sample of naturally cycling, medically healthy psychiatric outpatients reporting past-month SI completed two conditions during two different 14-day experimental intervals (days 7–20 where the luteinizing hormone surge = day 0), separated by a monthlong washout cycle. In the E2 and P4 (EP) condition, participants received transdermal E2 (0.1mg/day) plus oral micronized P4 (200mg/day as 100mg twice daily) to buffer perimenstrual steroid withdrawal. A matched placebo (PBO) condition allowed natural perimenstrual steroid withdrawal. Participants reported daily SI and planning (primary outcomes) and indices of depression (low mood, hopelessness), threat sensitivity (anxiety, perceived stress), executive functioning (difficulty concentrating, impulsivity), and social cognitive bias (rejection sensitivity, perceived burdensomeness). In baseline cycles, no participant met prospective criteria for DSM-5 premenstrual dysphoric disorder, but 59% met all criteria except full follicular symptom remission, and 93% showed the highest SI in the perimenstrual phase. Of 29 randomized, 28 were analyzed (14 EP-PBO, 14 PBO-EP). Experimental administration of E2 and P4 (relative to PBO) reduced perimenstrual exacerbation of SI, suicide planning, depression, hopelessness, perceived stress, rejection sensitivity, and perceived burdensomeness, particularly in the perimenstrual (natural E2 and P4 withdrawal) days. Further, delayed withdrawal from experimental E2 and P4 (but not PBO) recapitulated SI, hopelessness, and rejection sensitivity. Acute perimenstrual withdrawal from ovarian steroids may play a causal role in perimenstrual worsening of depression and SI.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for amenorrhea, more specifically with respect to evaluation of PCOS, screening for endometrial cancer, RCOG 2014 guidelines recommend to recognize that oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea may predispose to endometrial hyperplasia and later carcinoma in patients with PCOS. Consider offering progesterone to induce withdrawal bleeding at least every 3–4 months.

Vaginal estradiol tablets — endometrial monitoring considerations: Estradiol tablets, when placed in the upper third of the vagina, may result in a uterine first-pass effect resulting in a higher degree of uterine stimulation. It is unknown whether endometrial proliferation, hyperplasia, or cancer can occur after long-duration treatment (> 1 y) or in women with risk factors (late menopause, higher body mass index, higher dosing). For women at higher risk of endometrial cancer, surveillance using transvaginal ultrasound, followed by endometrial biopsy if endometrial thickening is present, may be prudent. Intermittent (possibly annual) progestogen withdrawal may be considered to assess endometrial status.

WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy

The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the "global index". The absolute excess risk of events in the "global index" was 19 per 10,000 women-years.

For those outcomes included in the WHI "global index" that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reductions per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures.

Results of the estrogen plus progestin substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White, 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other) are presented in Table 5. These results reflect centrally adjudicated data after an average follow-up of 5.6 years.

Timing of the initiation of estrogen plus progestin therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile. The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified for age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a non-significant trend toward reducing risk of overall mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44–1.07)].

### Use of exogenous gonadotropins for ovulation induction in anovulatory women: a committee opinion [^113fzJzv]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Gonadotropin regimens for ovulation induction in PCOS should therefore only be used by clinicians having the requisite training and experience, with the goal to promote the growth and development of a single mature follicle; women with PCOS may begin after a menses induced by brief exogenous progestin, though progestin withdrawal bleed may decrease pregnancy rates, and baseline ultrasonography should be performed to exclude ovarian cysts; exogenous FSH alone can induce ovulation in PCOS and there is no significant advantage to using any specific gonadotropin preparation, with outcomes similar for human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) versus FSH alone and for recombinant versus urinary FSH; the first dose-finding cycle typically uses 37.5–75 IU/day with small increments after 7 days or more if no follicle ≥ 10 mm has developed, 7–12 total treatment days are typical though longer may be required, and once a mature follicle has developed, exogenous hCG is administered to stimulate ovulation.

### Progestogen for preventing miscarriage in women with recurrent miscarriage of unclear etiology [^113BDMCw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Progesterone, a female sex hormone, is known to induce secretory changes in the lining of the uterus essential for successful implantation of a fertilized egg. Miscarriage is an early pregnancy loss. For women who have recurrent miscarriage, it has been suggested that a causative factor may be inadequate secretion of progesterone. Therefore, clinicians sometimes use progestogens (drugs that interact with the progesterone receptors), beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous miscarriage. It is important to understand if this is beneficial or harmful. This is an update of the review, last published in 2019. Previous versions included two trials that have since been retracted. This update included an updated trial search and evaluation of all trials using the Cochrane Trustworthiness Screening Tool.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of progestogens as a preventative therapy against recurrent miscarriage.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (July 2024). We also searched reference lists from relevant articles, attempted to contact trial authors where necessary, and contacted experts in the field for unpublished works.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials in pregnant participants comparing progestogens with placebo or no treatment, given in an effort to prevent miscarriage. We included trials of participants who were diagnosed with recurrent miscarriage (usually of unknown origin) and who began treatment with progestogens in the first trimester of pregnancy. We excluded trials treating participants with threatened miscarriage or who had conceived by in-vitro fertilization.

Outcomes

The critical outcome was miscarriage. The main important outcomes were live birth rate and preterm birth (< 37 weeks' gestation). Other important outcomes were neonatal death, fetal genital abnormalities, stillbirth, low birthweight (< 2500 g), maternal adverse events and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Other maternal outcomes of interest were severity of 'morning sickness', thromboembolic events, depression, admission to special care unit and subsequent fertility.

Risk Of Bias

Two review authors assessed the studies using the RoB 1 tool for selection, performance, detection, attrition, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias.

Synthesis Methods

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two reviewers assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We utilized a random-effects model to synthesize the results.

Included Studies

Nine trials with 1426 randomized participants met the inclusion criteria. Eight trials included analyzable data for 1276 participants. Overall, the risk of bias was low for six trials, while three had areas of concern. Because few studies reported on important outcomes, imprecision was high for those outcomes, limiting the certainty of those analyses.

Synthesis Of Results

Seven of the included trials compared treatment with placebo and the other two compared progestogen administration with no treatment. The trials were a mix of multicenter and single-center trials, conducted in Jordan, the UK, the Netherlands, and the United States. In three trials, participants had three or more consecutive miscarriages and in six trials, participants had two or more consecutive miscarriages. Route, dosage and duration of progestogen treatment varied across the trials. The majority of trials were at low risk of bias for most domains. Eight trials with 1276 participants contributed data to the analyses. Meta-analysis suggests that there is probably little to no difference in the miscarriage rate for women given progestogen supplementation compared to placebo or no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.07; I² = 0%; 8 studies, 1276 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses comparing placebo-controlled versus non-placebo-controlled trials, trials of participants with three or more prior miscarriages compared to women with two or more miscarriages, and different routes of administration showed no clear differences between subgroups for miscarriage. For women with recurrent miscarriage of unclear etiology receiving progestogen, there was probably little to no difference in live birth rate compared to placebo (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.12; 5 trials, 1063 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect on the rate of preterm birth; there was probably little to no difference (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.41; 3 trials, 256 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No clear differences were seen for women receiving progestogen for the other important outcomes, including neonatal death, fetal genital abnormalities, or stillbirth. There was little or no data on other important outcomes of low birth weight, maternal adverse events, teratogenic effects, or admission to a special care unit. None of the trials reported on any other important maternal outcomes, including severity of morning sickness, thromboembolic events, depression, admission to a special care unit, or subsequent fertility.

Authors' Conclusions

For women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage, progestogen supplementation therapy probably results in little to no effect on outcomes in subsequent pregnancies.

### Discontinuation of postmenopausal hormone therapy [^114QXaeo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend that postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) be used primarily for treatment of vasomotor and urogenital symptoms associated with the menopausal transition and that women use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time necessary. Vasomotor symptoms improve or resolve spontaneously within a few months to a few years of onset in the majority of women, suggesting that most women should be able to discontinue HT within a few years of starting treatment. Approximately 75% of women who try to stop are able to stop HT without major difficulty. However, some women who would like to stop HT are unable to do so, mainly owing to the development of vasomotor symptoms. Troublesome symptoms associated with stopping HT appear to be more common among women who start HT for treatment of symptoms, but they also are reported by women who started HT for other reasons, such as prevention of osteoporosis. Unfortunately, little information is available to guide physicians in helping women who have difficulty stopping HT. Many clinicians recommend slowly tapering HT or adding another drug for treatment of hot flashes, but the effectiveness of these approaches has not been evaluated. For women who cannot tolerate even a slow taper, the value of symptom relief likely outweighs any increased risks due to HT use.

### Pregnancy postponement and childlessness leads to chronic hypervascularity of the breasts and cancer risk [^112Z3AyA]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Each subject self-studied both breasts daily for one menstrual cycle so as to obtain the average of 28×2 daily readings, depending on the length of her particular cycle. The average from the right and left breast for each individual was also averaged so the data for each subject was truncated into one datum. The subjects were asked to commence daily Chronobra measurements when their menses had stopped and to continue until the next menses had stopped. Cycle lengths averaged 28.4 days with a range of 23–36 days. All the data were fitted to a notional 28 days by the following procedure. The daily progesterone concentration in saliva enabled the peak of the luteal phase to be identified. From the literature we deduced that on the average 28-day cycle this peak occurred on day 23 (see also). For each individual this calendar date was called 'day 23', and the phasing was obtained by counting up to 28 and down to 21 from this point. For those with a cycle longer than 28 days, e.g. 36 days, the initial 8 days of breast temperature of the cycle were omitted from the calculation of the menstrual average. For those with a short cycle, e.g. 23 days, there was a 'wrap around' from the beginning of the next cycle to fill up the missing 5 days to obtain the 28-day average. The appropriateness and effect of these procedures can be gauged from Figure 1

Figure 1
50 women of reproductive age and parity 0–5. Each subject's menstrual cycle of data represented. Right and left breast temperature averaged for each daily reading. The 50 daily readings are here subjected to a 3-day smooth with one standard error. The graphed daily points therefore represent 50×3 readings. Complementary saliva progesterone concentrations estimated daily are also given. Note that the breast core-temperatures and the progesterone values rise progressively from ovulation, but whereas breast core-temperatures peak on day 23 of a notional 28-day menstrual cycle, the breast core-temperature is maximum at the start of the menses. The synchronisation of the menstrual cycle across the subjects into a notional 28-day cycle is discussed in Methods.

What is progesterone capsules?

Progesterone capsules contain the female hormone called progesterone.

What is progesterone capsules used for?

Treatment of Menstrual Irregularities

Progesterone capsules are used for the treatment of secondary amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods in women who have previously had a menstrual period) due to a decrease in progesterone. When you do not produce enough progesterone, menstrual irregularities can occur. If your healthcare provider has determined your body does not produce enough progesterone on its own, progesterone capsules may be prescribed to provide the progesterone you need.

Protection of the Endometrium (Lining of the Uterus)

Progesterone capsules are used in combination with estrogen-containing medications in a postmenopausal woman with a uterus (womb). Taking estrogen-alone increases the chance of developing a condition called endometrial hyperplasia that may lead to cancer of the lining of the uterus (womb). The addition of a progestin is generally recommended for a woman with a uterus to reduce the chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb).

### Continuation of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy: comparison of cyclic versus continuous combined schedules [^114cyS7a]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

Discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is much more common than what is reported in randomized, double-blind clinical trials. Our purpose in this retrospective study, using a prescription database, was to compare the continuation rate among women who took cyclic combination therapy adding progesterone to estrogen (CYC-PERT) or continuous combined estrogen progestin therapy (CC-PERT). The study subjects were 1,532 women, ≥ 45 years old, who initially filled index prescriptions for 0.625mg conjugated estrogens. They were divided into two groups (CYC-PERT = 644, CC-PERT = 888) on the basis of coprescribed medroxyprogesterone. We found that for all women initiating therapy, 35–40% did not return for a refill and 76–81% stopped therapy within 3 years. Those prescribed CC-PERT initially were more likely to stop than those prescribed CYC-PERT (rate ratio [RR] = 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06–1.35). Adjustments for age, year of starting medication, cost of medication, and prescriber specialty did not affect the difference in discontinuation between the two regimens (RR 1.18, 95% CI = 1.04–1.34). We conclude that the likelihood of women continuing HRT beyond 3 years of initiation is low. Furthermore, compared with CYC-PERT users, those receiving CC-PERT have a slightly higher probability of discontinuation. Efforts should be made to understand why three quarters of women beginning HRT will stop it long before it can provide major long-term benefit.

DRSP has a half-life of approximately 30 hours with near-complete elimination by 10 days. For patients who frequently miss DRSP POPs, the text advises to explore patient goals, consider offering counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.

Results

Characteristics of included studies

For the main search, we identified 1284 references through database and grey literature searches. We removed 337 duplicates and screened 947 references. Of these, we excluded 932 irrelevant references based on title and abstract screening and selected 15 for full-text screening. We excluded 11, which were the wrong study design (primarily commentaries) and included a total of four studies in the review (see figure 1, PRISMA flow diagram). In the secondary search, we screened 443 references and did not find any new studies that reported on continuing pregnancies after use of mifepristone alone.

Figure 1
Summary of study selection process for inclusion in the systematic review of ongoing pregnancies after mifepristone and either treatment with progesterone (main search) or expectant management (secondary search).

We included four studies from our main search in this review. Three studies were case series and did not have comparison groups. Of these, only one had been included in the 2015 systematic review of abortion reversal. The fourth study is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the included studies.

Table 1
Characteristics of studies included in a systematic review of abortion reversal

The first study was a case series of seven patients who took mifepristone for medication abortion and then changed their mind and attempted reversal with progesterone. Their gestational ages ranged from 7 to 11 weeks and the treatment with progesterone was started at 7–72 hours after mifepristone ingestion. Progesterone regimens varied (see table 2 for details). Timing of progesterone initiation also varied. Although the article included few details, it appears that gestational cardiac activity was documented on ultrasound prior to initiating progesterone in at least five of the cases. Pregnancy outcomes were available for six of the seven patients and were assessed via patient history. One patient was lost to follow-up. The study did not report on any of our predetermined secondary outcomes.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115RdAq5]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Dosing of systemic estrogen therapy (ET) and progestogen — The therapeutic goal should be to use the most appropriate, often lowest, effective dose of systemic ET consistent with treatment goals, and the appropriate dose of progestogen is added to provide endometrial protection if a woman has a uterus, unless CEE is combined with BZA. Progestogen dosing-regimen options that provide for endometrial safety are dependent on the potency of the progestogen and vary with the estrogen dose, and different types and doses of progestogens, routes of administration, and types of regimen (sequential or continuous-combined) may have different associations with health outcomes; patient preference can and should be considered because many women will opt for regimens that avoid periodic menstrual bleeding.

### Hormone therapy in postmenopausal women and risk of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer [^11414ULv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Reduced circulating estrogen levels around the time of menopause can induce symptoms that affect health and well-being. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment, but may be associated with some adverse health outcomes, including endometrial pathology. This is an update of a review first published in 1999 and last updated in 2012.

Objectives

- To assess the effects of hormone therapy regimens for protecting postmenopausal women against endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer.
- To define the lowest effective dose(s) of progestogen used in combination with estrogen therapy for protecting the endometrium.

Search Methods

We searched for trials in the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group specialized register, CENTRAL (containing output from two trial registers and CINAHL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 22 July 2024. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Eligibility Criteria

Interventions of interest were unopposed estrogen, continuous combined estrogen and progestogen, and sequential combined estrogen and progestogen, administered for at least one year. These interventions could be compared head to head or with placebo. Trials had to report rates of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer (histologic diagnosis).

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes were endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer at one year and after one year. Our important outcomes were adherence to therapy, requirement for additional interventions, and withdrawal due to adverse events.

Risk Of Bias

We used the original Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1).

Synthesis Methods

Where meta-analysis was possible, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Included Studies

This update included 72 studies (involving 40,652 women) conducted worldwide. There were 42 multicenter trials.

Synthesis Of Results

There were too few studies with events to draw conclusions about endometrial cancer. The results for endometrial hyperplasia are presented below. Unopposed estrogen versus placebo Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with placebo (22–43 events/1000 women versus 5 events/1000 women; OR 5.86, 95% CI 4.09 to 8.40; I² = 0%; 6 RCTs, 2493 women; moderate-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia after one year (40–68 events/1000 women versus 6 events/1000 women; OR 8.97, 95% CI 6.78 to 11.87; I² = 49%; 9 RCTs, 2539 women; moderate-certainty-evidence). Continuous combined estrogen plus progestogen versus placebo Continuous combined therapy may have little to no effect on the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with placebo (0–16 events/1000 women versus 5 events/1000 women; OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.08 to 3.38; I² = 48%; 4 RCTs, 3893 women; low-certainty-evidence). We are unsure about the effect of continuous combined therapy after one year (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.40; I² = 47%; 4 RCTs, 789 women; very low-certainty evidence). Sequential combined estrogen plus progestogen versus placebo Sequential combined therapy may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with placebo (6–27 events/1000 women versus 2 events/1000 women; OR 5.53, 95% CI 2.60 to 11.76; I² = 0%; 4 RCTs, 1030 women; low-certainty-evidence). Sequential combined therapy may result in little to no difference in the risk of endometrial hyperplasia after one year (16–97 events/1000 women versus 20 events/1000 women; OR 2.30, 95% CI 0.76 to 6.99; I² = 0%; 3 RCTs, 534 women; low-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen versus continuous combined estrogen plus progestogen Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with continuous combined therapy (46–75 events/1000 women versus 3 events /1000 women; OR 21.90, 95% CI 16.76 to 28.62; I² = 53%; 11 RCTs, 7856 women; moderate-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia after one year compared with continuous combined therapy (33–73 events/1000 women versus 3 events/1000 women; OR 16.78, 95% CI 11.01 to 25.55; I² = 69%; 3 RCTs, 1191 women; moderate-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen versus sequential combined estrogen plus progestogen Unopposed estrogen may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with sequential combined therapy (156–301 events/1000 women versus 16 events/1000 women; OR 17.19, 95% CI 11.27 to 26.22; I² = 70%; 5 RCTs, 2354 women; low-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia after one year compared with sequential combined treatment (379–612 events/1000 women versus 49 events/1000 women; OR 19.21, 95% CI 11.95 to 30.90; I² = 15%; 2 RCTs, 417 women; low-certainty-evidence). Continuous combined estrogen plus progestogen versus sequential combined estrogen plus progestogen All analyses had insufficient events to draw conclusions. Continuous combined estrogen plus progestogen - dose comparisons We are unsure about the effect of moderate-dose estrogen plus low-dose progestogen compared with moderate-dose estrogen plus moderate-dose progestogen on the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.24 to 5.84; I² = 36%; 2 RCTs, 2363 women; very low-certainty-evidence). The remaining dose comparisons had insufficient events to draw conclusions. Sequential combined estrogen plus progestogen - dose comparisons Moderate-dose estrogen plus low-dose progestogen may result in little to no difference in the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with moderate-dose estrogen plus moderate-dose progestogen (3–32 events/1000 women versus 6 events/1000 women; OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.65; I² = 0%; 4 RCTs, 1072 women; low-certainty-evidence). The remaining dose comparisons had insufficient events to draw conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia versus placebo and continuous combined therapy at one year and later. Sequential combined therapy may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year versus placebo. The evidence is less certain for continuous versus sequential combined regimens and dose comparisons of continuous and sequential combined regimens. The trials had few events, and long-term follow-up was challenging. For endometrial cancer, events were rare and trials were underpowered to draw meaningful conclusions.

### The endocrinology of menstruation – a role for the immune system [^117G9f7j]. Clinical Endocrinology (2001). Low credibility.

The human endometrium displays characteristic features, both structural and functional, across the menstrual cycle. It is the sex steroid hormones, oestrogen and progesterone, that drive the endometrium through the different phases of the cycle. Oestrogen and progesterone act sequentially to regulate cellular concentrations of their respective receptors, this interaction initiates gene transcription. Thereafter a cascade of local events prepares the endometrium for implantation, but in the absence of pregnancy, progesterone withdrawal leads to menstruation and cyclic repair. Withdrawal of progesterone from an oestrogen-progesterone primed endometrium is the initiating event for the cascade of molecular and cellular interactions that result in menstruation. Progesterone withdrawal first affects cells with progesterone receptors. Early events in the menstrual process are vasoconstriction and cytokine up-regulation. The activation of lytic mechanisms is a later event and involves cells that may lack progesterone receptors, for example, uterine leucocytes and epithelial cells. Hence progesterone withdrawal results in a local increase of inflammatory mediators and the enzymes responsible for tissue breakdown. The total complex of local factors implicated in normal menstrual and aberrant menstrual bleeding are yet to be fully defined.

### Fertility drugs and cancer: a guideline [^114X2TgL]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Breast cancer and assisted reproductive technology (ART) — Breast cancer remains the most frequent female malignancy, affecting 1 in 8 women's lifetimes. Hormonal context is complex: evidence regarding the association of progesterone exposure and breast cancer is contradictory; although progesterone seems protective of the endometrium, it appears to be mitogenic to the breast, yet parity, a state of high progesterone levels, is associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. Regarding ART, studies investigating breast cancer risks in women who underwent ART treatments are inconsistent; ART treatments may induce temporary high estrogen and progesterone blood levels, but results are conflicting with some studies showing a possible increased or decreased risk and others showing no effect, and several confounding factors are present when evaluating the relationship between breast cancer and ART treatments.

### Effects of acute estradiol and progesterone on perimenstrual exacerbation of suicidal ideation and related symptoms: a crossover randomized controlled trial [^113tCUFD]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

E2 and P4 administration timed to the two weeks surrounding menses onset prevented premenstrual worsening of SI and planning, as well as depressed mood, hopelessness, rejection sensitivity, perceived burdensomeness, and perceived stress, with some evidence of an additional benefit for difficulty concentrating in the subsequent early follicular phase. The benefits of E2 and P4 administration were most marked in the perimenstrual phase (days −3 to +2 surrounding menses onset), when the majority of E2 and P4 withdrawal occurs, and were most often also present in the early follicular phase, just following the acute endogenous steroid withdrawal that initiates menstrual bleeding. However, these effects were also present for depressed mood and perceived stress in the midluteal phase, prior to the initiation of endogenous steroid withdrawal, which suggests the possibility of an additional or alternative mechanism of benefit (in addition to buffering the effects of E2 and P4 withdrawal). For SI, hopelessness, and rejection sensitivity, there were recapitulations of the E2 and P4 withdrawal effect during withdrawal from exogenous hormones in the active condition, underscoring a causal role for withdrawal. Consistent with prior epidemiologic studies, 59% of the sample demonstrated PME of at least one emotional symptom in the baseline phase, with nearly all showing their highest baseline levels of SI in the perimenstrual phase. Two participants were withdrawn in the washout phase due to suicide attempt (n = 1) or preparation (n = 1), and in both cases these behaviors occurred in the 7 days surrounding onset of menstrual bleeding. Together, these results support a causal, contributory role of cyclical ovarian steroids — and especially E2 and P4 withdrawal — in premenstrual exacerbation of SI and related symptoms among cycling individuals with suicidality. These results elucidate one of the first modifiable, time-varying biological triggers for suicidality.

### Reversal of medication abortion with progesterone: a systematic review [^1111hdfE]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Our review of the use of progesterone to reverse the effect of mifepristone found that ongoing pregnancy rates are not significantly different for individuals treated with progesterone compared with those managed expectantly. Also, individuals who do not receive misoprostol after mifepristone may be at increased risk of bleeding.

We found few studies investigating the effect of progesterone treatment to reverse the effects of mifepristone. Only one study was rigorously designed but did not reach its intended sample size due to safety concerns. The remainder were case series with serious ethical and methodological concerns. We compared the ongoing pregnancy rate at 7 weeks or less and 7–8 weeks for individuals treated with progesterone after mifepristone compared with those who were managed expectantly, pooling data from the four studies in this review and the only prior study which examined ongoing pregnancy rates after a 200 mg dose of mifepristone. Even including all the data from the poorly conducted case series, ongoing pregnancy rates are not significantly higher for individuals treated with progesterone compared with those managed expectantly.

Most of the data in this analysis were collected as part of a large case serieswith ethical and methodological issues. While we considered excluding it from the analysis, we ultimately included it because it did meet our definition of case series, though its lack of completeness and inclusiveness of cases over time limits its reliability. This case series by Delgado et al reported a success rate of progesterone treatment of up to 68%. As was also highlighted by authors who conducted a partial reanalysis of those findings, this success rate was likely inflated by two factors. While some participants had gestational cardiac activity confirmed by ultrasonography prior to initiating progesterone, it is unclear how many individuals in total had ultrasound examinations and how many were excluded from the study because they already had an embryonic demise prior to initiating progesterone. Only selecting individuals who had gestational cardiac activity at the time they sought abortion reversal would falsely inflate progesterone's success rate because mifepristone alone does not always cause embryonic demise, particularly at higher gestational ages. Also, the authors excluded from the analysis individuals who were lost to follow-up before 20 weeks, many of whom may have experienced embryonic demise.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113SUj3L]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Progestogen administration — with an intact uterus, "a progestogen must be added to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and cancer". Formulations "are administered in two regimens", including a combined sequential regimen in which "The combined sequential regimen includes estrogen for 20 to 25 days and a progestogen for 12 to 15 days each month", and "This approach is preferred for recently menopausal woman who are prone to breakthrough bleeding during the first year or two of therapy".

### Mental health symptoms in oral contraceptive users during short-term hormone withdrawal [^115d1r3H]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Interestingly, mental health problems associated with endogenous hormonal change appear most commonly during phases of hormonal withdrawal, like the premenstrual or postpartum period or menopause. Also, withdrawal from hormone replacement therapy results in negative mood symptoms. However, neither RCTs nor cohort studies have the necessary temporal resolution to identify whether mental health symptoms occur in response to COC application or during COC withdrawal. This is of particular relevance because the majority of COC formulations are designed to artificially mimic a menstrual cycle. Thus, over a period of 28 days, hormone-containing COC pills are taken for 21 to 24 days, followed by a so-called pill pause, ie, 4 to 7 days during which no pills are taken or during which the COC pills are replaced by placebo pills. During this pill-free interval, women experience exogenous hormonal withdrawal, which is accompanied by a vaginal bleeding similar to menses. Thus, even though mental health benefits in long-term COC users have been attributed to mood stabilization due to the constant hormonal milieu elicited by the daily intake of the same contraceptive formulation, this stable hormonal milieu is disrupted once a month to elicit a withdrawal bleeding. Although much attention has been paid to mental health symptoms in COC users, it has always been assumed that they occur during active intake. Accordingly, almost no research, to our knowledge, has been conducted into the mental health implications of the pill pause.

In the current study, we explored whether the pill pause is accompanied by changes in mental health symptoms in a well-powered sample of long-term COC users and whether these changes are moderated by (1) progestin type (androgenic vs antiandrogenic), (2) estrogen dose, and (3) previous mental health symptoms. By including a control group of women with natural menstrual cycles, we assessed how these changes compared with changes in mental health symptoms along the endogenous menstrual cycle.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^1158P3GC]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea evaluation — progesterone withdrawal test (PWT): The foundation of this test centers on the understanding that although low E2 and high gonadotropin levels are informative of ovarian insufficiency, normal E2 levels (in the range that is deemed normal for early follicular phase) and normal gonadotropins are relatively poor discriminants of the many nonovarian causes of amenorrhea; interpretation of a failed response (i.e., no bleeding) to PWT can be twofold, secondary to a hypoestrogenic milieu or because of an inability of the endometrium to respond to an estrogen replete environment, and in FHA circulating E2 is suppressed (< 30 pg/mL) with the endometrium often quiescent; ultrasound findings of endometrial thickness can help guide decisions regarding proceeding with PWT, and the absence of withdrawal bleeding with a progestin challenge is predictable if ultrasound demonstrates an attenuated endometrium.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^113ba98y]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Endometrial cancer — systemic estrogen therapy risks and progestogen use are summarized as follows: unopposed systemic ET in a postmenopausal woman with an intact uterus increases the risk of endometrial cancer and is dose- and duration-related; progestogen used continuously or cyclically for 10 to 14 days monthly significantly reduces this risk, and adequate concomitant progestogen is recommended for a woman with an intact uterus when using systemic ET; low-dose vaginal ET does not appear to increase endometrial cancer risk, although trials with endometrial biopsy end points are limited to 1 year in duration; progestogen is not advised with low-dose vaginal ET for GSM, although intermittent use may be considered in women at increased risk; and postmenopausal bleeding must be evaluated thoroughly because it may signal endometrial hyperplasia or cancer.

### Prenatal administration of progesterone for preventing preterm birth in women considered to be at risk of preterm birth [^114DseTC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm birth is a major complication of pregnancy associated with perinatal mortality and morbidity. Progesterone for the prevention of preterm labour has been advocated.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of progesterone for the prevention of preterm birth for women considered to be at increased risk of preterm birth and their infants.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (14 January 2013) and reviewed the reference list of all articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, in which progesterone was given for preventing preterm birth.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently evaluated trials for methodological quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Thirty-six randomised controlled trials (8523 women and 12,515 infants) were included. Progesterone versus placebo for women with a past history of spontaneous preterm birth Progesterone was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of perinatal mortality (six studies; 1453 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.75), preterm birth less than 34 weeks (five studies; 602 women; average RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69), infant birthweight less than 2500 g (four studies; 692 infants; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.79), use of assisted ventilation (three studies; 633 women; RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.90), necrotising enterocolitis (three studies; 1170 women; RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.89), neonatal death (six studies; 1453 women; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.76), admission to neonatal intensive care unit (three studies; 389 women; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.40), preterm birth less than 37 weeks (10 studies; 1750 women; average RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.74) and a statistically significant increase in pregnancy prolongation in weeks (one study; 148 women; mean difference (MD) 4.47, 95% CI 2.15 to 6.79). No differential effects in terms of route of administration, time of commencing therapy and dose of progesterone were observed for the majority of outcomes examined. Progesterone versus placebo for women with a short cervix identified on ultrasound Progesterone was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of preterm birth less than 34 weeks (two studies; 438 women; RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.90), preterm birth at less than 28 weeks' gestation (two studies; 1115 women; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.93) and increased risk of urticaria in women when compared with placebo (one study; 654 women; RR 5.03, 95% CI 1.11 to 22.78). It was not possible to assess the effect of route of progesterone administration, gestational age at commencing therapy, or total cumulative dose of medication. Progesterone versus placebo for women with a multiple pregnancy Progesterone was associated with no statistically significant differences for the reported outcomes. Progesterone versus no treatment/placebo for women following presentation with threatened preterm labour Progesterone, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of infant birthweight less than 2500 g (one study; 70 infants; RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.98). Progesterone versus placebo for women with 'other' risk factors for preterm birth Progesterone, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of infant birthweight less than 2500 g (three studies; 482 infants; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.91).

Authors' Conclusions

The use of progesterone is associated with benefits in infant health following administration in women considered to be at increased risk of preterm birth due either to a prior preterm birth or where a short cervix has been identified on ultrasound examination. However, there is limited information available relating to longer-term infant and childhood outcomes, the assessment of which remains a priority. Further trials are required to assess the optimal timing, mode of administration and dose of administration of progesterone therapy when given to women considered to be at increased risk of early birth.

### Mifepristone: ten years later [^115ms42V]. Contraception (2010). Low credibility.

While pregnant women have sought abortifacients for thousands of years, they had no success at finding one that both worked and did not jeopardize their lives in the process. The discovery of mifepristone, with both anti-glucocorticoid and anti-progesterone properties, has had a profound effect on women's lives while weaving the abortion-related political hazards. Despite the controversies, millions of women around the world have used mifepristone for medical abortion. This review describes how researchers addressed the numerous barriers of a mifepristone abortion (i.e., gestational age limitation, lengthy process, high costs, complex regimen, failures, side effects and complications) and continue to improve upon the limited numbers and types of clinicians offering mifepristone.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^113V8qU6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined oral contraceptives — actions after late or missed pills (Figure 1): If one hormonal pill is late (< 24 hours since a pill should have been taken) or if one hormonal pill has been missed (24 to < 48 hours since a pill should have been taken), take the late or missed pill as soon as possible, continue taking the remaining pills at the usual time (even if it means taking two pills on the same day), no additional contraceptive protection is needed, and emergency contraception is not usually needed but may be considered (with the exception of UPA [ulipristal acetate]) if hormonal pills were missed earlier in the cycle or during the last week of hormonal pills in the previous cycle. If two or more consecutive hormonal pills have been missed (≥ 48 hours since a pill should have been taken), take the most recent missed pill as soon as possible. Any other missed pills should be discarded. Continue taking the remaining pills at the usual time (even if it means taking two pills on the same day), and abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) until hormonal pills have been taken for 7 consecutive days. If pills were missed during the last week of hormonal pills (e.g., days 15–21 for 28-day pill packs), omit the hormone-free interval by finishing the hormonal pills in the current pack and starting a new pack the next day; if unable to start a new pack immediately, abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) until hormonal pills from a new pack have been taken for 7 consecutive days. Emergency contraception should be considered (with the exception of UPA) if hormonal pills were missed during the first week and unprotected sexual intercourse occurred during the previous 5 days, and emergency contraception may also be considered (with the exception of UPA) at other times as appropriate.

### Hormone therapy in postmenopausal women and risk of endometrial hyperplasia [^115PKz5e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Declining circulating estrogen levels around the time of the menopause can induce unacceptable symptoms that affect the health and well being of women. Hormone therapy (both unopposed estrogen and estrogen/progestogen combinations) is an effective treatment for these symptoms, but is associated with risk of harms. Guidelines recommend that hormone therapy be given at the lowest effective dose and treatment should be reviewed regularly. The aim of this review is to identify the minimum dose(s) of progestogen required to be added to estrogen so that the rate of endometrial hyperplasia is not increased compared to placebo.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to assess which hormone therapy regimens provide effective protection against the development of endometrial hyperplasia and/or carcinoma.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched January 2008), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2008), EMBASE (1980 to May 2008), Current Contents (1993 to May 2008), Biological Abstracts (1969 to 2008), Social Sciences Index (1980 to May 2008), PsycINFO (1972 to May 2008) and CINAHL (1982 to May 2008). Attempts were made to identify trials from citation lists of reviews and studies retrieved, and drug companies were contacted for unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of unopposed estrogen therapy, combined continuous estrogen-progestogen therapy and/or sequential estrogen-progestogen therapy with each other or placebo, administered over a minimum period of twelve months. Incidence of endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma assessed by a biopsy at the end of treatment was a required outcome. Data on adherence to therapy, rates of additional interventions, and withdrawals due to adverse events were also extracted.

Data Collection and Analysis

In this substantive update, forty five studies were included. Odds ratios were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. The small numbers of studies in each comparison and the clinical heterogeneity precluded meta analysis for many outcomes.

Main Results

Unopposed estrogen is associated with increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia at all doses, and durations of therapy between one and three years. For women with a uterus the risk of endometrial hyperplasia with hormone therapy comprising low dose estrogen continuously combined with a minimum of 1 mg norethisterone acetate or 1.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate is not significantly different from placebo (1mg NETA: OR = 0.04 (0 to 2.8); 1.5mg MPA: no hyperplasia events).

Authors' Conclusions

Hormone therapy for postmenopausal women with an intact uterus should comprise both estrogen and progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^1117ZBmJ]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea — definitions and thresholds for evaluation — Amenorrhea is the absence or abnormal cessation of menses, with primary amenorrhea evaluated when there is failure to menstruate by the age of 15 in the presence of normal secondary sexual development (2 standard deviations above the mean of 13 years), or within 5 years after breast development if that occurs before the age of 10; failure to initiate breast development by the age of 13 (2 standard deviations above the mean of 10 years) also requires investigation. In women with regular menstrual cycles, a delay of menses for as little as 1 week may require the exclusion of pregnancy. Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for > 3 months in those with previously regular cycles or 6 months in those with irregular menses, and requires investigation.

### Hormone therapy for breast cancer fact sheet-NCI… [^113iHpim]. NCI (2022). Medium credibility.

Hormone therapy for breast cancer should not be confused with menopausal hormone therapy — treatment with estrogen alone or in combination with progesterone to help relieve symptoms of menopause. These two types of therapy produce opposite effects: hormone therapy for breast cancer blocks the growth of HR-positive breast cancer, whereas MHT can stimulate the growth of HR-positive breast cancer. For this reason, when a woman taking MHT is diagnosed with HR-positive breast cancer she is usually asked to stop that therapy. Examples of ovarian suppression drugs are goserelin and leuprolide. For example, some women may take an aromatase inhibitor, instead of tamoxifen, every day for 5 years. Other women may receive additional treatment with an aromatase inhibitor after 5 years of tamoxifen. Finally, some women may switch to an aromatase inhibitor after 2 or 3 years of tamoxifen, for a total of 5 or more years of hormone therapy.

What are the side effects of hormone therapy. The side effects of hormone therapy depend largely on the specific drug or the type of treatment. The benefits and harms of taking hormone therapy should be carefully weighed for each person. A common switching strategy used for adjuvant therapy, in which patients take tamoxifen for 2 or 3 years, followed by an aromatase inhibitor for 2 or 3 years, may yield the best balance of benefits and harms of these two types of hormone therapy. Raloxifene
- risk of blood clots, especially in the lungs and legs
- stroke in certain subgroups Ovarian suppression
- bone loss
- mood swings, depression, and loss of libido Aromatase inhibitors
- risk of heart attack, angina, heart failure, and hypercholesterolemia
- bone loss
- joint pain
- mood swings and depression.

Many experts suggest that patients who are taking antidepressants along with tamoxifen should discuss treatment options with their doctors, such as switching from an SSRI that is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, such as paroxetine hydrochloride, to one that is a weaker inhibitor, such as sertraline or citalopram, or to an antidepressant that does not inhibit CYP2D6, such as venlafaxine.

### Choice of HRT regimen and postmenopausal symptoms… [^115jL81y]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Apart from its use for the relief of vasomotor symptoms, little is known about the effect of hormone replacement therapy on signs and symptoms associated with menopause. Studies have been complicated by a high placebo effect and by variations in the types of HRT used. In particular, the relative contributions of estrogen and progestin are difficult to estimate, and progestin is frequently prescribed in different formulations and regimens. Greendale and colleagues assessed the effects of estrogen alone, placebo, and three estrogen-progestin regimens on postmenopausal symptoms in a large multicenter trial. The progestin combinations included medroxyprogesterone acetate in a dosage of 2. 5 mg daily or medroxyprogesterone acetate in a dosage of 10 mg taken 12 days per month, or 200 mg of micronized progesterone taken 12 days per month. All medications were identical in appearance, and the study was double-blinded.

Data about demographic variables, medical history, physical activity, use of cigarettes and alcohol, and symptoms were collected at baseline, and symptom information was collected again at 12 and 36 months. During the three-year study period, 210 women stopped treatment. Approximately one quarter of these withdrawals were mandated because of endometrial abnormalities or other medical complications. Eleven women withdrew because of health concerns, and 21 cited "personal reasons. " The remaining 127 women cited various symptoms as the reason for withdrawal, the most common being vaginal bleeding, premenstrual syndrome, vasomotor symptoms, headaches, anxiety/depression and breast tenderness. When analyzed by original assignment and adherence to therapy, active treatment was statistically superior to placebo in the relief of vasomotor symptoms. The addition of progestin did not appear to change the relief of vasomotor symptoms.

Patients receiving progestin did, however, report significantly more breast discomfort than women taking placebo or estrogen alone. The effects of HRT on headache and forgetfulness were complicated. Women with headache before the trial reported improvement with estrogen alone compared with placebo or progestin-containing regimens. Conversely, women who did not report headache initially were more likely to develop the symptom during treatment with estrogen than other regimens. The authors conclude that all forms of HRT benefit vasomotor symptoms but appear to have little effect on anxiety, cognition or affect. They further conclude that the addition of progestin to HRT is associated with breast discomfort.
