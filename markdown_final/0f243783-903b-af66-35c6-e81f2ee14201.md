Lampreys attach to the skin of lake trout and absorb nutrients from its body. This relationship is an example of

Answer Choices:
A. commensalism
B. parasitism
C. mutualism
D. gravitropism

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ecological relationship best describes lampreys attaching to lake trout and absorbing nutrients from their bodies, with options including commensalism, parasitism, mutualism, and gravitropism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definitions of these ecological interactions. Then, I should verify what the provided sources say about lamprey feeding biology and whether it harms the host. Next, I will examine each option against the observed interaction. Finally, I will confirm the best fit and briefly consider why the distractors are incorrect, making sure I don't jump to conclusions without checking the evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't misclassify the interaction. Mutualism benefits both parties, commensalism benefits one party without affecting the other, and parasitism benefits one party at the expense of the other, typically by harming the host. Gravitropism, on the other hand, is a plant growth response to gravity and is not an interspecies ecological relationship, so it doesn't belong here.

> Wait, let me verify the biological details from the sources. Multiple high-credibility papers describe lampreys as using a toothed, suctorial oral disc to attach to fish hosts and feed on blood and/or tissue, with explicit statements that they "eat blood or cut off tissues" and that their feeding apparatus is specialized for this purpose, which clearly implies nutrient extraction from the host at the host's expense [^112ojUYX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check whether the host benefits or remains unaffected. The documents emphasize that lampreys can cause substantial harm to fisheries and that their feeding mode involves damaging host tissues, which aligns with parasitism rather than mutualism or commensalism, where the host either benefits or is not harmed, respectively [^114bWYwu] [^116sM59W].

> I will now examine each option against this evidence. Mutualism is ruled out because the lake trout does not benefit from being bitten and drained of nutrients. Commensalism is ruled out because the trout is harmed by tissue damage and nutrient loss. Gravitropism is irrelevant here since this is an animal–animal interaction, not a plant growth response. Parasitism fits because the lamprey benefits nutritionally while the host is harmed, which matches the described feeding biology and ecological impact [^114bWYwu] [^116sM59W].

> But wait, what if someone argues that some lampreys are non-parasitic and thus this could be commensalism? Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check that nuance. While some lamprey species are indeed non-parasitic, the question specifically describes attachment and nutrient absorption from a host fish, which is the hallmark of the parasitic feeding stage in species like the sea lamprey, so the correct classification for this described interaction remains parasitism despite the existence of non-parasitic lamprey life histories [^114g2igF] [^114bWYwu].

> Final answer: B. parasitism, because the lamprey benefits by obtaining nutrients while the lake trout is harmed by tissue damage and nutrient loss, which is the defining feature of parasitism and is directly supported by descriptions of lamprey feeding biology and ecological impact [^114bWYwu] [^116sM59W].

---

The correct answer is **B. parasitism**. Lampreys attach to lake trout and feed on their blood and body fluids, which harms the host and benefits the lamprey — a classic parasitic relationship [^114bWYwu]. Commensalism would imply no harm to the host, mutualism would require benefit to both, and gravitropism is a plant growth response to gravity, not an ecological interaction.

---

## Ecological relationships: definitions and examples

Ecological relationships describe how different species interact with each other in an ecosystem. The main types include:

- **Mutualism**: Both species benefit from the interaction (e.g. clownfish and sea anemones).
- **Commensalism**: One species benefits while the other is neither helped nor harmed (e.g. barnacles on whales).
- **Parasitism**: One species (the parasite) benefits at the expense of the other (the host), causing harm to the host (e.g. ticks on mammals).
- **Gravitropism**: A plant growth response to gravity, not an ecological relationship between species.

## Lamprey-lake trout interaction: parasitism

Lampreys are **jawless fish** that attach to other fish using their sucker-like mouth, rasp through the skin, and feed on blood and body fluids [^114bWYwu]. This feeding strategy causes significant harm to the host fish, including tissue damage, stress, and increased susceptibility to infections and death. The lamprey benefits by obtaining nutrients, while the lake trout suffers harm — a clear example of parasitism [^116sM59W].

---

## Why not commensalism or mutualism?

Commensalism would imply that the lamprey benefits without affecting the lake trout, but the lamprey's feeding causes **significant harm** to the host, so this is not commensalism. Mutualism would require both species to benefit, yet the lake trout derives no benefit and is harmed, so this is not mutualism either.

---

## Why not gravitropism?

Gravitropism is a **plant-specific growth response** to gravity and is irrelevant to animal interactions; it does not apply to the lamprey-lake trout relationship.

---

## Conclusion

The relationship between lampreys and lake trout is best described as **parasitism**, as the lamprey benefits by feeding on the lake trout's blood and body fluids, causing harm to the host [^114bWYwu]. This aligns with the definition of parasitism, where one organism benefits at the expense of another.

Introduction

As a lineage of the living jawless vertebrates, lampreys have great weight in the study of vertebrate evolution –. They are characterized by their peculiar feeding behavior of eating blood or cutting off tissues from the hosts or prey to which they firmly attach via their toothed oral sucker. In such a way, lampreys play a significant role in the aquatic ecosystem and, in some cases, where they are non-native, even bring tremendous loss to the fishery economy. These jawless fishes have been in existence for ca. 360 million years but left an extremely patchy fossil record in the post-Carboniferous period, with only two species known from the Cretaceous. Despite the superficially conservative morphology throughout their history, from the simply assembled teeth in Paleozoic fossils, lampreys' feeding apparatus, especially the size, shape and arrangement of the keratinous teeth, was substantially reformed and enhanced to the pattern of modern species. And evidently, departing from their Paleozoic kin with non-ammocoete larvae and expanding the habitats to the freshwater domain, lampreys changed the life-history strategy some time before the Cretaceous by evolving the ammocoete and metamorphic stages. Eventually, they established their current diversity and anti-tropical distribution. However, these scenarios were poorly understood due to the lack of reliable fossil record and the disputed lamprey phylogeny, especially that of the crown-group lineages –. Here we shed light on these issues by reporting two lampreys from the Jurassic terrestrial fossil Lagerstätte Yanliao Biota of North China. These fossil lampreys were exquisitely preserved with a complete suite of feeding structures, including the well-developed movable biting plates on the tongue-like piston, which has never been clearly recognized in previously known fossil lampreys and astonishingly resembles the pouched lamprey (Geotria australis) now confined to the Southern Hemisphere. Bridging the recorded fossil and extant lampreys, these fossils offer an opportunity to reconstruct the evolutionary process and the ancestral state of modern lampreys' feeding biology. As key constraints of the evolutionary timeline of its group, they also make it possible to assess the coevolutionary interactions with the potential hosts (or prey) and their implications for the establishment of the modern-type life-history mode. Also, based on the revised lamprey phylogeny, the early biogeographical history of modern lampreys was reconstructed and their 'poles-apart' distribution pattern was reinterpreted.

### Chitin-based barrier immunity and its loss predated mucus-colonization by indigenous gut microbiota [^111dKju5]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The salient feature of the mammalian gut is that chitin-based barrier immunity no longer exists, and luminal microbes directly interact with the surrounding, goblet cell-derived GFM mucus. This GFM mucus fulfills the primordial necessity of limiting microbial access to host tissue through joint actions with diffusive effector molecules (e.g. mucosal antibodies or antimicrobial peptides) in regionally diversified manners, (Fig. 6h–l). Simultaneously, this protective mucus has a role as a nutrient source for gut microbes. GFM is heavily and diversely glycosylated on its PTS domains, and these glycans are recognized and consumed by gut microbes. This glycan-foraging drives microbial adaptation to this novel mucosal interface through competition for persistence. Especially in the distal gut, where food-derived carbohydrate is scarce, GFM mucus forms a distinct niche for dense microbial colonization, (Fig. 6i–l). In turn, glycan-feeding enables hosts to shape microbial compositions by manipulating the glycan landscape. Ecological theory predicts that this host control over microbial ecosystems was a key for establishment of the mammalian gut microbiota that is diverse, but beneficial. This highlights the loss of chitin as a prerequisite for colonization of goblet cell-derived GFM mucus by indigenous gut microbes in mammals. With or without this novel type of animal–microbe association, the guts of mammals and ray-finned fish likely provide disparate mucosal environments that impose distinct selective pressures on microbial composition. This may at least partly explain why, in reciprocal transplantation of indigenous gut microbes between mice and zebrafish, transplanted communities change their composition to resemble that of recipients. In this way, an approach to integrate microbiome data into evolutionary trajectories of host natural histories would advance our understanding of this coevolved association.

In conclusion, this comparative study provided a glimpse of gradual changes in the intestinal mucosal surface in chordates. We propose a transition from a chitin-based ancestral condition to a mucin-based derived state (Fig. 7). Concomitantly, gut microbes appear to have changed position from transient passengers that are incorporated from the surrounding environment, as food, to a selected assembly that inhabits the mucus layer as an integral part of the host fitness. We begin to appreciate that spatial organization of gut microbes lays the foundation of this microbial ecosystem. Compartmentalization, which is usually neglected in gut homogenates prepared for microbiome studies, may give us further insight into animal–microbe associations in this digestive and the largest immune organ of the body, the gut.

### Mapping of adaptive traits enabled by a high-density linkage map for lake trout [^116gFbjs]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

Growth and body condition related traits all have suggestive QTL on linkage groups Sna1 and Sna12, indicating that genes on these chromosomes likely harbor variation that underlies differences in growth between populations. Linkage group Sna12 also appears to harbor an inversion that differentiates lake trout from other salmonid species examined, including brook trout. A previous study identified a putative growth rate QTL on the brook trout linkage group homologous to Sna12 (Figure S7; BC9). The same study identified a stress response QTL, measured as change in blood cortisol levels following handling stress, in brook trout on the chromosome homologous to Sna1 (, BC6). Increased cortisol levels have been found to be negatively corelated with growth and condition factor in other salmonids, suggesting that variation observed in our families could actually be due to variation in stress response. There is evidence for variation in fitness among lake trout hatchery strains used to supplement and restore lake trout populations in the Great Lakes, with the strain from Seneca Lake, New York appearing to have a fitness advantage. Great Lakes lake trout populations are heavily impacted by predation by invasive sea lamprey and previous work has shown that larger individuals have a greater probability of surviving lamprey attack (Swink 1990). Similarly, size-selective fisheries have also been shown to impose strong natural selection on growth in multiple species. Future work could examine whether the chromosomal regions identified here are associated with size-at-age or are under selection in populations experiencing lamprey predation or size-selective fisheries.

Associations between environmental conditions and phenotype have been observed across the lake trout range and across salmonid species for the afore mentioned traits, suggesting adaptive significance in some contexts. For example, patterns and intensity of skin pigmentation, along with divergence in other traits, is commonly associated with depth-of-capture in both lake trout and Arctic char populations. Variation in skin pigmentation is potentially involved with predator avoidance and camouflage, feeding behavior, mate choice, or protection from ultraviolet radiation. Differences in age specific growth rates are also frequently observed between humper, lean, and siscowet-like lake trout morphotypes — as well as between Arctic char morphotypes. These differences in growth rate likely reflect variation in allocation of resources toward growth and reproduction, adaptation to nutrient stress, or plastic responses to environmental variation.

The evolution of lampreys' feeding apparatus and its implications

As indicated by the lineage of Mesomyzon in our Petromyzontiform timetree, the substantial shift of lampreys' life cycle pattern from the Paleozoic type without ammocoete stage, to that comprising three stages might have occurred no later than the late Early Jurassic (ca. 180 Ma) (Fig. 3). This evolutionary breakthrough coincided with a dramatic evolutionary increase of the body size of these animals (Fig. 3), a natural consequence of the evolutionary dynamics of host-lamprey interactions and the changing ecological structures of the ichthyofaunal communities.

Lampreys underwent radical changes in their feeding structures and feeding habits since their appearance in the Devonian (Fig. 3). This history can be divided into two episodes linked by the Jurassic species (Supplementary Discussion). The Paleozoic lampreys might not hold parasitic or predaceous habits as conventionally assumed. They are all very small and lack an ammocoete stage, which should be associated with their simply structured and tiny dentition and the limited buccal cavity, the space accommodating the anti-coagulant secreting glands and food processing in living lampreys. Their buccal cavity is squeezed by the anteriorly positioned branchial apparatus, which culminates in Priscomyzon, whose first two gill pouches even extend anterior to the eye. These early lampreys' oral disc (e.g. the extraordinarily large oral disc of Priscomyzon) and associated structures (e.g. the radiative arrangement of the circumoral petaliform plates of Priscomyzon, Pipiscius, and probably Mayomyzon that would add the rigidity of the disc) all point to the enhanced attaching capability, but the real 'biting' structures, i.e. those laminae on the gouging piston, or the supraoral lamina which might function in feeding were so weakly developed that they were never preserved or unrecognizable in the fossils despite the existence of the clearly observable circumoral teeth in situ. Moreover, were they parasitic or predatory forms, their feeding opportunities were rather limited because the vast majority of their potential hosts then all had thick scales or armor surfaced by enamel or dentine layers or ridges, thus too hard for lampreys' keratinous teeth to penetrate. Instead, we propose that these early lampreys' well-developed oral discs and attaching skills might be adapted to scraping algal mats on other aquatic animals, thereby opening up a new niche to avoid the competition from the contemporary diversified jawless fishes, especially that from the long-bodied jawless conodonts with comparable feeding apparatus. Also, their oral discs could be used for hitch-hiking on other aquatic vertebrates to expand their distribution, which could partially account for the wide historical distribution of these animals from the polar region of the Late Devonian to the low-latitude region of the Late Carboniferous (Fig. 4). Lampreys' oral disc could also be involved in some reproductive behaviors, e.g. moving stones for nesting or anchoring to the stone or the partner female during the mating as in living lampreys.

### A lasting symbiosis: how the hawaiian bobtail squid finds and keeps its bioluminescent bacterial partner [^115zbt91]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2021). High credibility.

For more than 30 years, the association between the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and the bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri has been studied as a model system for understanding the colonization of animal epithelia by symbiotic bacteria. The squid-vibrio light-organ system provides the exquisite resolution only possible with the study of a binary partnership. The impact of this relationship on the partners' biology has been broadly characterized, including their ecology and evolutionary biology as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms of symbiotic dynamics. Much has been learned about the factors that foster initial light-organ colonization, and more recently about the maturation and long-term maintenance of the association. This Review synthesizes the results of recent research on the light-organ association and also describes the development of new horizons for E. scolopes as a model organism that promises to inform biology and biomedicine about the basic nature of host-microorganism interactions.

### A conserved chemical dialog of mutualism: lessons from squid and Vibrio [^115thJS6]. Microbes and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Microorganisms shape, and are shaped by, their environment. In host-microbe associations, this environment is defined by tissue chemistry, which reflects local and organism-wide physiology, as well as inflammatory status. We review how, in the squid-vibrio mutualism, both partners shape tissue chemistry, revealing common themes governing tissue homeostasis in animal-microbe associations.

### The rise of predation in jurassic lampreys [^116sM59W]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Lampreys, one of two living lineages of jawless vertebrates, are always intriguing for their feeding behavior via the toothed suctorial disc and life cycle comprising the ammocoete, metamorphic, and adult stages. However, they left a meager fossil record, and their evolutionary history remains elusive. Here we report two superbly preserved large lampreys from the Middle-Late Jurassic Yanliao Biota of North China and update the interpretations of the evolution of the feeding apparatus, the life cycle, and the historic biogeography of the group. These fossil lampreys' extensively toothed feeding apparatus differs radically from that of their Paleozoic kin but surprisingly resembles the Southern Hemisphere pouched lamprey, which foreshadows an ancestral flesh-eating habit for modern lampreys. Based on the revised petromyzontiform timetree, we argued that modern lampreys' three-staged life cycle might not be established until the Jurassic when they evolved enhanced feeding structures, increased body size and encountered more penetrable host groups. Our study also places modern lampreys' origin in the Southern Hemisphere of the Late Cretaceous, followed by an early Cenozoic anti-tropical disjunction in distribution, hence challenging the conventional wisdom of their biogeographical pattern arising from a post-Cretaceous origin in the Northern Hemisphere or the Pangean fragmentation in the Early Mesozoic.

### Symbiotic conversations are revealed under genetic interrogation [^116i5tYP]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2008). Medium credibility.

The recent development and application of molecular genetics to the symbionts of invertebrate animal species have advanced our knowledge of the biochemical communication that occurs between the host and its bacterial symbionts. In particular, the ability to manipulate these associations experimentally by introducing genetic variants of the symbionts into naive hosts has allowed the discovery of novel colonization mechanisms and factors. In addition, the role of the symbionts in inducing normal host development has been revealed, and its molecular basis described. In this Review, I discuss many of these developments, focusing on what has been discovered in five well-understood model systems.

### The rise of predation in jurassic lampreys [^112ojUYX]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The reinforcement of the feeding apparatus peaked in the Middle and Late Jurassic lampreys, which prefigured the ancestry of the feeding mode of living lampreys (Fig. 3). Yanliaomyzon 's dentitional arrangement and the gut content point to a flesh-eating habit. Their dentitional pattern resembles Geotria, a large flesh eater that can even destroy the skull of teleost fish. Our study suggests that the flesh-eating habit is likely ancestral for modern lampreys, rather than the blood-eating as traditionally noted, nor the non-feeding habit. The establishment of this feeding habit in Jurassic lampreys implemented their energy intake and growth potential as in their living counterparts, which should have fueled their long-distance dispersals and exerted a subtle influence on the later history of the group, including the origination and distribution of modern lineages.

The historic biogeography of modern lampreys

Living lampreys' anti-tropical distribution is effectively restricted in temperate or sub-arctic regions, north and south of the 30° parallel and marked out by the annual 20°C isotherm. The adaptation to cool or cold waters might also exist in early lampreys. The paleotemperature curve projected to our dated petromyzontiform timetree (Fig. 4) shows that the emergence of recorded fossil lampreys,– appears to coincide with the cool or cold geological intervals and came from productive areas influenced by continental ice sheets, cooling events or topographical highland,– (Supplementary Discussion). This could suggest that lampreys' environmental preference might have remained static throughout their history and hence being more frequently discovered in cool settings.

### Public health assessments&health consultations… [^1138vFnJ]. archive.cdc.gov (2000). Low credibility.

ATSDR's quantitative evaluation of human exposure by water and soil ingestion and by inhalation uses media-specific rates for adults and children. The rates are calculated by multiplying the contaminant concentration by the ingestion rate for an adult or a child, and then dividing that number by the appropriate standard body weight. The water ingestion rates used for adults and children are 2. 0 liters/day and

1. 0 liter/day, respectively. For soil and sediment, the ingestion rates used are 100 mg/day for adults, 500 mg/day for school-age children, and 5, 000 mg/day for pica children. ATSDR uses an inhalation rate of 23 cubic meters /day for adults and 3. 8 m 3/day for a 1-year-old child. Some exposures are intermittent or irregularly timed. For those exposures, an exposure factor. Other domestic uses of water resulted in residents inhaling TCE volatilized from the contaminated water and dermal absorption of TCE from the contaminated water. Limited air monitoring data indicate that on- and off-site military and civilian populations near OU B and OU D were also exposed to TCE by the inhalation route. Reports in the literature indicate that, while showering, people generally inhale an amount of VOCs equivalent to that found in 2 liters of water. Therefore, if the estimated TCE inhalation and ingestion exposures at McAFB are additive, they do not exceed the ATSDR oral intermediate MRL of 0. 7 mg/kg/day. Dermal exposure would not increase the total exposure sufficiently to be of public health concern. Such exposures have resulted in depression, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastritis, colitis, hepatic damage and cirrhosis, congestion in the lungs, pulmonary edema, and bronchitis.

In addition to VC exposure by way of ingestion, off-site residents may inhale VC when using water for domestic purposes, such as bathing, cooking, and watering lawns and gardens. It has been estimated that inhalation exposures are equivalent to those by ingestion. Residents may inhale VC if it is present in the crawl spaces of their homes.

### A lasting symbiosis: how Vibrio fischeri finds a squid partner and persists within its natural host [^111Ricuc]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2021). High credibility.

As our understanding of the human microbiome progresses, so does the need for natural experimental animal models that promote a mechanistic understanding of beneficial microorganism-host interactions. Years of research into the exclusive symbiosis between the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and the bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri have permitted a detailed understanding of those bacterial genes underlying signal exchange and rhythmic activities that result in a persistent, beneficial association, as well as glimpses into the evolution of symbiotic competence. Migrating from the ambient seawater to regions deep inside the light-emitting organ of the squid, V. fischeri experiences, recognizes and adjusts to the changing environmental conditions. Here, we review key advances over the past 15 years that are deepening our understanding of these events.

### Sequencing of the sea lamprey (petromyzon marinus) genome provides insights into vertebrate evolution [^116ehZC8]. Nature Genetics (2013). Medium credibility.

Lampreys are representatives of an ancient vertebrate lineage that diverged from our own ∼500 million years ago. By virtue of this deeply shared ancestry, the sea lamprey (P. marinus) genome is uniquely poised to provide insight into the ancestry of vertebrate genomes and the underlying principles of vertebrate biology. Here, we present the first lamprey whole-genome sequence and assembly. We note challenges faced owing to its high content of repetitive elements and GC bases, as well as the absence of broad-scale sequence information from closely related species. Analyses of the assembly indicate that two whole-genome duplications likely occurred before the divergence of ancestral lamprey and gnathostome lineages. Moreover, the results help define key evolutionary events within vertebrate lineages, including the origin of myelin-associated proteins and the development of appendages. The lamprey genome provides an important resource for reconstructing vertebrate origins and the evolutionary events that have shaped the genomes of extant organisms.

### Transcriptomic analysis of gonadal development in parasitic and non-parasitic lampreys (ichthyomyzon spp.), with a comparison of genomic resources in these non-model species [^114g2igF]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

These genomic resources have been of great use in helping to improve our understanding of genes and gene networks that control many aspects of sea lamprey biology (ee review by). However, relatively little is known about the genes involved in lamprey reproduction. In addition to the idiosyncrasies of their genome, understanding the genetic basis of lamprey sex determination (i.e. the "master switch" that determines the ultimate fate of the gonad) and sex differentiation (the process by which the undifferentiated gonad develops into a recognizable ovary or testis) is complicated by their long and complex life cycle, the prolonged period during which their gonads remain histologically undifferentiated, and uncertainties regarding which sex steroids are physiologically relevant (see review by). Environmental sex determination (ESD) has been proposed in lampreys, but evidence for ESD is equivocal; genes involved in sex determination in the "lower vertebrates" (i.e. reptiles and non-amniotes) are far less conserved than they are in birds and mammals, and whether there is a genetic component to sex determination is lampreys is unknown. In contrast, many of the genes involved in the sex differentiation process tend to be conserved among vertebrates, and initial studies suggest that at least some of the same genes are involved in gonadal development in lampreys (see below).

There are at least 41 extant species of lampreys, all with a long larval stage spent burrowed in river sediments, where they grow slowly filter-feeding on detritus and algae. After ∼4–7 years as larvae, they undergo a pronounced metamorphosis during which the eye and the characteristic lamprey oral disc appear. In 18 species (including the sea lamprey), metamorphosis is followed by a sexually immature juvenile stage, which feeds parasitically on ray-finned fishes or other aquatic vertebrates for few months to a few years. Sexual maturation is initiated at the end of the parasitic feeding stage, and the lampreys embark on a non-trophic upstream migration to the spawning grounds, and die after a single spawning season. The remaining species are nonparasitic (i.e. they do not feed at all following metamorphosis), and they show an accelerated sexual maturation, and spawn and die in their natal stream within 6–10 months of metamorphosis.

### Methods for unveiling cryptic microbial partnerships in nature [^1119gkht]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Syntrophy and mutualism play a central role in carbon and nutrient cycling by microorganisms. Yet our ability to recognize these partnerships in nature or to effectively study their behavior in culture has been hindered by the inherent interdependence of syntrophic associations, their dynamic behavior, and their frequent existence at thermodynamic limits. Now solutions to these challenges are emerging in new methodologies. These include: comparative metagenomics and transcriptomics; discovery-based methods such as Magneto-FISH; and metabolic substrate tracking using stable isotopes coupled either with density gradient separation (SIP) or with FISH-SIMS. These novel approaches are redefining the way we study microbial mutualism and are making intimate microbial associations accessible to both identification and characterization in their native habitats.

### Knowing your friends: invertebrate innate immunity fosters beneficial bacterial symbioses [^112FrgY5]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2012). Medium credibility.

The innate immune system is present in all animals and is a crucial first line of defence against pathogens. However, animals also harbour large numbers of beneficial microorganisms that can be housed in the digestive tract, in specialized organs or on tissue surfaces. Although invertebrates lack conventional antibody-based immunity, they are capable of eliminating pathogens and, perhaps more importantly, discriminating them from other microorganisms. This Review examines the interactions between the innate immune systems of several model invertebrates and the symbionts of these organisms, and addresses the central question of how these long-lived and specific associations are established and maintained.

### Flow physics of nutrient transport drives functional design of ciliates [^113m934i]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Phagotrophy, the ability of cells to ingest organic particles, marked a pivotal milestone in evolution, enabling the emergence of single-celled eukaryotes that consume other organisms and leading to multicellular life. However, reliance on food particles also created a mechanical challenge-how to coordinate the transfer of particles from the exterior environment to the cell interior? Here, we investigate this important link using mechanistic models of ciliates, a clade of single-celled eukaryotes that either swim or attach and generate feeding currents to capture prey. We demonstrate that ciliates optimize their feeding efficiency by designating a specific portion of the cell surface as a 'mouth', and optimal cilia coverage varies by life strategy: for sessile ciliates, prey encounter is most efficient when cilia are arranged in bands around oral structures while ciliates that swim display diverse ciliary arrangements that meet the cell's nutritional needs. Importantly, beyond a threshold of doubling nutrient uptake, further increases in feeding flux do not seem to be a dominant selective force in cell design.

### Transcriptomic landscape of atlantic salmon (salmo salar L.) skin [^113DuL9d]. G3 (2023). Medium credibility.

Transcriptional profiling of the skin

We further investigated the transcriptional profile of the tissue clusters. Using Fish I as an example, the avg. number of genes in a cluster was 235 (median 246). However, the number of genes assigned to a cluster varied between 8 DEGs for operculum and loose connective tissue and 507 DEGs for skin epithelial tissue. We further searched for unique genes within the clusters of a sample (Supplementary File 1). Here, unique means DEGs only being expressed in 1 cluster. For the skin tissues, the number of unique genes ranged from 18% in epithelial cluster of the pectoral fin to 0.5% in the epithelial tissue of operculum fin. Further, only 1 sample had muscle attached to the skin. The muscle tissue cluster had the highest number of unique genes (71%) compared with the epithelial and connective tissue of the skin in the same sample. In terms of validation of the technique, it is expected that muscle tissue, which is a different tissue type, and not present in the fins, stands out in terms of gene expression.

Furthermore, the interrelationships among the transcriptomic profiles of tissue clusters revealed that epithelial clusters exhibited the broadest nodes (Fig. 6), indicating similarities in the transcriptome across different body sites. Conversely, multiple connections were observed between the dermal tissue clusters (Fig. 6), suggesting greater disparities in the transcriptome within dermal connective tissues at different body locations. It is important to note that in spatial transcriptomics, the composition of specific tissues or cell types present in a sample depends on the plane of the tissue section and the distribution of cell types within that plane. Therefore, given that epithelial tissue predominantly consists of keratinocytes and mucous cells, a more comparable transcriptional pattern would be anticipated compared with dermal connective tissues, which encompass a diverse array of cell types with distinct functions and gene expression patterns, in which structure and function varies with body site.

### Convergent shifts in host-associated microbial communities across environmentally elicited phenotypes [^115z9CGU]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

A system to test the hypothesis that host-associated microbial communities are phenotype specific are the feeding (planktotrophic) larvae of marine invertebrates. Planktotrophic larvae require exogenous nutrients to progress through development and undergo metamorphosis. The abundance and distribution of phytoplankton in coastal seas are spatially and temporally heterogeneous and often diluted in offshore waters. Several groups of planktotrophic larvae, including echinoids (phylum Echinodermata, class Echinoidea), respond to heterogeneous feeding environments by exhibiting morphological plasticity. When experiencing starvation, larvae allocate energetic resources from development of the larval body toward the structures for ingestion (i.e. post-oral arms) while absorbing stomach tissues, enabling larvae to increase their feeding capacity in low food environments –. The role of and responses by the associated microbial community along this morphological continuum remains unknown, even though echinoderm larvae associate with diverse microbial communitiesand encounter tremendous numbers of environmental microbiota.

While within-species comparisons may discern the potential values of phenotypic plasticity, comparisons of conserved responses between closely related species to common environmental variation provides a broader inference for characterizing shared and species-specific adaptive responses. Here we use larvae of three confamilial echinoid species(Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Mesocentrotus franciscanus, and S. droebachiensis; Supplementary Fig. 1 A-C) that differ in their expression of plasticity, in order to test the hypothesis that the associated microbial community co-varies with expression and magnitude of morphological plasticity. Through a series of differential feeding experiments paired with sequence-based analysis of the associated bacterial community, we provide evidence that the microbiome shifts following the expression of phenotypic plasticity and the magnitude to which this character is expressed.

### Extensive differences in gene expression between symbiotic and aposymbiotic cnidarians [^1159iEJa]. G3 (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the great ecological importance of cnidarian–dinoflagellate symbioses, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which these relationships are established, maintained, or disrupted. This situation has resulted in part from the difficulties inherent in studying corals directly. Thus, we and others have turned to the small sea anemone Aiptasia, which is normally symbiotic with dinoflagellates closely related to those found in corals but offers many experimental advantages. In particular, Aiptasia lacks the calcareous skeleton that hinders biochemical and microscopic analyses of corals, grows rapidly by asexual reproduction under standard aquarium conditions to form large clonal populations, can be induced to spawn and produce larvae throughout the year in the laboratory (S. F. Perez and J. R. Pringle, unpublished data), and (importantly for this study) can be maintained indefinitely in an aposymbiotic (bleached) state so long as it is fed regularly.

The intracellular localization of the dinoflagellate (Figure 1) raises some key questions about regulation of the symbiosis. First, how does the host recognize, take up, and maintain appropriate symbionts without generating a deleterious immune response that could result in a failure of algal uptake, digestion of the algae after uptake, or apoptosis of the host cells? Second, what metabolites do the two organisms exchange across the symbiosome membrane, and how? It seems likely that the symbiotic state involves both transporters and regulation of metabolic pathways that are distinct from those found in aposymbiotic animals. Third, what changes in transport occur at other membranes? For example, although both gastrodermal and epidermal cells in aposymbiotic anemones presumably excrete ammonium as a toxic waste product, as do other aquatic invertebrates, at least some of that ammonium must be redirected to the dinoflagellates in symbiotic anemones. Particularly intriguing questions are how the epidermal tissue layer is nourished (as it lacks both dinoflagellate symbionts and direct access to food particles in the gastric cavity) and whether the nature and mechanisms of this nourishment change upon the establishment of symbiosis.

### The microbiome in allergic disease: current understanding and future opportunities-2017 PRACTALL document of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology and the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology [^114zEFHN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Microbial ecology — Trillions of microbes colonize the skin and mucosal body surfaces and are highly adapted to survive within complex community structures requiring nutrients from other microbes and host processes. Many bacterial species within these communities lack genes essential in other environments while possessing genes that benefit the host, suggesting symbiotic coevolution; these communities evolve within a host from birth to maintain a homeostatic balance with the host's immune system and are influenced by adaptive and innate immune responses, diet, medication, toxin exposure, infection, and illness. Given the potentially vast number of interactions among microbes, diet or nutrients, host metabolism, immune responses, and xenobiotics, it has been extremely difficult to model population dynamics experimentally.

### Mucosal immunoglobulins at respiratory surfaces mark an ancient association that predates the emergence of tetrapods [^1123Z277]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Gas-exchange structures are critical for acquiring oxygen, but they also represent portals for pathogen entry. Local mucosal immunoglobulin responses against pathogens in specialized respiratory organs have only been described in tetrapods. Since fish gills are considered a mucosal surface, we hypothesized that a dedicated mucosal immunoglobulin response would be generated within its mucosa on microbial exposure. Supporting this hypothesis, here we demonstrate that following pathogen exposure, IgT(+) B cells proliferate and generate pathogen-specific IgT within the gills of fish, thus providing the first example of locally induced immunoglobulin in the mucosa of a cold-blooded species. Moreover, we demonstrate that gill microbiota is predominantly coated with IgT, thus providing previously unappreciated evidence that the microbiota present at a respiratory surface of a vertebrate is recognized by a mucosal immunoglobulin. Our findings indicate that respiratory surfaces and mucosal immunoglobulins are part of an ancient association that predates the emergence of tetrapods.

### Extensive differences in gene expression between symbiotic and aposymbiotic cnidarians [^113sQq7i]. G3 (2014). Low credibility.

Fatty-acid metabolism and transport:

Our previous study of the transfer of fixed carbon from the dinoflagellates to the host was more comprehensive in its evaluation of polar than of nonpolar compounds. Thus, it is conceivable that the upregulation of genes encoding proteins of fatty-acid metabolism and transport reflects a significant role of fatty acids in this transfer (Figure 7F). Importantly, however, (1) we saw upregulation of genes of both fatty-acid synthesis and fatty-acid breakdown (suggesting that gastrodermal and epidermal cells may be behaving differently) and (2) in most animals, high levels of glucose (such as those expected in the cytoplasm of gastrodermal cells harboring dinoflagellates) inhibit β-oxidation and stimulate fatty-acid synthesis. Thus, we think it more likely that gastrodermal cells synthesize fatty acids from the glucose provided by the dinoflagellates during the day (Figure 7G), store them in neutral fats or wax esters, and subsequently mobilize them to serve as an energy supply at night and/or for transfer into the mesoglea (Figure 7H) and thence into the epidermal cells (Figure 7I). The epidermal cells would metabolize the fatty acids by β-oxidation (Figure 7J) to provide energy and acetyl-CoA building blocks. The apparent upregulation of the glyoxylate cycle (Figure 7K) (see Results) would be explained by the need of the epidermal cells to synthesize carbohydrates, amino acids, and other compounds from acetyl-CoA. Testing of these hypotheses should be possible by immunolocalization of the relevant proteins, in situ mRNA hybridization, and/or examination of gene expression in separated gastrodermal and epidermal tissue layers.

### Amphibian gut microbiota shifts differentially in community structure but converges on habitat-specific predicted functions [^112KWxkB]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Complex microbial communities inhabit vertebrate digestive systems but thorough understanding of the ecological dynamics and functions of host-associated microbiota within natural habitats is limited. We investigate the role of environmental conditions in shaping gut and skin microbiota under natural conditions by performing a field survey and reciprocal transfer experiments with salamander larvae inhabiting two distinct habitats (ponds and streams). We show that gut and skin microbiota are habitat-specific, demonstrating environmental factors mediate community structure. Reciprocal transfer reveals that gut microbiota, but not skin microbiota, responds differentially to environmental change. Stream-to-pond larvae shift their gut microbiota to that of pond-to-pond larvae, whereas pond-to-stream larvae change to a community structure distinct from both habitat controls. Predicted functions, however, match that of larvae from the destination habitats in both cases. Thus, microbial function can be matched without taxonomic coherence and gut microbiota appears to exhibit metagenomic plasticity.

### The biogeographic differentiation of algal microbiomes in the upper ocean from pole to pole [^115wvpTY]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Phytoplankton are a diverse group of largely photoautotrophic microorganisms encompassing algae and cyanobacteria, contributing approximately half of the annual global carbon fixation. Although the interconnected oceans generally do not limit their global dispersal – many studies have shown that their local diversity is correlated with geographical partitioning based on either oceanographic fronts that separate populations or larger-scale ecosystem gradients such as the latitude gradient in local species diversity –. However, there is also evidence that environmental and ecological selection in geographically well-defined and seemingly unstructured marine ecosystems likely plays a role in generating and maintaining microbial diversity. Regardless as to whether inter or intra-specific variations are being considered to explain microbial diversity patterns in the global ocean, two variables usually explain most of the relatedness between species and populations, respectively: temperature and whole-community chlorophyll a. Temperature is known to be a strong selecting agent evidenced by thermal tolerance limits according to the geographic origin of species. Furthermore, temperature together with salinity and the flow of currents creates ecological boundaries in the upper ocean such as oceanographic fronts, which might impact the structure and evolution of inter and intra-specific diversity across spatio-temporal scales. Chlorophyll a on the other hand, which is a proxy for the biomass of phytoplankton, suggests that ecological selection is at play via interactions with organisms that benefit from phytoplankton and vice versa. Besides herbivores such as copepods and krill, heterotrophic microbes such as bacteria and archaea are among those groups with significant interactions with phytoplankton. Some of them even form intimate relationships including mutualism and symbiosis. The space where most of the interactions between phytoplankton and heterotrophic prokaryotes take place is the phycosphere, a microscale mucus region that is rich in organic matter surrounding a phytoplankton cell analogous to the rhizosphere in plants. Thus, organic matter released by phytoplankton are used as substrates for prokaryotes, which sometimes provide essential bioactive compounds in return, such as vitamin B12. About 60% of examined heterokont microalgae (e.g. diatoms) require vitamin B12 that is synthesized by bacteria and archaea. Thus, those bacteria have formed a mutualistic relationship with phytoplankton that potentially help to sustain primary productivity in many parts of the global ocean. There is also evidence for species-specific diversity of algal microbiomes. Often, it is the phytoplankton partner that recruits heterotrophic microbes via the secretion of infochemicals, which elicits a response from the other microbes. As these signalling processes can be species-specific and likely have co-evolved in association with responding partners, algal microbiomes are complex and dynamic and their diversity might be either driven by ecological or environmental selection, generating and maintaining these intimate relationships over space and evolutionary time.

### Defining the ecological strategies of phytoplankton associated bacteria [^112YN87i]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Intricate mosaics of inter-species interactions shape environmental microbiomes and their influence on ecosystem function. In the marine environment, one of the most important inter-microbial relationships occurs among phytoplankton and bacteria –, whereby ecological partnerships played out at the microscale can govern ecosystem productivity and biogeochemistry. Laboratory experiments have revealed that many phytoplankton-bacteria relationships are underpinned by exchanges of specific metabolites, resulting in mutualistic, commensal, or parasitic interactions –.

Chemical exchanges between phytoplankton and bacteria were initially thought to be based solely on the provision of phytoplankton-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to bacterial associates, which could sometimes be reciprocated by the transfer of remineralized nutrients and vitamins back to the phytoplankton. However, recent studies have started to uncover the tremendous complexity of these interactions and the diversity of chemical currencies exchanged in the establishment and maintenance of these partnerships. Furthermore, many of these associations appear to be species –, or even strain-specific, as well as very dynamic. Indeed, the nature of the interaction can shift (e.g. from mutualism to pathogenicity) according to environmental conditionsor the growth stage of the organism. These metabolite exchanges have been theorised to take place when bacteria are in close spatial proximity to a phytoplankton partner, within the phycosphere, which is the microenvironment directly surrounding phytoplankton cells where the concentration of exuded metabolites can be orders of magnitude higher than the surrounding seawater.

### Probiotic colonization ofskin causes short-term changes in skin microbiomes and gene expression [^113DjomP]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study is the first in amphibians to systematically demonstrate the impact of probiotic application on overall immune system function, supplementing ongoing investigation on the amphibian immune-microbiome interface and amphibian evolutionary ecology more broadly. While many aspects of microbial community structure and innate immunity mechanisms are phylogenetically conserved, understanding mechanisms in amphibian microbial-immune cross-talk is in its infancy with important implications for disease ecology and organismal evolutionary ecology including speciation and extinction. A recent theory proposed by Woodhams et al. coined as the "adaptive microbiome hypothesis" posits that microbial-immune interactions are a process of disease resilience, whereby competitive microbial interactions interact with differential host immunity to select for functions that increase host fitness. An alternative explanation to this adaptive-microbiome hypothesis is a "constrained" microbiome hypothesis, where specific intrinsic factors such as evolutionarily constrained host-associated microbial composition differentially restrict the possibility space of immune responses in a manner that is causally independent from adaptive-selective mechanisms. While our study provides support for both hypotheses, context dependency and future amphibian immune-microbiome studies will help resolve their potential role in wildlife disease outcomes and eco-evolutionary processes.

### Predicting nutrient content of ray-finned fishes using phylogenetic information [^112x5Cpz]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Evolutionary correlation matrix of key variables, log-transformed. Colored cells indicate correlations significant at p < 0.1 (Pearson's r). Lightly shaded top left corner shows correlations between life history variables; darkly shaded bottom right corner shows correlations between nutrient variables. Unshaded top right corner shows correlations between life history and nutrient variables. The variables 'min depth' and 'max depth' refer to habitat preferences. 'Max length' refers to maximum reported length of the species. The variables 'a_lw' and 'b_lw' refer to the scalar and exponential parameters in the length-weight relationship equation W = aL b, wherein W is weight and L is length. 'Trophic level' refers to the weighted mean of the trophic level of the diet of the species. See Table 1 for more details

Patterns are also apparent within the set of nutrients (bottom right corner of Fig. 1, darkly shaded). Fish with more protein tend to contain less Vitamin A and total fat. Fish that are high in total fat also tend to be good sources of Vitamins A, B12, and D. Fish high in iron also tend to be good sources of zinc and all included vitamins. Vitamin A and Vitamin D are positively associated, and the latter is correlated with Vitamin B12. Overall, this set of correlations suggests that specific sets of nutrients tend to cluster together. Given that nutritional analyses, due to cost considerations, tend to focus on a small set of nutrients, such observed correlations may be important for roughly inferring levels of unmeasured nutrients.

Finally, we see that life history parameters, controlling for phylogeny, vary in their association to key nutrients (top right of Fig. 1, unshaded). Fish living at greater oceanic depths contain more total fat and Vitamin A, but less zinc. Longer fish contain proportionally less zinc and Vitamin B12, but more Vitamin A; smaller fish, often overlooked in conservation, livelihoods, and nutrition programs, may be richer sources of key micronutrients.

### Non-additive microbial community responses to environmental complexity [^1111qnwG]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Microbial communities form the basis for an enormous range of biological processes, from cycling of nutrients in the ocean to regulation of human health –. Despite our growing knowledge of community compositions in various biomes – and of the role of individual nutrients in modulating community properties, relatively little is known about how the nutrient complexity of an environment (i.e. the number of different available nutrients) affects community ecology. Understanding this relationship is crucial to disentangling the effects of the environment on natural microbial ecosystems, which are exposed to a multitude of different nutrients, as well as the effects of diet on microbiome structure and function. In the gut microbiome, for example, recent work has highlighted how community composition depends strongly on the diversity of available nutrients –. However, reports in natural ecosystems – and in synthetic microcosms – conflict on how this environmental complexity modulates growth yields and taxonomic diversity, raising questions as to how these relationships vary within and across communities, and hindering nascent efforts to engineer microbiomes with defined functions –.

### Extracellular vesicles-new players in cell-cell communication in aquatic environments [^116sXzVr]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Communication between microorganisms in aquatic environments can influence ecosystem function and determine the structure and composition of microbial populations. This microbial cross talk can be mediated by excretion of specialized metabolites or extracellular vesicles (EVs). Recently it has become apparent that cells across all domains of life produce EVs that may convey specific targeted signals that can modulate cell fate, morphology and susceptibility to viruses. The vast majority of knowledge about EVs is derived from studies of mammalian tissues, parasitic host-pathogen interactions and model bacterial systems. Very little is known about the role of EVs in aquatic environments, although they have potential to influence community structure and trophic-level interactions. We propose functions and ecological implications of communication via EVs in aquatic microbial ecosystems.

### Top consumer abundance influences lake methane efflux [^1166VLyc]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Lakes are important habitats for biogeochemical cycling of carbon. The organization and structure of aquatic communities influences the biogeochemical interactions between lakes and the atmosphere. Understanding how trophic structure regulates ecosystem functions and influences greenhouse gas efflux from lakes is critical to understanding global carbon cycling and climate change. With a whole-lake experiment in which a previously fishless lake was divided into two treatment basins where fish abundance was manipulated, we show how a trophic cascade from fish to microbes affects methane efflux to the atmosphere. Here, fish exert high grazing pressure and remove nearly all zooplankton. This reduction in zooplankton density increases the abundance of methanotrophic bacteria, which in turn reduce CH4 efflux rates by roughly 10 times. Given that globally there are millions of lakes emitting methane, an important greenhouse gas, our findings that aquatic trophic interactions significantly influence the biogeochemical cycle of methane has important implications.

### An artificial intelligence-based model for optimal conjunctive operation of surface and groundwater resources [^114eFnqN]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Symbiotic organisms search (SOS) algorithm

Symbiotic organisms search (SOS) is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, that simulates the interactive behaviors of organisms. Organisms rarely live in isolation due to relying on other species to live and even survive. This trust-based relationship is known as symbiosis. The SOS algorithm simulates interactions in the relationship between two species, in a way that one species searches to find the most suitable organism. Like other population-based algorithms, the SOS algorithm repeatedly generates a population of candidates to find regions as optimal solutions in the whole solution space. This population is equivalent to the optimal release scenarios in each period, in the problem of optimal operation of the reservoirs. The SOS algorithm starts with an initial population called the ecosystem. In the initial ecosystem, a group of organisms (decision variables) is randomly generated in the search space. Each organism as a candidate for the problem solution, which is related to a certain degree of fitness, indicates the degree of adaptation to the desired target (value of the objective function). Almost all meta-heuristic algorithms use a substitution process at each iteration to solve the problem and generate a new solution for the next iteration. In SOS, the generation of a new solution is governed by mimicking the biological interaction between two organisms in the ecosystem. Three phases of mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism, which are like the biological interaction model in the real world, are considered. The identity of each interaction is defined based on the type of interaction. In this way, the two-way profit shows the mutualism phase, the one-sided profit represents the commensalism phase, and the profit of one side and the loss of the other side indicate the parasitic phase. In all phases, each organism randomly interacts with another organism. This process continues until the process termination criterion (reaching the maximum number of iterations) is met. The general process of the algorithm is as follows:

Initialization → Iteration → Mutualism phase → Commensalism phase → Parasitism phase → Process termination after reaching the maximum number of iterations.

### Methane-and dissolved organic carbon-fueled microbial loop supports a tropical subterranean estuary ecosystem [^113oS8dS]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Methane and DOC-derived carbon flow into the anchialine food web is facilitated by trophic interactions between the shrimp and its microbial food source. To examine the biochemical origins of the 13 C-depleted values of the bulk shrimp tissue, we analyzed the composition and carbon isotopic content of FA biomarkers extracted from shrimp with the largest (55%) and smallest (3%) calculated methane contributions (Fig. 5b; Supplementary Table 4). The composition and δ 13 C values of FAs differed substantially between the two shrimp, which is consistent with assimilation of different food and carbon sources. In addition, in both specimens, individual FAs differed in their stable carbon isotopic composition, which is indicative of different biochemical pathways for FA synthesis. Even-chained saturated FAs (C 14:0, C 16:0, and C 18:0) had compound-specific δ 13 C values closely matching the bulk tissue (Fig. 5b), suggesting the shrimp synthesized these compounds de novo from their dietary carbon sources. In contrast, several monounsaturated FAs in both shrimp and methylated FAs in shrimp 1, showed substantially more negative δ 13 C values than the bulk tissue (Fig. 5b), which provides evidence for a dietary source of these compounds through the direct transfer of FAs from ingested bacteria. Given the strong geochemical evidence for aerobic methane oxidation (Fig. 3) in the hypoxic environment, we attribute the source of 13 C-depletion in the FAs primarily to methane carbon derived from methanotrophs. Stable isotope probing experiments using Arctic lake sediments have shown that several compounds present in the shrimp tissue (C 14:0, C 16:1ω7 and C 18:1ω7) are synthesized from methane carbon by methanotrophs that were also present in the cave waters (e.g. Methylococcaceae and Methylocystacea). These FAs and the methylated FAs are also found in other organisms, but are not likely to have the 13 C-depleted isotope signatures observed here. A symbiotic sourceof the incorporated bacterial biomass might also explain the observed FA profiles. However, Typhlatya shrimp appendages capable of direct filter-feeding of bacteria-sized particlessuggest the methanotrophic biomass is incorporated from the environment rather than from symbiotic sources. These observations have significant implications for understanding energy transfer within the anchialine food web. Considering that Typhlatya spp. are one of the most abundant macrofaunal populations in this habitat, and they are the primary prey for predators in the subterranean food web, it is reasonable to assume they have a significant role in transferring methane- and DOC-derived carbon to higher levels of the food web.

### Extensive differences in gene expression between symbiotic and aposymbiotic cnidarians [^113Qn5ey]. G3 (2014). Low credibility.

Coral reefs comprise only a small part of the world's ocean environment but are habitats for a disproportionately large fraction of all marine species. Corals are able to produce the massive and biologically rich reef habitats despite growing in nutrient-poor waters because of the energy acquired through their mutualistic symbiosis with dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. These unicellular algae inhabit the symbiosomes (phagosome-derived vacuoles) of gastrodermal cells in corals and other cnidarians (Figure 1) and transfer up to 95% of their photosynthetically fixed carbon to the host. Reef-building corals are declining worldwide due largely to anthropogenic causes, which include pollution, destructive fishing practices, and increasing sea-surface temperatures. Such stresses can lead to coral "bleaching", in which the algae lose their photosynthetic capacity and/or are lost altogether by the host. In severe cases, bleaching can result in the death of the host. The threat of bleaching is particularly alarming because many corals already live near the upper limits of their thermal tolerances, and most climate-change models predict that these tolerances will be exceeded frequently in the coming decades, leading to widespread coral death and a resulting loss of the reef habitats.

The spatial organization of cnidarian–dinoflagellate symbiosis. A simplified schematic diagram of a section of cnidarian body wall is shown; note that the drawing is not to scale (e.g. the dinoflagellate typically fills most of the symbiosome). The two major tissue layers are the epiderm, which faces the outside sea water and lacks both dinoflagellate symbionts and direct access to food in the gastric cavity, and the gastroderm, which faces the gastric cavity and may contain dinoflagellate symbionts in some of its cells. These two cell layers are separated by the largely acellular mesoglea. After phagocytosis by a host gastrodermal cell, the dinoflagellate resides within a "symbiosome" (believed to be derived from a phagosome that does not fuse with lysosomes) and transfers fixed carbon to the host.

### Biological invasions as a selective filter driving behavioral divergence [^1154FVpu]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Activity

To measure activity levels, skinks were randomly collected from their housing containers by hand and placed in an experimental arena (550 × 320 mm) marked with 20 equal grid squares (110 × 80 mm). Skinks were acclimated for 10 min in a transparent plastic container placed in the centre of the arena. This transparent container allowed skinks to become familiar with their surroundings prior to the start of behavioral trials. After acclimation, the transparent container was removed by hand and skinks were allowed to move freely in the arena for 20 min. We scored activity as the number of transitions between grid squares made by the skink. A lizard was considered to have transitioned between grid squares when their center of mass crossed the line separating two squares.

Exploration

To measure an individual's exploratory tendency, skinks were collected and placed by hand into an experimental arena (550 × 320 mm; see Activity section for details) containing a novel opaque barrier (width = 320 mm; height = 300 mm). The barrier was placed approximately 365 mm from one end of the arena (i.e. 2/3rds down the arena) and acted as a wall that divided the arena into a large (zone 1) and small (zone 2) zone. Two small gaps were located at either end of the barrier that enabled lizards to squeeze through and enter the second zone. Thus, skinks could only enter the second zone by exploring the novel barrier and finding the small gaps. At the beginning of the exploration trial, skinks were left to acclimate for 10 min in a transparent plastic container placed in the center of zone 1. After acclimation, skinks were allowed to move freely for 20 min. We measured exploratory tendency as the amount of time a skink spent exploring the barrier and the number of times that skinks passed the barrier. Skinks were considered to be exploring the barrier when they were actively moving while in contact with the barrier. Similarly, lizards were recorded as having crossed the barrier once their center of mass passed through the barrier gap separating the two zones. The amount of time exploring the barrier was highly correlated to the number of times the skink passed into zone 2. We, therefore, used the total time spent exploring the barrier as our measure of exploration, in line with previous studies in Lampropholis skinks.

### Multivariate extremes in lakes [^115zuB4Q]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Individually, each of the extreme events described in this study can have considerable, and diverse, impacts on lake ecosystems, as well as more broadly. For example, while some littoral communities are adapted to periodic drying and flooding and even rely on these perturbations to support life history stages, anomalous littoral exposure that occurs during extreme low water events can degrade nearshore habitat structure, alter biotic community composition, and impact critical lake ecological functions. Critically, changes in water level can directly affect the availability of habitat for various organisms, particularly those dependent on shoreline areas for breeding, foraging, or shelter. In extreme cases, dramatic shifts in water levels can even result in the loss of critical habitats and the displacement of sensitive species. A reduction in water level can also increase the amount of sunlight reaching deeper waters, leading to a change in dominant primary producers with cascading effects at higher trophic levels. Furthermore, dramatic declines in lake level and surface water extent can influence human activity, with already vulnerable communities having to travel greater distances to reach freshwater. It can also influence the local climate, as well as greenhouse gas emissions from lakes. Regarding lake heatwaves, recent studies have suggested that an increase in their frequency can have a detrimental influence on aquatic organisms by exposing them to unprecedented temperatures, which can be particularly fatal for species that live in regions close to their critical thermal maximum. Specifically, when temperatures more frequently exceed critical levels, organism traits such as embryonic development, growth, or heat tolerance can be severely affected. Extreme temperatures have even been described as potentially having a disproportionate impact on species relative to gradual, long-term temperature change. An increase in surface water temperature during a lake heatwave can also result in other critical changes, such as a decline in dissolved oxygen concentrations at the lake surface due to reduced gas solubility and at depth due to stronger and longer lasting thermal stratification. Finally, algal blooms can have a devastating impact on lake ecosystems. For example, blooms of algae in freshwaters can produce potent toxins, potentially making water bodies unsafe for recreational activities and threatening the health of humans, pets, or livestock that use affected waters. These blooms are often produced by cyanobacteria which can cause a range of health problems, from minor skin irritations to severe stomach upsets, and can even lead to death. However, even if algal blooms are non-toxic, they can negatively impact aquatic life by, for example, irritating or even clogging fish gills causing suffocation and blocking out sunlight from reaching deeper water. The latter can reduce photosynthesis, ultimately leading to a decrease in the concentration of dissolved oxygen available to support aquatic life. In addition, when algae eventually die and decompose, they consume oxygen in the water, causing dead zones that can be inhospitable for many organisms. The detrimental effects of algal blooms can ripple throughout the ecosystem, impacting not only water quality but also the availability of resources for other species, such as zooplankton and fish.

### Convergent shifts in host-associated microbial communities across environmentally elicited phenotypes [^1147GBr5]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Morphological plasticity is a genotype-by-environment interaction that enables organisms to increase fitness across varying environments. Symbioses with diverse microbiota may aid in acclimating to this variation, but whether the associated bacteria community is phenotype specific remains understudied. Here we induce morphological plasticity in three species of sea urchin larvae and measure changes in the associated bacterial community. While each host species has unique bacterial communities, the expression of plasticity results in the convergence on a phenotype-specific microbiome that is, in part, driven by differential association with α- and γ-proteobacteria. Furthermore, these results suggest that phenotype-specific signatures are the product of the environment and are correlated with ingestive and digestive structures. By manipulating diet quantity over time, we also show that differentially associating with microbiota along a phenotypic continuum is bidirectional. Taken together, our data support the idea of a phenotype-specific microbial community and that phenotypic plasticity extends beyond a genotype-by-environment interaction.

However, each of these barriers are liable to damage under certain conditions. Contaminants can penetrate to the inner body through the skin by dissolving the layer of wax that we have covering our oil glands. The GI Tract is also very vulnerable to compounds that are soluble and can be easily absorbed and taken into the body cells. Refer to Handout 2.

- The digestive tract. stratum corneum. This is the structure that determines the rate of absorption of substances through the epidermis. For example, a pesticide such as Malathion, which easily penetrates the stratum corneum, moves quickly through the other layers of the skin and is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. DDT, another type of pesticide, does not easily penetrate the stratum corneum, so the rate of absorption is much slower.
- Dermis.

The inner layer of the skin is sometimes referred to as the true skin. In animal hides, this is the layer that turns to leather when chemically processed. The dermis is the source of oxygen and of nutrients for the epidermis. The hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands are found in this layer. These structures play a limited role in the absorption of substances across the skin.
- Subcutaneous fatty tissue. This layer provides a cushion for the underlying structures and allows the skin to move to some extent. Factors affecting dermal absorption of toxic substances include
- The condition of the skin. An intact stratum corneum is an effective barrier to absorption of toxic chemicals. However, physical damage to the protective barrier, such as a cut or abrasion, allows toxic substances to penetrate the epidermis and enter the dermis where they more readily enter the bloodstream and are carried to other parts of the body. __some__.
- The chemical make up of the substance. Inorganic chemicals and substances are not easily absorbed through intact, healthy skin (such as cadmium, lead, mercury, and chromium. Organic chemicals dissolved in water do not easily penetrate the skin because the skin is impermeable to water. However, organic solvents, such as paint thinner or gasoline, are easily absorbed through the epidermis.
- Increasing the concentration of the toxic substance or the exposure time can increase the rate or amount of material absorbed.

### Phylogenomics uncovers early hybridization and adaptive loci shaping the radiation of lake tanganyika cichlid fishes [^111aEQ17]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Diet is a major force shaping the evolution of opsins

The molecular evolution of cone-opsins (colour vision) was analysed in further detail. The genotype–phenotype association in cone opsins is straightforward, the phenotypic consequences of amino acid replacements are well understood and extensive work on cichlid opsinsprovides a solid basis for the interpretation of our results. Sites at chromophore-binding pockets are highly variable in all cone-opsin genes (Fig. 4b) and often under positive selection (Supplementary Table 7). This suggests the occurrence of structural changes in the studied opsins, which can potentially shift spectral sensitivity. However, direct evidence for changes in spectral sensitivity would require microspectrophotometry and functional validation experiments.

Six out of the seven opsin genes showed faster rates of positive selection in the Lake Tanganyika species flock (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 10) suggesting that this adaptive radiation coincided with the diversification of the visual system. For the seventh gene lws, a model showing deceleration of positive selection in the Lake Tanganyika flock followed by acceleration in Haplochromini fitted the data best. According to AIC, CmC considering divergent rates associated with ecological traits explained sequence variation better than neutral models in five out of seven opsins (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 11). In four out of these five genes, diet had the highest explanatory power among all tested ecological and life history factors (Fig. 4c). For example, planktivorous cichlids display faster rates of evolution for the UV-sensitive opsin sws1, in agreement with the observed higher expression of this gene when compared to other cichlids. This finding agrees with the fact that increased UV sensitivity would confer higher efficiency in foraging on plankton, which is translucent except under UV light. In contrast, cichlids grazing on Aufwuchs (algae adhering to open surfaces and other small organisms and organic matter attached to them) show the fastest rates in the green-sensitive opsin rh2a-α. CmC allowing different rates in shallow-dwelling versus deep-dwelling cichlids fit data best for lws (absorption λ max ~565 nm) and second best for sws1 (absorption λ max ~375 nm), in both cases shallow-dwelling cichlids having faster rates of positive selection. In contrast, deep-water dwellers had higher rates for sws2b (absorption λ max ~425 nm). This makes sense given that UV and red light are diminished from the light spectrum in deep water. This evidence further agrees with the pseudogenization of sws1 in the deep-water tribe Bathybatini (all individuals had premature stop codons). Despite notable differences in AIC with other models, CmC partitioning for depth was not significant for lws after Benjamini-Hochberg correction. These results, together with previous studies that found divergent evolution in the dim light opsin rh1 between deep and shallow water Tanganyika cichlids, support depth as an important driver in the evolution of colour-sensitive opsins. CmC models accounting for differences between species with and without sex-related colour dimorphism and between substrate- versus mouth-breeding cichlids fit data significantly better than the null model (neutral evolution) only for short wavelength sensitive opsin genes (absorption λ max < 470 nm). In all cases, sexually monomorphic and substrate-breeding species had faster rates than sexually dimorphic or mouth-brooding cichlids (Supplementary Table 11). The molecular evolutionary analyses of the 29 selected innovation-associated loci revealed interesting patterns connected to cichlid adaptive radiations, ecology and life history, but the generality of such results will need to be confirmed, refuted, or adjusted using larger genome-wide approaches such as genome re-sequencing.

Our study offers important new insights into gut bacterial community dynamics of amphibians, an understudied host group, under natural conditions. We find that gut bacterial community structure of salamander larvae is habitat-specific, demonstrating that abiotic and biotic environmental factors mediate community structure. In addition, although skin communities shift in response to environmental change to simply match the community structure of the destination habitat controls, gut communities reach habitat-specific functionality by shifting in two distinct ways (matching and non-matching taxonomic shifts) depending on the directionality of transfer.

### Continental-scale nutrient and contaminant delivery by pacific salmon [^115uTjd2]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Species-specific transport patterns

The five species of Pacific salmon have inherently dissimilar patterns in their nutrient versus contaminant transport potential due to differences in their life history (that is, time to maturation) and trophic ecology (that is, diet and relative trophic positions) –. Furthermore, there is a categorical distinction in the behaviour of nutrients and PBT contaminants in aquatic food webs; nutrient concentrations are approximately proportional to fish size (that is, expressed as percentage of body weight)whereas concentrations of PBT contaminants are expected to increase with fish size and trophic position (that is, bioaccumulate and biomagnify). We examined the interactions among these factors to explore species-specific influence on nutrient and contaminant transport patterns and how those patterns vary with changes in the Pacific salmon community over time.

Rubidium Eluate Level Testing:

Set a dose calibrator for Rb 82 as recommended by the manufacturer or use the Co-60 setting and divide the reading obtained by 0.548. Obtain the reading from the instrument in millicuries.
Elute the generator with 50 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection and discard the eluate (first elution).
Allow at least 10 minutes for the regeneration of Rb 82, then elute the generator with 50 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection at a rate of 50 mL/min and collect the eluate in a stoppered glass vial (plastic containers are not suitable). Note the exact time of end of elution (E.O.E.).
Using the dose calibrator, determine the activity of Rb 82 and note the time of the reading. Correct the reading for decay to the E.O.E. using the appropriate decay factor for Rb 82 (see Table 1). Note: If the reading is taken 2 ½ minutes after end of elution, multiply the dose calibrator reading by 4 to correct for decay.
Using the sample obtained for the Rb 82 activity determination, allow the sample to stand for at least one hour to allow for the complete decay of Rb 82.
Measure the activity of the sample in a dose calibrator at the setting recommended by the manufacturer for Rb 82 and/or Sr 82. As an alternative, use the Co-60 setting and the reading obtained divided by 0.548. Set the instrument to read in microcuries and record in the display.
Calculate the ratio (R) of Sr 85/Sr 82 on the day (post-calibration) of the measurement using the ratio of Sr 85/Sr 82 on the day of calibration provided on the generator label and the Sr 85/Sr 82 Ratio Factor from Table 2. Determine R using the following equation:
Use a correction factor (F) of 0.478 to compensate for the contribution of Sr 85 to the reading.
Calculate the amount of Sr 82 in the sample using the following equation:
Determine if Sr 82 in the eluate exceeds an Alert or Expiration Limit by dividing the microCi of Sr 82 by the mCi of Rb 82 at End of Elution (see below for further instructions based on the Sr 82 level)
Determine if Sr 85 in the eluate exceeds an Alert or Expiration Limit by multiplying the result obtained in step 10 by (R) as calculated in step 7 (above).
