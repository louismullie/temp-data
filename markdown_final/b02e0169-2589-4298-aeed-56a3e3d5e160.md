## Question

Is calcitonin indicated for an appendiceal abscess?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether calcitonin is indicated for an appendiceal abscess. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the distinction between calcitonin (the hormone/medication) and procalcitonin (the infection biomarker). Then, I should review guideline-based management of appendiceal abscess and check explicitly if calcitonin appears anywhere. Next, I will consider how procalcitonin may be used in appendicitis care if the term was used in error. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, evidence-based recommendation for therapy and monitoring, making sure no therapeutic role is being missed for calcitonin in this context, given that calcitonin regulates calcium homeostasis while procalcitonin reflects bacterial inflammation.

> Wait, let me verify the fundamental distinction so we do not conflate terms. Calcitonin is a 32–amino-acid peptide secreted by thyroid C cells; clinically it is used for bone-related indications such as Paget's disease and, historically, hypercalcemia, and it has no established role in diagnosing or treating infections or intra-abdominal abscesses [^115c9FDy] [^113EoKvg] [^113WiudP]. Procalcitonin, by contrast, is the 116–amino-acid precursor that rises with bacterial infections and sepsis; it is employed as a diagnostic and antimicrobial-stewardship biomarker rather than as a therapeutic agent [^111GpHGM] [^114WA4oq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — before declaring "no role", I should check authoritative guidelines for appendiceal abscess to see if calcitonin appears at all. I will now examine contemporary, high-credibility guidance from WSES, EAES, and EAST as well as broader intra-abdominal infection guidance, and none include calcitonin in any treatment pathway for periappendiceal abscess or phlegmon [^115Eoa82] [^114Ubvvk] [^111jAPff] [^112rSHqM] [^115Eoa82]. Let me first confirm this across sources: WSES 2020 emphasizes antibiotics with or without percutaneous drainage or laparoscopic surgery in experienced hands; there is no mention of calcitonin as therapy for abscess or sepsis in this setting [^115Eoa82] [^114Ubvvk].

> Next, I should review the standard of care for an appendiceal abscess to ensure I'm not overlooking an adjunct where calcitonin might have been proposed. The evidence-based approach is nonoperative management with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and image-guided percutaneous drainage when feasible, or upfront laparoscopic management in experienced centers; early laparoscopy can reduce readmissions and additional interventions compared with conservative therapy in selected patients, but it carries risks of bowel resection in a minority, and decisions should be individualized [^115Eoa82] [^117R5Rff] [^113YfmMh]. I need to ensure antibiotic transitions align with the clinical course; guidelines support initial IV therapy with step-down to oral agents as patients improve clinically, with source control via drainage when accessible [^115Eoa82] [^1137vn9y].

> Let me consider whether the user might have meant procalcitonin rather than calcitonin. I should double-check the diagnostic characteristics: procalcitonin levels tend to be higher in complicated appendicitis such as abscess or perforation, but the test characteristics vary with the cutoff, for example specificity around 95% but sensitivity only 29% at 0.5 ng/mL, and sensitivity around 85% but specificity only 30% at 0.05 ng/mL, underscoring that PCT is an adjunct and not definitive on its own [^111GpHGM]. But wait, what if someone is using PCT to guide antibiotic stewardship in surgical patients? That is reasonable in broader surgical infection pathways; still, it remains a biomarker to support decisions about starting, continuing, or discontinuing antibiotics — not a treatment for the abscess itself [^114WA4oq] [^111fpyHC].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could calcitonin have any plausible anti-inflammatory or antimicrobial mechanism that might justify off-label use here? Let me verify the pharmacology and labeled uses. Calcitonin acts via high-affinity calcitonin receptors with downstream cAMP/PKA and other pathways to acutely inhibit osteoclast activity; its approved clinical use is bone-related, and no infectious disease indication exists on the FDA label or in endocrine references for intra-abdominal infections or abscess therapy, making a therapeutic role in appendiceal abscess implausible [^117BenPZ] [^113WiudP] [^112632Xm]. I should confirm: infection-related elevations discussed in endocrine reviews refer to procalcitonin physiology rather than a therapeutic effect of calcitonin, so using calcitonin to treat an abscess would be a category error [^115c9FDy].

> I need to ensure the downstream management implications are clear. For a periappendiceal abscess, prioritize appropriate-spectrum antibiotics, obtain image-guided drainage when accessible, consider early laparoscopic management in experienced centers, and avoid routine interval appendectomy after successful nonoperative management unless clinical factors warrant it; none of these steps includes calcitonin as a therapy [^115Eoa82] [^112rSHqM] [^117R5Rff]. If procalcitonin was intended, use it only as an adjunctive biomarker to complement clinical assessment and imaging; do not substitute it for guideline-concordant treatment or source control [^111GpHGM] [^114WA4oq].

> Bottom line, after reviewing the biology, labels, and guideline-based care, I should conclude unequivocally: calcitonin is not indicated for appendiceal abscess, whereas standard care is antibiotics with or without percutaneous drainage or laparoscopic surgery depending on expertise and patient factors; if the term was meant to be procalcitonin, it serves as a diagnostic and stewardship biomarker with limited standalone accuracy, not a treatment [^115Eoa82] [^114Ubvvk] [^111GpHGM] [^114WA4oq].

---

Calcitonin is **not used for appendiceal abscess**; it is a calcium-regulating hormone with no role in this condition [^115c9FDy]. Management of appendiceal abscess involves **antibiotics and drainage** [^115Eoa82] or surgery [^117R5Rff], not calcitonin [^112dJtJ3] [^114Ubvvk]. Calcitonin is not a biomarker for appendiceal abscess; procalcitonin can help assess infection severity but is not specific to appendicitis [^111GpHGM] [^111fpyHC]. There is no evidence or guideline support for its use in appendiceal abscess [^1119pt5R].

---

## Pharmacological properties and clinical uses of calcitonin

Calcitonin is a 32-amino-acid peptide hormone produced by thyroid C cells that lowers serum calcium by inhibiting osteoclasts and increasing renal calcium excretion [^117BenPZ]. It is used for osteoporosis, Paget's disease, and hypercalcemia of malignancy, **not for intra-abdominal infections or abscesses** [^113WiudP].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical presentation of appendiceal abscess

An appendiceal abscess is a localized collection of pus resulting from perforated appendicitis, presenting with right lower quadrant pain, fever, leukocytosis, and a palpable mass [^116ZnbaQ]. Management includes **antibiotics, percutaneous drainage, or surgery**, depending on patient factors and resources [^112dJtJ3] [^114Ubvvk].

---

## Current clinical guidelines for appendiceal abscess management

Guidelines recommend initial nonoperative management with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage when feasible, with laparoscopic surgery as an alternative when expertise is available [^114Ubvvk] [^115Eoa82] [^117R5Rff] [^112dJtJ3]. Calcitonin is **not mentioned in any guideline** for appendiceal abscess management.

---

## Evidence regarding calcitonin use in appendiceal abscess

There is **no evidence supporting calcitonin** for appendiceal abscess. Calcitonin is neither an antibiotic nor an anti-inflammatory agent for intra-abdominal infections, and no studies or trials support its use in this context.

---

## Biomarkers in appendiceal abscess management

Calcitonin is **not a biomarker** for appendiceal abscess [^115c9FDy]. Procalcitonin, a precursor, can help assess infection severity but is not specific to appendicitis or abscess [^111GpHGM] [^111fpyHC]. It is a biomarker, not a treatment [^114WA4oq].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of calcitonin

Calcitonin can cause nausea, vomiting, flushing, hypersensitivity, and, rarely, anaphylaxis. These risks are **unacceptable** in the absence of evidence of benefit in appendiceal abscess [^114uVktG].

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

Standard treatments (antibiotics, drainage, surgery) are **effective and evidence-based** for appendiceal abscess [^117R5Rff] [^112dJtJ3]. Calcitonin lacks evidence of efficacy and is not recommended [^114Ubvvk].

---

## Clinical scenarios where calcitonin might be considered

There are **no clinical scenarios in which calcitonin is appropriate** for appendiceal abscess. Its use is limited to bone and calcium disorders, not intra-abdominal infections.

---

Calcitonin is **not used for appendiceal abscess**; management involves antibiotics, drainage, or surgery. There is no evidence or guideline support for calcitonin in this condition [^115Eoa82].

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis: 2020 update of the WSES Jerusalem guidelines [^114Ubvvk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

The WSES 2020 guidelines address specific circumstances involving intra-abdominal abscesses, particularly in patients with periappendiceal abscesses. They recommend considering laparoscopic surgery as the treatment of choice for patients with complicated appendicitis characterized by phlegmon or abscess, especially when advanced laparoscopic expertise is available. A low threshold for conversion is advised.

### Diagnostic role of procalcitonin in patients with suspected appendicitis [^111GpHGM]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of procalcitonin (PCT) in emergency department (ED) patients with suspected appendicitis.

- **Methods**: A prospective observational study was carried out in the emergency department of a university hospital between July 2007 and June 2008. Adult patients who presented to the ED with clinically suspected appendicitis were enrolled. Each patient underwent serum PCT, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Alvarado score evaluation on admission. The results of these three measurements were analyzed in relation to the final diagnosis determined by histopathological findings or compatible computed tomography findings.

- **Results**: Of the 214 study patients, 113 (52.8%) had a confirmed diagnosis of appendicitis, and 58 had complicated appendicitis (phlegmon, perforation, or gangrene). For the diagnosis of appendicitis, the area under the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve is 0.74 for Alvarado score, 0.69 for PCT, and 0.61 for CRP. Overall, the Alvarado score has the best discriminative capability among the three tested markers. We adopted two cutoff point approaches to harness both ends of the diagnostic value of a biomarker. PCT levels were significantly higher in patients with complicated appendicitis. For the diagnosis of complicated appendicitis, a cutoff value of 0.5 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 29% and a specificity of 95%, while a cutoff value of 0.05 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 30% in diagnosing complicated appendicitis.

For those with a PCT value in the gray zone, clinical findings may be key in guiding diagnosis.

- **Methods**: RCTs that compared antibiotic treatment with appendicectomy in patients with suspected acute non-perforated appendicitis were included. Quasi-RCTs were also included, but only in the sensitivity analysis. Studies with a very high risk of bias, where both the description of methods and the baseline characteristics indicated that many patients randomized were not included, were excluded.

- **Data sources and searches**: The comprehensive search conducted in the 2011 Cochrane systematic review of Wilms and colleagues was updated, extending until June 2011. This consisted of three blocks of search terms for the concepts appendicitis, appendicectomy, and antibiotic treatment, limited by the Cochrane filters for RCTs and the McMaster University Health Information Research Unit Clinical Queries hedges for therapeutic studies. The searches were adapted and run without language restrictions in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from 1 January 2011 to 4 December 2015. PubMed was also searched for in-process citations, and the major clinical trial registries, including the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal (ICTRP), were searched for ongoing trials. Appendix S1 (supporting information) shows details of the search strategy. Additionally, reference lists of other previous systematic reviews comparing antibiotic treatment with appendicectomy in patients with non-perforated appendicitis were searched.

- **Study selection**: Using standard, pilot-tested forms.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: A systematic review [^1145gE6P]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Most trials of conservative treatment used ultrasound or CT imaging to evaluate the diagnosis of appendicitis and exclude patients with findings of perforation or abscess. No consensus exists regarding definitions of complicated appendicitis and its complement, and studies varied regarding specific criteria to distinguish these entities. For example, some studies excluded patients with any evidence of perforation or abscess, while others allowed small lesions (e.g. abscess < 5 cm). This is consistent with a functional definition of uncomplicated appendicitis as appendicitis that would otherwise receive urgent appendectomy, and complicated appendicitis as appendicitis accompanied by a major abscess or phlegmon that would preclude surgery (other than percutaneous drainage) or perforation with diffuse peritonitis that would require urgent operation.

Both ultrasound and CT imaging correlate poorly with operative findings, with one RCT reporting 18% of surgery-randomized patients having complicated appendicitis at operation. However, since antibiotic treatment without surgery is a standard approach for treatment of appendicitis accompanied by a major phlegmon or abscess due to a high success rate and avoidable ileocecectomy, this may not be an important distinction other than the expected response time and a potentially increased risk of occult malignancy. Some RCTs in adults did not use routine imaging, which was associated with a high rate of unnecessary surgery in one study. Patients diagnosed with uncomplicated appendicitis based only on clinical evaluation who do not respond to antibiotics must be considered for further intervention.

### Biomarkers of acute appendicitis: Systematic review and cost-benefit trade-off analysis [^111fpyHC]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Appendicitis continues to pose a diagnostic challenge to emergency physicians and surgeons. Clinical impression remains a crucial tool in diagnosis and treatment allocation for those with suspected appendicitis. As yet, no biomarker has been shown to have sufficient diagnostic performance to be used in isolation clinically. This suggests that further areas of research should focus on the discovery of new diagnostic tests and evaluating their clinical utility, rather than replicating research into previously studied biomarkers. Through this approach, the accuracy of appendicitis diagnosis can be enhanced, reducing the number of negative appendectomies performed. This would also minimize the adverse impact on patients and decrease treatment costs for hospitals.

### Updates on the causes, diagnosis, and management of peritoneal abscesses: A systematic review [^116ZnbaQ]. Cureus (2023). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on intra-abdominal abscesses:

- **Definition**: Intra-abdominal abscesses are localized collections of pus within the abdominal cavity, often resulting from an intra-abdominal infection or a perforation of the gastrointestinal tract.

- **Pathophysiology**: Intra-abdominal abscesses commonly occur as complications of intra-abdominal infections such as diverticulitis (diverticular abscess), appendicitis (periappendiceal abscess), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pelvic inflammatory disease (tubo-ovarian abscess), or following abdominal surgery, gastrointestinal tract perforation, or penetrating abdominal trauma. Abscesses confined to single organs or structures can also occur, such as in the liver (pyogenic or amebic), spleen, subphrenic area, or psoas muscle.

- **Disease course**: Intra-abdominal abscesses often present with abdominal pain, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis. A palpable abdominal mass, peritoneal findings, ileus, and anorexia may also be present.

### Treating appendicitis with antibiotics [^111UBaeV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A nonsurgical approach using antimicrobial agents has been advocated as the initial treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis. Several studies and meta-analyses explored this approach. Because many of these studies included individuals with resolving appendicitis, their results were biased. Antimicrobials, however, are warranted and needed for the management of surgical high-risk patients with perforated appendicitis and those with localized abscess or phlegmon. Randomized placebo-controlled trials that focus on early identification of complicated acute appendicitis patients needing surgery and that prospectively evaluate the optimal use of antibiotic treatment in patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis are warranted.

### Calcitonin: current concepts and differential diagnosis [^112632Xm]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Elevated serum calcitonin (CT) levels can arise due to a variety of causes, leading to several controversies.

- **Overproduction**: Endogenous CT secretion may increase as a physiological consequence of excessive stimuli, such as hypercalcemia and hypergastrinemia. Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy are the most common causes of hypercalcemia, accounting for approximately 90% of cases. However, chronic hypercalcemia is a rare cause of CT elevation. Oral calcium administration elicits diverse hormonal responses that help in the differential diagnosis of these conditions. Thyroid parafollicular cells can express a calcium-sensing receptor similar to the one found on the parathyroid gland. In contrast to parathyroid hormone (PTH), receptor binding in this context stimulates CT release. Hypergastrinemia can result from achlorhydria, caused by conditions such as pernicious anemia, atrophic gastritis, or antacid use, as well as by Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. CT elevation can also occur in various situations where its precursors are elevated, such as pancreatitis, bacterial inflammation, sepsis, or when taking calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors for migraine treatment.

	- Overproduction of CT may occur primarily, rather than as a response to CT secretagogues. Though not pathognomonic, elevated CT is most commonly associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and is used as a diagnostic and prognostic tool as previously outlined. Nonetheless, MTC is not the sole thyroid pathology presenting with hypercalcitoninemia.

- **Table of causes**: Though the table has been removed from the text, causes and clinical relevance of hypercalcitoninemia relative to basal CT (bCT) and stimulated serum CT values are notable.

Note: The excerpt seems to be missing definitive data on the C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) that is mentioned in connection with slight increases of both basal and stimulated serum CT levels, pointing to potential truncation.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^1137vn9y]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with a periappendiceal abscess can be managed with percutaneous image-guided drainage in surgical departments with ready access to diagnostic and interventional radiology. When percutaneous drainage is not available, surgery is suggested (Recommendation 1B).

In approximately 10% of patients, a periappendiceal abscess and inflammatory phlegmon is present at diagnosis. This condition is more frequently encountered in cases of delayed diagnosis. Clinical features of complicated appendicitis, such as mass and abscess, may include fever, tachycardia, palpation of mass, and extension of the area of tenderness and rebound. Surgical management varies because some cases will evolve into an ileocecal resection or a right-sided hemicolectomy if operated on in the acute setting.

In recent years, high success rates of 76–97% and low incidences of complications have been reported in patients with appendicitis associated with abscess and/or mass after conservative management. Therefore, performing non-surgical treatments, such as antibiotic therapy and percutaneous drainage during the initial period, has been proven effective and safe. However, a necessary condition for conservative management is easy access to diagnostic and interventional radiology to perform percutaneous drainage. When percutaneous drainage is not available, surgery is suggested.

In patients treated conservatively, interval appendectomy may not be necessary following initial non-operative treatment of complicated appendicitis. However, interval appendectomies should always be considered.

### Antibiotics versus placebo in adults with CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis (APPAC III): Randomized double-blind superiority trial [^114P8Mpw]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Over the past decade, there has been considerable discussion and accumulating robust evidence in both adults and children for the efficacy and safety of antibiotics as a feasible treatment alternative for imaging-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, antibiotics were acknowledged as a safe alternative to surgery for uncomplicated acute appendicitis by the American College of Surgeons, as non-operative treatment would allow for limiting inpatient bed use and reallocation of healthcare resources.

The belief that appendicitis inevitably progresses to perforation without surgery applies to complicated cases, such as obstruction with a faecolith, for which appendicectomy is indicated unless an abscess is present. However, the majority of patients present with imaging-confirmed uncomplicated appendicitis, in whom non-operative management with antibiotics is possible. The APPAC III (APPendicitis ACuta III) trial of antibiotics versus placebo in adults with CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis is a part of a research continuum from an initial trial comparing antibiotics with appendicectomy and a recent one comparing oral antibiotics with intravenous, then oral antibiotics. The trial design was based on the notion that acute appendicitis seems very similar to diverticulitis, for which uncomplicated disease does require antibiotics.

With the increasing risk of developing antibiotic resistance, studies on their rational use are warranted. A Korean single-blind randomized trial reported no difference in treatment failure rates.

Regarding the medical management of appendiceal neoplasm, more specifically with respect to intraperitoneal chemotherapy, the ASCRS 2025 guidelines suggest offering intraperitoneal chemotherapy after cytoreductive surgery. This recommendation aims to reduce peritoneal disease recurrence in patients with appendiceal epithelial neoplasms, although its impact on overall survival is not established and has been associated with increased costs and toxicity.

### Diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112CvXeo]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

The optimal diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis remain controversial. This systematic review details the evidence and best practices for the evaluation and management of uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis in adults and children.

- **Methods**: Eight questions regarding the diagnosis and management of appendicitis were formulated. PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, and clinicaltrials.gov/NLM were queried for articles published from 2010 to 2022 with keywords related to at least one question. Randomized and non-randomized studies were included. Two reviewers screened each publication for eligibility and then extracted data from eligible studies. Random effects meta-analyses were performed on all quantitative data. The quality of randomized and non-randomized studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 or Newcastle Ottawa Scale, respectively.

- **Results**: A total of 2792 studies were screened, and 261 were included. Most had a high risk of bias. Computerized tomography scan yielded the highest sensitivity (> 80%) and specificity (> 93%) in the adult population, although high variability existed. In adults with uncomplicated appendicitis, non-operative management resulted in higher odds of readmission (OR 6.10) and need for operation (OR 20.09), but less time to return to work/school (SMD -1.78). In pediatric patients with uncomplicated appendicitis, non-operative management also resulted in higher odds of needing an operation (OR 38.31). In adult patients with complicated appendicitis, there were higher odds of needing an operation following antibiotic treatment.

### Pitfalls in appendicitis [^117RYjZv]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of appendicitis is fraught with potential pitfalls, and despite its prevalence, appendicitis continues to be a condition at high risk for missed and delayed diagnosis. There is no single historical or physical finding or laboratory test that can definitively make the diagnosis. This article discusses the value of presenting signs, symptoms, laboratory testing, and the rational use of various imaging modalities, such as CT scanning and ultrasound. Challenges of special populations, such as children, the elderly, and pregnant patients, are also discussed. Although appendicitis continues to be a source of medical legal risk and misdiagnosis, a clear understanding of the strengths and limitations of all tests in suspected appendicitis can improve the emergency physician's diagnostic accuracy in this high-risk disease.

### Meta-analysis of antibiotics versus appendicectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis [^112wcnD1]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). High credibility.

The search yielded 685 potentially relevant reports. After screening titles, abstracts, and trial registries, and including six studies in previous reviews, 52 reports were retrieved for full-text screening. A total of six RCTs were included: five in the final primary analysis and, in addition, one quasi-RCT in a sensitivity analysis. Two RCTs were excluded: one due to subsequent retraction owing to plagiarism and the other because of postrandomization exclusions that led to serious prognostic imbalance. Four of the six authors (including the author of the quasi-RCT) confirmed the accuracy of the consensus data extraction, corrected some errors, or provided additional information; two were unable to assist with the requests or could not be contacted.

### The role of procalcitonin in reducing antibiotics across the surgical pathway [^114WA4oq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is widely regarded as a highly sensitive biomarker of bacterial infection, offering general and emergency surgeons a key tool to aid in the management of surgical infections.

### Early versus delayed appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess [^112QjLAb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Appendiceal phlegmon and abscess account for 2% to 10% of acute appendicitis. People with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess usually need an appendicectomy to relieve their symptoms and avoid complications. The timing of appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess is controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of early versus delayed appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess, in terms of overall morbidity and mortality.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1950 to 23 August 2016), Embase Ovid (1974 to 23 August 2016), Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to 23 August 2016), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1978 to 23 August 2016). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal (23 August 2016) and ClinicalTrials.gov (23 August 2016) for ongoing trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all individual and cluster-randomised controlled trials, irrespective of language, publication status, or age of participants, comparing early versus delayed appendicectomy in people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently identified the trials for inclusion, collected the data, and assessed the risk of bias. We performed meta-analyses using Review Manager 5. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: We included two randomised controlled trials.

### Acute appendicitis, inflammatory appendiceal mass and the risk of a hidden malignant tumor: a systematic review of the literature [^1135ficC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The incidence of appendicitis requiring emergency surgical treatment is remarkably common, with appendectomy being the standard treatment since 1889. In the United States alone, appendicitis accounts for approximately 300,000 hospital admissions annually.

Despite the increased use of computed tomography to evaluate acute abdominal pain and diagnose appendicitis, and the adoption of laparoscopic appendectomy, the number of perforated cases has remained stable over the past three decades. Between 2 and 6% of patients with acute appendicitis present with an appendiceal mass, often described as an inflammatory phlegmon or abscess. In these cases, the ideal approach remains controversial, with proposals for indirect, non-surgical treatment being considered.

When conservative treatments initially yield positive results, there is often a dilemma regarding whether to perform an interval appendectomy or to maintain a nonoperative approach. The primary disadvantage of the latter is the absence of histological analysis of the appendix. In a meta-analysis and systematic review of 2,771 patients diagnosed with inflammatory appendiceal mass (phlegmon or abscess), Andersson and collaborators identified malignant tumors in 31 cases.

These lesions are detected in 0.9 to 1.4% of the appendectomies performed to treat acute appendicitis. Although rare, appendiceal tumors represent about 1% of large intestine malignancies. Acute appendicitis serves as the initial presentation of primary neoplasms of the appendix in more than 50% of cases, causing an unexpected challenge for both the doctor and the patient.

### Antibiotics alone versus appendectomy to treat uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults: What do meta-analyses say [^1153evpy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of inflammatory acute abdomen. The incidence of acute appendicitis varies from 250,000 to 280,000 cases per year in the United States, accounting for more than 1 million hospital days per year and a cost exceeding 3 billion dollars. For more than a century, acute appendicitis has been treated by surgery, i.e. appendectomy, with mortality rates ranging from 0.07% to 0.7%. Nevertheless, surgical intervention is associated with greater pain, adhesion and hernia development, ileus, venous thromboembolic events, cardiopulmonary complications, and increased costs.

During the 1950s, an initial non-operative approach for acute appendicitis was attempted, but it was not generally accepted at the time. Appendicitis complicated by appendicular abscess/phlegmon may be managed with antibiotics and non-operative strategies, resulting in reduced complication rates compared to surgery, similar to other acute inflammatory intestinal conditions such as diverticulitis and enterocolitis. Antibiotic therapy may be associated with reduced costs of treatment, avoiding operation and its consequent complications. However, the use of antibiotics alone as primary therapy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is still being assessed, and studies have shown conflicting results so far.

The aim of this study is to review available meta-analyses comparing antibiotics alone versus appendectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with complicated appendicitis [^116DTyJG]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Low credibility.

Complicated appendicitis, characterized by conditions such as abscess, perforation, or generalized peritonitis, poses a significant burden on healthcare systems, with an incidence rate of up to 28–29%. Management options for this condition include antibiotic therapy coupled with up-front surgery, antibiotic therapy with percutaneous drainage, or antibiotic therapy alone. Currently, there is no consensus in the literature regarding treatment guidelines. This study aims to better define treatment algorithms for patients presenting with acute complicated appendicitis by evaluating clinical outcomes in those treated with or without surgery.

- **Methods**: We conducted a single-institution, retrospective review of 220 adult patients (≥ 18 years old) treated for acute complicated appendicitis from January 2017 to June 2022. Demographic and clinicopathologic variables were collected and analyzed. We compared patients who were managed non-operatively versus those who received operative management. Regression modeling was employed to determine factors associated with non-operative management (NOM) and those predictive of NOM failure.

- **Results**: Our analysis indicated that 26.3% of patients with acute complicated appendicitis underwent NOM (n = 58), while 73.6% underwent operative management at index admission (n = 162). Within the NOM group, 55.1% were treated with antibiotics alone (n = 32), versus 44.8% who received percutaneous drainage (n = 26). In the operative cohort, 88.7% of patients underwent appendectomy (n = 142). Age, body mass index, comorbidities, vital signs, and laboratory values on admission were similar between both groups. Clinical factors predictive of initial NOM were analyzed.

### Calcitonin: Current concepts and differential diagnosis [^115c9FDy]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Mature human calcitonin is a 32-membered heterodetic cyclic peptide comprising the sequence Cys-Ser-Asn-Leu-Ser-Thr-Cys-Val-Leu-Gly-Lys-Leu-Ser-Gln-Glu-Leu-His-Lys-Leu-Gln-Thr-Tyr-Pro-Arg-Thr-Asn-Thr-Gly-Ser-Gly-Thr-Pro-NH2, cyclized by a disulfide bridge between the two Cys residues at positions 1 and 7 and a proline at the carboxyterminal end. Both the ring structure and this aminated proline are essential for the full expression of CT's known bioactions.

Because prohormones are not secreted into the bloodstream in healthy individuals, ProCT in the serum serves as a helpful biomarker in cases of bacterial-mediated septic states. More specifically, the production of ProCT in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is mediated by the thyroid C-cells, whereas in cases of acute bacterial infection, the most probable sites are the neuroendocrine cells of the lungs and intestine. Consequently, ProCT synthesis in the former case depends upon elevated calcium levels, glucocorticoids, gastrin, or β-adrenergic stimulation. In contrast, in the latter, ProCT production is linked to the presence of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and various inflammatory cytokines such as IL (interleukin)-1, IL-2, and IL-6. Healthy subjects thus have very low serum ProCT levels, which, taken together with the quite long plasma half-life of 25–30 h, have recently fueled a significant amount of research to delineate the role of ProCT in MTC and sepsis.

### WSES Jerusalem guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis [^116F6Jyy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

In order to elucidate the role of non-operative treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis, in 2012 Varadhan et al. performed a meta-analysis including four randomized controlled trials with a total of 900 patients (470 antibiotic treatment, 430 appendectomy): the antibiotic treatment was associated with a 63% success rate at 1 year and a lower complication rate with a relative risk reduction of 31% if compared with appendectomy (RR 0.69, I2 = 0%, P = 0.004). Moreover, this risk reduction was found to be more relevant (39%, RR 0.61, I2 = 0%, P = 0.02) if the studies with crossover of patients between the antibiotic and surgical treatment were excluded. The analysis did not find significant differences for treatment efficacy, length of stay, or risk of developing complicated appendicitis.

The observational NOTA (Non-Operative Treatment for Acute Appendicitis) study treated 159 patients with suspected appendicitis with antibiotics [mean AIR (Appendicitis Inflammatory Response) score = 4.9 and mean Alvarado score = 6.2 (range 3–9)] with a 2-year follow-up. The mean length of stay of those patients was 0.4 days, and the mean sick leave period was 5.8 days. The short-term (7 days) failure rate was 11.9%. Of 22 patients with a long-term recurrence (13.8%), 14 were successfully treated non-operatively.

Recently, the RCT by Svensson et al. included 50 pediatric patients (24 antibiotic treatment, 26 appendectomy) with 92% success rate in the non-operative group. However, an 8% short-term failure (two patients, one complicated appendicitis and one mesenteric lymphadenitis) was observed.

### Prognostic factors associated with primary non-responsiveness to antibiotics and appendicitis recurrence for CT-diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis: Secondary analysis of two randomized clinical trials [^117CJpXz]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

- **Methods**: The patient population for this study was a combination of two earlier RCTs, APPAC and APPAC II, assessing non-operative management of CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis in patients aged 18–60 years. Briefly, the APPAC trial was a multicenter, open-label, non-inferiority RCT involving 530 patients at six hospitals in Finland. The APPAC II trial was also a multicenter, open-label, non-inferiority RCT involving 603 patients at nine hospitals in Finland. The trial protocols were approved by the ethics committee at the Hospital District of Southwest Finland and institutional research boards at each participating site. The trials were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all patients provided written informed consent.

- **Criteria**: Criteria for uncomplicated acute appendicitis on CT included an appendiceal diameter greater than 6 mm, a thickened, contrast-enhanced appendiceal wall, periappendiceal edema and/or minor fluid collection, and the absence of criteria for complicated acute appendicitis, such as the presence of an appendicolith, perforation, abscess, or suspicion of a tumor.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Exclusion criteria included age over 60 years, peritonitis, contraindication for CT (e.g. allergy to contrast media or iodine), pregnancy or lactation, kidney insufficiency or a serum creatinine value exceeding the upper reference limit, metformin use, serious systemic illness (e.g. malignancy), inability to cooperate or give consent, and complicated acute appendicitis on CT. In the APPAC trial, all patients were randomized.

### Antibiotics versus appendicectomy in the management of acute appendicitis: An ongoing debate [^114KhT61]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The management of acute appendicitis has traditionally followed a surgical approach. However, there has been much recent debate regarding the potential use of antibiotics not only as a bridge to surgery but as a mainstay of treatment. Initial evidence has been limited and of poor quality, with a general consensus that appendicectomy remains the gold standard for the management of acute appendicitis. This finding has been echoed in several recent reviews on this topic, including an earlier review by Varadhan et al. (2010).

Indeed, the main difference between their previous paper and this paper is the inclusion of an additional randomized controlled trial by Vons et al. A key point to elicit from that paper was that 21 patients (18%) of those randomized to undergo appendicectomy were found at surgery to have complicated appendicitis with peritonitis, despite an earlier CT scan diagnosing uncomplicated appendicitis.

By simply assessing the pathway of treatment for the antibiotic group in the Varadhan et al. (2012) paper, significant disadvantages to antibiotic treatment have been demonstrated. 21% of patients (93 / 438) treated with antibiotics crossed over to surgery and underwent appendicectomy, with 10 of those patients demonstrating a perforation and 12 of those patients demonstrating a gangrenous appendix. In addition, 20% of patients (68 / 345) were readmitted to hospital following initial antibiotic treatment, with 65 of these patients proceeding to appendicectomy. Of those, 20% had either a perforated or gangrenous appendix.

### Initial laparoscopic appendectomy versus initial nonoperative management and interval appendectomy for perforated appendicitis with abscess: A prospective, randomized trial [^117REkUP]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Perforated appendicitis is a common condition in children which, in a small number of patients, may be complicated by a well-formed abscess. Initial nonoperative management with percutaneous drainage or aspiration of the abscess, followed by intravenous antibiotics, usually allows for an uneventful interval appendectomy. Although this strategy has become well accepted, there are no published data comparing initial nonoperative management (drainage/interval appendectomy) to appendectomy upon presentation with an abscess. Therefore, we conducted a randomized trial comparing these two management strategies.

- **Methods**: After internal review board approval (#06 11–164), children who presented with a well-defined abdominal abscess by computed tomographic imaging were randomized on admission to laparoscopic appendectomy or intravenous antibiotics with percutaneous drainage of the abscess (when possible), followed by interval laparoscopic appendectomy approximately 10 weeks later. This was a pilot study with a sample size of 40, based on our recent volume of patients presenting with appendicitis and abscess.

- **Results**: On presentation, there were no differences between the two groups regarding age, weight, body mass index, sex distribution, temperature, leukocyte count, number of abscesses, or greatest two-dimensional area of the abscess in the axial view. Regarding outcomes, there were no differences in length of total hospitalization, reabscess rates, or overall charges. There was a trend toward a longer operating time in patients undergoing initial appendectomy.

### Calcitonin: Current concepts and differential diagnosis [^116PCew6]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Recent data have disputed the clinical value of the stimulating tests. Specifically, novel immunochemiluminometric assays, which are highly sensitive and specific for monomeric CT and avoid cross-reactivity, have provided new information. In a study of 91 patients, the gender-specific bCT and sCT cutoffs for the identification of MTC were found to be greater than 26 and 68 for bCT, and greater than 79 and 544 pg/ml for sCT in females and males, respectively. However, the accuracy of bCT and sCT was found to be similar, suggesting that serum CT assays with improved functional sensitivity may decrease the relevance of stimulation tests in various conditions. In another surgical series with 2733 patients, MTC was consistently observed in patients with a bCT of 60 pg/ml or greater, while the Pg test offered no additional diagnostic information for managing patients with elevated preoperative basal serum CT levels.

### Risk of appendiceal neoplasm in periappendicular abscess in patients treated with interval appendectomy vs follow-up with magnetic resonance imaging: 1-year outcomes of the Peri-Appendicitis Acuta randomized clinical trial [^1135KB9K]. JAMA Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The importance of the step following conservative treatment for periappendicular abscess has sparked controversy. Recommendations vary from abandoning interval appendectomy due to low recurrence rates of the initial diagnosis to the practice of routine interval appendectomy, prompted by novel findings indicating an increased risk of neoplasm at interval appendectomy. Notably, to our knowledge, no randomized clinical trials with adequate patient numbers have compared these treatment options.

The objective of this study was to compare interval appendectomy with follow-up using magnetic resonance imaging after the initial successful nonoperative treatment of periappendicular abscess.

The Peri-Appendicitis Acuta randomized clinical trial was designed as a multicenter, noninferiority trial conducted across five hospitals in Finland. The study included all patients aged 18 to 60 years who were diagnosed with periappendicular abscess via computed tomography and had undergone successful initial nonoperative treatment between January 2013 and April 2016. Data analysis was performed from April 2016 to September 2017.

Interventions consisted of randomizing patients to either interval appendectomy or follow-up with magnetic resonance imaging. All patients also underwent colonoscopy.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary endpoint was treatment success, defined as the absence of postoperative morbidity in the appendectomy group and no recurrence of appendicitis in the follow-up group. Secondary predefined endpoints included neoplasm incidence, inflammatory bowel disease, length of hospital stay, and days of sick leave.

Results reported that a total of 60 patients were included in the study, including 36 men.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^1119bwvH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The treatment of choice for acute appendicitis continues to be the appendectomy. Antibiotic therapy is a safe primary treatment for patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, but this conservative approach is less effective long-term due to significant recurrence rates. Although the standard treatment for acute appendicitis has historically been the appendectomy, the medical community has recently seen a notable increase in the use of antibiotic therapy as a primary means of treatment.

Several meta-analyses have been published, overviewing a series of randomized trials comparing antibiotic therapy to appendectomies for acute uncomplicated appendicitis, specifically in cases without abscesses or phlegmon. Although non-operative, antibiotic-mediated treatments of uncomplicated appendicitis are associated with significantly fewer complications, more manageable pain control, and shorter patient sick leave, this conservative approach features high rates of recurrence and is therefore inferior to the traditional appendectomy.

Given that only a small number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of poor methodological quality are currently available, well-designed RCTs are required to better assess the effects of an antibiotic-based approach in conservative treatments of uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Given this controversy, the appendectomy remains the treatment of choice for acute appendicitis. Non-operative antibiotic treatment may be used as an alternative treatment for specific patients for whom surgery is contraindicated.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: A systematic review [^115dy9qj]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

- **Data sources and searches**: A literature search was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines using the PUBMED (1966) and EMBASE (1947) databases for studies published in both English and non-English languages through April 29, 2018, using the keywords (antibiotic or antibiotics or nonoperative or non operative or non-operative or conservative) and (appendicitis). References in the selected publications, including reviews, were searched for additional studies. Two reviewers, one clinician and one nonclinician, independently searched these databases, reached a consensus on potentially relevant publications, and evaluated candidate articles for final inclusion.

- **Study selection and criteria**: Only full-text articles of trials that described initial conservative management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis were considered relevant. Studies with poorly characterized study populations were excluded. All study designs were allowed.

- **Data extraction**: Studies were included in data extraction if they reported methods of conservative management. Studies were categorized as follows: randomized controlled trial (RCT); prospective, comparative; prospective, noncomparative; retrospective, noncomparative; and RCT comparing antibiotic treatment versus supportive care. The following information was extracted: number of participants that received conservative treatment, ages, patient selection including clinical and imaging criteria, antibiotic regimen, pain and diet management, criteria for initial antibiotic nonresponse, and initial response rate.

### Outpatient non-operative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: A non-inferiority study [^111abgt8]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The management of acute appendicitis is a widely debated topic with increasing interest worldwide. Since Andersson's description, a conservative approach with antibiotic therapy has been re-proposed for uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Several randomized trials and meta-analyses demonstrated that conservative treatment is a safe alternative to appendectomy in uncomplicated acute appendicitis with similar short-term outcomes. In particular, antibiotics proved non-inferior to appendectomy with a similar success proportion at a 30-day follow-up and a lower morbidity rate. Existing trials have proposed conservative management as in-hospital treatment, coupling medical observation and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics. The non-response to non-operative management (NOM) has been reported to be 8.5%, and hospitalization would ensure patient safety with continuous re-evaluation, allowing prompt urgent appendectomy in case of failure of conservative treatment.

The APPAC II study demonstrated the non-inferiority of oral in-hospital antibiotics compared to the intravenous route, opening new possibilities for outpatient treatment. The first experience of outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis has been described in a recent subgroup analysis of patients randomized and included in the CODA trial. Patients received a first dose of intravenous antibiotics in the emergency department, and then they were discharged home within 24 hours from the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. To the best of our knowledge, no other data are available in the literature.

### Prognostic factors associated with primary non-responsiveness to antibiotics and appendicitis recurrence for CT-diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis: Secondary analysis of two randomized clinical trials [^112BdQKo]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

One concern with increasing non-operative management for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is the remaining uncertainty of possible undetected appendiceal neoplasms. However, the risk of appendiceal neoplasms is directly associated with appendicitis severity, underlining the importance of differentiating between uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis. The reported appendiceal tumour risk associated with complicated acute appendicitis (2.4%) is markedly higher compared with uncomplicated acute appendicitis (1.5%), with the highest prevalence of up to 14.3% in complicated acute appendicitis presenting with a periappendicular abscess, as indicated by a recent large prospective cohort study. These findings mitigate the risk of missed appendiceal neoplasms associated with antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

This study has several limitations. The first limitation is the relatively small number of patients with non-responsiveness to antibiotics. This is due to the careful initial inclusion and exclusion criteria for the RCTs assessing specifically patients with CT-diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis, which demonstrates a strength of the initial RCT patient selection according to the study hypothesis. Second, the antibiotic treatment between the three groups varied. However, considering the similar characteristics of all three groups and the two trials, the identical inclusion criteria in both the APPAC trial and the APPAC II trial, and consistent results at 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up, the variability of antibiotic treatment was noted to have minimal impact.

### Meta-analysis of antibiotics versus appendicectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis [^113a1Wnz]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Complete-case analyses were carried out, including only patients who were followed and whose outcomes were available. Pooled estimates of risk differences were calculated by a random-effects meta-analysis using the DerSimonian and Laird approach (Freeman–Tukey double arcsine transformation). Heterogeneity was assessed for each outcome across studies using the I² statistic and Cochran's Q. For outcomes in which five or more studies were available, subgroup analyses were planned to examine the study-level variables as potential sources of heterogeneity. These variables and the prespecified hypotheses that results would favour antibiotics were those with CT confirmation of the diagnosis of non-perforated appendicitis and those with low risk of bias, considered separately for each risk-of-bias domain with at least two studies with high and at least two studies with low risk of bias.

For outcomes in which there was a significant difference between groups, sensitivity analyses were planned in which results were imputed for missing data in a manner that challenged the robustness of these differences. If missing data were minimal (5 percent or less), the plan was not to conduct these analyses.

Guidance from the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group provided the methodology for assessing quality of evidence.

### Laparoscopic surgery or conservative treatment for appendiceal abscess in adults? A randomized controlled trial [^117R5Rff]. Annals of Surgery (2015). High credibility.

We hypothesized that immediate laparoscopic surgery for appendiceal abscess would result in faster recovery than conservative treatment.

On the basis of retrospective studies, conservative management of appendiceal abscess is recommended as a first-line treatment, but some controversy exists.

Sixty adult patients diagnosed with appendiceal abscess were randomly assigned to either laparoscopic surgery (n = 30) or conservative treatment (n = 30). Hospital stay, recurrences, additional interventions, and complications within 60 days from randomization were recorded.

There was no difference in hospital stay: 4 days (interquartile range: 3–5 days) in the laparoscopy group versus 5 days (3–8) in the conservative group (P = 0.105). Patients in the laparoscopy group had a 10% risk for bowel resection and a 13% risk for incomplete appendectomy. There were significantly fewer patients with unplanned readmissions in the laparoscopy group: 1 (3%) versus 8 (27%) (P = 0.026). Additional interventions were required in 2 (7%) patients in the laparoscopy group (percutaneous drainage) and in 9 (30%) patients in the conservative group (surgery) (P = 0.042). Reabscesses and failure to respond to conservative treatment were the main reasons for additional interventions. Open surgery was required in 3 (10%) patients in the laparoscopy group and in 4 (13%) patients in the conservative group. Postoperative complications occurred in 3 patients in the laparoscopic group versus 2 patients in the conservative group. The rate of uneventful recovery was 90%.

### Biomarkers of acute appendicitis: Systematic review and cost-benefit trade-off analysis [^112AQe1W]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency, with an annual incidence in the United States of 9.38 per 100,000. Cases are characterized by an acute inflammatory process; however, in approximately 16.5% of cases, the appendix has perforated and become gangrenous, or there is overt peritonitis, termed "complicated appendicitis". While in rare special circumstances management may differ, the mainstay of treatment for the majority of patients remains surgery, either by an open or laparoscopic approach. With 326,000 appendectomies performed in the United States during 2007 at an average estimated cost of $6,242, appendicitis represents a highly prevalent condition with significant expenditure associated with its treatment.

Despite the frequency of appendicitis, accurate diagnosis remains difficult. The National Surgical Research Collaborative in the UK has estimated that the negative appendectomy rate is as high as 20.6%. The use of ultrasound and computerized tomography (CT) has in some cases been shown to improve appendicitis diagnostic accuracy and reduce the number of negative appendectomies, with the latter shown to decrease rates to less than 10%. However, exposing patients to high levels of radiation is undesirable given the lifetime risk of cancer, along with the increase in costs associated with increased utilization of CT, representing negatives to this approach. While this radiation dosage is avoided by using ultrasound scanning, the technique is operator-dependent, and in as many as 55% of cases, the appendix fails to be visualized.

Several studies have previously examined a variety of biomarkers.

The high-quality RCT by Mentula et al. (not included in the Cochrane review) demonstrated that laparoscopy appendectomy (LA) in experienced hands is a safe and feasible first-line treatment for appendiceal abscess. In this study, early LA was associated with fewer readmissions and fewer additional interventions than conservative treatment, with a comparable hospital stay. Patients in the laparoscopy group had a 10% risk of bowel resection and a 13% risk of incomplete appendectomy. There were significantly fewer patients with unplanned readmissions following LA (3% versus 27%, P = 0.026). Additional interventions were required in 7% of patients in the laparoscopy group (percutaneous drainage) and 30% of patients in the conservative group (appendectomy). Conversion to open surgery was required in 10% of patients in the laparoscopy group and 13% of patients in the conservative group. The rate of uneventful recovery was 90% in the laparoscopy group versus 50% in the conservative group (P = 0.002).

Luo et al. analyzed the outcomes of 1,225 patients under 18 years of age who had non-surgical treatment for an appendiceal abscess between 2007 and 2012 in Taiwan. The authors compared outcomes of percutaneous drainage with antibiotics or antibiotics alone. Of 6,190 children having an appendiceal abscess, 1,225 patients received non-operative treatment. Patients treated with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics had a significantly lower rate of re-appendiceal abscess, significantly smaller chance of receiving an interval appendectomy, and significantly fewer postoperative complications after the interval appendectomy.

### Calcitonin: Current concepts and differential diagnosis [^117BenPZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

As a peptide hormone, calcitonin (CT) cannot cross the phospholipid membrane and thus binds to high-affinity calcitonin receptors (CTRs). The CTR is a member of a subfamily of the seven-transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, which includes several peptides. Members of this family have a similar structure to other seven-membrane-spanning domain G-protein-coupled receptors. Several signaling transduction pathways have been linked to CT receptors, with the most important leading to the upregulation of protein kinase A through the adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-PKA pathway activation (Adenosine 3,5-cyclic monoposphate Protein Kinase A). Other reports suggest that phospholipase A2, C, and D can also participate in CT's second messenger cascade. Additionally, another study implicated the MAPK ERK1/2 (Mitogen-Activated-Protein-Kinase Extracellular-Signal-Regulated 1/2) pathway through the Shc tyrosine phosphorylation.

- **Bone**: Osteoclasts are the major target for the action of CT and are among the best studied. CT plays an important role in skeletal homeostasis, being a key modulator of bone resorption. Acutely, the hormone acts directly on the CTR, altering the osteoclast's sensitivity to serum calcium. It induces quiescence of the osteoclast motility with retraction of the pseudopods along with a cessation of membrane ruffling. However, CT acts for a short time frame, as osteoclasts "escape" its function in 24–48 hours. CT also inhibits other components of the osteoclast, such as the release of acid phosphatase and the expression of carbonic anhydrase II and focal adhesion kinase.

### Randomized clinical trial of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated appendicitis [^113hRF63]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated appendicitis may resolve spontaneously or require treatment with antibiotics or appendicectomy. The aim of this randomized trial was to compare the outcome of a non-antibiotic management strategy with that of antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated appendicitis.

- **Methods**: Patients presenting to a university teaching hospital with CT-verified uncomplicated simple appendicitis (appendiceal diameter no larger than 11 mm and without any signs of perforation) were randomized to management with a no-antibiotic regimen with supportive care (intravenous fluids, analgesia, and antipyretics as necessary) or a 4-day course of antibiotics with supportive care. The primary endpoint was the rate of total treatment failure, defined as initial treatment failure within 1 month and recurrence of appendicitis during the follow-up period.

- **Results**: Some 245 patients were randomized within the trial and followed up for a median of 19 months. The duration of hospital stay was shorter (mean 3.1 versus 3.7 days; P < 0.001) and the medical costs lower (€1181 versus €1348; P < 0.001) among those randomized to therapy without antibiotics. There was no difference in the total treatment failure rate between the groups: 29 of 124 (23.4 percent) in the no-antibiotic group and 25 of 121 (20.7 percent) in the antibiotic group (P = 0.609). Eighteen patients (9 in each group) had initial treatment failure, 15 of whom underwent appendicectomy and three received additional antibiotics. Thirty-six patients (20 in the no-antibiotic group and 16 in the antibiotic group) experienced recurrence, of whom 30 underwent further treatment.

### Nonsurgical treatment of appendiceal abscess or phlegmon: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Ltmhi]. Annals of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

A systematic review of the nonsurgical treatment of patients with appendiceal abscess or phlegmon emphasized the success rate, need for drainage of abscesses, risk of undetected serious disease, and need for interval appendectomy to prevent recurrence.

Patients with appendiceal abscess or phlegmon are traditionally managed by nonsurgical treatment and interval appendectomy, a practice that remains controversial. Proponents argue for immediate surgery, while others question the necessity of interval appendectomy.

A Medline search identified 61 studies published between January 1964 and December 2005, reporting on the results of nonsurgical treatment of appendiceal abscess or phlegmon. The results were pooled, taking potential study-level clustering into account. A meta-analysis was performed to compare the morbidity after immediate surgery with that after nonsurgical treatment.

Findings show that appendiceal abscess or phlegmon is found in 3.8% (95% CI, 2.6–4.9) of patients with appendicitis. Nonsurgical treatment fails in 7.2% (CI 4.0–10.5), and the need for abscess drainage is 19.7% (CI 11.0–28.3). Immediate surgery is associated with higher morbidity compared to nonsurgical treatment (odds ratio, 3.3; CI 1.9–5.6; P < 0.001). After successful nonsurgical treatment, a malignant disease is detected in 1.2% (CI 0.6–1.7), and an important benign disease in 0.7% (CI 0.2–11.9) during follow-up. The risk of recurrence is 7.4% (CI 3.7–11.1).

### Current management of acute appendicitis in adults: What you need to know [^1163ARHT]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is one of the most common acute surgical diseases worldwide. It often presents with a recognizable clinical manifestation of abdominal pain localized in the right lower quadrant, which is more typical in men than in women of childbearing age. Several clinical and laboratory calculations can aid in increasing the likelihood of an accurate diagnosis. Various imaging modalities, including ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, are utilized to diagnose appendicitis, each with well-known sensitivity and specificity values for positive predictive diagnosis.

The management of acute appendicitis depends on the patient's presentation, categorized into uncomplicated and complicated cases. Both require antibiotics, followed by a timely appendectomy. Recent studies indicate that non-operative management of uncomplicated appendicitis, without the presence of a fecalith, can be effectively managed with antibiotics alone. Complicated acute appendicitis necessitates prompt surgical intervention.

Patients presenting with a large appendiceal abscess or phlegmon should undergo percutaneous drainage and antibiotic management. Certain patient populations, such as pregnant and immunosuppressed individuals, should receive timely surgical intervention to mitigate the risk of complications. This review outlines the principles of diagnosis, imaging, and treatment of acute appendicitis.

### Safety and efficacy of antibiotics compared with appendicectomy for treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117MPm9P]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

Appendicectomy has been the mainstay for the treatment of acute appendicitis since it was first reported by McBurney in 1889, and the general assumption since the 19th century has been that in the absence of surgical intervention, the disease often progresses from uncomplicated to perforated appendicitis. The advent of laparoscopic surgery and the low threshold for operative intervention have led to a risk of high negative appendicectomy rates with unnecessary surgery-related morbidity. Only 20% of patients present with complicated appendicitis, and non-operative management with antibiotics and supportive treatment has been explored as a therapeutic option for patients with early uncomplicated appendicitis, with resolution in most of them. Antibiotic treatment was often considered as a bridge to surgery in patients with suspected appendicitis but no clear indications for appendicectomy, such as signs of perforation or peritonitis. However, the routine use of antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis was not well supported, owing to inherent pitfalls in the quality and design of individual studies. The role of antibiotic treatment in acute uncomplicated appendicitis may have been overlooked mainly on the basis of tradition rather than evidence, considering that other intra-abdominal inflammatory processes such as colonic diverticulitis are primarily managed non-operatively.

This time-honored practice has been challenged recently with reports of less morbidity associated with antibiotic treatment than surgery in uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis: 2020 update of the WSES Jerusalem guidelines [^115Eoa82]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

- **Statement 6.1**: Non-operative management is a reasonable first-line treatment for appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess. Percutaneous drainage as an adjunct to antibiotics, if accessible, could be beneficial, although there is a lack of evidence for its use on a routine basis. Laparoscopic surgery in experienced hands is a safe and feasible first-line treatment for appendiceal abscess, being associated with fewer readmissions and fewer additional interventions than conservative treatment, with a comparable hospital stay.

- **Recommendation 6.1**: We suggest non-operative management with antibiotics and — if available — percutaneous drainage for complicated appendicitis with a periappendicular abscess, in settings where laparoscopic expertise is not available [QoE: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Weak; 2B].

- **Statement 6.2**: Operative management of acute appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess is a safe alternative to non-operative management in experienced hands and may be associated with shorter LOS, reduced need for readmissions, and fewer additional interventions than conservative treatment.

- **Recommendation 6.2**: We suggest the laparoscopic approach as the treatment of choice for patients with complicated appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess where advanced laparoscopic expertise is available, with a low threshold for conversion [QoE: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Weak; 2B].

- **Q.6.2**: Is interval appendectomy always indicated for patients with acute appendicitis following successful NOM? The reported rate of recurrence after non-surgical treatment for perforated AA and phlegmon is [information incomplete].

### Antibiotics versus placebo in adults with CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis (APPAC III): Randomized double-blind superiority trial [^112MSuSL]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

With the substantial body of evidence on antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis from large trials, the focus of studies on non-operative treatment of this condition has shifted. Researchers are now working to further define tailored optimal treatment strategies. The results of these large trials are remarkably consistent, demonstrating a success rate of approximately 70% and less disability with antibiotic therapy. Although antibiotics are understandably inferior to appendicectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis when evaluated solely in terms of treatment efficacy, non-operative management cannot compete with surgery due to the definitive nature of appendicectomy.

Potential pre-interventional findings associated with a more complicated course of appendicitis, primary antibiotic treatment failure, and recurrence need to be identified. International collaboration is necessary to refine the diagnosis of appendicitis severity using uniform and standardized criteria. In a recent subgroup analysis of the APPAC II trial, which assessed 583 patients with CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis without an appendicolith, findings included that an appendiceal diameter of 15 mm or more and body temperature above 38°C were associated with an increased risk of non-responsiveness to initial antibiotics. The pragmatic CODA trial, which included patients with more severe appendicitis, reported a higher risk of appendicectomy (41%) for patients with appendicolith.

### Appendectomy or not? An update on the evidence for antibiotics only versus surgery for the treatment of acute appendicitis in children [^113S9FnC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is a common diagnosis in children being evaluated in the emergency department. After diagnosis, the standard treatment has been surgical appendectomy. However, in recent years, there is a growing body of evidence evaluating the possibility of nonoperative management in both children and adults. This review will present the state of pediatric literature that suggests patients may be successfully treated with antibiotics alone (i.e. without surgery), though a proportion of these patients will experience recurrent appendicitis.

Given that the literature regarding the option of antibiotic-only management compared with surgery is not yet definitive, there are many factors for providers to discuss with families and patients when considering treatment for acute appendicitis.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: A systematic review [^117WUQNv]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The role of conservative antibiotic treatment for the initial management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis is an area of continued controversy. Because of evidence gaps, it has not been generally concluded that antibiotic treatment should routinely replace surgery. These gaps include limited data outside healthy young adults, limited comparison with laparoscopic surgery, and incomplete assessment of patient-related and long-term outcomes.

Meta-analyses have found conservative treatment associated with similar or fewer complications overall compared with surgery, and a recent guideline now acknowledges that this management can be successful for selected patients who wish to avoid surgery and accept the possibility of recurrence. However, guidance does not exist to best advise patients and provide this care.

This systematic review describes the patient selection criteria and range of medical treatments used in published trial methods of conservative antibiotic management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis. While RCT (level II; RCTs with some negative criteria) evidence of the comparative effectiveness of conservative treatment in relation to urgent appendectomy exists, the full body of experience includes other prospective and retrospective, comparative and non-comparative trials. In total, our search found 34 studies describing 2,944 antibiotic-treated participants.

For patients, this summary facilitates discussion about the extent to which their clinical profile is supported by trial experience and what they should expect should they choose nonoperative treatment.

### Meta-analysis of antibiotics versus appendicectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis [^1138fW8X]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Five RCTs that followed more than 1100 patients with non-perforated appendicitis for one year demonstrated both advantages and disadvantages to an initial management strategy of antibiotics with appendicectomy only as necessary versus immediate appendicectomy. Advantages of the antibiotic regimen include a potentially lower rate of major complications (primarily appendiceal perforations) [2.6 percent less, low-quality evidence], a potentially lower rate of minor complications [7.2 percent less, very low-quality evidence], potentially shorter sick leave [4 days shorter, very low-quality evidence], and a lower rate of appendicectomies in the first month after presentation [91.8 percent less, high-quality evidence]. These advantages need to be traded off against a 22.6 percent incidence of recurrence of appendicitis at one year (high-quality evidence) and potentially longer hospital stay (by 0.4 days, moderate-quality evidence).

Relative to previous systematic reviews, this analysis has many strengths. **Strengths**: Use of explicit eligibility criteria led to the exclusion of two trials inappropriately included in other reviews: one that has been retracted owing to plagiarism and another trial that suffered from serious prognostic imbalance. A comprehensive search led to the inclusion of two recently published trials. Two reviewers determined eligibility, assessed risk of bias, and abstracted data independently and in duplicate, with adjudication by a third reviewer as necessary. Rigorous meta-analyses were conducted and prespecified criteria were met.

### Appendicitis [^112MLj7Z]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix that may lead to an abscess, ileus, peritonitis, or death if untreated. It is the most common abdominal surgical emergency. The standard treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis is usually surgery, but there has been increasing evidence published on the use of antibiotics.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of surgery compared with antibiotics for acute appendicitis? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of surgery (including laparoscopic and open appendicectomy) compared with antibiotics.

### Antibiotic treatment versus appendicectomy for acute appendicitis in adults: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^115sD9io]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have found antibiotics to be a feasible and safe alternative to appendicectomy in adults with imaging-confirmed acute appendicitis. However, patient inclusion criteria and outcome definitions vary greatly between RCTs. We aimed to compare antibiotics with appendicectomy for the treatment of acute appendicitis using individual patient data and uniform outcome definitions.

- **Methods**: In this individual patient data meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions between database inception and June 6, 2023, for RCTs comparing appendicectomy with antibiotics for the treatment of adults (≥ 18 years) with imaging-confirmed acute appendicitis. Studies without 1-year follow-up data on complications were excluded, as were patients. Corresponding authors of eligible studies were contacted and invited to share data; individual patient data were merged after validation. One-stage meta-analyses were conducted using a generalised, mixed-effects linear regression model, accounting for clustering of patients within studies. The primary outcome was the complication rate at 1-year follow-up, uniformly harmonised across trials using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Complications were further divided into minor (grade 1–2 or equivalent) and major (grade 3–5 or equivalent) complications. Appendicectomy rate during 1 year was a key secondary outcome but not considered a complication for the antibiotics group. Outcomes were described separately for patients with and without complications.

### Meta-analysis of antibiotics versus appendicectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis [^1163o7MT]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Data extraction was conducted using standard pilot-tested forms, along with detailed instructions. Working in teams of two, reviewers extracted data independently. A clinician–methodologist adjudicator resolved any disagreements. Authors were contacted to check the data for accuracy and to provide additional information regarding the original studies when needed.

The following data were extracted: sample size, participants' characteristics, antibiotic regimens, and details of surgical management (laparoscopic or open, any antibiotic use). The outcomes for both treatment groups included major complications at 1 year, specifically Clavien–Dindo complication classification grade III or above (conditions requiring endoscopic, radiological, or surgical intervention, or causing organ dysfunction or death) such as appendiceal perforation, as well as deep infections, incisional hernias, and adhesive bowel obstruction not requiring intervention. Minor complications at 1 year were also noted, such as superficial wound infections, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Additional data extracted included the confirmed or suspected recurrence of appendicitis between 1 month and 1 year, the rate of appendicectomy within 1 month of intervention, the duration of the hospital stay, and the duration of sick leave.

In the risk-of-bias assessment, each study was evaluated using a modified version of the Cochrane Collaboration's instrument according to four criteria: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, and completeness of data. For each criterion, studies were judged to be at either high or low risk of bias.
