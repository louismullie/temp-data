## Question

What dose of Asprin after stroke

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what aspirin dose to use after ischemic stroke in the acute phase and for secondary prevention, including special scenarios like thrombolysis and minor stroke or high-risk TIA. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and timing relative to stroke onset and thrombolysis. Then, I should verify the acute dosing for patients not receiving thrombolysis. Next, I will review secondary prevention dosing for long-term therapy. After that, I need to check special cases such as short-term dual antiplatelet therapy for minor stroke or high-risk TIA and post-thrombolysis timing. Finally, I should confirm safety considerations, dose-response, and synthesize a practical regimen with clear transitions and monitoring cues [^117Wx1oY] [^113bmhte].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context so I do not jump to conclusions. Aspirin is indicated for acute ischemic stroke and for secondary prevention after ischemic stroke or TIA, but it is contraindicated in acute intracranial hemorrhage and must be timed around thrombolysis or thrombectomy; I should ensure ischemic pathophysiology and the absence of hemorrhage on imaging before starting, especially if reperfusion therapy was given [^117Wx1oY] [^113bmhte].

> Now, I will examine acute dosing when no thrombolysis is given. For adults with acute ischemic stroke who are not receiving thrombolysis, early aspirin within 24–48 hours at a dose of 160–325 mg daily is recommended to achieve prompt platelet inhibition during the high-risk early period; I should double-check that both drug labeling and guideline-concordant sources align here, and they do, including ACCP Grade 1A support and SPL labeling at 160–325 mg daily, with benefit on early recurrence based on time-course analyses showing early effect onset [^116EmaW8] [^1167yfKU] [^111NrYtq].

> Wait, I should verify the post-thrombolysis scenario because timing is crucial. If IV thrombolysis was administered, antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin, should be delayed for 24 hours and started only after follow-up imaging excludes hemorrhagic transformation; I almost said to start immediately after lysis, but that would be incorrect, so I need to confirm the 24-hour delay with imaging before initiation, which is consistent with AHA/ASA early management guidance [^117Wx1oY].

> Next, I need to review secondary prevention dosing for long-term therapy. For ongoing prevention after the acute phase of ischemic stroke or TIA, a maintenance dose of 75–100 mg daily is standard and sufficient, although AHA/ASA guidelines allow a range of 50–325 mg daily; I should emphasize that low-dose regimens are as effective as higher doses due to saturable COX-1 platelet inhibition, and higher doses mainly increase bleeding without added antithrombotic benefit, which supports selecting 75–100 mg for routine long-term use [^115myGKq] [^113bmhte] [^114MpC9j] [^113Ppob3] [^115eRH8U].

> Hold on, I should verify special clinical scenarios, particularly minor stroke or high-risk TIA where short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) can reduce early recurrence. For non-cardioembolic minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA treated within 24 hours, short-term DAPT with clopidogrel plus aspirin for 21 days, then monotherapy, is strongly supported; aspirin within this regimen is typically 75–100 mg daily after the loading period, and POINT shows bleeding trade-offs, while CHANCE shows stroke reduction without excess moderate-severe hemorrhage, and ticagrelor plus aspirin for 30 days is a reasonable alternative in selected patients per guideline suggestions, acknowledging higher bleeding risk [^114pzjup] [^111auBQ5] [^112b9eR4] [^111zEk61] [^1125nMjM] [^1164WDRJ].

> I need to ensure I address patients already taking aspirin at the time of their non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA. The 2021 AHA/ASA guideline notes insufficient evidence to support increasing the aspirin dose or switching antiplatelet agents solely because the event occurred on aspirin; I should avoid reflexively escalating dose and instead reassess adherence, pharmacologic interactions, and stroke mechanism to inform targeted changes [^1122fzqk].

> Next, I should review safety and dose-response, since this guides the transition from higher acute doses to lower maintenance doses. Platelet inhibition is saturated at low doses, and bleeding risk rises with higher aspirin doses; major bleeding, including gastrointestinal and intracranial hemorrhage, is dose related, so for chronic use I should prefer 75–100 mg daily to minimize harm while preserving efficacy, especially outside the acute window [^115xi9U3] [^115CXZX1] [^111V5cGG].

> Let me consider the time course of benefit because it informs early initiation. The greatest absolute benefit of aspirin on recurrent ischemic events occurs in the early weeks after TIA or minor stroke, with reductions in both risk and severity of early recurrent stroke evident within days; this supports prompt initiation in appropriate patients and then de-escalation to low-dose maintenance as the early hazard subsides [^111NrYtq] [^113rfZti] [^1138fSMF].

> I should now synthesize a practical regimen and double-check each step. For acute ischemic stroke without thrombolysis, start aspirin 160–325 mg daily within 24–48 hours if no contraindication; after about 7–14 days, transition to 75–100 mg daily for long-term therapy, continuing indefinitely for secondary prevention; if thrombolysis was given, delay antiplatelet therapy for 24 hours and start only after imaging excludes hemorrhage; for minor stroke or high-risk TIA presenting within 24 hours, consider 21 days of clopidogrel plus aspirin followed by monotherapy, or ticagrelor plus aspirin for 30 days in selected patients, ensuring individualized bleeding risk assessment; avoid routine long-term doses above 100 mg because higher doses increase bleeding without improving efficacy, and do not up-dose solely due to an event on aspirin without a mechanistic rationale [^116EmaW8] [^115myGKq] [^113bmhte] [^114MpC9j] [^114pzjup] [^112b9eR4] [^1125nMjM] [^1164WDRJ] [^115xi9U3] [^1122fzqk].

For acute ischemic stroke, give **160–325 mg aspirin within 24–48 hours** after onset, unless thrombolysis or thrombectomy is planned or there is a bleeding risk [^116EmaW8] [^117Wx1oY]. For long-term secondary prevention, use **75–100 mg daily** [^117F2bRQ] [^115myGKq]. If dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated (e.g. minor stroke or high-risk TIA), continue aspirin 75–100 mg daily with clopidogrel [^112b9eR4] for 21 days, then revert to aspirin monotherapy [^114pzjup]. Avoid aspirin in hemorrhagic stroke or if contraindications exist [^117Wx1oY].

## Acute ischemic stroke: initial aspirin dosing

- **Initial dose**: 160–325 mg orally within 24–48 hours after symptom onset, unless thrombolysis or thrombectomy is planned or there is a bleeding risk [^116EmaW8] [^117Wx1oY] [^113bmhte].

- **Rationale**: Early aspirin reduces recurrent ischemic stroke [^1138fSMF] and improves outcomes [^111NrYtq].

- **Administration**: Use chewable or non–enteric-coated aspirin for rapid absorption [^117Wx1oY].

---

## Long-term secondary prevention: maintenance aspirin dosing

For long-term secondary prevention, the **maintenance dose is 75–100 mg daily** to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA [^117F2bRQ] [^115myGKq]. Low-dose aspirin is effective [^115eRH8U] and has a lower bleeding risk than higher doses [^115xi9U3].

---

## Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) considerations

- **Indications**: Minor ischemic stroke (NIHSS ≤ 3) or high-risk TIA (ABCD2 ≥ 4) within 24 hours [^114pzjup].

- **Regimen**: Aspirin 75–100 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 21 days, then aspirin monotherapy [^112b9eR4] [^114pzjup].

- **Rationale**: Short-term DAPT reduces early recurrent stroke [^1178FGGA] without excess major bleeding [^1138itBT].

---

## Special considerations and contraindications

- **Hemorrhagic stroke**: Aspirin is contraindicated [^117Wx1oY].

- **Allergy or intolerance**: Use alternative antiplatelets (e.g. clopidogrel) [^114MpC9j].

- **Bleeding risk**: Assess and monitor for gastrointestinal or intracranial bleeding [^115CXZX1].

## Summary: aspirin dosing after stroke

For acute ischemic stroke, start aspirin **160–325 mg daily** within 24–48 hours [^117Wx1oY]. For long-term secondary prevention, continue **75–100 mg daily** indefinitely [^115myGKq]. If dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated, use aspirin **75–100 mg daily** plus clopidogrel **75 mg daily for 21 days**, then continue aspirin monotherapy. Aspirin is a **cornerstone of secondary stroke prevention**; use 160–325 mg acutely and 75–100 mg daily long term, with short-term DAPT for select minor stroke or high-risk TIA patients [^113bmhte].

The purpose of these guidelines is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive set of recommendations for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke in a single document. The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines supersede the 2013 guidelines and subsequent updates.

- **Methods**: Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Strict adherence to the American Heart Association conflict of interest policy was maintained. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. The members of the writing group unanimously approved all recommendations, except when relations with industry precluded members from voting. Prerelease review of the draft guideline was performed by four expert peer reviewers and by members of the Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee and Stroke Council Leadership Committee. These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2015 Class of Recommendations and Levels of Evidence and the new American Heart Association guidelines format.

- **Results**: These guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately addressed.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for acute high risk transient ischaemic attack and minor ischaemic stroke: a clinical practice guideline [^114pzjup]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

What is the role of dual antiplatelet therapy after high risk transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke? Specifically, does dual antiplatelet therapy with a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel lead to a greater reduction in restroke and death compared to the use of aspirin alone when administered within the first 24 hours following a high risk transient ischaemic attack or minor ischaemic stroke? An expert panel produced a strong recommendation for initiating dual antiplatelet therapy within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms and recommended continuing it for 10–21 days. Current practice typically involves the use of a single drug.

### Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: Current knowledge and future research needs [^115VNCAi]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In secondary prevention, among a very wide range of survivors of prior occlusive cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and those suffering acute myocardial infarction (MI) or occlusive stroke, aspirin decreases risks of MI, stroke, and CVD death. In these high-risk patients, the absolute benefits are large and absolute risks are far smaller, so aspirin should be more widely prescribed. In contrast, in primary prevention, aspirin reduces risks of first MI, but the evidence on stroke and CVD death remains inconclusive.

Based on the totality of evidence from predominantly low-risk subjects where the absolute benefits are low and side effects are the same as in secondary prevention, any decision to prescribe aspirin for primary prevention should be an individual clinical judgment by the healthcare provider that weighs the absolute benefit in reducing the risk of a first MI against the absolute risk of major bleeding. If the ongoing trials of intermediate-risk subjects show net benefits, then general guidelines may be justified with several caveats.

- **Decision-making**: Any decision to use aspirin should continue to be made by the healthcare provider.
- **Therapeutic considerations**: Therapeutic lifestyle changes and other drugs of life-saving benefit, such as statins, should be considered with aspirin as an adjunct, not an alternative.

The more widespread and appropriate use of aspirin in primary prevention is particularly attractive, especially in developing countries where CVD is emerging as the leading cause of death. In addition, aspirin is generally widely available over the counter and is extremely inexpensive.

### European stroke organisation expedited recommendation for the use of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy early after minor stroke and high-risk TIA [^111auBQ5]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Prevention of early re-ischemic stroke remains a priority in people with TIA or ischemic stroke. A number of trials have recently been completed assessing the efficacy of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus single antiplatelet therapy early after minor or moderate stroke, or high-risk TIA. We present an expedited recommendation for the use of dual antiplatelet therapy early after ischemic stroke and TIA on behalf of the ESO Guideline Board.

- **Strong recommendation**: Based on high-quality evidence, we recommend the use of 21-days of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel in people with a non-cardioembolic minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA in the past 24 hours.

- **Weak recommendation**: Based on moderate-quality evidence, we suggest 30-days of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor in people with non-cardioembolic mild to moderate ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA in the past 24 hours.

### Effects of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent stroke after transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: Time-course analysis of randomised trials [^116EdUPT]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

- **Added value of this study**:

Our analyses of data from trials of aspirin in secondary prevention after TIA and ischaemic stroke show that the effect of aspirin on the risk of early recurrent events has been underestimated. We demonstrate substantial reductions in the early risk of all stroke, ischaemic stroke, and acute myocardial infarction. We also found that a major part of the early benefit of aspirin was due to a previously unrecognised reduction in the severity of early recurrent ischaemic stroke, resulting in 80–90% reductions in the early risk of disabling or fatal recurrent ischaemic stroke after TIA and minor stroke. Although these trials recruited few patients in the first few days after TIA or stroke, we found similar reductions in the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke with aspirin in trials of acute ischaemic stroke.

- **Interpretation of all available evidence**:

Urgent medical treatment substantially reduces the risk of early recurrent stroke after TIA and minor stroke, and early use of aspirin is the key intervention. Medical services should administer aspirin as soon as possible, and public education should aim at self-administration following unfamiliar transient neurological symptoms suggestive of threatened stroke.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, specifically concerning antiplatelet therapy, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines highlight insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of increasing the dose of aspirin or switching to another antiplatelet medication in patients already taking aspirin at the time of non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA.

### Effects of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent stroke after transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: Time-course analysis of randomised trials [^113rfZti]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Our analyses of trials of aspirin in secondary prevention after TIA and ischaemic stroke show that the effect of aspirin on early recurrent events has been underestimated. We identified substantial reductions in the early risks of all stroke, ischaemic stroke, and acute myocardial infarction with aspirin, with effect sizes greater than those previously reported after unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction. We also found that a major part of the early benefit of aspirin was due to a previously unrecognized reduction in the severity of early recurrent ischaemic stroke, resulting in up to a 90% reduction in early risk of disabling or fatal recurrent ischaemic stroke after TIA and minor stroke.

However, trials of aspirin for secondary prevention recruited few patients in the acute phase after TIA or stroke. We found no significant diminution of the effect in patients randomized early, but acute effects might differ. For example, aspirin had no effect on death for the first three days after acute myocardial infarction in the ISIS-2 trial. We therefore studied trials of aspirin in the treatment of acute stroke, aiming simply to estimate the time course of onset of effect of aspirin on the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke, with the overall balance of risk and benefit having been documented elsewhere. With use of stratification by severity of the baseline neurological deficit, we showed that in patients with less severe stroke, the relative reduction in risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke on aspirin was similar to that in the secondary prevention trials and was evident by the seco…

### European stroke organisation expedited recommendation for the use of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy early after minor stroke and high-risk TIA [^115b47s1]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Prevention of early re-ischaemic stroke remains a priority in people with TIA or ischaemic stroke. Several trials have recently been completed, assessing the efficacy of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus single antiplatelet therapy early after minor or moderate stroke or high-risk TIA.

We present an expedited recommendation for the use of dual antiplatelet therapy early after ischaemic stroke and TIA on behalf of the ESO Guideline Board. We make a strong recommendation, based on high-quality evidence, for the use of 21 days of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel in people with a non-cardioembolic minor ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA in the past 24 hours. We make a weak recommendation, based on moderate-quality evidence, for 30 days of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor in people with non-cardioembolic mild to moderate ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA in the past 24 hours.

### Effects of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent stroke after transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: Time-course analysis of randomised trials [^112Cb7SX]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

- **Data selection and extraction**: Trials were eligible if they randomised the following: patients with TIA or ischaemic stroke to regular aspirin (any dose; in the presence or absence of another antiplatelet drug) versus no antiplatelet or anticoagulant in the secondary prevention of stroke and other vascular events; patients with acute ischaemic stroke to regular aspirin (any dose) versus no aspirin, in the presence or absence of another antithrombotic treatment, for acute treatment and prevention of early recurrence; or patients with TIA or ischaemic stroke to regular dipyridamole (any dose) versus no dipyridamole (in the presence or absence of another antiplatelet drug) in the secondary prevention of stroke and other vascular events. Searches were conducted up to January 31, 2016, and PMR identified trials through the Antithrombotic Trialists' (ATT) Collaboration, subsequent systematic reviews, and the Cochrane Collaboration. Due to the historical nature of the trials, no additional searches were made for ongoing trials or abstracts presented at meetings.

	- For all eligible trials of aspirin or dipyridamole in secondary prevention after TIA or stroke, individual patient data were sought. If these were not available, published data on vascular events were extracted from trial reports. Data were obtained on the following baseline variables: randomised treatment allocation, age, sex, prior diabetes, smoking, history of hypertension, blood pressure at entry, and time from most recent cerebrovascular event to randomisation.

### Association between low-dose rivaroxaban with or without aspirin and ischemic stroke subtypes: A secondary analysis of the COMPASS trial [^1128jbmU]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

The COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies) randomized clinical trial was stopped early due to the efficacy of low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin in preventing major cardiovascular events. The main reason for early trial termination was the effect of combination therapy on reducing ischemic strokes.

- **Objective**: To analyze the association between low-dose rivaroxaban with or without aspirin and different ischemic stroke subtypes.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This study is a secondary analysis of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted in 33 countries from March 12, 2013, to May 10, 2016. Patients with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease were eligible, and a total of 27,395 participants were randomized and followed up until February 6, 2017. All first ischemic strokes and uncertain strokes that occurred by this date were adjudicated using TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria. The analysis of ischemic stroke subtypes was evaluated using an intention-to-treat principle. Statistical analysis was performed from March 12, 2013, to February 6, 2017.

- **Interventions**: Participants received rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice a day) plus aspirin (100 mg once a day), rivaroxaban (5 mg twice a day), or aspirin (100 mg once a day).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Risk of ischemic stroke subtypes during follow-up.

- **Results**: A total of 291 patients (66 women; mean [SD] age, 69.4 [8.5] years; 43 [14.8%] had a previous nonlacunar stroke) experienced an ischemic stroke during the study period.

### Effects of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent stroke after transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: Time-course analysis of randomised trials [^111NrYtq]. The Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Aspirin is recommended for secondary prevention after transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or ischaemic stroke, based on trials showing a 13% reduction in long-term risk of recurrent stroke. However, the risk of major stroke remains very high in the initial days following TIA and minor ischaemic stroke. Observational studies indicate significantly greater benefits of early medical treatment during the acute phase compared to longer-term trials. We hypothesized that the short-term benefits of early aspirin have been underestimated.

- **Methods**: Pooling the individual patient data from all randomised trials of aspirin versus control in secondary prevention after TIA or ischaemic stroke, we examined the effects of aspirin on the risk and severity of recurrent stroke, stratified by the following time periods: less than 6 weeks, 6–12 weeks, and more than 12 weeks after randomisation. We compared the severity of early recurrent strokes between treatment groups using shift analysis of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. To understand possible mechanisms of action, we also studied the time course of the interaction between the effects of aspirin and dipyridamole in secondary prevention of stroke. Additionally, we pooled data from trials of aspirin versus control, in which patients were randomised less than 48 hours following a major acute stroke, stratified by the severity of baseline neurological deficit. This was done to establish the very early time course of the effect of aspirin on the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke and how this effect varies by severity at baseline.

- **Findings**: We pooled data for 15,778 participants.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^1164WDRJ]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor plus aspirin for 30 days to reduce the risk of 30-day recurrent stroke in patients, recognizing that it may also increase the risk of serious bleeding events, including intracerebral hemorrhage:

- **Recent (< 24 hours) minor-to-moderate stroke**: NIHSS score ≤ 5.
- **High-risk TIA**: ABCD² score ≥ 6.
- **Symptomatic intracranial or extracranial ≥ 30% stenosis of an artery**: Could account for the event.

### A randomized trial of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women [^1138n5JF]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). High credibility.

Randomized trials have shown that low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of a first myocardial infarction in men, with little effect on the risk of ischemic stroke. There are few similar data in women.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 39,876 initially healthy women 45 years of age or older to receive 100 mg of aspirin on alternate days or placebo and then monitored them for 10 years for a first major cardiovascular event (i.e. nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes).

- **Results**: During follow-up, 477 major cardiovascular events were confirmed in the aspirin group, as compared with 522 in the placebo group, for a nonsignificant reduction in risk with aspirin of 9 percent (relative risk, 0.91; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.80 to 1.03; P = 0.13). With regard to individual end points, there was a 17 percent reduction in the risk of stroke in the aspirin group, as compared with the placebo group (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.99; P = 0.04), owing to a 24 percent reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke (relative risk, 0.76; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.93; P = 0.009) and a nonsignificant increase in the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (relative risk, 1.24; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.87; P = 0.31). As compared with placebo, aspirin had no significant effect on the risk of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (relative risk, 1.02; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.84 to 1.25; P = 0.83) or death from cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.7).

### Clopidogrel with aspirin in acute minor stroke or transient ischemic attack [^112b9eR4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Stroke is common during the first few weeks following a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke. Combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin may provide greater protection against subsequent stroke than aspirin alone.

- **Methods**: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 114 centers in China, we randomly assigned 5170 patients within 24 hours after the onset of minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA to combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin (clopidogrel at an initial dose of 300 mg, followed by 75 mg per day for 90 days, plus aspirin at a dose of 75 mg per day for the first 21 days) or to placebo plus aspirin (75 mg per day for 90 days). All participants received open-label aspirin at a clinician-determined dose of 75 to 300 mg on day 1. The primary outcome was stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) during 90 days of follow-up in an intention-to-treat analysis. Treatment differences were assessed with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model, with study center as a random effect.

- **Results**: Stroke occurred in 8.2% of patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group, as compared with 11.7% of those in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.81; P < 0.001). Moderate or severe hemorrhage occurred in seven patients (0.3%) in the clopidogrel-aspirin group and in eight (0.3%) in the aspirin group (P = 0.73); the rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.3% in each group.

- **Conclusions**: Among patients with TIA or minor stroke who can be treated within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms, the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin provides significant protection against subsequent strokes compared to aspirin alone.

### Aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease: The association of aspirin dose and clopidogrel with thrombosis and bleeding [^112ttoSD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The optimal aspirin dose for the prevention of cardiovascular events remains controversial.

- **Objective**: To assess the incidence of and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes by investigator-determined aspirin dose in a primary prevention trial.

- **Design**: Post hoc observational analyses of data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.

- **Setting**: Outpatient.

- **Patients**: 15,595 patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors.

- **Intervention**: Clopidogrel, 75 mg/d, or placebo, with aspirin, 75 to 162 mg/d, as selected by the investigators.

- **Measurements**: Incidence of the composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death (efficacy end point) and incidence of severe or life-threatening bleeding (safety end point), at a median of 28 months (interquartile range, 23 to 31 months) of follow-up.

- **Results**: Daily aspirin doses were categorized as less than 100 mg (75 or 81 mg) (n = 7180), 100 mg (n = 4961), and greater than 100 mg (150 or 162 mg) (n = 3454). The hazard of the primary efficacy end point was the same regardless of dose (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.80 to 1.13] for 100 mg vs. less than 100 mg, and 1.0 [CI, 0.85 to 1.18] for greater than 100 mg vs. less than 100 mg). The hazard of the primary safety end point also did not depend on dose (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.85 [CI, 0.57 to 1.26] for 100 mg vs. less than 100 mg and 1.05 [CI, 0.74 to 1.48] for greater than 100 mg vs. less than 100 mg). In patients also receiving clopidogrel, daily aspirin doses greater than 100 mg seemed to be non-statistically significant.

### New horizons in pharmacologic therapy for secondary stroke prevention [^112thEKX]. JAMA Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Even with currently available therapies and lifestyle modifications following an ischemic stroke, there remains a substantial residual lifetime risk of stroke recurrence and cardiovascular morbidity. This review summarizes emerging novel therapeutic approaches that have demonstrated signals of efficacy for the prevention of noncardioembolic stroke from phase II and phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and provides an overview of drug regimens that have shown promising results in primary stroke prevention and could be considered for further evaluation.

- **Observations**: After a minor acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, patients bear a high cardiovascular risk that is insufficiently addressed by long-term antiplatelet treatment. The potent combination of low-dose rivaroxaban with aspirin as an antithrombotic option for secondary prevention in patients with clinical atherosclerosis and a history of previous stroke warrants further study. Two international RCTs are currently evaluating the utility of oral factor XI inhibitors combined with antiplatelets for secondary, noncardioembolic ischemic stroke prevention. Aggressive lipid management with statins has been shown to ameliorate ischemic stroke recurrence and total cardiovascular risk. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are drug regimens that researchers have suggested confer additional protection against stroke recurrence, while antisense oligonucleotide therapies targeting lipoprotein(a) have been reported to hold great promise as a future therapeutic strategy.

### Prevention with low-dose aspirin plus dipyridamole in patients with disabling stroke [^117Bi5Pw]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

The combination of low-dose aspirin and dipyridamole is more effective than aspirin alone in reducing the risk of stroke and other major cardiovascular events in patients with a recent transient ischemic attack or minor stroke. It is unknown whether this also applies to patients with a disabling stroke.

- **Methods**: We reanalyzed the data of 5,700 patients from ESPRIT and ESPS-2 to study the effect of aspirin and dipyridamole according to the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at baseline. The primary outcome was vascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death). We used proportional hazards regression to estimate the treatment effect across mRS strata at baseline, and we tested for interactions with treatment.

- **Results**: In total, 426 patients (7.5%) had an mRS score of 4 or 5 at baseline. The risk of an outcome event increased with the mRS score. The relative risk associated with the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole compared to aspirin alone in patients with an mRS score of 0 to 5 was 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91). The relative risk according to mRS subcategory scores of 0 to 4 at baseline varied between 0.73 and 0.96 for vascular events and between 0.62 and 0.96 for stroke. The number of patients with an mRS score of 5 was too small for reliable estimates, but the data suggest a beneficial effect. There was no evidence of interaction between treatment effect and mRS score at baseline.

- **Conclusions**: The beneficial effect of the combination of low-dose aspirin and dipyridamole was present in all subcategories of the mRS score.

### Risk of hemorrhagic stroke with aspirin use: an update [^111V5cGG]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin is an important therapeutic option in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke, especially considering its unique cost-effectiveness and widespread availability. Moreover, based on the results of several large studies, aspirin is also widely used in the primary prevention of MI. This review provides an update of the available data to offer greater clarity regarding the risks of aspirin with respect to hemorrhagic stroke, as well as insights regarding patient selection to minimize the risk of this complication.

- **Summary of review**: In the secondary prevention of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and ischemic events, evidence supports that the benefits of aspirin treatment significantly outweigh the risk of major hemorrhage. Evidence from primary prevention of MI studies, including that from the recent Women's Health Study evaluation of aspirin use in healthy women, demonstrates that the increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke is small, comparable to the secondary prevention studies, and fails to achieve statistical significance. A reasonable estimate of the risk of hemorrhagic stroke associated with aspirin use in primary prevention patients is 0.2 events per 1000 patient-years, which is comparable to estimates of the risk associated with aspirin use in secondary prevention patients.

- **Conclusions**: When considering whether aspirin is appropriate, the absolute therapeutic cardiovascular benefits of aspirin must be balanced with the possible risks associated with its use.

### Risk for major hemorrhages in patients receiving clopidogrel and aspirin compared with aspirin alone after transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic stroke: A secondary analysis of the POINT randomized clinical trial [^111zEk61]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Results show the short-term risk of hemorrhage in treating patients with acute transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with clopidogrel plus aspirin or aspirin alone. The objective was to characterize the frequency and kinds of major hemorrhages in the Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) trial.

This secondary analysis of the POINT randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in 10 countries across North America, Europe, and Australasia. It included patients with high-risk TIA or minor AIS who were randomized within 12 hours of symptom onset and followed up for 90 days. The total enrollment, from May 28, 2010, through December 17, 2017, was 4881, constituting the intention-to-treat group; 4819 (98.7%) were included in the as-treated analysis group. The primary safety analyses were as-treated, classifying patients based on the study drug actually received. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed as secondary analyses, with data analyzed in April 2018.

Patients were assigned to receive clopidogrel (600 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 75 mg daily for days 2–90) or placebo; all patients also received open-label aspirin, 50 to 325 mg/d. The main outcomes and measures included the primary safety outcome, which was all major hemorrhages. Other safety outcomes included minor hemorrhages.

A total of 269 sites worldwide randomized 4881 patients (median age, 65.0 years [interquartile range, 55–74 years]; 2195 women [45.0%]); the primary results have been shared in the associated analysis.

### Estimates of benefits and harms of prophylactic use of aspirin in the general population [^116hYh8Y]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

When used in primary prevention settings, aspirin has been shown to reduce serious vascular events among individuals at average/low risk by 12% (0.51% versus 0.57% per year, P = 0.0001). This was primarily due to a 21% reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), with little overall effect on strokes. Overall effects on serious vascular events were similar in men and women, although the effect of aspirin on coronary heart disease was larger in men and the effect on stroke was larger in women. Despite the effect on incidence, no reduction has been seen in cardiovascular mortality in the primary prevention trials (relative risk [RR] = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87–1.09, ATT Collaboration; odds ratio [OR] = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.87–1.12, Rothwell et al.), although some reduction has been seen in high-risk individuals in the secondary prevention trials (RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.82–1.00, P = 0.06).

- **Bleeding and other side-effects**: Without a doubt, increased bleeding is the most important side-effect of aspirin. Haemorrhagic stroke, although rare, is the most serious and potentially fatal side-effect. Estimates suggest a relative increase of 32%–36% in haemorrhagic strokes in aspirin users from a baseline rate of 0.03% per year. Much more common are the extracranial (predominantly gastrointestinal) bleeds, where the risk for major events is increased by about 30%–70% from an overall baseline risk of 0.7 per 1000 per year with low or standard-dose aspirin treatment.

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, specifically in primary prevention, the USPSTF 2022 guidelines recommend individualizing the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in adults aged 40–59 years with a ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk. This is particularly advised for individuals who are not at increased risk of bleeding and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily.

### Aspirin in the prevention of progressing stroke: A randomized controlled study [^114Gwarh]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study focus on the impact of stroke progression on patient outcomes. Specifically, the study aims to assess the efficacy of aspirin in preventing stroke progression and thus improving outcomes.

The study design was a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial. Patients were treated in stroke units across four hospitals in Sweden. The subjects included were patients experiencing ischemic stroke without complete paresis, and no antiplatelet drugs were permitted within 72 hours prior to onset. The delay until the first trial dosage was limited to 48 hours. The trial was structured to detect a 20% reduction in stroke progression, anticipated to occur in 20% of cases overall. A total of 441 patients (220 in the aspirin group and 221 in the placebo group) completed the trial, with baseline comparisons showing no differences between the groups.

The interventions involved administering aspirin (325 mg) or placebo once daily for five consecutive days.

- **Main outcome measures**: Neurological assessments were performed three times daily during the treatment period to identify progression of at least two points on the Scandinavian Stroke Supervision Scale. Patient outcomes were followed up at discharge and after 3 months.

The results indicated that aspirin treatment did not significantly reduce the rate of stroke progression. Among aspirin-treated patients, stroke progression occurred in 15.9%, compared with 16.7% in the placebo group, which was less frequent than expected. The relative risk was calculated at 0.95 (95% CI 0.62–1.45) within the treatment group. Outcomes at discharge and after 3 months were similarly monitored.

### Rationale and design of the aspirin dosing-a patient-centric trial assessing benefits and long-term effectiveness (ADAPTABLE) trial [^116sAC85]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Determining the right dosage of aspirin for secondary prevention treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains an unanswered and critical question. This paper reports the rationale and design for a randomized clinical trial to determine the optimal dosage of aspirin to be used for secondary prevention of ASCVD using an innovative research method.

This pragmatic, open-label, patient-centered, randomized clinical trial is being conducted in 15,000 patients within the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). PCORnet is a distributed research network including clinical research networks, health plan research networks, and patient-powered research networks across the United States. Patients with established ASCVD treated in routine clinical practice within the network are eligible. Patient recruitment began in April 2016 and enrollment was completed in June 2019. Final follow-up is expected to be completed by June 2020.

Participants are randomized on a web platform in a 1:1 fashion to either 81 mg or 325 mg of aspirin daily. The primary efficacy endpoint is the composite of all-cause mortality, hospitalization for nonfatal myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for a nonfatal stroke. The primary safety endpoint is hospitalization for major bleeding associated with a blood-product transfusion. Endpoints are captured through regular queries of the health systems' common data model within the structure of PCORnet's distributed data environment.

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke: The seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^1167yfKU]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about the treatment and prevention of stroke is part of the 7th ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see Guyatt et al.). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following:

- **Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration**: For patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), we recommend administration of i.v. tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), if treatment is initiated within 3 hours of clearly defined symptom onset (Grade 1A).
- **Thrombolytic therapy in patients with hypodensity on CT**: For patients with extensive and clearly identifiable hypodensity on CT, we recommend against thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B).
- **Use of i.v. tPA beyond 3 hours and within 6 hours**: For unselected patients with AIS of more than 3 hours but less than 6 hours, we suggest clinicians not use i.v. tPA (Grade 2A).
- **Streptokinase and full-dose anticoagulation**: For patients with AIS, we recommend against streptokinase (Grade 1A) and suggest clinicians not use full-dose anticoagulation with i.v. or subcutaneous heparins or heparinoids (Grade 2B).
- **Early aspirin therapy**: For patients with AIS who are not receiving thrombolysis, we recommend early aspirin therapy, 160 to 325 mg daily (Grade 1A).
- **Prophylactic use of heparin or heparinoids**: For AIS patients with restricted mobility, we recommend prophylactic low-dose subcutaneous heparin or low molecular weight heparins or heparinoids (Grade 1A).
- **Use of compression devices or elastic stockings**: For patients who have contraindications to anticoagulants, we recommend the use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices or elastic stockings (Grade 1C).

In patients with acute intracerebral hematoma, we recommend…

### Evaluation of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of ischemic stroke among patients with diabetes: a retrospective cohort study [^112cEDW9]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin is recommended to prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients with myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke for secondary prevention. It is also recommended to prevent cardiovascular events in the adult general population without a previous history of cardiovascular disease.

However, the Primary Prevention Project (PPP) trial raised doubt about the effectiveness of aspirin in diabetes patients. Two subsequent randomized controlled trials, which enrolled only patients with diabetes, did not show a benefit of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease but did report an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. A meta-analysis by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration provided subgroup analyses including patients with diabetes and found that the effects of low-dose aspirin on major vascular events were not statistically significant. Furthermore, another meta-analysis including diabetic patients without cardiovascular disease found no significant reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events with low-dose aspirin.

The previous studies were insufficient to identify the effect of primary prevention due to their small sample size, lack of information on the use of statins, low level of compliance to aspirin therapy, switching of aspirin use status during follow-up, or lack of precision of outcome measures. Based on the limited evidence available, recent guidelines for managing diabetes mellitus narrow down the target of low-dose aspirin use for primary prevention.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends the use of aspirin as an individual decision for adults aged 40 to 59 years to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, it does not recommend aspirin use for adults aged 60 years and older. This recommendation is based on a comprehensive review of available evidence, highlighting the benefits and potential risks associated with aspirin use for cardiovascular prevention in different age groups.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: An update of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^112id9hc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). High credibility.

Coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are leading causes of death in the United States. In 2002, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommended that clinicians discuss aspirin with adults who are at increased risk for coronary heart disease.

- **Purpose**: To determine the benefits and harms of taking aspirin for the primary prevention of myocardial infarctions, strokes, and death.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE and Cochrane Library (search dates, 1 January 2001 to 28 August 2008), recent systematic reviews, reference lists of retrieved articles, and suggestions from experts.

- **Study selection**: English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case-control studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews of aspirin versus control for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were selected to answer the following questions: Does aspirin decrease coronary heart events, strokes, death from coronary heart events or stroke, or all-cause mortality in adults without known CVD? Does aspirin increase gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhagic strokes?

- **Data extraction**: All studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined USPSTF criteria.

- **Data synthesis**: New evidence from one good-quality RCT, one good-quality meta-analysis, and two fair-quality subanalyses of RCTs demonstrates that aspirin use reduces the number of CVD events in patients without known CVD. Men in these studies experienced fewer myocardial infarctions, and women experienced fewer ischemic strokes. Aspirin does not seem to affect CVD mortality.

### Aspirin and stroke prevention [^113Ppob3]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

According to meta-analyses, aspirin provides a relative reduction in the rate of major vascular events of 19% in patients with arterial disease in general, whereas for patients with ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, this reduction is only 13%. This discrepancy may well result from pathophysiological differences and not from a play of chance.

There is no proven difference in efficacy according to dose. The evidence for this equivalence is most compelling in the range between 75 and 1300 mg daily, but it is still fairly convincing for doses between 30 and 50 mg. In contrast, side effects are clearly more frequent as the dose increases.

Other antiplatelet agents — sulfinpyrazone, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, orally administered IIb/IIIa inhibitors — have no clear advantages over aspirin and, in some cases, definite disadvantages. The combination of aspirin and dipyridamole may be more efficacious than aspirin alone, but the evidence hinges on a single trial.

If recurrent transient ischemic attacks occur under treatment with aspirin, the rational response is not to change to a different antiplatelet agent, but to review the diagnosis and consider causes other than artery-to-artery embolism.

Platelet aggregation can probably still occur despite complete acetylation of platelets, via pathways other than COX-1 inhibition, but in vitro aggregation tests are an unreliable measure.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^1172NJxK]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

The 2024 guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) recommend specific preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, with a focus on primary prevention. Notably, the guidelines advise against using aspirin for the prevention of a first stroke in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

### Effects of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent stroke after transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: time-course analysis of randomised trials [^113mQCLV]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

We found no evidence that adding dipyridamole to aspirin reduced the risk or severity of early recurrent ischaemic stroke. However, dipyridamole plus aspirin versus aspirin alone did reduce the risk of later recurrent ischaemic stroke, and this effect was particularly marked for disabling or fatal events. Further work is required to fully understand the nature of this late effect in the trials that we studied here and in the PROFESS trial.

Our results do have limitations. First, the trials of aspirin in secondary prevention were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. Medical care has since changed, with more detailed investigations and more intensive lowering of blood pressure and lipids. However, the effect of urgent treatment after TIA and minor stroke observed in more recent observational studies is very similar to that in the previous trials. Changes in medical care would likely impact less on the effectiveness of prehospital self-administration. Second, most patients in the secondary prevention trials were already beyond the very early high-risk period after their initial TIA or minor stroke when recruited. However, delayed inclusion is likely to have underestimated the absolute reduction in risk of early recurrent stroke, as might the absence of a loading dose in the trials of low-dose aspirin. Yet, relative risk reductions are likely to be generalisable to the acute phase. The absolute reduction in risk of ischaemic stroke in the EXPRESS study, in which patients were treated more acutely, was about 8% (number needed to treat 12).

### Aspirin-free strategies in cardiovascular disease and cardioembolic stroke prevention [^111cpyeN]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

In patients with manifestations of cardiovascular disease, acetylsalicylic acid (popularly known as aspirin) has been the mainstay of treatment for decades due to its capacity to reduce the risk of ischemic events. Novel antithrombotic therapies have been traditionally tested alongside acetylsalicylic acid therapy. Although the adjunctive use of such therapies can further reduce the risk of ischemic events, they are inevitably associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Acetylsalicylic acid also increases the risk of bleeding, challenging the paradigm that it should remain the cornerstone of antiplatelet treatment when alternative antithrombotic agents are available.

Many antithrombotic compounds are characterized by increased potency and consistent efficacy, possibly reducing the need for concomitant acetylsalicylic acid. Consequently, numerous investigations are testing the hypothesis that acetylsalicylic acid-sparing regimens based on newer antithrombotic agents might offer an increased net benefit for patients due to a reduced bleeding risk, without a trade-off in efficacy. This review summarizes the state of the art relating to antithrombotic approaches with and without acetylsalicylic acid for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cardioembolic stroke, including the scientific rationale — from bench to bedside — for ongoing studies of acetylsalicylic acid-free pharmacological strategies.

### Oral anticoagulants versus antiplatelet therapy for preventing further vascular events after transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke of presumed arterial origin [^116fK5mR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Patients who participate in clinical trials following a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or a non-disabling ischaemic stroke have an annual risk of significant vascular events, including death from all vascular causes, non-fatal stroke, or non-fatal myocardial infarction, ranging from 4% to 11%. Aspirin, at a daily dose of 30 mg or more, offers only modest protection after cerebral ischaemia, reducing the incidence of major vascular events by up to 20%. Secondary prevention trials following myocardial infarction suggest that treatment with oral anticoagulants is associated with a risk reduction approximately twice that of antiplatelet therapy.

- **Objectives**: 1) To compare the efficacy of oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy in the secondary prevention of vascular events after cerebral ischaemia of presumed arterial origin. 2) To compare the safety of oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy in the secondary prevention of vascular events after cerebral ischaemia of presumed arterial origin.

- **Search strategy**: This review utilizes the search strategy developed for the Stroke Group. Relevant trials were identified in the Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, with the last search conducted in June 2000. Authors of published trials were contacted for further information and unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials with concealed treatment allocation on long-term (> 6 months) secondary prevention after recent (< 6 months) TIA or minor ischaemic stroke of presumed arterial origin were selected. The oral anticoagulant therapy was to be applied consistently.

### Aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients without clinical cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^114gEnPo]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The benefit of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events in subjects without clinical cardiovascular disease relative to the increased risk of bleeding is uncertain.

- **Methods**: A meta-analysis of randomized trials of aspirin versus placebo/control was conducted to assess the effect of aspirin on major cardiovascular events (MCEs) such as nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death, including individual components of the MCE, stroke subtype, all-cause mortality, and major bleeding. Nine trials involving 102,621 patients were included, with 52,145 allocated to aspirin and 50,476 to placebo/control.

- **Results**: Over a mean follow-up of 6.9 years, aspirin was associated with a reduction in MCE (risk ratio [RR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.85–0.96, P < .001). However, there was no significant reduction for myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemic stroke, or all-cause mortality. Aspirin was associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.01–1.81, P = .04) and major bleeding (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.31–2.00, P < .001). In meta-regression, the benefits and bleeding risks of aspirin were independent of baseline cardiovascular risk, background therapy, age, sex, and aspirin dose. The number needed to treat to prevent one MCE over a mean follow-up of 6.9 years was 253 (95% CI 163–568), which was offset by the number needed to harm to cause one major bleed of 261 (95% CI 182–476).

- **Conclusions**: The totality of evidence provides only modest support for a benefit of aspirin in patients without clinical cardiovascular disease, which is offset by its risk for major bleeding.

### Clopidogrel and aspirin in acute ischemic stroke and high-risk TIA [^115izYWJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Combination antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin may reduce the rate of recurrent stroke during the first 3 months following a minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). A trial of combination antiplatelet therapy in a Chinese population has shown a reduction in the risk of recurrence. We tested this combination in an international population.

- **Methods**: In a randomized trial, we assigned patients with minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA to receive either clopidogrel at a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1, followed by 75 mg per day, plus aspirin (at a dose of 50 to 325 mg per day), or aspirin alone within the same dosage range. The dose of aspirin in each group was selected by the site investigator. The primary efficacy outcome in a time-to-event analysis was the risk of a composite of major ischemic events, which were defined as ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from an ischemic vascular event, at 90 days.

- **Results**: A total of 4881 patients were enrolled at 269 international sites. The trial was halted after 84% of the anticipated number of patients had been enrolled because the data and safety monitoring board determined that the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin was associated with both a lower risk of major ischemic events and a higher risk of major hemorrhage than aspirin alone at 90 days. Major ischemic events occurred in 121 of 2432 patients (5.0%) receiving clopidogrel plus aspirin, and in 160 of 2449 patients (6.5%) receiving aspirin plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 1.00).

### Aspirin in childhood acute ischemic stroke: The evidence for treatment and efficacy testing [^112ErW4J]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Low credibility.

Aspirin is the most commonly prescribed antiplatelet agent worldwide, but evidence supporting its use varies by age and disease process. Despite its frequent use in childhood acute ischemic stroke prevention and management, significant knowledge gaps exist about optimal pediatric aspirin use, particularly in this setting, where high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed. This review focuses on the evidence for aspirin use in childhood acute ischemic stroke. It includes a summary of aspirin pharmacology to highlight misconceptions and common clinical situations which may limit its efficacy and discusses the techniques and potential role of laboratory monitoring of aspirin efficacy in children.

### Ticagrelor and aspirin or aspirin alone in acute ischemic stroke or TIA [^1125nMjM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Trials have evaluated the use of clopidogrel and aspirin to prevent stroke after an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). In a previous trial, ticagrelor was not better than aspirin in preventing vascular events or death after stroke or TIA. The effect of the combination of ticagrelor and aspirin on the prevention of stroke has not been well studied.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial involving patients who had a mild-to-moderate acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 5 or less (range, 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe stroke), or TIA and who were not undergoing thrombolysis or thrombectomy. The patients were assigned within 24 hours after symptom onset, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive a 30-day regimen of either ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose followed by 90 mg twice daily) plus aspirin (300 to 325 mg on the first day followed by 75 to 100 mg daily) or matching placebo plus aspirin. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke or death within 30 days. Secondary outcomes were the first subsequent ischemic stroke and the incidence of disability within 30 days. The primary safety outcome was severe bleeding.

- **Results**: A total of 11,016 patients underwent randomization (5523 in the ticagrelor-aspirin group and 5493 in the aspirin group). A primary-outcome event occurred in 303 patients (5.5%) in the ticagrelor-aspirin group and in 362 patients (6.6%) in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.71 to 0.96).

### Effects of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent stroke after transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: Time-course analysis of randomised trials [^114Su6y9]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

For trials of aspirin in the treatment of major acute stroke, we sought to obtain individual patient data on the severity of stroke at entry, such as a severity score or other measures of the extent of the baseline neurological deficit, and on the time to first recurrent ischaemic stroke during the trial period. In one small trial, only data for the progression of stroke were collected, defined as a worsening of at least 2 points on the Scandinavian Stroke Progression Scale. In the absence of any other data, this outcome was included for completeness.

### Low-dose aspirin in patients with stable cardiovascular disease: A meta-analysis [^112frQq1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the benefit and risk of low-dose aspirin (50–325 mg/d) in patients with stable cardiovascular disease. Many recommendations for aspirin in stable cardiovascular disease are based on analyses of all antiplatelet therapies at all dosages and in both stable and unstable patients.

- **Methods**: Secondary prevention trials of low-dose aspirin in patients with stable cardiovascular disease were identified by searching the MEDLINE database from 1966 to 2006. Six randomized trials were identified, enrolling patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI) (n = 1), stable angina (n = 1), or stroke/transient ischemic attack (n = 4). A random effects model was used to combine results from individual trials.

- **Results**: Six studies randomized 9853 patients. Aspirin therapy was associated with a significant 21% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death) (95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.88), a 26% reduction in the risk of nonfatal MI (95% CI, 0.60–0.91), a 25% reduction in the risk of stroke (95% CI, 0.65–0.87), and a 13% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI, 0.76–0.98). Patients treated with aspirin were significantly more likely to experience severe bleeding (odds ratio 2.2, 95% CI, 1.4–3.4). Treating 1000 patients for an average of 33 months would prevent 33 cardiovascular events, 12 nonfatal MIs, 25 nonfatal strokes, and 14 deaths, but cause 9 major bleeding events. Among those with ischemic heart disease, aspirin was most effective at reducing the risk of nonfatal MI.

### Evaluation of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of ischemic stroke among patients with diabetes: a retrospective cohort study [^11777jj5]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin is recommended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, yet questions regarding its use for primary prevention have been raised among patients with diabetes. We evaluated the use of low-dose aspirin for preventing ischemic stroke in patients with diabetes by utilizing a national health insurance database.

- **Methods**: Using data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009, a population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted. This study involved incident patients with diabetes aged 40 to 99 years old who began initial use of low-dose aspirin during the index period from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2007. Each low-dose aspirin user was matched to one non-user using a propensity score. The Cox proportional hazards model was applied to compare the risk of hospitalization for ischemic stroke in users and non-users of low-dose aspirin until December 31, 2009.

- **Results**: Out of 261,065 incident patients with diabetes, 15,849 (6.2%) were low-dose aspirin users. Compared to non-users, the adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of low-dose aspirin users for hospitalization due to ischemic stroke was 1.73 (95% CI; 1.41–2.12). A sensitivity analysis of study subjects with more than one year of follow-up showed a slightly higher adjusted hazard ratio of 1.97 (95% CI; 1.51–2.62). In the subgroup analyses, there were no significant changes in the risk of hospitalization for ischemic stroke irrespective of gender, age, or comorbidity.

- **Conclusions**: In this study of patients with diabetes, t

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^115eRH8U]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

The lowest effective daily dose of aspirin for long-term antiplatelet prophylaxis ranges between 50 and 100 mg, with no evidence that higher doses are more effective, consistent with saturability of platelet COX-1 inactivation at low doses. This evidence is based on indirect comparisons of RCTs employing different aspirin dosing regimens, as well as on a limited number of head-to-head randomized comparisons of a lower versus a higher dose, both in acute coronary syndromes and stable patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

There is also no convincing evidence that the dose requirement for the antithrombotic effect of aspirin varies in different clinical settings or as a function of body weight. Similarly, there is no evidence that the effect of aspirin on major vascular events is influenced by gender, age, concomitant treatments, or primary versus secondary prevention. In the ASPREE trial involving 19,114 healthy elderly persons (median age, 74 years) who did not have known cardiovascular disease (CVD), the use of low-dose aspirin did not result in a significantly lower risk of CVD than placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83–1.08]. However, the widely cited message from ASPREE that low-dose aspirin is ineffective in old age is potentially misleading for the following reasons: (i) CVD was not the primary endpoint of ASPREE; (ii) CVD, a pre-specified secondary endpoint, was a composite of platelet-dependent as well as platelet-independent events, i.e. fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal MI, fatal or non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization.

### Aspirin for primary prevention: a challenging decision [^113KnG66]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a challenging issue for clinicians, patients, and health policy makers. Even with the availability of multiple randomized trials and several high‐quality systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, significant debate remains about which patients, if any, should be offered aspirin for primary prevention.

- **United States guideline‐issuing organizations**: The main US guideline‐issuing organizations, including the US Preventive Services Task Force and the American Heart Association, have made recommendations in favor of aspirin use for primary prevention in people with increased CVD risk who are not at high risk for aspirin's adverse effects.

- **Opposition to aspirin use**: Others have recommended against aspirin use for most patients without a prior history of CVD events. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a statement reaffirming that "[it] has reviewed the available data and does not believe the evidence supports the general use of aspirin for primary prevention of a heart attack or stroke".

Much of the debate about aspirin's use for primary prevention centers on two key issues: first, how to integrate information on potential benefits derived from multiple trials that were performed in heterogeneous populations, that used a range of doses of aspirin, and that were conducted in the context of differing availability of other effective interventions, such as statins; and second, how to assess whether the potential benefits outweigh the known harms of aspirin, including gastrointestinal bleeding and, less commonly but more seriously, hemorrhagic stroke. Most analyses address these complex considerations thoroughly.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138itBT]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

Minor ischaemic strokes or transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) put patients at risk of subsequent cardiovascular events, including devastating major strokes. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that patients who experience minor ischaemic strokes or TIAs benefit from antiplatelet therapy. Consequently, guidelines for the management of acute ischaemic stroke and TIA recommend antiplatelet therapy — typically providing strong recommendations for the use of a single agent, most commonly aspirin. One guideline provides a weak recommendation for clopidogrel and aspirin therapy, initiated within 24 hours of a patient presenting with minor stroke or TIA, and continuing for 21 days.

Several trials have tested the effectiveness and safety of clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin alone to prevent recurrent events in patients experiencing non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or TIA in both the acute phase and the chronic phase. The Clopidogrel in High-risk patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial reported that adding clopidogrel to aspirin starting within 24 hours of a minor stroke or TIA and continuing for 21 days reduced stroke risk without increasing the risk of moderate or severe haemorrhage at three and 12 months.

Despite findings from the CHANCE trial, many guideline recommendations persisted in recommending a single rather than dual agent clopidogrel and aspirin for the initial treatment of minor ischaemic stroke or TIA. Rationales provided by guideline authors for not recommending routine dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with these conditions continue to be debated.

### Effects of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent stroke after transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: Time-course analysis of randomised trials [^115SJjKV]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

All analyses were conducted by intention to treat based on the randomised treatment allocation. In the secondary prevention trials, the effects of aspirin versus control and dipyridamole versus control were calculated, with stratification by time from randomisation (0–6 weeks, 6–12 weeks, and > 12 weeks), for the following outcomes: re-ischaemic stroke, disabling or fatal re-ischaemic stroke, any re-stroke, any fatal stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and acute myocardial infarction. For each outcome, odds ratios (OR) were calculated for each trial and pooled estimates were generated by fixed-effects meta-analysis (Mantel-Haenszel-Peto method) if there was no significant heterogeneity (χ² test) between trials.

In the absence of significant heterogeneity, individual patient data were pooled and Kaplan-Meier curves (1−proportion free of event) were generated for time to first event. Statistical significance of any effect of randomised treatment allocation was determined using the log-rank test stratified by trial, and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were generated for events up to 12 weeks follow-up using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by trial. The assumption of proportional hazards was violated if events after 12 weeks were included. The severity of early re-strokes between treatment groups was compared based on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores using ordinal regression (mRS shift) analysis. The assumption of proportional odds was assessed with the score test and was valid (p > 0.3) for all analyses.

### Contemporary primary prevention aspirin use by cardiovascular disease risk: Impact of US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, 2007–2015: A serial, cross-sectional study [^116CMPpq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Aspirin use is effective in preventing first heart attacks and strokes, although it increases the risk of bleeding events. A 2012 meta-analysis of aspirin's net benefit reported a 31% excess in nontrivial bleeding (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.14–1.50). However, the health impact of a heart attack or stroke differs from that of a reversible, nonfatal bleeding event. Thus, "appropriate aspirin use" can be defined as prescribing aspirin to prevent a first cardiovascular ischemic event when the benefit outweighs the risk, guided by patient preferences. Achieving this clinical goal requires a thoughtful discussion between an informed clinician and an "at-risk" patient.

Clinicians may have concerns about "inappropriate" aspirin use in populations with low cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. In this study, 41% of individuals with a 10-year CVD risk of less than 10% used aspirin, and 33% of those with a CVD risk of less than 5% used aspirin. This high prevalence of aspirin use may reflect a lack of consensus on which patients might benefit from aspirin, as indicated by different recommendations from various guideline committees. The 2009 recommendations employed different risk thresholds based on age and sex, meaning many people with 5% to 10% risk met the qualifications for aspirin use. Interestingly, aspirin use in the group with 5% to 10% risk was similar to other risk categories, with a slight decline following the 2009 recommendations.

### Do clinicians recommend aspirin to patients for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^116H3qcz]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released updated guidelines in 2009 recommending aspirin to prevent myocardial infarction among at-risk men and stroke among at-risk women.

Our aim was to examine clinician aspirin recommendations among eligible persons based on cardiovascular risk scores and USPSTF cutoffs. We used a cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative sample.

Participants were aged 40 years and older and were part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011 to 2012. We determined aspirin eligibility for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention for each participant based on reported and assessed cardiovascular risk factors. Men's risk was assessed using a published coronary heart disease risk calculator based on Framingham equations. A similar calculator was used to assess stroke risk for women. The USPSTF risk cutoffs for sex and age that account for offsetting risk for gastrointestinal hemorrhage were applied. Clinician recommendations for aspirin were assessed based on participant reports.

Among men aged 45–79 years and women aged 55–79 years, 87% of men and 16% of women were potentially eligible for primary CVD aspirin prevention. Clinician recommendation rates for aspirin among those eligible were low, at 34% for men and 42% for women. Rates were highest among diabetics (63%), those aged 65 to 79 years (52%), or those in poor health (44%). In contrast, aspirin recommendation rates were 76% for CVD secondary prevention.

### Frequency of intracranial hemorrhage with low-dose aspirin in individuals without symptomatic cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115CXZX1]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Use of low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events remains controversial due to the increased risk of bleeding, which may offset the overall benefit. Among major bleeding events, intracranial hemorrhage is associated with high mortality rates and functional dependency.

- **Objective**: To assess the risk of intracranial hemorrhage associated with low-dose aspirin among individuals without symptomatic cardiovascular disease.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from January 1966 to October 30, 2018.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials that compared low-dose aspirin (daily dose ≤ 100 mg) vs. control and recorded the endpoints of intracranial hemorrhage separately for active treatment and control groups were included.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: A random-effect estimate was computed based on the Mantel-Haenszel method. Relative risk with 95% CI was used as a measure of aspirin vs. control on the risk of intracranial hemorrhage.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The main outcomes were any intracranial hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural or extradural hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, for aspirin vs. control.

The search identified 13 randomized clinical trials of low-dose aspirin use for primary prevention, enrolling 134,446 patients. Pooling the results from the random-effects model showed that low-dose aspirin, compared with control, was associated with an increased risk of any intracranial bleeding.

### Use of aspirin for primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in the United States, 2011–2012 [^1131tDK6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Individuals who had never been told by a physician that they had a stroke or heart attack were considered candidates for primary prevention. Their eligibility for guideline-recommended use of aspirin was based on the assessment of their risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). High risk for CHD was classified as having a 10-year CHD risk of greater than 10% according to the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) with no history of heart attack or stroke. Low risk for CHD was considered a risk of 10% or less according to the FRS with no history of heart attack or stroke, as stated in the 2010 American Diabetes Association/American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines.

The FRS was calculated according to published guidelines in the literature.

- **Framingham risk score**: The FRS utilizes gender, age, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, use of blood pressure medications, and smoking status. For NHANES participants, total cholesterol was available through the laboratory testing results. Systolic blood pressure was calculated by averaging three readings taken during the medical examination portion of the NHANES study. Smoking status was defined as whether or not the respondent was currently smoking. The scores were grouped into two categories for this analysis: low risk (having a 10-year risk of heart attack be less than 10% on the Framingham Risk Calculator) and high risk (10% or above).

For people with diabetes, defined as having been told by a physician that the respondent had diabetes (excluding gestational diabetes), as per the American Diabetes Association/American Heart Association guidelines, aspirin therapy was evaluated.

### Revisiting the role of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1176By5P]. Circulation (2019). Low credibility.

Aspirin is the cornerstone of the antithrombotic management of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, major guidelines provide conflicting recommendations for its use in primary prevention. Findings from recent randomized trials involving over 47,000 patients have called into question the net clinical benefits of aspirin in primary prevention for three key populations: patients with diabetes mellitus, community-dwelling elderly individuals, and patients without diabetes mellitus who are at intermediate risk for atherosclerotic events.

In the context of increasing emphasis on the use of other treatments for primary prevention in patients with moderate-high future risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary prevention has become uncertain. Key unresolved questions regarding the role of aspirin in primary prevention include:

- **Optimal drug formulation, dosing schedule, weight-based dose selection**, and interplay between sex and treatment response.

In the current era, most patients without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease should not be prescribed aspirin. Instead, aggressive management of comorbidities tailored to the expected cardiovascular risk needs to be emphasized. In this context, informed shared decision-making between clinicians and patients regarding the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events is a suitable and laudable approach.

### Low-dose aspirin in primary prevention: Cardioprotection, chemoprevention, both, or neither [^115aFQvm]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been shown to be effective in preventing about one-fifth of atherothrombotic vascular complications (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death) in a meta-analysis of 16 secondary prevention trials in patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient cerebral ischaemia. This corresponds to an absolute reduction of about 10–20 per 1000 patients in the yearly incidence of non-fatal events and to a smaller, but still definite, reduction in vascular death.

Against this benefit, the absolute increase in major extracranial bleeding complications (mostly gastrointestinal) is 20- to 50-fold smaller, depending on age and sex. Hence, for secondary prevention, the benefits of antiplatelet therapy substantially exceed the risks.

For primary prevention, the balance between vascular events avoided and major bleeds caused by aspirin is substantially uncertain because the risks without aspirin, and hence the absolute benefits of antiplatelet prophylaxis, are at least an order of magnitude lower than in secondary prevention. The aim of this article is to review the updated evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention and to discuss additional health benefits resulting from prolonged antiplatelet therapy in apparently healthy people at low average risk of vascular events.

### Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology 2023 focused update of the guidelines for the use of antiplatelet therapy [^114Gxvt7]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, specifically in the context of primary prevention, the CAIC/CCS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of aspirin for the primary prevention of ASCVD in certain patients who are deemed at high risk of ASCVD but have a low bleeding risk. This recommendation should be made in the context of a patient-centered and informed shared decision-making process.

### Aspirin resistance in stroke: 2004 [^1171H1v3]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2005). Low credibility.

Aspirin is a well-established medication in the treatment of atherothrombotic vascular disease. However, despite aspirin treatment, a substantial number of patients experience recurring ischaemic episodes. Aspirin resistance denotes situations where it is unable to protect individuals from thrombotic complications, or when it fails to produce an anticipated effect in laboratory tests of platelet function. Various laboratory techniques exist to evaluate the effectiveness of aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs. It has been estimated that in 5–60% of patients, aspirin does not achieve adequate efficacy in various measures of platelet activity. Some studies have revealed that vascular patients shown by laboratory tests to be aspirin-resistant are at an increased risk of major vascular events.

- **Suggested mechanisms of aspirin resistance**: Among others, these include genetic polymorphisms, alternate pathways of platelet activation, aspirin-insensitive thromboxane biosynthesis, drug interactions, or low aspirin dose.

An increase in the dosage of aspirin or conversion to clopidogrel or clopidogrel plus aspirin might be beneficial in managing patients who are aspirin resistant. Additional work is required to improve and validate laboratory tests of platelet function so they may become useful tools for selecting the most appropriate antiplatelet therapy for an individual patient. Improvements in antiplatelet treatment strategies in the future should lead to a reduction in premature vascular events.

### Anticoagulants versus antiplatelet agents for acute ischaemic stroke [^1151BAYW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet agents produce a small but worthwhile benefit in long-term functional outcome and survival, and have become the standard treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. Anticoagulants are often used as an alternative treatment, despite evidence that they are ineffective in producing long-term benefits. We wanted to review trials that have directly compared anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents to assess whether any anticoagulant regimen offers net advantages over antiplatelet agents, overall or in some particular category of patients (e.g. patients with atrial fibrillation).

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of anticoagulants compared with antiplatelet agents in acute ischaemic stroke and to assess whether the addition of anticoagulants to antiplatelet agents offers any net advantage over antiplatelet agents alone.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Central/CCTR), the trials register held by the Antithrombotic Therapy Trialists' Collaboration, MEDLINE (1966–2000), and EMBASE (1980–2000). All searches were performed during April and May 2001.

- **Selection criteria**: Truly unconfounded, randomized-controlled trials comparing anticoagulants with antiplatelet agents, or anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents with antiplatelet agents alone, given within 14 days of the onset of presumed or confirmed ischaemic stroke.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Both reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion in the review, assessed trial quality, and extracted data.

### Effects of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent stroke after transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: Time-course analysis of randomised trials [^1138fSMF]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Aspirin is recommended for secondary prevention after transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or ischaemic stroke based on trials showing a 13% reduction in long-term risk of recurrent stroke. However, the risk of major stroke is very high during the first few days after TIA and minor ischaemic stroke. Observational studies indicate substantially greater benefits of early medical treatment in the acute phase compared to longer-term trials. We hypothesized that the short-term benefits of early aspirin use have been underestimated.

- **Methods**: Pooling data from all randomised trials of aspirin versus control in secondary prevention after TIA or ischaemic stroke, we studied the effects of aspirin on the risk and severity of recurrent stroke. We stratified results by the time periods: less than 6 weeks, 6–12 weeks, and more than 12 weeks after randomisation. The severity of early recurrent strokes was compared between treatment groups using a shift analysis of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Furthermore, we examined the time course of interaction between the effects of aspirin and dipyridamole in stroke secondary prevention. In another analysis, we pooled data from trials of aspirin versus control where patients were randomised less than 48 hours following a major acute stroke, stratified by baseline severity of neurological deficit, to establish the early time course of aspirin's effects on the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke and its variation by baseline severity.

- **Findings**: Data were pooled for 15 relevant studies.

### Analysis of risk of bleeding complications after different doses of aspirin in 192,036 patients enrolled in 31 randomized controlled trials [^115xi9U3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). High credibility.

We sought to compare the risk of hemorrhage due to the low (200 mg) doses of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) in 192,036 patients enrolled in 31 clinical trials. Despite substantial differences in the reporting patterns of bleeding complications, low-dose ASA was associated with the lowest risk, and moderate doses caused a relatively high hemorrhagic event rate, especially with regard to minor, gastrointestinal, and total bleeding, and stroke. These findings should be considered when using combination antiplatelets, anticoagulant therapy, or both, with ASA, especially with the daily dose of > 100 mg.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178FGGA]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

Strengths of this review include a comprehensive search for randomized, placebo-controlled trials; explicit eligibility criteria with a focus on populations most likely to benefit from dual antiplatelet therapy; assessment of risk of bias; provision of important data not included in their published reports, provided by the authors of the two large studies; use of the GRADE approach to determine our certainty in the evidence; and an innovative approach to creating a single incidence curve that informs the optimal duration for continuing clopidogrel from the two large studies. The consistent results across studies and the clear benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy on reducing stroke without evidence of important adverse effects is likely to provide clear guidance for patients with high risk TIA and minor ischaemic stroke and for the clinicians responsible for their care.

Our study has some limitations. The loading dose and treatment onset time differed among the three studies: CHANCE and FASTER used a smaller loading dose of clopidogrel compared with POINT (300 mg vs 600 mg). This could leave clinicians with uncertainty as to which loading dose to choose. Our review does not address other populations of potential interest, including those who have experienced low risk TIA and those with moderate to severe ischaemic stroke.

No trial compared clopidogrel with dual antiplatelet therapy and the addition of aspirin. It is possible that different categories of ischaemic stroke subtypes — small vessel disease, large vessel stenosis — might result in different responses to treatment.
