## Question

What is the recommended Lasix iv dosage for acute pulmonary edema?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended IV furosemide (Lasix) dosage for acute pulmonary edema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are dealing with cardiogenic pulmonary edema versus other etiologies. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled IV dosing for pulmonary edema. Next, I will consider how prior outpatient loop diuretic exposure modifies the initial dose. After that, I need to check administration details and escalation strategy. I will then review adjunctive therapies, especially nitrates, and hemodynamic caveats. I should also examine renal function considerations and diuretic resistance. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-conscious algorithm and note special scenarios like high-altitude pulmonary edema and ARDS where furosemide may not help or may be harmful.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because dosing and sequencing hinge on whether this is cardiogenic pulmonary edema due to acute decompensated heart failure versus non-cardiogenic causes like ARDS or high-altitude pulmonary edema. Furosemide is indicated as adjunctive therapy for pulmonary edema in adults, but its role and benefit vary by etiology, so I need to ensure we are treating cardiogenic edema before committing to IV loop diuretics [^113UsGBg] [^116upV7c] [^116saNzv] [^116jtXGc].

> I should confirm the FDA-labeled IV regimen for pulmonary edema. The label directs 40 mg IV bolus over 1–2 minutes, repeated at 80 mg IV in 1 hour if necessary, which establishes a clear initial and escalation anchor for undifferentiated pulmonary edema presentations in adults [^116WUoyX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a fixed 40 mg start for everyone. For patients already taking outpatient loop diuretics, contemporary heart failure guidance recommends converting the total daily oral furosemide dose to IV and giving 1–2.5 times that total daily dose as the initial IV dose, which often results in 40–80 mg IV for many patients, and the DOSE trial signal suggests higher initial dosing yields more fluid loss and symptom relief by 72 hours, so I should individualize based on home dose rather than default to 40 mg if the patient is on higher chronic therapy [^114DeRrU] [^111UpGBY].

> Wait, let me verify administration details and timing. The labeled bolus should be administered over 1–2 minutes, and if the response is inadequate, escalate to 80 mg IV at 1 hour, which operationalizes early reassessment and avoids premature stacking of doses. I should also remember that furosemide can transiently worsen hemodynamics in some settings, so I need to monitor blood pressure and perfusion closely after dosing [^116WUoyX] [^111ffcwV].

> Next, I should review adjunctive therapy because diuretic monotherapy may be insufficient in severe pulmonary edema. Emergency care policies and randomized data support combining furosemide with high-dose nitrates, which reduce preload and afterload and may decrease the need for intubation, so I should prioritize nitrates early alongside judicious diuretic dosing rather than aggressive diuretic monotherapy [^1133CB3u] [^112eXhff].

> I need to ensure hemodynamic safety. IV furosemide can provoke hypotension, particularly in patients with low baseline blood pressure, advanced age, low ejection fraction, or atrial fibrillation, and co-administration with agents like diltiazem can compound blood pressure drops, so in borderline or low SBP I should consider starting at 20–40 mg IV and titrate cautiously while watching for hypotension and renal perfusion changes [^115rvb3N] [^113dMgYT].

> Let me consider renal function and diuretic responsiveness. Even with eGFR below 20 mL/min/1.73 m², no routine dose adjustment is mandated, but higher doses may be required to overcome reduced natriuretic response, and in diuretic resistance I should consider combination strategies such as adding a thiazide-type diuretic or hypertonic saline protocols, while balancing risks of worsening renal function and electrolyte disturbances [^114ytgxe] [^111mtWBX] [^117GcufS].

> But wait, what if the pulmonary edema is not cardiogenic? In ARDS, a conservative fluid strategy is reasonable, yet loop diuretics have not shown mortality benefit and should not be used reflexively, and in high-altitude pulmonary edema, descent and nifedipine are first-line while furosemide may improve imaging findings without improving hard outcomes, so I should avoid furosemide in these non-cardiogenic etiologies unless there is a compelling, individualized indication [^116saNzv] [^112Cjh4a] [^116jtXGc] [^1146J22L].

> I should double-check special populations. In the elderly, start at the low end of the range and titrate carefully due to greater susceptibility to volume shifts and electrolyte disturbances, and in patients with substantial alcohol use or cirrhosis, I need to monitor closely for orthostatic symptoms and hepatic complications when using loop diuretics [^114Ekz9C] [^113d1wt5] [^115s3mYS].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm while keeping safety front and center. For undifferentiated acute pulmonary edema, begin with 40 mg IV furosemide over 1–2 minutes and reassess at 1 hour, escalating to 80 mg IV if the response is inadequate. For patients already on loop diuretics, give 1–2.5 times their total daily oral furosemide dose IV as the initial bolus, typically 40–80 mg but sometimes higher. In all cases, co-administer high-dose nitrates when not hypotensive, monitor blood pressure and urine output closely, and titrate subsequent doses to clinical response while avoiding excessive cumulative daily totals that risk renal injury and electrolyte derangements [^116WUoyX] [^114DeRrU] [^1133CB3u] [^111pDXNy].

> Hold on, I should verify the upper dosing guardrails. While the FDA label allows cumulative furosemide doses up to 600 mg/day in severe edematous states, observational and trial data associate higher loop diuretic exposure with worse renal outcomes and mortality, so I should aim for the lowest effective dose to achieve decongestion and reassess frequently rather than push toward high cumulative totals [^116cuqM1] [^111pDXNy].

> Finally, I need to ensure ongoing monitoring and de-escalation. Track strict intake and output, daily weights, electrolytes, and renal function, and as congestion improves, transition to oral therapy at the minimal effective dose with a plan for patient-directed flexible dosing and early follow-up to prevent rebound congestion and diuretic resistance [^114poBeZ].

---

The recommended IV Lasix (furosemide) dose for acute pulmonary edema is **40 mg IV bolus over 1–2 minutes** [^116WUoyX], repeated at **80 mg IV in 1 hour if needed** [^116WUoyX]. For patients already on loop diuretics, give **1–2.5× the total daily oral dose IV** [^114DeRrU]. Use the lowest effective dose and titrate to response, with close monitoring for hypotension, electrolyte disturbances, and renal function [^111Sd7xR] [^116cuqM1].

---

## Recommended IV Lasix dosage

- **Initial dose**: 40 mg IV bolus over 1–2 minutes [^116WUoyX].
- **Repeat dose**: 80 mg IV bolus 1 hour after the initial dose if the clinical response is inadequate [^116WUoyX].
- **Patients on chronic loop diuretics**: 1–2.5× the total daily oral dose IV [^114DeRrU].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosage recommendations

Evidence includes the **FDA labeling** specifying 40 mg IV, repeated at 80 mg in 1 hour if needed [^116WUoyX], and the **DOSE trial**, which supports 1–2.5× the oral dose IV for patients already on loop diuretics [^114DeRrU].

---

## Factors influencing dosage adjustments

Several factors influence **dosage adjustments**:

| **Factor** | **Dosage adjustment** |
|-|-|
| Renal impairment | May require higher doses due to reduced diuretic response [^114ytgxe] [^111mtWBX] |
| Severe renal dysfunction (eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m²) | Higher doses may be necessary [^114ytgxe] |
| Hypotension | Use caution; consider lower initial doses [^115rvb3N] |
| Electrolyte disturbances | Monitor and adjust dose accordingly [^116c1UmL] |

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

IV furosemide carries **potential risks and adverse effects**:

- **Hypotension**: Especially in patients with low baseline blood pressure [^115rvb3N].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia [^113zZnDw].
- **Renal dysfunction**: Worsening renal function, particularly with high doses [^111pDXNy].
- **Ototoxicity**: Rare but possible with high doses or rapid administration.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **hemodynamic monitoring** — regular blood pressure and heart rate checks — and **laboratory monitoring** of electrolytes, renal function, and acid-base status. Clinical assessment should track respiratory status, oxygen saturation, and urine output.

---

## Alternative therapies and adjunctive treatments

Alternative therapies and adjunctive treatments include **vasodilators** such as nitroglycerin or nitroprusside to reduce preload and afterload [^116o6ZBR] [^1144pfWc], and **non-invasive ventilation** (CPAP or BiPAP) to improve oxygenation and reduce intubation rates [^notfound]. Inotropes may be considered for severe cardiogenic shock.

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **elderly patients**, in whom lower initial doses and careful titration are recommended [^114Ekz9C], and **patients with chronic kidney disease**, who may require higher doses due to reduced diuretic response [^114ytgxe] [^111mtWBX].

---

The recommended IV Lasix dosage for acute pulmonary edema is **40 mg IV bolus over 1–2 minutes** [^116WUoyX], repeated at **80 mg IV in 1 hour if needed** [^116WUoyX]. For patients already on loop diuretics, give **1–2.5× the total daily oral dose IV** [^114DeRrU]. Use the lowest effective dose and titrate to response, with close monitoring for hypotension, electrolyte disturbances, and renal function [^116c1UmL] [^116cuqM1].

### Loop diuretics in acute heart failure: beyond the decongestive relief for the kidney [^114GBUa1]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients with acute heart failure (AHF), the risk of death or rehospitalization within 60 days from admission ranges from 30 to 60%, depending on the population studied. The symptoms that drive hospital admission are linked to congestion, and loop diuretics are the most common initial therapeutic approach (used in 90% of cases). These agents promptly improve symptoms and have been shown to reduce dyspnea scores and peripheral edema. However, loop diuretics have been associated with increased rates of mortality and readmission in a graded fashion with cumulative dose and with continuous infusions. It is unclear whether this association is due to confounding by indication or whether adverse events lead to clinically meaningful outcomes accounting for these observations. In this context, neither European Society of Cardiology nor American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines provide any specific recommendation regarding starting and maintaining dosage, oral or intravenous infusion, and time course of treatment. Thus, despite the clinical efficacy of these drugs in providing decongestion and symptomatic improvement, several questions remain to be answered about the optimal approach in any given patient providing diuresis and decongestion but not tipping the balance leading to acute kidney injury (AKI), electrolyte disturbances, and worse outcomes.

### Advanced heart failure: parenteral diuretics for breathlessness and peripheral oedema-systematic review [^111u51Xf]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Background

Advanced heart failure patients suffer with breathlessness and peripheral oedema, which are frequently treated with parenteral diuretics despite limited evidence.

Aim

To analyse the effectiveness of parenteral diuretics on breathlessness and peripheral oedema in advanced heart failure patients.

Methods

We searched Embase, MEDLINE(R), PsycINFO, CINAHL and CENTRAL from their respective inceptions to 2021, and performed handsearching, citation searching and grey literature search; limited to English publications. Selection criteria included parenteral (intravenous/subcutaneous) diuretic administration in advanced heart failure patients (New York Heart Association class III-IV). Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion; one author extracted data. Data were synthesised through narrative synthesis or meta-analysed as appropriate.

Results

4646 records were screened; 6 trials (384 participants) were included. All were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intravenous continuous furosemide infusion (CFI) versus intravenous bolus furosemide infusion (BFI). Improvement in breathlessness and peripheral oedema (two studies, n = 161, OR 2.80, 95%CI 1.45 to 5.40; I² = 0%), and increase in urine output (four studies, n = 234, mean difference, MD 344.76, 95%CI 132.87 to 556.64; I² = 44%), were statistically significant in favour of CFI. Significantly lower serum potassium was found in BFI compared with CFI (three studies, n = 194, MD -0.20, 95%CI -0.38 to -0.01; I² = 0%). There was no difference between CFI and BFI on reduction in weight, renal function or length of hospital stay.

Conclusions

CFI appears to improve congestion in advanced heart failure patients in the short term. Available data came from small trials. Larger, prospective RCTs are recommended to address the evidence gap.

WARNING

LASIX (furosemide) is a potent diuretic which, if given in excessive amounts, can lead to a profound diuresis with water and electrolyte depletion. Therefore, careful medical supervision is required and dose and dose schedule must be adjusted to the individual patient's needs (s ee DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

---

### Furosemide (Lasix) [^112bQzVF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Edema

LASIX is indicated in adults and pediatric patients for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. LASIX is particularly useful when an agent with greater diuretic potential is desired.

Hypertension

Oral LASIX may be used in adults for the treatment of hypertension alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Hypertensive patients who cannot be adequately controlled with thiazides will probably also not be adequately controlled with LASIX alone.

Decongestion with diuretic and adjunctive therapy — initial inpatient dosing and continuation: Establishing an effective diuretic regimen is crucial for achieving decongestion, and first doses, often given in the emergency department (ED), are generally based on previous home loop diuretic doses, as in the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial. For patients already on outpatient loop diuretics, the total daily dose should be changed to an oral furosemide equivalent and administered intravenously (IV) at 1 to 2.5 times the total daily dose. For patients not previously on outpatient diuretics, the initial furosemide dose usually is around 40 to 80 mg IV daily. In the DOSE trial, initiation of the 2.5 times higher dose led to 37% more fluid loss, 43% more weight loss, and greater dyspnea relief by 72 hours. Diuretic agents are usually continued throughout the early hospital stay, either by IV bolus every 8 to 12 hours or by continuous IV infusion.

### Continuous versus bolus intermittent loop diuretic infusion in acutely decompensated heart failure: a prospective randomized trial [^1136w9YG]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

This was a prospective, randomized, open label, double-blind study comparing continuous with intermittent infusion of furosemide in patients admitted with a diagnosis of ADHF into our tertiary-care medical center. The current pilot study design was planned to anticipate a larger multicenter trial able to definitively evaluate most optimal loop diuretic strategies in patients with ADHF. Patients were enrolled consecutively from the Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiology Section Center (Siena, Italy) from April 2010 to November 2012. All patients enrolled were submitted to continuous electrocardiography and blood pressure monitoring as well as regular measurements of urine output. We hypothesized that continuous infusion treatment could be superior to bolus intermittent administration to relieve congestion, increase diuresis and decrease B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Patients were eligible if they were admitted with a primary diagnosis of ADHF, could be randomized within 12 h after hospital presentation and had evidence of volume overload (pulmonary congestion on chest radiography or significant increase in BNP levels). Some patients received noninvasive ventilation support before randomization (10 in the continuous and 7 in the bolus group). The cumulative daily dose of intravenous furosemide to be given in the initial 12 h was decided upon by the attending physician. Patients were then randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated scheme into either twice-daily bolus injections or continuous infusion (mixed as a 1:1 ratio in 5% dextrose in water), for a time period ranging from 72 to 120 h. Boluses of furosemide were administered in 100 mL of water solution in one hour. The mean daily diuretic dosage was similar in both groups as a result of the protocol (Figure 1).

### A randomized controlled trial of a single dose furosemide to improve respiratory distress in moderate to severe bronchiolitis [^113ofApa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is one of the most common disorders of the lower respiratory tract in infants. While historically diuretics have been used in severe bronchiolitis, no studies have looked directly at their early use in children in the emergency department.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to determine whether a single early dose of a diuretic in infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis would improve respiratory distress. Secondary objectives examined whether it reduced the use of noninvasive ventilation and hospital length of stay.

Methods

Patients diagnosed with clinical bronchiolitis were enrolled at a tertiary care, academic children's hospital over a 3-year period. This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in which subjects were randomly assigned to either furosemide or placebo. Respiratory rate and oxygen saturation at the time of medication delivery and at 2 and 4 h post-intervention were recorded, as well as other data. Exact logistic regression was used to examine associations.

Results

There were 46 subjects enrolled and randomized. There was no difference in respiratory rates, measured as a decrease of ≥ 25%, at both 2 and 4 h after intervention between furosemide and placebo groups (odds ratios 1.13 and 1.13, respectively). There was also no difference in oxygen saturation, intensive care unit admission rate, or hospital length of stay between groups.

Conclusions

While theoretically a single dose of a diuretic to reduce lung fluid would improve respiratory distress in children with bronchiolitis, our randomized controlled medication trial showed no difference in outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02469597.

### Blood pressure effects and risk of hypotension due to intravenous furosemide in acute decompensated heart failure [^113dMgYT]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

In this prospective cohort study, we found that the risk of hypotension associated with IV furosemide during ADHF treatment is low and predominantly occurs at low baseline blood pressures and higher furosemide doses. These results should reassure clinicians that administration of guideline‐directed IV loop diuretic doses is hemodynamically safe in the vast majority of ADHF patients.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a novel formulation of furosemide administered as a single subcutaneous injection [^111UM5Zg]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Furoscix (furosemide injection) 80 mg/10 mL is a pH neutral formulation administered subcutaneously (SC) over 5 hours to treat edema in adults with chronic HF or chronic kidney disease. Furosemide 80 mg/mL is a novel concentrated formulation administered as a single 1.0-mL SC injection that could improve convenience for patients. This randomized, open-label, phase 1 study assessed the pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, pharmacodynamics, and safety of furosemide 80 mg/mL SC versus furosemide 80 mg administered intravenously (IV).

Methods

Healthy volunteers were randomized 1:1 to furosemide 80 mg/mL SC or furosemide 80 mg IV (two 40-mg boluses, 2 hours apart), and after a 3-day washout, received the opposite treatment. Plasma furosemide pharmacokinetics, urine output, and urinary sodium and potassium excretion were measured through 12 hours post-dose. Bioavailability (the primary endpoint) was assessed as the least-squares mean ratio (LSMR) of area under the curve (AUC) from time 0-last (AUC last) and 0-infinity (AUC inf) between furosemide SC and furosemide IV. Plasma furosemide pharmacokinetics were assessed noncompartmentally. Pharmacodynamics were assessed using a repeated measures, mixed model analysis. Safety was assessed through end of study.

Results

Twenty-one participants were randomized (furosemide SC/IV, n = 10; furosemide IV/SC, n = 11). The furosemide SC/IV LSMR (90% confidence interval [CI]) AUC last was 106.1% (102.7%, 109.6%), and LSMR (90% CI) AUC inf was 107.3% (103.9%, 110.8%). Furosemide 80 mg/mL SC had bioavailability equivalent to furosemide 80 mg IV, as the CIs fell within 80.0%-125.0%. Mean (SD) C max was 4532.9 (1497.7) ng/mL with furosemide 80 mg/mL SC and 10,087.6 (2804.7) ng/mL with furosemide IV. The therapeutic effects of furosemide 80 mg/mL SC on diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis occurred within 1 hour of treatment and were consistent with those of furosemide IV at all time points. There was no significant difference between furosemide 80 mg/mL SC versus furosemide IV in total urine output or urinary sodium or potassium excretion at 0–6 hours, 0–8 hours, or 0–12 hours. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 14 (66.7%) participants (furosemide SC, n = 11 [52.4%]; furosemide IV, n = 7 [35.0%]) and were mild or moderate. Ten (47.6%) participants had injection site AEs, all of which were treatment-related, mild, non-serious, and resolved. Injection site pain scores graded on a Likert 11-point scale remained low (mean, < 0.4; median, 0) at all time points, were similar between groups, and decreased over time.

Conclusions

Furosemide 80 mg/mL SC injection was generally well tolerated and had bioavailability, diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis consistent with those of furosemide IV.

### Continuous versus bolus intermittent loop diuretic infusion in acutely decompensated heart failure: a prospective randomized trial [^1159j1KD]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The use of intravenous loop diuretics is a cornerstone of therapy for acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) treatment, especially in patients admitted with pulmonary congestion and volume overload. Significant concerns have been raised regarding the risks and benefits of loop diuretics, especially about the dosage and administration regimen. Recent guidelines recommend the use of loop diuretics to reduce left ventricular filling pressure, avoid pulmonary edema, and alleviate peripheral fluid retention. Therapeutic recommendations focus primarily on symptom relief because there are no specific strategies showing a clear benefit in the outcome of ADHF. Despite the ubiquity of loop diuretic administration, high quality data supporting their efficacy and best modality of administration are lacking. In addition, impaired renal function has consistently been proven to be an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes and a leading reason why higher doses and continuous infusions are used. The use of high doses of loop diuretics has been associated with unfavorable neuroendocrine activation, worsening renal function, electrolyte disturbances, and a poor outcome. Although loop diuretics are the most commonly used drugs in ADHF treatment, their short- and long-term effects are relatively unknown; thus, it is recommended to administer the lowest dosage to patients with ADHF in order to relieve their symptoms. Some studies have provided guidelines for the administration of these drugs in clinical practice, but data interpretation remains challenging due to the frequent exclusion of patients with kidney disease from major ADHF clinical trials. Therefore, it is not clear if continuous infusion is better than intermittent boluses in terms of decongestion, maintenance of renal filtration function, and prognosis. In theory, intermittent boluses could lead to more unfavorable hemodynamic changes, be associated with a higher rate of diuretic resistance due to suboptimal drug levels in the renal tubules, and result in a rebound in sodium reabsorption. On the other hand, continuous administration should provide more constant delivery of diuretic into the tubule, potentially reducing this phenomenon. Additionally, continuous infusion may induce an increased dieresis, reducing systemic and pulmonary congestion more efficaciously, thus avoiding sudden blood pressure reduction induced by bolus administration. However, for the same reasons, continuous infusion is associated with sustained neuroendocrine activation and electrolyte imbalance that could potentially be reduced by intermittent administration.

### The role of furosemide and fluid management for a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants [^112oC2Jk]. Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in infants born premature can present significant management challenges for neonatal providers. Quantifying a hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA) represents the first hurdle, however, identifying the best evidence-based approach amongst conservative, pharmacologic, and/or interventional management options has proven to be even more complicated. Within the conservative arm, furosemide to reduce pulmonary edema and improve lung function has spawned several discussions given the concerns for its upregulation of prostaglandin E 2 in the kidneys and conflicting outcomes data. There remains no consensus regarding furosemide use in hsPDAs. In this perspective article, we summarize the approach to defining a hsPDA, review the current practice of furosemide use in the management of hsPDA, and suggest an approach to fluid management and diuresis to address the question: is the routine use of furosemide in hsPDA merited in current practice?

### Blood pressure effects and risk of hypotension due to intravenous furosemide in acute decompensated heart failure [^115rvb3N]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient‐level factors, such as severely low EF, advanced age, and atrial fibrillation, significantly increased blood pressure reduction and risk of hypotension in the ED. In patients with these features, it may be reasonable to administer lower doses of furosemide (e.g. 40 mg) when pre‐treatment SBP is borderline to low (e.g. < 110 mmHg). By examining the confounding effects of co‐administered treatments with and without IV furosemide, we found that multiple co‐administered treatments also had profound effects on SBP which, at times, were multiplicative with IV furosemide's effects. Some of these are likely unavoidable based on specific clinical situations, such as NIPPV in patients with respiratory failure.

Others, like calcium channel blockers, are relatively contraindicated in heart failure per AHA guidelines. Use of diltiazem in combination with furosemide was the single greatest multivariable‐adjusted predictor of reduced SBP (Figure 2C), which underscores that these agents should be avoided or used with extreme caution in ADHF patients who require IV loop diuresis. Patients administered ACEi/ARB alongside IV furosemide had small but significantly greater SBP reduction than those with equivalent IV furosemide doses alone. Other medications administered in the ED (e.g. beta blockers, MRAs, dihydropyridine CCBs) did not show significant effects on SBP reduction; but the analysis was not specifically powered to detect subtle effects in these subgroups.

### Continuous versus bolus intermittent loop diuretic infusion in acutely decompensated heart failure: a prospective randomized trial [^114KwYW3]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation (DOSE) trial was a prospective, double-blind study in which researchers randomly assigned 308 subjects with ADHF to high-dose versus low-dose and continuous versus intermittent infusion of furosemide. This study did not reveal positive outcomes in either primary or secondary endpoints comparing continuous infusion to a bolus regimen. However, there were higher rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the high-dose arm. Thus, equipoise remains on this issue. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of continuous infusion of furosemide in comparison with a twice daily regimen at similar doses, on biomarker and clinical parameters.

2 Methods

2.1 Study Design and Setting

This multicenter prospective observational study was approved as minimal‐risk research by the Wayne State University (WSU) and Indiana University (IU) institutional review boards. This cohort study prospectively enrolled patients from five hospital emergency departments (EDs) in two US states. A detailed description of the study design, from which this pre‐planned secondary analysis was performed, has been published previously as CLEAR‐AHF. This manuscript was prepared according to the STROBE guidelines.

2.2 Selection of Participants

Patients with ED physician suspicion of ADHF and any of the following were included: dyspnea due primarily to ADHF per physician judgment, pulmonary edema on chest radiograph (CXR), and/or BNP (N‐terminal pro B‐type natriuretic peptide) > 300 pg/mL. Exclusion criteria were temperature > 38.5°C, suspected sepsis, ST‐elevation myocardial infarction, pregnancy, prisoners, unknown ejection fraction (EF) within 12 months, and patients without diagnostically adjudicated ADHF.

2.3 Interventions

After enrollment, two study authors with extensive ADHF research experience (P.P. and P.L.), blinded to one another, reviewed cases to adjudicate the ED diagnosis of ADHF. Disagreements were decided by discussion. A ClearSight technician, blinded to the analysis and clinical data, reviewed all monitor waveforms offline and excluded measurements where device internal diagnostics suggested a low‐quality signal (e.g. if a patient adjusted or removed the monitor to get up to the bathroom).

Clinical decision‐making by the treating physician determined the interventions (e.g. IV furosemide, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation [NIPPV], and nitroglycerin) used for ADHF. Interventions were recorded based on the ClearSight monitor's internal clock to harmonize the timing of clinical and hemodynamic data. No other IV loop diuretics were used in the hospital besides IV furosemide.

Vasodilators

Six vasodilators were studied across nine trials. Urapidil and diazoxide were the most commonly studied (three, and two trials, respectively). Fenoldopam, hydralazine, nitroglycerin, and nitroprussidewere each evaluated once. In three trials, urapidil in IV or PO formulations significantly reduced SBP from 215–165 to 179–132 over 0.5–12 h. Side effects reported with urapidil were nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, headache, and orthostatic hypotension.

Diazoxide (150–1290 mg IV) was investigated in two prospective cohort studies, which found that 150–1290-mg IV doses rapidly reduced SBP, from 214–225 to 187–159 in less than 1 h. Side effects reported with diazoxide were uremia, acute pulmonary edema, palpitations, transient hemiparesis, pain at the site of IV infusion, a mild increase in heart rate, atrial tachycardia, and chest pain. In single trials, IV fenoldopam (n = 90) at a mean dose of 0.41 mcg/kg/min reduced SBP from 212 to 178, hydralazine (n = 19) reduced MAP from 244 to 126 at 0.5 h, and nitroglycerin (n = 40) reduced SBP from 190 to 150 at 1 h.

Combinations of Antihypertensives

Combinations of agents were studied in two trials: labetalol plus furosemide and clonidine plus chlorthalidone. Labetalol 300 mg PO plus Lasix 20 mg IV was evaluated in one small (n = 16) prospective cohort, which showed a decrease in SBP from 206 to 154 at 3 h. Clonidine plus chlorthalidone was investigated in one RTC, which found that PO clonidine doses of 0.2–0.8 mg plus chlorthalidone 25 mg reduced SBP from 193–182 to 142–137 at 24 h.

### Intravenous or enteral loop diuretics for preterm infants with (or developing) chronic lung disease [^117EYbUu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Lung disease in preterm infants is often complicated with lung edema.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess the risks and benefits of administration of a diuretic acting on the loop of Henle (loop diuretic) in preterm infants with or developing chronic lung disease (CLD). Primary objectives were to assess changes in need for oxygen or ventilatory support and effects on long-term outcome, and secondary objectives were to assess changes in pulmonary mechanics and potential complications of therapy.

Search Strategy

We used the standard search method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We searched MEDLINE (1966-October 2001), EMBASE (1974-November 2001) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) (Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001). In addition, we hand searched several abstract books of national and international American and European Societies.

Selection Criteria

We included in this analysis trials in which preterm infants with or developing chronic lung disease and at least 5 days of age were all randomly allocated to receive a loop diuretic either enterally or intravenously. Eligible studies needed to assess at least one of the outcome variables defined a priori for this systematic review. Primary outcome variables included important clinical outcomes, and secondary outcome variables included toxicity and pulmonary mechanics (e.g., lung compliance and airway resistance).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard method for the Cochrane Collaboration which is described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. Two investigators extracted, assessed and coded separately all data for each study, using a form that was designed specifically for this review. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. We combined parallel and cross-over trials and, whenever possible, transformed baseline and final outcome data measured on a continuous scale into change scores using Follmann's formula.

Main Results

The only loop diuretic used in the studies which met the selection criteria was furosemide. Most studies focused on pathophysiological parameters and did not assess effects on important clinical outcomes defined in this review, or the potential complications of diuretic therapy. In preterm infants < 3 weeks of age developing CLD, furosemide administration has either inconsistent effects or no detectable effect. In infants > 3 weeks of age with CLD, a single intravenous dose of 1 mg/kg of furosemide improves lung compliance and airway resistance for 1 hour. Chronic administration of furosemide improves both oxygenation and lung compliance.

Reviewer's Conclusions

In preterm infants > 3 weeks of age with CLD, acute and chronic administration of furosemide improve lung compliance. Chronic administration of intravenous or enteral furosemide improves oxygenation. In view of the lack of data from randomized trials concerning effects on important clinical outcomes, routine or sustained use of systemic loop diuretics in infants with (or developing) CLD cannot be recommended based on current evidence. Randomized trials are needed to assess the effects of furosemide administration on survival, duration of ventilatory support and oxygen administration, length of hospital stay, potential complications and long-term outcome.

### High dose interleukin-2 (aldesleukin)-expert consensus on best management practices-2014 [^116twP2r]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Examples

Center A - whose approach is to maintain blood pressure using relatively high volumes of fluid, both as maintenance and as boluses for hypotension, will hold doses of IL-2 for oliguria of less than 80–160 ml/8 hour, and give furosemide. Most centers do not utilize diuretics except on an as needed basis, since furosemide is only likely to be effective if given more than 4 hours after an IL-2 dose. If there is no diuresis, then IL-2 doses will be delayed.

Center B - who uses vasopressors and smaller volumes of fluids, will monitor 24 hour urine output and requires at least 100 ml/shift. If there is no improved output with holding a dose of IL-2 or if there is steeply rising creatinine, then another IL-2 dose will be held until the output is increased. Fluids will be given with vasopressors to attempt to improve output.

Center C - who uses a combination of fluids and vasopressors, also starts renal doses of dopamine from the beginning of treatment. However, a prospective randomized trial compared prophylactic use of low dose dopamine versus initiation of dopamine in response to oliguria, and found no benefit to prophylactic use. Therefore, the efficacy of prophylactic renal dose dopamine is not confirmed. Dopamine may induce tachycardia which may prompt the holding of the next dose of IL-2.

Metabolic acidosis

Hypocarbia occurs for a multitude of reasons during HD IL-2 treatment: pulmonary injury, renal dysfunction, diarrhea, hypotension with high vasopressor levels resulting in poor tissue perfusion or dilution, due to the administration of non-bicarbonate containing fluids. Bicarbonate supplementation of IV fluids is recommended for serum bicarbonate levels of 19 mmol/L or an absolute drop of 4 mmol/L from baseline. If the serum bicarbonate remains < 18 mmol/L despite replacement, IL-2 should be held or stopped and bolus bicarbonate infusions administered. Low sodium bicarbonate has been associated with refractoriness to vasopressors which further decreases tissue perfusion, thus worsening the acidosis. It is important to replace the bicarbonate preemptively in order to avoid this circumstance. Some centers use lactated ringers solution for maintenance fluids and note their patients do not experience low serum bicarbonate levels. Most others utilize saline for fluid support and give replacement boluses of bicarbonate as needed. Whatever strategy is chosen it is critical not to fall behind in patients at greater risk.

### Clinical effects and safety of different strategies for administering intravenous diuretics in acutely decompensated heart failure: a randomised clinical trial [^113zZnDw]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The mainstay of treatment for acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is intravenous diuretic therapy either as a bolus or via continuous infusion.

Objectives

We evaluated the clinical effects and safety of three strategies of intravenous furosemide administration used in emergency departments (EDs) for ADHF.

Methods

We performed a multicentre, randomised, parallel-group study. Patients with ADHF were randomised within 2h of ED arrival to receive furosemide by continuous infusion (10mg/h, group 1) or boluses (20mg/6h, group 2; or 20mg/8h, group 3). The primary end point was total diuresis, and secondary end points were dyspnoea, orthopnoea, extension of rales and peripheral oedema, blood pressure, respiratory and heart rates, and pulse oximetry, which were measured at arrival and 3, 6, 12 and 24h after treatment onset. We also measured serum creatinine, sodium and potassium levels at arrival and after 24h.

Results

Group 1 patients (n = 36) showed greater 24h diuresis (3705mL) than those in groups 2 (n = 37) and 3 (n = 36) (3093 and 2670mL, respectively; p < 0.01), and this greater diuretic effect was observed earlier. However, no differences were observed among groups in the nine secondary clinical end points evaluated. Creatinine deterioration developed in 15.6% of patients, hyponatraemia in 9.2%, and hypokalaemia in 19.3%, with the only difference among groups observed in hypokalaemia (group 1, 36.3%; group 2, 13.5%; group 3, 8.3%; p < 0.01).

Conclusions

In patients with ADHF attending the ED, boluses of furosemide have a smaller diuretic effect but provide similar clinical relief, similar preservation of renal function, and a lower incidence of hypokalaemia than continuous infusion.

Trial Registration Number

This randomised trial was registered in the European Clinical Trial Database (EudraCT) with the reference number 2008–004488–20.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Edema

Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response.

Adults — The usual initial dose of furosemide is 20 mg to 80 mg given as a single dose. Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 mg or 40 mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (e.g., at 8 am and 2 pm). The dose of furosemide may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states.

Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving furosemide on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week.

When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Test).

Geriatric patients — In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

### Effect of furosemide in the treatment of high-altitude pulmonary edema [^117WacDX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The average time of onset for HAPE in this study was approximately 4 days after arriving at high-altitude areas, which is consistent with the 2–5 days reported in the previous literature. The latest onset of symptoms in our study occurred on the tenth day after entering the high-altitude area, which is later than what has been reported in the literature. This difference may be related to variations in factors such as oxygen supply facilities, level of exertion, and individual susceptibility.

Further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods is needed to elucidate the impact of imaging improvements on clinical outcomes and to better understand the various factors influencing hospital stay duration in HAPE patients.

Limitation

As our study is retrospective, it is prone to bias. The mortality rate of patients with HAPE after formal treatment is lower, and a larger sample size is needed to determine the effect of furosemide on in-hospital mortality in patients with HAPE.

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^113Gdt7f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute Left Ventricular Failure

Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema is a self‐evident clinical condition with short‐term resolution in most patients and is another clinical condition that does not have its management primarily oriented by BP values. The management is based on the physiopathology of the syndrome and the clinical experience. BP is elevated in many patients, particularly those with hypertensive cardiomyopathy, because of the sympathetic discharge promoted by hypoxemia and the fear of imminent death. The rationale for treatment indicates drugs that reduce preload and afterload, such as nitrates.

Guidelines for managing heart failure superficially address on the management of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, a condition that was specifically focused by a complementary statement from the European Society of Cardiology. It recommends vasodilators, preferentially nitrates, and oxygen and loop diuretics as the first step for treatment. Pulmonary edema secondary to acute left ventricular failure is another clinical condition that does not have its management primarily oriented by BP values in most patients.

4 Discussion

In the treatment of ADHF, furosemide plays a vital role, yet its dosing and mode of administration vary significantly in clinical practice. Few prospective clinical trials have thoroughly explored the effectiveness and safety of diverse furosemide regimens. In our randomized clinical study, we observed no notable differences in renal function, as evaluated by serum creatinine levels, or fluid removal measured by body weight loss, among continuous intravenous furosemide infusion, bolus furosemide injection, and intravenous furosemide with HSS treatment regimens. However, the continuous intravenous furosemide infusion notably correlated with a reduced duration of hospital stay. Ours is among the initial trials comparing all three treatment regimens within a single study. Continuous intravenous infusion of furosemide offers advantages like consistent urine output, leading to a gradual reduction in intravascular volume, reduced neurohormonal activation, less vasoconstriction, and fewer side effects. However, its clinical superiority in terms of efficacy lacks conclusive proof in human studies. Aaser et al. compared cIV with bI in ADHF, finding no difference in urine output and neurohormonal responses.

Methods

Patients

From January 2000 to December 2010, 806 consecutive patients with APE admitted to our acute cardiac care unit were included. APE was defined as orthopnea of ≤ 6 hours with bilateral rales, hypoxemia (arterial oxygen saturation < 90%), and radiographic evidence of alveolar and/or interstitial pulmonary edema. Oxygen saturation was assessed on admission and blood pressure, by cuff, and heart rate were measured at first medical attention. Also, a chest X‐ray and a standard 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG) were performed on hospital arrival. Serial blood samples for myocardial necrosis markers (creatine kinase MB [CK‐MB] and troponin I) were drawn every 4 to 6 hours during at least the first 24 hours. In view of the frequent presence of renal insufficiency in these patients, however, myocardial necrosis was assessed by levels of CK‐MB. Initial treatment included oxygen by mask, intravenous morphine sulphate, intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin, and intravenous furosemide. Sodium nitroprusside was added whenever needed, whereas hypotension was initially treated with dobutamine and/or noradrenaline. Patients with persistent respiratory insufficiency underwent noninvasive ventilatory support, whereas oral intubation and mechanical ventilation were instituted in cases of refractory hypoventilation. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptors antagonists and beta‐blockers were added in the subacute phase of the disease. These drugs along with diuretics were the main line of therapy for heart failure at hospital discharge. In recent years, aldosterone antagonists were also recommended. Additional medications were added according to the underlying heart disease. Also, coronary revascularization procedures, surgical treatment of valvular heart disease, and follow‐up management were dictated by the attending physicians that were largely within the recommendations of appropriate international guidelines.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema.

Use of intravenous furosemide rather than oral administration in acute decompensated congestive cardiac failure is universally recommended in international guidelines. We argue that this recommendation is not supported by the existing evidence, and suggest that trials should be performed to determine whether larger doses of oral furosemide should be prescribed prior to an IV switch. This could reduce length of hospital admissions and allow for more patients to be managed in the primary care setting.

Level C recommendations: Aggressive diuretic monotherapy is unlikely to prevent the need for endotracheal intubation compared with aggressive nitrate monotherapy, and diuretics should be administered judiciously given the potential association between diuretics, worsening renal function, and the known association between worsening renal function at index hospitalization and long-term mortality.

### Effect of furosemide in the treatment of high-altitude pulmonary edema [^1146J22L]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, although the use of furosemide could help to improve the lung CT imaging findings in patients with HAPE, there are no significant benefits in terms of length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality. Clinicians still need to assess the use of such medications based on individual circumstances. And we suggest that in cases where standardized treatment centers can be accessed promptly, the decision to delay descent to a lower altitude may be considered.

Medication dosing — recommended dosages for prevention and treatment of altitude illness (acute mountain sickness [AMS], high altitude cerebral edema [HACE], high altitude pulmonary edema [HAPE]) include the following examples from Table 1: For AMS treatment with acetazolamide, the oral dose is 250 mg every 12 h; pediatric dosing is 2.5 mg·kg−1 every 12 h (maximum: 125 mg per dose). For dexamethasone in AMS/HACE treatment, routes are oral, IV, or IM; AMS: 4 mg every 6 h; HACE: 8 mg once, then 4 mg every 6 h; pediatric dosing is 0.15 mg·kg−1·dose−1 every 6 h (Maximum: 4 mg per dose). For AMS prevention with ibuprofen, the oral dose is 600 mg every 8 h.

### Modern management of cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^111RHt9D]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) is a life-threatening condition that is frequently encountered in standard emergency medicine practice. Traditionally, diagnosis was based on physical assessment and chest radiography and treatment focused on the use of morphine sulfate and diuretics. Numerous advances in diagnosis and treatment have been made, however. Serum testing for B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has improved the accuracy of diagnoses in these patients. Treatment should focus on fluid redistribution with aggressive preload and afterload reduction rather than simply on diuresis. Some specific medications and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation have been shown to be safe and rapidly effective in improving patients' symptoms and improve outcomes.

### Renal insufficiency following contrast media administration trial III: urine flow rate-guided versus left-ventricular end-diastolic pressure-guided hydration in high-risk patients for contrast-induced acute kidney injury. rationale and design [^114yewQP]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urine flow rate (UFR)-guided and left-ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP)-guided hydration regimens have been proposed to prevent contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI). The REnal Insufficiency Following Contrast MEDIA Administration triaL III (REMEDIAL III) is a randomized, multicenter, investigator-sponsored trial aiming to compare these two hydration strategies.

Methods

Patients at high risk for CIAKI (that is, those with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 45mL/min/1.73m 2 and/or with Mehran's score ≥ 11 and/or Gurm's score > 7) will be enrolled. Patients will be randomly assigned to (a) LVEDP-guided hydration with normal saline (LVEDP-guided group) and (b) UFR-guided hydration carried out by the RenalGuard system (RenalGuard group). Seven-hundred patients (350 in each arm) will be enrolled. In the LVEDP-guided group the fluid infusion rate will be adjusted according to the LVEDP as follows: 5 mL kg -1 hr -1 for LVEDP ≤ 12mmHg, 3 mL kg -1 hr -1 for LVEDP 13–18mmHg, and 1.5 mL kg -1 hr -1 for LVEDP > 18mmHg. In the RenalGuard group hydration with normal saline plus low-dose of furosemide is controlled by the RenalGuard system, in order to reach and maintain a high (> 300mL/hr) UFR. In all cases, iobitridol (a low-osmolar, nonionic contrast agent) will be administered.

Results

The primary endpoint is the composite of CIAKI (i.e., serum creatinine increase ≥ 25% and/or ≥ 0.5 mg/dL from the baseline to 48hr after contrast media exposure) and/or acute pulmonary edema.

Conclusion

The REMEDIAL III will test the hypothesis that the UFR-guided hydration is superior to the LVEDP-guided hydration to prevent the composite of CIAKI and/or acute pulmonary edema.

### Benefits and risks of furosemide in acute kidney injury [^1159zCND]. Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Furosemide, a potent loop diuretic, is frequently used in different stages of acute kidney injury, but its clinical roles remain uncertain. This review summarises the pharmacology of furosemide, its potential uses and side effects, and the evidence of its efficacy. Furosemide is actively secreted by the proximal tubules into the urine before reaching its site of action at the ascending limb of loop of Henle. It is the urinary concentrations of furosemide that determine its diuretic effect. The severity of acute kidney injury has a significant effect on the diuretic response to furosemide; a good 'urinary response' may be considered as a 'proxy' for having some residual renal function. The current evidence does not suggest that furosemide can reduce mortality in patients with acute kidney injury. In patients with acute lung injury without haemodynamic instability, furosemide may be useful in achieving fluid balance to facilitate mechanical ventilation according to the lung-protective ventilation strategy.

Edema

Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response.

Adults -

The usual initial dose of furosemide tablets is 20 to 80 mg given as a single dose. Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 or 40 mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (e.g., at 8 am and 2 pm). The dose of furosemide tablets may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states.

Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving furosemide tablets on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week.

When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests).

Geriatric Patients -

In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

Pediatric Patients -

The usual initial dose of oral furosemide in pediatric patients is 2 mg/kg body weight, given as a single dose. If the diuretic response is not satisfactory after the initial dose, dosage may be increased by 1 or 2 mg/kg no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose. Doses greater than 6 mg/kg body weight are not recommended. For maintenance therapy in pediatric patients, the dose should be adjusted to the minimum effective level.

### Management of hypertensive crisis: British and Irish hypertension society position document [^116o6ZBR]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary oedema

Heart failure associated with raised BP may present as hypertensive crisis. Typically, shortness of breath, cough, orthopnoea, with compatible signs on CXR points towards heart failure. Underlying conditions like ischaemic heart disease or bilateral renal artery stenosis may predispose to heart failure.

Treatment should be directed toward the underlying cause and the associated pathophysiology. Patient may not always present with florid symptoms of pulmonary oedema. Flash pulmonary oedema, which occurs with elevated left ventricular filling pressures may be the first presentation albeit rarely.

Patients with acute hypertensive heart failure have been under-represented in acute heart failure trials. The best available evidence for treatment of heart failure is for use of diuretics particularly loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide. Treatment aiming for a decrease in BP (fall in MAP by 20–25%) over a few hours has been mentioned in most guidelines. AHA guidelines recommend treatment of pulmonary oedema with clevidipine, nitro-glycerine, nitroprusside or enalaprilat. ESC guidelines, recommend treating BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg in patients with heart failure, to SBP < 140 mmHg.

GTN is the most commonly used therapy in hypertensive heart failure, administered by continuous infusion. However, the evidence comes from small, retrospective, and non-randomised clinical trials. The advantage is a quick reduction in preload and afterload. The use of higher doses of nitrates in patients with pulmonary oedema associated with myocardial infarction is supported by a few older studies. Small doses of opioids for vasodilatory and anxiolytic effect must be considered. Use of parenteral ACEi such as enalaprilat is supported by two studies particularly, one relatively large (n = 103) retrospective study of IV enalaprilat prescribed in the setting of acute heart failure and another small (n = 20) double blinded RCT comparing IV enalaprilat versus placebo in patients with congestive heart failure. However, IV enalaprilat is not routinely available. Nitroprusside may be an acceptable treatment strategy, while being cautious in patients with concomitant renal and liver failure. Clevidipine has been used safely in small studies. β blockers are contraindicated in acute pulmonary oedema (Table 11).

Both pulmonary oedema and ACS can be accompanied by an acute rise in BP with multiple confounding factors including pain and anxiety. Clinical discretion is required to differentiate if HTN is the causative factor, or a mere bystander similar to AIS and SAH.

### Critical analysis of the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal tubular sodium, water and chloride homeostasis and their role in influencing heart failure outcomes [^1179Wq3t]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

EFFECT OF SGLT2 INHIBITORS ON EDEMA AND CONGESTION

The primary end point for the regulatory approval of diuretics is the alleviation of edema in sodium-avid states. Thiazide and loop diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and vasopressin antagonists ameliorate fluid retention in heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. – In contrast, there are no reports of a favorable effect of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce the edema of heart failure or the ascites of hepatic cirrhosis. Observations about decongestion are difficult to interpret when patients are being concurrently treated with an intensified regimen of loop diuretics.

It is interesting that in patients hospitalized for heart failure, there may be little relationship between the magnitude of natriuresis and the relief of symptoms. Intensive intravenous loop diuretics produce a greater diuresis but not greater effects on pulmonary congestion. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to a loop diuretic yields a modest diuretic effect, but no incremental benefit on dyspnea. Acetazolamide potentiates the natriuretic response to loop diuretics but without a reported benefit on symptoms. Conventional diuretics may preferentially act to remove excess fluid from the interstitial space, with little change in total blood volume, cardiac filling pressures, or symptoms.

Effect of SGLT2 Inhibitors on Congestion in Acutely Decompensated Heart Failure

Three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have evaluated the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure, treated for ≤ 90 days: EMPAG-HF (Empagliflozin in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure), EMPA-RESPONSE-AHF (Empagliflozin Response Acute Heart Failure), and EMPULSE (Empagliflozin in Patients Hospitalized for Acute Heart Failure). The largest trial (EMPULSE [Empagliflozin in Patients Hospitalized for Acute Heart Failure]) enrolled 530 patients (NT-proBNP ≈3200 pg/mL) who (after in-hospital stabilization) were randomized to placebo or empagliflozin (10 mg/d) for 3 months. Empagliflozin reduced a composite symptom score, with benefits seen as early as 15 days, but with modest changes in NT-proBNP. Although patients were required to have pulmonary congestion or peripheral edema at randomization, the effects of empagliflozin on signs of fluid retention were not reported. Treatment with empagliflozin did not spare the use of loop diuretics; the number of patients receiving furosemide (> 40 mg/d) was numerically more frequent in the empagliflozin group. Changes in body weight and hematocrit could not be ascribed to a diuresis, because they can be influenced by the rapid effects of empagliflozin to induce urinary caloric loss and erythropoiesis.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^116ASnPP]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Respiratory distress (includes Bronchospasm, Pulmonary Edema) — prehospital pulmonary edema management states that nitroglycerin reduces left ventricular filling pressure primarily via venous dilation and at higher doses variably lowers systemic afterload and increases stroke volume and cardiac output; diuretics such as furosemide provide no immediate benefit for most patients and can cause significant harm with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with other disease processes; nitrates provide both subjective and objective improvement and might decrease intubation rates, incidence of MIs, and mortality, with high-dose nitrates reducing both preload and afterload and potentially increasing cardiac output and blood pressure; if available and trained, ultrasound is useful to distinguish pulmonary edema from other causes of respiratory distress (including pneumothorax); pulmonary edema due to irritant gas inhalation generally is best managed by supportive care and escalation of airway interventions once the patient is appropriately decontaminated, and early poison center consultation should be strongly considered for guidance; pulmonary edema due to high altitude should be managed as described in Altitude Illness Guideline.

### Continuous versus bolus intermittent loop diuretic infusion in acutely decompensated heart failure: a prospective randomized trial [^1178zu3L]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Supplementary treatment was left to the discretion of the treating physician. All patients took angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and nitrates. No thiazide diuretics, nesiritide, or arginine vasopressin antagonists were administered during the hospitalization period. Hypertonic saline solution was administered to the patients who developed hyponatremia (serum Na values < 128 mEq/L) during treatment with the goal of restoring plasma sodium values up to 134 mEq/L. For this reason Na concentration was monitored each day during the infusion period. The hypertonic saline solution consisted of 20 mEq of NaCl in 500 mL saline solutions (0.9% of NaCl). Infusion was administered at 80 cc/h once or twice a day, depending on the Na value. Dopamine infusions were administered to patients with systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg with the goal of restoring systolic values up to 100 mmHg maintaining diuretic infusion. Inotrope therapy was stopped when blood pressure values were sustained at approximately 105 mmHg during 12 sequential hours for four consecutive measurements.

The frequency of laboratory tests to evaluate electrolyte balance and renal function during hospitalization was at the discretion of the attending physician but was guided by a dose-escalation algorithm. This trial was approved by our hospital's Institutional Review Board of Siena and all patients gave their signed informed consent. This trial was registered and regularly updated in ClinicalTrials.gov with Identifier number: NCT01441245.

Inclusion criteria

Patients over age 18 years of age were screened if they met diagnostic criteria for ADHF due to systolic dysfunction and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 45% by exhibiting at least one of the following symptoms at rest: dyspnea, orthopnea, peripheral edema or major fatigue and at least two clinical signs including rales, pulmonary congestion on chest radiography, jugular vein dilatation, or a third heart sound. Elevations in blood BNP > 400 pg/mL were considered supportive for a diagnosis of ADHF.

Exclusion criteria

Patients were excluded if they had received more than two IV doses of furosemide or any continuous infusion of furosemide one month before randomization, if they had end-stage renal disease or the need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or ultrafiltration), isolated diastolic dysfunction with LVEF > 45% or recent myocardial infarction within thirty days of screening. Patients with a systolic blood pressure < 80 mm Hg or with serum creatinine levels > 4.0 mg/dL were also excluded, as well as patients who received recent intravenous iodinated contrast.

### Acute effects of low and high intravenous doses of furosemide on myocardial function in anuric haemodialysis patients: a tissue Doppler study [^111JXV8f]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with pulmonary oedema and preserved renal function, furosemide has not only a renal, but also a vascular effect, causing a rapid fall in left ventricular filling pressure accompanied by an increase in venous compliance. Previous studies have shown conflicting findings regarding the vascular effects of furosemide in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The objective of our study was to investigate whether furosemide induces changes in central cardiac haemodynamics in anuric ESRD patients, using conventional echocardiography and colour tissue Doppler velocity imaging (TVI), a new quantitative and sensitive method.

Methods

Repeated low doses (40 mg followed by an additional dose of 40 mg after 30 min) of i.v. furosemide were administered to 12 (61.6 ± 16 years, 7 men) and a high dose (250 mg) of i.v. furosemide to 6 (64.1 ± 3.6 years, 5 men) clinically stable anuric haemodialysis (HD) patients. Conventional two-dimensional echocardiography and colour TVI images were recorded immediately before (0 min) the furosemide infusion in both groups, and in the group receiving the repeated low-dose infusion (at 0 and 30 min), 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 70 min after the administration of the first infusion. In the group receiving the single high dose of furosemide the ultrasound investigation was repeated 10, 20, 30 and 40 min after the infusion. The myocardial tissue velocities (v; cm/s) for isovolumetric contraction (IVC), peak systole (PS), early (E') and late (A') myocardial diastolic filling velocities were measured in the left ventricle (LV) at six sites (infero-septal, antero-lateral, inferior, anterior, infero-lateral and antero-septal walls) at the basal region. IVC time (IVCT), IV relaxation time (IVRT), PS time (PSt), RR interval, mitral annulus motion (MAM), strain rate (SR), left ventricular filling pressure (E/E') and cardiac output were also measured. The average of the different walls was used to evaluate global function. Right ventricle (RV) dynamics was evaluated from measurements of IVC velocity (IVCv), peak systolic velocity (PSv), E' and A' from the RV free wall.

Results

No significant changes in cardiac output, IVCv, PSv, SR, MAM, E', A', E'/A', IVRT and LV filling pressure were observed, indicating that neither 40 mg (plus additional 40 mg after 30 min) nor 250 mg of furosemide had any measurable effects on LV filling pressure and LV and RV systolic and diastolic function.

Conclusions

In anuric HD patients, low and high doses of furosemide had no significant effects on central cardiac haemodynamics. Therefore, the use of furosemide infusion in anuric ESRD patients with acute pulmonary oedema is not supported by the results of this study.

Fluid management

PICO question

In adults with ARDS, does the use of a conservative fluid strategy, compared with a liberal fluid strategy or standard care, affect survival or selected outcomes?

Study identification

The search strategy was predefined as per the online appendix C. Of four SR identified, one recent high quality SR with MA addressing the question of optimal fluid strategy in ARDS was included. This review included patients with ARDS, sepsis and SIRS, although subgroup data were available for ARDS. The review included data from five RCTs in ARDSperformed between 2002 and 2014, and ranging from 29 to 1000 participants. Significant clinical heterogeneity was evident between these studies in terms of intervention strategies, fluid balance achieved and outcome reporting. Conservative fluid strategies included protocolised diuretic use, withor withouthyperoncotic albumin solutions, minimisation of fluid intakeand the use of extravascular lung water (EVLW) measurements to guide fluid therapy. Liberal fluid strategies varied from a protocolised fluid administration strategy, which approximated the usual care arm of previous large trials in ARDS, use of furosemide without hyperoncotic albuminand use of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) to guide fluid administration. One study did not define conservative and liberal fluid strategies in detail.

A GRADE summary of findings table is shown for critical and important outcomes (table 4). A full GRADE evidence table can be found as part of the online appendix B.

Table 4
Conservative compared to liberal fluid management for ARDS

Analysis of outcomes

Mortality

Heterogeneity in outcome reporting was evident, with two studies reporting mortality at 30 daysand three at 60 days; the pooled results showed no effect of fluid balance strategy on mortality.

Moderate quality evidence supported an RR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.08) for mortality using a conservative rather than a liberal fluid strategy. Although two of the RCTs included were at high or uncertain risk of bias, these studies included only 129 of 1206 patients, and thus overall no serious risk of bias was deemed to be present. Serious indirectness was present, in that various treatment regimens were compared, including a comparison of hyperoncotic albumin versus placebo as an adjunct to diuretic therapy, and of EVLW-guided with PCWP-guided fluid therapy. Exclusion of these studies made little difference to the point estimate. As confidence intervals around the point estimate were wide, neither clinically important benefit nor harm could be excluded.

### Diuretics for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants [^112e1VPx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Lung edema may complicate respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess the risks and benefits of diuretic administration in preterm infants with RDS.

Search Strategy

The standard search method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library) were searched using the following keywords: < exp respiratory distress syndrome > and < exp diuretics >. These searches were updated in April 2003 and March 2007. In addition, the abstract books of the American Thoracic Society and Society for Pediatric Research were searched. A MEDLINE and CENTRAL search was conducted in March 2007 using the keyword "Respiratory Distress Syndrome" alone, to make sure to find studies medications recently classified as diuretics, such as theophylline.

Selection Criteria

Trials were included in which preterm infants with RDS and less than 5 days of age were randomly allocated to diuretic administration. Of those trials, studies were only included in which at least one of the following outcomes measures was evaluated: mortality, patent ductus arteriosus, hypovolemic shock, intraventricular hemorrhage, renal failure, duration of oxygen supplementation, duration of mechanical ventilation, need for oxygen supplementation at 28 days of life, oxygen supplementation at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (gestational age + postnatal age), length of stay, number of rehospitalizations during the first year of life, and neurodevelopmental outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

The standard method for the Cochrane Collaboration, which is described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook, was used. Two investigators extracted, assessed and coded separately all data for each study. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion.

Main Results

Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Six studies using furosemide were done before the current era of prenatal steroids, surfactant and fluid restriction. Furosemide administration had no long-term benefits. Furosemide-induced transient improvement in pulmonary function did not outweigh an increased risk for patent ductus arteriosus and for hemodynamic instability. In one recent study, theophylline had no long-term benefits. Theophylline significantly decreased the risk of oligoanuria and transiently increased renal function, but did not significantly affect renal function at discharge or other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no data to support routine administration of furosemide in preterm infants with RDS. Elective administration of furosemide to any patient with RDS should be carefully weighed against the risk of precipitating hypovolemia or developing a symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus. There are not enough data to support routine administration of low-dose theophylline in preterm infants with RDS.

### Expert consensus guidelines on management and best practices for tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cell therapy [^113xFn3K]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

The first IL-2 administration in the TIL cell therapy regimen should begin approximately 3–24 hours after the completion of TIL infusion at a dose of 600 000 IU/kg intravenous every 8–12 hours typically up to a maximum of 6 doses. To facilitate optimal staffing, some centers initiate IL-2 dosing the morning after TIL infusion, rather than overnight. It may be helpful to schedule IL-2 infusions around standard vital times; however, administration should not be scheduled immediately preceding nursing shift changes.

It is important to note that no clear correlation has been observed between the total number of IL-2 doses administered and efficacy of TIL cell therapy when the IL-2 was discontinued for toxicity. IL-2 can be held or discontinued at the discretion of the treating clinician at any time. Based on our collective clinical experience, we would be extremely cautious with rechallenging a patient with high dose IL-2 who has required a previous dose hold. If one dose is held, dosing can resume at the next scheduled dose if the patient has sufficiently recovered but should be done so with significant caution. If two consecutive doses are held, IL-2 should be permanently discontinued. As such, we strongly encourage holding or discontinuing IL-2 in the setting of toxicity that does not rapidly resolve with supportive medications. After IL-2 completion or discontinuation, IL-2-related medications including NSAIDs and meperidine should be stopped 12 hours later. Many patients will require supplemental oxygen during IL-2 administration due to capillary leak syndrome and fluid shifts resulting in pulmonary edema. The use of diuretics during the IL-2 period is a subject of debate. Some clinicians use intravenous diuresis with furosemide as needed in between IL-2 doses, with frequent electrolyte monitoring and replacement. If diuresis causes acute renal failure, IL-2 should be stopped.

### Continuous infusion vs. intermittent bolus injection of furosemide in acute decompensated heart failure: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111YLoCW]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Loop diuretics remain a fundamental pharmacological therapy to remove excess fluid and improve symptom control in acute decompensated heart failure. Several recent randomised controlled trials have examined the clinical benefit of continuous vs. bolus furosemide in acute decompensated heart failure, but have reported conflicting findings. The aim of this review was to compare the effects of continuous and bolus furosemide with regard to mortality, length of hospital stay and its efficacy profile in acute decompensated heart failure. All parallel-arm randomised controlled trials from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception until May 2017 were included. Cross-over randomised controlled trials, observational studies, case reports, case series and non-systematic reviews that involved children were excluded. Eight trials (n = 669) were eligible for inclusion. There was no difference between furosemide continuous infusion and bolus administration for all-cause mortality (four studies; n = 491; I² = 0%; OR 1.65; 95%CI 0.93–2.91; p = 0.08) or duration of hospitalisation (six studies; n = 576; I² = 71%; mean difference 0.27; 95%CI -1.35 to 1.89 days; p = 0.74). Continuous infusion of intravenous furosemide was associated with increased weight reduction (five studies; n = 516; I² = 0%; mean difference 0.70; 95%CI 0.12–1.28 kg; p = 0.02); increased total urine output in 24 h (four studies; n = 390; I² = 33%; mean difference 461.5; 95%CI 133.7–789.4 ml; p < 0.01); and reduced brain natriuretic peptide (two studies; n = 390; I² = 0%; mean difference 399.5; 95%CI 152.7–646.3 ng.l -1; p < 0.01), compared with the bolus group. There was no difference in the incidence of raised creatinine and hypokalaemia between the two groups. In summary, there was no difference between continuous infusion and bolus of furosemide for all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay and electrolyte disturbance, but continuous infusion was superior to bolus administration with regard to diuretic effect and reduction in brain natriuretic peptide.

### Continuous positive airway pressure for cardiogenic pulmonary edema: a randomized study [^1152pv96]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to determine the immediate and delayed effects of noninvasive ventilation for patients in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE) in addition to aggressive usual care in a medical prehospital setting.

Methods

Out-of-hospital patients in severe ACPE were eligible for the study. Patients were randomized to receive either usual care, including conventional optimal treatment with furosemide, oxygen, and high-dose boluses of isosorbide dinitrate plus oxygen, or conventional medications plus out-of-hospital continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The primary outcome was the treatment success defined as all of respiratory rate less than 25 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of greater than 90% at the end of 1-hour study. Secondary end points included death during 30 days after inclusion. Lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays were also recorded.

Results

In total, 124 patients were enrolled into the study. The 2 groups had similar baseline characteristics. For the primary outcome analysis, 22 (35.5%) of 62 patients were considered as experiencing a treatment success in the usual care group vs 19 (31.7%) of 60 in the CPAP group (P = .65). Seven patients died within 30 days in the usual care group vs 6 in the CPAP group (P = .52). There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups for length of stay either in hospital or in the intensive care unit.

Conclusion

In the prehospital setting, in spite of its potential advantages for patients in ACPE, CPAP may not be preferred to a strict optimal intravenous treatment.

### Continuous versus bolus dosing of furosemide for patients hospitalized for heart failure [^116GBg5R]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Intravenous diuretics are the cornerstone of management for patients hospitalized for heart failure. Physiologic data suggest that intermittent high-dose furosemide promotes neurohormonal activation, which a slow continuous infusion might remediate. However, the limited clinical data comparing dosing schemes are confounded. This study was a randomized, open-label, single-center trial of twice-daily bolus injection versus continuous infusion furosemide in patients hospitalized with heart failure and volume overload. The primary outcome was change in creatinine from admission to hospital day 3 or discharge. Twenty-one patients were randomized to bolus injection and 20 patients to continuous infusion. Baseline characteristics were balanced between study arms except for gender, with a mean age of 60 ± 15 years, a mean ejection fraction of 35 ± 19%, and a mean creatinine level of 1.9 ± 1.2 mg/dl. The mean doses of furosemide were similar between arms over the first 48 hours (162 ± 48 and 162 ± 52 mg/24 hours). None of the outcomes differed significantly between bolus and continuous dosing from admission to hospital day 3 or discharge (mean change in creatinine -0.02 vs 0.13 mg/dl, p = 0.18; urine output 5,113 vs 4,894 ml, p = 0.78; length of stay 8.8 vs 9.9 days, p = 0.69). All patients survived to discharge. In conclusion, there were no substantial differences between bolus injection and continuous infusion of equal doses of furosemide for the treatment of patients hospitalized with heart failure. Given the high prevalence of heart failure hospitalization and the disparate results of small studies regarding optimal dosing of loop diuretics to treat these patients, larger multicenter blinded studies are needed.

### Furosemide (Lasix) [^116cuqM1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Edema

Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response.

Adults — The usual initial dose of LASIX is 20 mg to 80mg given as a single dose. Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 mg or 40mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (e.g., at 8 am and 2 pm). The dose of LASIX may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states.

Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving LASIX on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week.

When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable (s ee PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Test).

Geriatric patients — In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

Pediatric patients — The usual initial dose of oral LASIX in pediatric patients is 2 mg/kg body weight, given as a single dose. If the diuretic response is not satisfactory after the initial dose, dosage may be increased by 1 or 2 mg/kg no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose. Doses greater than 6 mg/kg body weight are not recommended. For maintenance therapy in pediatric patients, the dose should be adjusted to the minimum effective level.

### Continuous versus bolus intermittent loop diuretic infusion in acutely decompensated heart failure: a prospective randomized trial [^112eBrxw]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Algorithm of diuretic treatment during randomization and study period: in both arms escalation doses were decided upon based on diuretic response, doubling previous dose administration in a step by step protocol. ADHF, acute decompensated heart failure; BW, body weight.

Before randomization, renal function parameters and BNP levels were measured in all patients. Therefore, all patients were submitted to echocardiograpy and chest radiography to assess pulmonary congestion. Chest radiography was also repeated promptly before treatment disruption to verify pulmonary congestion improvement. Subsequent titration of the furosemide dosage was guided by a dose-escalation algorithm based on the patient's response to the treatment (body weight (BW) loss < 1 kg from the starting enrollment to the third day or urine output < 1,000 mL/day), signs of recovery (decreased pulmonary rales, venous jugular congestion, additive heart sounds, improvement in pulmonary congestion on chest radiography), and/or by important changes in renal function, such as a sudden increase of creatinine > 0.8 mg/dl compared to the baseline value or hypokalemia below 3.2 mEq/L. The specific doses of furosemide and the use of additional agents to manage ADHF (dopamine, intravenous (IV) vasodilators, hypertonic saline infusions for hyponatremia) were decided upon based on the above cited laboratory and clinical parameters, with daily dosages adjusted during the infusion periods. Specifically in the case of poor initial diuretic response, the furosemide dosage was doubled. In case of diuretic resistance, defined as diuresis below 1,000 mL/day, the dosage was escalated up to 250 mg/day.

### Diuretics for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants [^114R8pS4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Lung edema may complicate respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess the risks and benefits of diuretic administration in preterm infants with RDS.

Search Methods

The standard search method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. These searches were updated in April 2003, March 2007, January 2011. In addition, the abstract books of the American Thoracic Society and Society for Pediatric Research were searched. MEDLINE and CENTRAL search was conducted using the keyword "Respiratory Distress Syndrome" alone, to find studies of medications recently classified as diuretics, such as theophylline. In addition, EMBASE, controlled-trials.com and clinicaltrials.gov searches were completed in January 2011. MEDLINE search updated to August 2011.

Selection Criteria

Trials were included in which preterm infants with RDS and less than five days of age were randomly allocated to diuretic administration. Of those trials, studies were only included in which at least one of the following outcomes measures was evaluated: mortality, patent ductus arteriosus, hypovolemic shock, intraventricular hemorrhage, renal failure, duration of oxygen supplementation, duration of mechanical ventilation, need for oxygen supplementation at 28 days of life, oxygen supplementation at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (gestational age + postnatal age), length of stay, number of rehospitalizations during the first year of life, and neurodevelopmental outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

The standard method for the Cochrane Collaboration, which is described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook, was used. Two investigators extracted, assessed and coded separately all data for each study. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion.

Main Results

Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Six studies using furosemide were done before the current era of prenatal steroids, surfactant and fluid restriction. Furosemide administration had no long-term benefits. Furosemide-induced transient improvement in pulmonary function did not outweigh an increased risk for patent ductus arteriosus and for hemodynamic instability. In one recent study, theophylline had no long-term benefits. Theophylline significantly decreased the risk of oligoanuria and transiently increased renal function, but did not significantly affect renal function at discharge or other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no data to support routine administration of furosemide in preterm infants with RDS. Elective administration of furosemide to any patient with RDS should be carefully weighed against the risk of precipitating hypovolemia or developing a symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus. There are not enough data to support routine administration of low-dose theophylline in preterm infants with RDS.

### Risk of vasopressin use: a case of acute pulmonary oedema, post intramyometrial infiltration of vasopressin in laparoscopic myomectomy [^113bSLWh]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Treatment

Initial treatment included positioning the patient in an upright position, application of high flow oxygen via a tight-fitting anaesthetic mask, held on the anaesthetist with a water circuit applying positive end expiratory pressure. With a suspected diagnosis of pulmonary oedema, intravenous furosemide (20 mg) was administered along with diamorphine to alleviate distress (at 1 mg increments — total dose of 4 mg). The patient already had a catheter in situ.

In recovery, Optiflow, a respiratory support system with supplementary oxygen (60%) was commenced, oxygen saturations improved from 89% to 94%. A radial arterial line (20 G abbocath) was sited for monitoring and to optimise oxygen replacement. Chest X-ray was performed, which confirmed acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute pulmonary oedema. She had excellent diuresis, passing 500 mL of urine within the first hour. Twelve lead ECG demonstrated sinus tachycardia and nil acute ischaemia. The intensive care unit registrar reviewed and recommended a further 20 mg of intravenous furosemide to optimise diuresis. The oxygen flow rate was gradually reduced to 1 L/min over a period of 10 hours. She was stepped down to ward-based care, maintaining her saturations above 94% via nasal prongs. She had excellent diuresis, with a urine output more than 200 mL/hour. She was gradually weaned off oxygen and was able to maintain her oxygen saturations in room air.

### 2022 ESC / ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^111Sd7xR]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) — diuretics and fluid management states that once patients develop signs of right-sided heart failure (HF) and oedema, restricting fluid intake and using diuretics is recommended, with loop diuretics, thiazides, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists used as monotherapy or in combination according to clinical need and kidney function. Patients on diuretics should regularly monitor body weight and seek medical advice in case of weight gain; kidney function and serum electrolytes should be regularly monitored, and intravascular volume depletion must be avoided due to risks of reduced cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. Clinicians should also recognize that fluid retention and oedema may be a side effect of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapy.

### Lower urine sodium predicts longer length of stay in acute heart failure patients: insights from the ROSE AHF trial [^111UpGBY]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

The study design and results of the ROSE AHF trial have been published previously. 8 The study was a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized trial conducted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute sponsored Heart Failure Research Network. The study was approved by the institutional review board of each participating center. All participants provided written informed consent.

A total of 360 patients hospitalized with AHF and renal dysfunction at admission, defined as an eGFR of 15 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation, were enrolled. AHF was diagnosed by at least one symptom (edema, dyspnea, or orthopnea) and at least one sign (edema, rales, ascites, or pulmonary vascular congestion on chest X‐rays). Patients with reduced and preserved ejection fraction were included. Patients were first randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the dopamine or nesiritide strategy, and within each strategy were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to active therapy or placebo for a duration of 72 hours. The dopamine dosage was 2 μg/kg/minute by continuous infusion. The nesiritide dosage was 0.005 μg/kg/minute by continuous infusion. All patients were treated with intravenous loop diuretic at a recommended total daily dose of 2.5 times the total daily outpatient dose based on the results of the DOSE trial, 10 with a minimum of 80 mg furosemide in the first 24 hours. The total daily dose was administered as two divided bolus doses. Adjustment of the loop diuretic dose and administration of other medications were at the discretion of the treating physicians. Patients with absence of 24‐hour urine sodium data (n = 34) or who received less than the protocol‐specified minimum diuretic dose of 80 mg intravenous furosemide or equivalent in the first 24‐hour period (n = 36) were excluded from this analysis, the latter because urine composition in these patients may not have reflected the effects of diuretic.

### Loop diuretics in acute heart failure: beyond the decongestive relief for the kidney [^111pDXNy]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Loop diuretics and outcome

The administration of intravenous loop diuretics to patients with heart failure (HF) and congestion results typically in a prompt diuretic effect. In most patients, the increased diuresis is accompanied by a decrease in LV ventricular filling pressures and improvement of symptoms by reducing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and intra-alveolar edema. When used in combination with vasodilators, loop diuretics reduce ventricular remodeling and mitral regurgitation, resulting in increased cardiac output. In spite of these hemodynamic effects, no long-lasting benefits were demonstrated with this approach. In population studies, after adjustments for possible confounders, the highest diuretic quartile of loop diuretic dosing remained a significant predictor of mortality. An increased risk for in-hospital mortality and renal failure has been consistently associated with higher doses of intravenous loop diuretics compared with lower doses. The Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Registry (ADHERE) analysis confirmed that patients receiving the lower doses had a lower risk of in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit stay, prolonged hospitalization, or adverse renal effects. A meta-analysis by Abdel-Qadir et al. including more than 4000 patients has demonstrated a clear relation among discharge diuretic dosage and recurrent events over a mean 3-year follow-up period and shown doubled mortality in the highest quartile compared with the lowest. In accordance with this study, the ESCAPE Trial showed that patients submitted to higher daily dosage (300 mg/day) had an unfavorable laboratory pattern in terms of elevated natriuretic peptide levels, increased creatinine and hyponatremia, and worsened clinical outcomes. In the same analysis, the authors observed an inverse linear relation between diuretic dosage and adverse outcome and suggested the lowest dosage feasible to resolve congestive symptoms. As mentioned above, these associations could all represent confounding by indication, meaning that the more severely ill require higher doses of diuretics, particularly when urine output does not respond, and hence could be at higher risk for adverse outcomes independent of the utilization of loop diuretics. As mentioned above, the DOSE trial, a prospective randomized double-blind controlled trial with a two-by-two factorial design that compared bolus versus continuous infusion and low-dose versus high-dose strategies in a large population, did not demonstrate any benefit (death or hospitalization) of one strategy with respect to the others: analysis regarding bolus versus continuous administration revealed a trend toward a higher rate of creatinine increase in the continuous arm, although this has not influenced outcome. Finally, a recent Cochrane analysis showed that bolus infusion was related to both increased urine output and fewer adverse effects compared with continuous infusions; unfortunately, no data were reported on long-term mortality and post-discharge events. Thus, it remains unclear whether high doses or continuous infusions of loop diuretics cause harm; but given all of the data to date, they are very unlikely to help patients. Taken together, these findings suggest that higher dosage administration of loop diuretics probably contributes to adverse events as well as serving as a proxy for more severe disease which itself confers a poor prognosis. This theory seems to be confirmed by a subanalysis of the DOSE trial showing that patients with higher furosemide dose experienced worse renal function, more advanced symptoms, and New York Heart Association class. Besides, the same authors demonstrated a close relation between higher diuretic dose and risk of rehospitalization. Further studies are warranted to determine whether high-dose diuretics are responsible for worsening renal function and whether coexisting renal dysfunction could be a marker of more severe HF.

### Aerosolized diuretics for preterm infants with (or developing) chronic lung disease [^112Wv1VE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Lung disease in preterm infants is often complicated with lung edema.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to assess the risks and benefits of aerosolized diuretic administration in preterm infants with or developing chronic lung disease (CLD). Primary objectives are to assess effects on short term outcome (changes in need for oxygen or ventilatory support) and effects on long-term outcome. Secondary objectives are to assess changes in pulmonary mechanics and potential complications of therapy.

Search Strategy

We used the standard search method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the following keywords: { < bronchopulmonary dysplasia > or < chronic lung disease > } and < explode diuretics >, limited to < human > and limited to < infant, newborn > or < infant >. We searched MEDLINE (1966–1998), EMBASE (1974–1998) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006). In addition, we hand searched several abstract books of national and international American and European Societies. The search of MEDLINE and of CENTRAL was last updated in March 2006.

Selection Criteria

For the purpose of this analysis, we included trials in which preterm infants with or developing chronic lung disease and at least five days of age were all randomly allocated to receive an aerosolized loop diuretic. Eligible studies needed to assess at least one of the outcome variables defined a priori for this systematic review. Primary outcome variables included need for ventilator support, chronic lung disease, mortality and other important clinical outcomes. Secondary outcome variables included pulmonary mechanics and potential complications of therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard method for the Cochrane Collaboration which is described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. Two investigators extracted, assessed and coded separately all data for each study, using a form that was designed specifically for this review. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. We combined parallel and cross-over trials and, whenever possible, transformed baseline and final outcome data measured on a continuous scale into change scores using Follmann's formula.

Main Results

We identified eight studies that met selection criteria. Most studies focused on pathophysiological parameters and did not assess effects on important clinical outcomes defined in this review or the potential complications of diuretic therapy. No study assessed the amount of diuretic effectively delivered to the patient. Furosemide was the only diuretic used in the eight studies included in this review. Among preterm infants < 3 weeks of age developing CLD, not enough information is available to assess the effect of aerosolized furosemide on outcome or lung function. Among infants > 3 weeks with CLD, a single aerosolized dose of 1 mg/kg of furosemide may transiently improve pulmonary mechanics. Not enough information is available to assess the effect of chronic administration of aerosolized furosemide on oxygenation and pulmonary mechanics.

Authors' Conclusions

In preterm infants > 3 weeks with CLD administration of a single dose of aerosolized furosemide improves pulmonary mechanics. In view of the lack of data from randomized trials concerning effects on important clinical outcomes, routine or sustained use of aerosolized loop diuretics in infants with (or developing) CLD cannot be recommended based on current evidence. More double-blinded randomized trials are needed (1) to analyze factors likely to affect the response to aerosolized furosemide, e.g., washout period and delivery of furosemide to distal airways, and (2) to assess the effects of chronic administration of aerosolized furosemide on mortality, O2 dependency, ventilator dependency, length of hospital stay and long-term outcome.

### Self-care of heart failure patients: practical management recommendations from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^114poBeZ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice and patients' perspectives

Reactions to symptoms need to be adapted to the individual patient. Due to changes in the patients' condition (either HF related to other reasons) the medication regimen might need to be changed (see part on side effects and medication), physical activity level and exercise training decreased, or a (temporary) change in their sodium or fluid intake needed.

Furthermore, diuretic therapy is used to treat signs and/or symptoms of congestion.

The goal of diuretic therapy is to achieve and maintain euvolaemia with the lowest achievable dose. However, clinical assessment of euvolaemia may be difficult and many patients remain congested despite increase in HF therapy. 119 The dose of the diuretic must be adjusted according to individual needs over time. A patient‐directed flexible diuretic dosing schedule based on personalized variation in fluid‐related signs and symptoms is safe in patients with chronic HF. Some patients and families might not feel comfortable making decisions to change medications or lifestyle and need support from the health care providers.

Professional attitudes and behaviour
Provide individualized information to support self‐care management to patients and caregivers. Patients may adjust diuretic therapy and/or alert their health care team in case of increasing signs and symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea, oedema, hypotension), or a sudden unexpected weight gain of > 2 kg in 3 days as a rule of thumb; however, this may need to be tailored to the individual patient.
In selected euvolaemic/hypovolaemic patients, the use of a diuretic drug might be (temporarily) discontinued.
In patients with severe generalized congestion, especially in those with gut oedema, the effect of oral furosemide may be altered due to inadequate gastro‐intestinal absorption. A change in diuretics or a switch to intravenous furosemide is recommended in order to increase diuresis, reduce generalized congestion and gut oedema and re‐establish gastro‐intestinal absorption for oral diuretics.
Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors and diuretic therapy continued during acute hypovolaemic illness significantly increase the risk of acute kidney injury and/or hyperkalaemia. One or more of these agents may need to be temporarily stopped or its dose reduced during illness. Particularly the diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists migth need to be reduced/temporarily stopped (early).

### High-dose furosemide for established ARF: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^114JSi5e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of furosemide on the survival and renal recovery of patients presenting with acute renal failure (ARF) is still debated.

Methods

Three hundred thirty-eight patients with ARF requiring dialysis therapy were randomly assigned to the administration of either furosemide (25 mg/kg/d intravenously or 35 mg/kg/d orally) or matched placebo, with stratification according to severity at presentation. The primary end point was survival. The secondary end point was number of dialysis sessions. Tertiary end points included time on dialysis therapy, time to achieve a serum creatinine level less than 2.26 mg/dL (< 200 micromol/L), and time to reach a 2-L/d diuresis.

Results

There were no differences in survival and renal recovery rates between the 2 groups. Time to achieve a 2-L/d diuresis was shorter with furosemide (5.7 ± 5.8 days) than placebo (7.8 ± 6.8 days; P = 0.004). Overall, 148 patients achieved a urine output of at least 2 L/d during the study period (94 of 166 patients; 57%) with furosemide versus 54 of 164 patients (33%) with placebo (P < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in number of dialysis sessions and time on dialysis therapy between the furosemide and placebo groups, even in the subgroup of patients reaching a 2-L/d diuresis.

Conclusion

High-dose furosemide helps maintain urinary output, but does not have an impact on the survival and renal recovery rate of patients with established ARF.

### RITZ-5: randomized intravenous teZosentan (an endothelin – A / B antagonist) for the treatment of pulmonary edema: a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113dXcsf]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to evaluate the addition of intravenous (IV) tezosentan to standard therapy for patients with pulmonary edema.

Background

Tezosentan is an IV nonselective endothelin (ET)-1 antagonist that yields favorable hemodynamic effects in patients with acute congestive heart failure (CHF).

Methods

Pulmonary edema was defined as acute CHF leading to respiratory failure, as evidenced by an oxygen saturation (SO(2)) < 90% by pulse oxymeter despite oxygen treatment. All patients received oxygen 8 l/min through a face mask, 3 mg of IV morphine, 80 mg of furosemide, and 1 to 3 mg/h continuous drip isosorbide-dinitrate according to their blood pressure level and were randomized to receive a placebo or tezosentan (50 or 100 mg/h) for up to 24 h.

Results

Eighty-four patients were randomized. The primary end point, the change in SO(2) from baseline to 1 h, was 9.1 ± 6.3% in the placebo arm versus 7.6 ± 10% in the tezosentan group (p = NS). The incidence of death, recurrent pulmonary edema, mechanical ventilation, and myocardial infarction during the first 24 h of treatment was 19% in both groups. Reduced baseline SO(2), lower echocardiographic ejection fraction, high baseline mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and inappropriate vasodilation (MAP reduction at 30 min of < 5% or > 30%) correlated with worse outcomes. A post-hoc analysis revealed that the outcome of patients who received only 50 mg/h tezosentan was better than patients in the placebo group whereas patients receiving 100 mg/h had the worst outcomes.

Conclusions

In the present study, tezosentan (an ET-1 antagonist) did not affect the outcome of pulmonary edema, possibly because of the high dose used.

### High dose interleukin-2 (aldesleukin)-expert consensus on best management practices-2014 [^113Wjwu5]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Peripheral edema and weight gain

Edema is a consequence of the capillary leak syndrome and fluid infusion, and in general causes discomfort but is not serious. Administration of fluids should result in a minimum 1–2 lb per day weight gain. Falling behind in fluid replacement may result in administering more fluid boluses, problems with oliguria and increased creatinine, and high doses of vasopressors ultimately leading to early cessation of IL-2 dosing. (Figure 4) Careful attention to daily weights and the rate of increase is important. After stopping IL-2, many centers choose to initiate diuresis prior to discharge, and may target achieving a weight that is within 5 pounds of admission. In general, diuretics are not effective until about 6–8 hours after the last dose of IL-2 and the cyclical effects of that dose begin to wane. If peripheral edema is present when the patient is otherwise ready for discharge, several centers send patients home with a prescription for diuretics, but others do not, advising the patient that diuresis will occur on its own. Mostly, this is a comfort issue, and patients who are very uncomfortable should receive a prescription for diuretics, usually 20 to 40 mg of furosemide depending on renal function, upon discharge with instructions to take until edema is gone or weight returns to the immediate pre-admission level.

Figure 4

### Furosemide (14-panel toxicology medicated collection system) [^111RwYru]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Edema

Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response.

Adults

The usual initial dose of Furosemide tablets is 20 to 80 mg given as a single dose. Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 or 40 mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (eg, at 8 am and 2 pm). The dose of Furosemide tablets may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states.

Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving Furosemide tablets on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week.

When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable. (See PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests.)

Geriatric patients

In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

Pediatric patients

The usual initial dose of oral Furosemide tablets in pediatric patients is 2 mg/kg body weight, given as a single dose. If the diuretic response is not satisfactory after the initial dose, dosage may be increased by 1 or 2 mg/kg no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose. Doses greater than 6 mg/kg body weight are not recommended. For maintenance therapy in pediatric patients, the dose should be adjusted to the minimum effective level.

### The added value of hypertonic saline solution to furosemide monotherapy in patients with acute decompensated heart failure: a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^117GcufS]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This meta‐analysis, including 10 RCTs and ~3000 patients with HF, shows that treatment with intravenous HSS plus furosemide was associated with favorable responses across several surrogate efficacy endpoints, with no signals of safety based on low to moderate quality evidence (see Graphical abstract).

The administration of HSS is not used routinely in the management of ADHF patients. Current heart failure clinical practice guidelines dedicate too little attention to this therapy. However, there is evidence that supports its efficacy and safety in ADHF patients. The mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of HSS in decongesting patients with acute HF are diverse, including a rapid increase in plasma sodium and osmolality, with a rise in intravascular volume and renal perfusion, but are mainly focused on renal physiology. A neurohormonal effect inhibiting the deleterious action of the renin‐angiotensin system has been suggested. This hypothesis has been supported by plasma determination of values of BNP and also other inflammatory and fibrotic parameters (suppression of tumorigenicity 2, inflammatory cytokines [IL‐6]), which were lower in patients receiving HSS.

Diuretic resistance is a condition defined by an inability to increase fluid and sodium excretion despite an increase in loop diuretic dose, which is insufficient to relieve volume overload, peripheral edema, or pulmonary congestion. The physiology of diuretic resistance is also complex and not fully understood. It has been suggested that renal function (mainly glomerular filtration) would play a limited role in diuretic resistance, with sodium handling at the renal tubules being the most relevant mechanism. Therefore, diuretic combination strategies targeting sodium reabsorption at different tubular levels are highly effective in patients with diuretic resistance, but at the cost of worsening kidney function and notable electrolyte abnormalities that harm patients' outcomes.HSS administration improved the performance of loop diuretic therapy, as reflected in increased urinary volume and urinary sodium, and achieved a greater patient weight loss. To that effect, HSS is an adjunctive useful measure in patients with diuretic resistance. Furthermore, a trend towards a lower increase in creatinine levels was also observed in patients who received HSS.

Treatment for Patients During the First Days of Admission forHas Not Been Shown to Improve Outcomes

About 20 years ago, it was suggested that the treatment of AHF can be divided into 3 major stages: first, the initial stabilization, then the first few days in the hospital, and finally before and after discharge.

The interventions administered to patients during the first hours of admission for AHF are based on little evidence. The most common treatment administered is intravenous furosemide or other types of loop diuretics. This practice is endorsed by all guidelines. For instance, the 2022 Heart Failure Clinical Practice Guidelinesinclude a level 1 recommendation for diuretics in the initial treatment of AHF, but with level B‐NR evidence (nonrandomized studies). Nonetheless, the use of intravenous loop diuretics to decrease congestion in patients with AHF during the initial first few hours of admission is important for symptom relief. The effect of this therapy on short‐ and longer‐term outcomes is, however, not known. Keeping loop diuretics as a background therapy, studies have been done throughout the years to assess the addition of other treatments early in the AHF admission. Two small studies, suggested an early benefit of intravenous nitrates on oxygenation and need for mechanical ventilation for early myocardial infarction in patients with pulmonary edema; however, a recent study has shown that those strategies do not improve short‐term outcomes. Noninvasive ventilation was also proposed as a way to improve both patients' symptoms and outcomes in the immediate stabilization of AHF; however, a prospective studyhas shown that noninvasive ventilation improves patients' dyspnea but has no effect on short‐term outcomes. Therefore, as of now, guidelines recommend the use of diuretics as the first‐line treatment of patients with AHF. Other therapies, such as intravenous vasodilators and noninvasive ventilation, can be considered for symptom improvement, but these interventions do not seem to improve short‐term outcomes.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112Cjh4a]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Grade recommendation justification

Despite the low quality of evidence for the majority of outcomes, and the results being driven largely by a single trial, conservative fluid management may be beneficial without evidence of harm. We therefore suggest that in adult patients with ARDS, clinicians consider the use of a conservative fluid strategy which uses fluid restriction, diuretics and possibly hyperoncotic albumin to avoid a positive fluid balance in preference to a liberal fluid strategy.

### Diuretics decrease fluid balance in patients on invasive mechanical ventilation: the randomized-controlled single blind, IRIHS study [^114jSZp6]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Intervention

In the diuretic group, patients were given furosemide once or twice a day until successful extubation. The dosage was adapted by the bedside physician with the aim to reach patient's reference weight, with a maximum daily dose set at 250 mg of furosemide to avoid kidney toxicity. The administration of diuretics was postponed if one of the following criteria was present: urea > 25 mmol L −1, creatinine > 180 μmol L −1, creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL min −1, administration of iodinated contrast product in the past 6 h, natremia > 150 mmol L −1, kalemia < 3 mmol L −1, pH > 7.50, bicarbonates > 40 mmol L −1. Once these metabolic issues were corrected, diuretics could be administered. After successful extubation, diuretic management was left to the attending physician's discretion.

Control

In the control group, diuretic administration was prohibited. Diuretic could be used as rescue therapy in case of acute pulmonary edema or de novo heart failure.

Outcomes

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was the patient's fluid balance. Fluid balance was defined as the difference between the body weight assessed at the time of extubation and the body weight assessed on randomization.

Secondary outcome: efficacy criteria

The rate of extubation failure, the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation from randomization to successful weaning, the number of ventilatory free-days by day-28, the duration of ICU stay, ICU mortality and mortality by day-60 were compared between groups.

Secondary outcome: safety criteria

We compared the incidence and duration of hypokalemia episodes (≤ 3.5 mmol L −1), the incidence and duration of hyponatremia (≤ 135 mmol L −1), the number of hypernatremia episodes (≥ 145 mmol L −1), the rate of cardiac arrythmia (atrial fibrillation, torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia), the rate of kidney injury (KDIGO classification) from randomization to successful extubation. Urine output was measured daily and incorporated in the KDIGO definition. Safety events are described.

Sample size calculation

In a multicenter randomized-controlled study of sepsis, the median fluid balance during resuscitation was + 5 kg. We hypothesized that in the diuretic group, the fluid balance would be nil, whereas the fluid balance would be + 5 kg in the control group. Considering a standard deviation of 10, we calculated that we would need 172 patients (86 per group) for the study with an 80% power and a one-sided level of 0.05.

### Intravenous furosemide in decompensated heart failure: do not protocolize dosing but the desired effect! [^114S2MWZ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Palazzuoli and colleagues report on a study comparing continuous versus bolus infusion of furosemide in acute decompensated heart failure. Patients in the continuous infusion group had greater urine output, decreased renal function and increased 6-month mortality.

We feel that, due to the study design, the conclusions drawn are difficult to translate into clinical practice. The decisive advantage of continuous over bolus infusion is the ability to titrate to effect in a gradual and precise manner. This advantage is completely negated when large-step (that is, doubling) dose increases are rigidly protocolized, as was the case in this study. When the advantages of a method are lost, only its comparative harms remain: continuous infusion may have a stronger diuretic effect than bolus infusion (milligram for milligram) and the continuous infusion group in this study seemed overtreated, resulting in renal dysfunction that is associated with poor outcomes.

Future research should focus on the optimal method to attain the clinical goal of inducing sufficient but not excessive diuresis. Comparing outcomes on a protocolized-dose basis is straightforward but cannot elucidate which method is best in practice. Indeed, the authors write that a study utilizing a more tailored dose could further clarify this subject. We suggest that a truly relevant comparison can only be made when treatment in both groups is aimed at individual targets. This would require a large trial with patients optimally treated using either of the two infusion methods, while dosing is completely determined by preset clinically relevant endpoints.

### Diuretics for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants [^112tRN5H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Lung edema may complicate respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess the risks and benefits of diuretic administration in preterm infants with RDS.

Search Strategy

We used the standard search method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We searched Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from the Cochrane Library, using the following keywords: < exp respiratory distress syndrome > and < exp diuretics >. In addition, we searched the abstract books of the American Thoracic Society and Pediatric Research Societies.

Selection Criteria

We only included trials in which preterm infants with RDS and less than 5 days of age were randomly allocated to diuretic administration. Of those trials, we only included studies in which at least one of the following outcomes measures was evaluated: mortality, patent ductus arteriosus, hypovolemic shock, intraventricular hemorrhage, renal failure, duration of oxygen supplementation, duration of mechanical ventilation, need for oxygen supplementation at 28 days of life, oxygen supplementation at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (gestational age + postnatal age), length of stay, number of rehospitalizations during the first year of life, and neurodevelopmental outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard method for the Cochrane Collaboration which is described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. Two investigators extracted, assessed and coded separately all data for each study. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion.

Main Results

Six studies met inclusion criteria. Studies available for this systematic review were all done before the current era of prenatal steroids, surfactant, indomethacin and fluid restriction. Furosemide administration had no long-term benefits. Furosemide-induced transient improvement in pulmonary function did not outweigh an increased risk for patent ductus arteriosus and for hemodynamic instability.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There are no current data to support routine diuretic administration in preterm infants with RDS. Elective administration of furosemide or any diuretic to any patient with RDS should be carefully weighed against the risk of precipitating hypovolemia. In addition, elective administration of furosemide should be weighed against the risk of developing a symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus.
