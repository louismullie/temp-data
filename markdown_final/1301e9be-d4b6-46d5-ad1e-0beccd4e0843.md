## Question

Is it okay to take ampicillin instead of amoxicillin before dental procedure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ampicillin can be used instead of amoxicillin for dental antibiotic prophylaxis, and if so, how to dose it and when it is indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether prophylaxis is indicated at all. Then, I should verify what the major guidelines say about first-line agents and alternatives. Next, I will check whether ampicillin is an accepted substitute and how to dose it. After that, I need to consider pharmacokinetics and whether oral ampicillin is reasonable. Finally, I should review allergy considerations, stewardship implications, and summarize a practical recommendation with timing and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because I need to ensure we are not overprescribing prophylaxis. For infective endocarditis prevention, prophylaxis is reserved for patients with high-risk cardiac conditions undergoing procedures involving manipulation of gingival tissue, periapical region, or perforation of oral mucosa, and it is not recommended for most patients with prosthetic joints to prevent periprosthetic joint infection, where routine prophylaxis is discouraged by ADA/AAOS guidance [^114AdUX9] [^1117ghTf] [^112SYCr6] [^117XUgB3].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line agent and dose before jumping to alternatives. The American Heart Association recommends amoxicillin 2 g orally 30–60 minutes before the dental procedure for adults, with pediatric dosing at 50 mg/kg, and this remains the standard regimen in contemporary cardiology guidance as well [^114AdUX9] [^1117ghTf] [^115nFsA9].

> I will now examine whether ampicillin is an acceptable substitute when amoxicillin is unavailable or not feasible. The AHA guideline explicitly lists ampicillin 2 g IM or IV as an alternative for patients unable to take oral medications, and European Society of Cardiology summaries similarly note ampicillin 2 g as an option in prophylaxis regimens, which supports ampicillin as a pharmacologically appropriate alternative in the right context [^114AdUX9] [^116fNEt1].

> Hold on, I should verify the route and formulation, because oral ampicillin is not the usual choice. The AHA's oral-first-line is amoxicillin. Ampicillin is listed as parenteral (IM/IV) when the patient cannot take oral therapy, and I do not see a labeled or guideline-endorsed oral ampicillin regimen for dental IE prophylaxis, so using oral ampicillin would be off-label and likely suboptimal given absorption and tolerability considerations compared with amoxicillin [^114AdUX9] [^114EqytS].

> Let me think about pharmacokinetics to ensure the substitution makes sense. Amoxicillin is preferred orally due to superior absorption and higher, more sustained serum levels against oral streptococci, whereas ampicillin has lower oral bioavailability and more frequent gastrointestinal upset; this is why guidelines historically moved from older penicillin regimens to amoxicillin for prophylaxis, and it argues against substituting oral ampicillin for oral amoxicillin when the latter is available [^114EqytS] [^1156NRJh].

> But wait, what if the patient has a penicillin allergy; I need to check that before concluding. In patients with a serious beta-lactam allergy (anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria), penicillins including ampicillin and amoxicillin are contraindicated, and alternatives such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, or a first-generation cephalosporin (if no severe penicillin allergy) should be selected per guideline, with clindamycin used cautiously given C. difficile risk even with a single dose [^114AdUX9] [^1161naWm] [^116URjER] [^116bNmMn].

> I should double-check stewardship and appropriateness, because unnecessary prophylaxis is common. National data show that more than 80% of dental prophylaxis prescriptions are discordant with guidelines, often involving patients with prosthetic joints or low-risk cardiac conditions. Routine prophylaxis for prosthetic joints is not recommended, and unnecessary antibiotics expose patients to adverse effects and resistance without proven benefit, so I need to ensure the indication is valid before choosing any agent [^11554yd4] [^112SYCr6] [^117XUgB3].

> Let me reconsider the practical recommendation and make sure the timing is correct. If prophylaxis is truly indicated for a high-risk cardiac patient who cannot take oral amoxicillin, ampicillin 2 g IM or IV 30–60 minutes before the procedure is acceptable per AHA, whereas if the patient can take oral medication, amoxicillin 2 g orally remains preferred. If the preprocedural dose is missed, it may be given up to 2 hours after the procedure, but routine postprocedural dosing is not recommended [^114AdUX9] [^1171pwiY].

> In summary, I need to ensure the indication is present, then choose the right agent and route. Ampicillin is an acceptable alternative to amoxicillin for dental prophylaxis against infective endocarditis, but it should be given parenterally (2 g IM or IV) when the patient cannot take oral amoxicillin; oral ampicillin is not a standard prophylaxis option and is generally not recommended due to inferior oral pharmacokinetics, so if oral therapy is feasible, amoxicillin 2 g orally 30–60 minutes pre-procedure remains the first-line choice [^114AdUX9] [^114EqytS].

Ampicillin is **not recommended** for dental prophylaxis because it is less stable orally, has lower bioavailability, and is more likely to cause gastrointestinal upset than amoxicillin [^114EqytS]. The **standard regimen is amoxicillin 2 g orally 30–60 minutes before the procedure** [^115nFsA9] [^114AdUX9]. If amoxicillin is unavailable, ampicillin 2 g IV/IM is an acceptable alternative [^114AdUX9]; oral ampicillin is not recommended due to poor absorption and inferior pharmacokinetics. Use ampicillin only if amoxicillin is not available or if the patient cannot take oral medication, and avoid in penicillin allergy [^114AdUX9] [^116URjER].

## Pharmacological differences between ampicillin and amoxicillin

| **Parameter** | **Amoxicillin** | **Ampicillin** |
|-|-|-|
| Oral bioavailability | High (~90%) [^notfound] | Lower (~50–70%) |
| Gastrointestinal stability | Stable [^notfound] | Less stable |
| Gastrointestinal tolerance | Well tolerated [^113W1Ugm] | More GI upset |
| Clinical use | Preferred oral penicillin [^114EqytS] | Preferred IV/IM penicillin |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **AHA guidelines**: Amoxicillin 2 g orally 30–60 minutes before dental procedures involving gingival manipulation, periapical region, or oral mucosa perforation [^114AdUX9] [^1117ghTf].
- **Alternative regimen**: If amoxicillin cannot be given orally, ampicillin 2 g IV/IM 30–60 minutes before the procedure [^114AdUX9].
- **Oral ampicillin**: Not recommended due to lower bioavailability and higher GI upset risk.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting amoxicillin

- **Bacteremia reduction**: Amoxicillin significantly reduces incidence, nature, and duration of bacteremia after dental procedures [^11398RTm] [^11776dCJ].
- **Pharmacokinetics**: Superior oral absorption and sustained serum levels make amoxicillin the preferred oral agent [^114EqytS].
- **Clinical outcomes**: Amoxicillin is associated with better patient adherence and fewer GI adverse effects than ampicillin.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting ampicillin

Limited evidence supports oral ampicillin for dental prophylaxis; **IV/IM ampicillin is an alternative** when oral amoxicillin is not feasible [^114AdUX9]. However, its **lower oral bioavailability and higher GI upset risk limit its use** compared with amoxicillin [^114EqytS].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Penicillin allergy**: Avoid ampicillin and amoxicillin; use clindamycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin as alternatives [^114AdUX9] [^1161naWm].
- **Gastrointestinal intolerance**: Ampicillin is more likely to cause GI upset, making amoxicillin the preferred oral agent [^notfound].
- **Patient preference**: Amoxicillin is generally preferred due to better tolerability and adherence.

---

## Clinical scenarios where ampicillin may be considered

Ampicillin may be considered only when **amoxicillin is unavailable or the patient cannot take oral medication**; in such cases, use ampicillin 2 g IV/IM 30–60 minutes before the procedure [^114AdUX9]. It is **not recommended for patients with penicillin allergy** [^1161naWm] [^116URjER].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **Preferred agent**: Amoxicillin 2 g orally 30–60 minutes before dental procedures [^114AdUX9] [^115nFsA9].
- **Alternative agent**: Ampicillin 2 g IV/IM only if amoxicillin cannot be given orally [^114AdUX9].
- **Oral ampicillin**: Not recommended due to lower bioavailability and higher GI upset risk.
- **Penicillin allergy**: Use clindamycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin as alternatives [^114AdUX9].

Ampicillin is **not recommended for routine dental prophylaxis** because of lower oral bioavailability and higher GI upset risk; use amoxicillin when possible and reserve ampicillin for cases in which amoxicillin is unavailable or oral administration is not feasible [^114EqytS].

### The use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joints: evidence-based clinical practice guideline for dental practitioners – a report of the American dental association council on scientific affairs [^112SYCr6]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Management of patients with prosthetic joints undergoing dental procedures — clinical recommendation states that, in general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures to prevent prosthetic joint infection. For patients with a history of complications associated with their joint replacement surgery who are undergoing dental procedures that include gingival manipulation or mucosal incision, prophylactic antibiotics should only be considered after consultation with the patient and orthopedic surgeon, and a complete health history is always recommended when making final decisions regarding the need for antibiotic prophylaxis. The clinical reasoning provided is that there is evidence that dental procedures are not associated with prosthetic joint implant infections, that antibiotics provided before dental care do not prevent prosthetic joint implant infections, that there are potential harms of antibiotics including risk for anaphylaxis, antibiotic resistance, and opportunistic infections (e.g. Clostridium difficile), that the benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis may not exceed the harms for most patients, and that the individual patient's circumstances and preferences should be considered when deciding whether to prescribe prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures.

These findings have strong public health implications. To our knowledge, this is the first national analysis of overprescribing of antibiotics for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures and should initiate a call to action to the public health and dental communities to improve prescribing of antibiotics for infection prophylaxis. Because dentists primarily prescribe antibiotics for infection prophylaxis, a decrease in unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis will significantly decrease overall antibiotic prescribing by dentists. Therefore, specific antibiotic stewardship strategies and prescribing tools targeted to dentists and dental practices should be developed, implemented, and assessed for effectiveness in improving prescribing of antibiotics for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures.

The prescription of prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures is common, although factors influencing prescribing are poorly understood. We surveyed general and specialist medical providers and dentists on beliefs and attitudes regarding prophylactic antibiotic prescribing prior to dental procedures. There were significant differences in factors influencing decisions and perceived responsibility regarding prophylactic antibiotic prescribing between groups, although interest in additional education on the subject was high across both groups.

Additionally, instead of making an a priori assumption of fixed incidence rates before and after a single change point, we applied a non-parametric LOWESS smoother to visually inspect trends. We compared these to what would be expected under a hypothesis that dental prophylactic antibiotic prescribing was protective against the development of infective endocarditis (both for total cases and for the proportion of cases linked to oral streptococci), against an assumed background of linearly increasing cases unrelated to dental prophylactic antibiotic prescribing. To confirm that the change in guideline resulted in reduced dental prophylactic antibiotic prescribing, we downloaded annual data on two types of prescriptions known to be used almost exclusively for dental prophylaxis in the community (3 g doses of amoxicillin and 600 mg doses of clindamycin) from NHS Digital. We plotted annual numbers of 3 g amoxicillin doses only, as it was not possible to distinguish 600 mg doses of clindamycin (as opposed to other dose strengths) from the data, although it has previously been shown that the latter form only around 25% or less of prophylactic prescribing and follow the same pattern as 3 g amoxicillin doses.

All analyses were conducted using Stata v15.1 (StataCorp).

### Oral streptococcal infective endocarditis among individuals at high risk following dental treatment: a nested case-crossover and case-control study [^114gsg27]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

It is not clear whether the risk if VGS-IE (Viridans Group Streptococcal Infective Endocarditis) among individuals at high risk is elevated following bacteraemia caused by invasive dental procedures (IDPs) compared to daily bacteraemia. If such an association does not exist, the use of prophylactic antibiotics (AP) in dentistry for the prevention of VGS-IE is not clinically meaningful.

Individuals with prior IE, prosthetic heart valve, or complex congenital heart disease (CHD), are considered at high risk, because incidence rates of IE among these groups are increased compared to the general population.,25–30% of IE-cases are caused by VGS commonly found in the oral cavity, and may be associated with chewing, brushing, or dental procedures. According to European and American guidelines, individuals at high risk should receive AP prior to IDPs (dental extractions, the removal of dental calculus, and oral surgical procedures) to reduce the risk of VGS-IE. Expert committees revising the guidelines acknowledge that it is unclear whether AP prevents VGS-IE and that VGS-IE is more likely the result of daily bacteraemia caused by chewing and brushing of teeth, than by occasional dental procedures. Recent studies on national data from England and Sweden (where the prophylaxis is no longer routinely recommended since 2008 and 2012, respectively), detected no increase in VGS-IE associated with the guideline change. In England an addendum in 2016 stated that the prophylaxis is not recommended routinely, although amoxicillin prescriptions did not increase among dentists after this change. In Sweden an addendum published in March 2016, specifies that AP is not routinely recommended. The addendum states that AP may be considered if advised by the patient's physician. In such cases, the physician is responsible for notifying the dentist. No increase in amoxicillin prescriptions among dentists was detected after the publication of the addendum.

If there is an association between IDPs and VGS-IE among individuals at high risk it would be easier to detect in Sweden or England, where it may not be masked by the use of AP. Thornhill et al. attempted to study the association in England, although as the data showed a significant decrease in IDPs during the 3 months prior to IE, the authors attributed this to selective loss of data.

The aim of this nested study was to evaluate whether VGS-IE among the individuals at high risk was temporally associated with IDPs.

### Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans endocarditis [^1148941X]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Among the bacteria of the HACEK group, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is the organism involved most commonly in infective endocarditis. However, the epidemiological and clinical features specifically associated with this species have not been evaluated adequately. Three patients with infective endocarditis caused by A. actinomycetemcomitans seen at the Hospital La Timone (Marseille, France) between 1994 and 2001 are reported. Of 99 cases in the literature, 75% of patients had previous heart disease before infective endocarditis, the portal of entry of which was usually the oral cavity. Among the total of 102 cases, 27 had prosthetic valves. Intermittent fever was observed in all cases, and weight loss and peripheral signs of endocarditis were noteworthy in this study. Anaemia and microscopic haematuria were frequently noted. The disease is insidious, with a mean duration of symptoms of 13 weeks before diagnosis, as confirmed by blood cultures incubated for > 5 days. The aortic valve is most commonly involved, and echocardiographic findings were non-specific. Complications occurred in 63% of patients, with emboli being the most common. The surgery rate was 23.5%. The overall mortality rate was 18%. Of the cases, 76.5% were cured with antibiotics alone, including a simple third-generation cephalosporin or a combination of ampicillin and an aminoglycoside. An antibiotic therapy duration of at least 4 weeks is recommended. Surgical therapy is usually required for haemodynamic reasons. Prophylaxis of A. actinomycetemcomitans endocarditis relies on antibiotic therapy for all cardiac patients at risk before dental procedures. Among 17 patients undergoing dental manipulations, only eight received amoxycillin before the procedure, demonstrating that prophylaxis is far from being systematically prescribed. In conclusion, A. actinomycetemcomitans endocarditis should be highly suspected in patients with previous cardiac disease and for whom symptoms have evolved over a number of weeks or even months.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocarditis prophylaxis — prophylaxis is indicated only for patients at high risk, including those with prosthetic valves, a history of infective endocarditis, congenital heart disease repaired with foreign material, or cardiac transplant with valvulopathy; in these patients, antibiotic agents are recommended before lung or chest biopsy or abscess/empyema drainage, with amoxicillin or cefazolin as effective agents and clindamycin as an alternative in penicillin-allergic patients, whereas endocarditis prophylaxis is not recommended for patients undergoing "clean" procedures or "clean contaminated" genitourinary or gastrointestinal procedures.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^116HfCf2]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Adjusted Analysis

In multivariable analyses, unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased over time (Table 3). Patients 65 years and older and those aged 35 to 44 years had lower odds of being prescribed unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis compared with patients aged 18 to 34 years, while women (vs men; odds ratio [OR], 1.21; 95% CI, 1.17–1.25) had higher odds of unnecessary prescribing. Significant regional variation remained: compared with the Midwest, the Northeast and South had lower odds of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis, while the West (OR, 1.15, 95% CI, 1.06–1.25) had higher odds of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis. In addition, being in a rural location was associated with lower odds of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis. Dental procedures defined as diagnostic, preventive, oral and maxillofacial surgery, periodontics, and endodontics had lower odds of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis compared with those without these CDT procedure categories; adjunctive general services, implant services (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.45–1.89), prosthodontics, orthodontics, and maxillofacial prosthetics had higher odds of unnecessary prescribing. Unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis was less common in patients with diabetes, immunocompromised conditions, or health care use in the previous 6 months, while having a prosthetic joint device (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.22–2.41) was associated with unnecessary prescribing compared with those not having a prosthetic joint. Finally, unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis was most associated with antibiotics falling into the "other" category, followed by clindamycin (OR 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15), compared with amoxicillin.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^11554yd4]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Antibiotics are recommended before certain dental procedures in patients with select comorbidities to prevent serious distant site infections.

Objective

To assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures using Truven, a national integrated health claims database.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study. Dental visits from 2011 to 2015 were linked to medical and prescription claims from 2009 to 2015. The dates of analysis were August 2018 to January 2019. Participants were US patients with commercial dental insurance without a hospitalization or extraoral infection 14 days before antibiotic prophylaxis (defined as a prescription with ≤ 2 days' supply dispensed within 7 days before a dental visit).

Exposures

Presence or absence of cardiac diagnoses and dental procedures that manipulated the gingiva or tooth periapex.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as a prescription dispensed before a dental visit with a procedure that manipulated the gingiva or tooth periapex in patients with an appropriate cardiac diagnosis. To assess associations between patient or dental visit characteristics and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, multivariable logistic regression was used. A priori hypothesis tests were performed with an α level of .05.

Results

From 2011 to 2015, antibiotic prophylaxis was prescribed for 168 420 dental visits for 91 438 patients (median age, 63 years; interquartile range, 55–72 years; 57.2% female). Overall, these 168 420 dental visits were associated with 287 029 dental procedure codes (range, 1–14 per visit). Most dental visits were classified as diagnostic (70.2%) and/or preventive (58.8%). In 90.7% of dental visits, a procedure was performed that would necessitate antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk cardiac patients. Prevalent comorbidities include prosthetic joint devices (42.5%) and cardiac conditions at the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis (20.9%). Per guidelines, 80.9% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions before dental visits were unnecessary. Clindamycin was more likely to be unnecessary relative to amoxicillin (odds ratio [OR], 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15). Prosthetic joint devices (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.22–2.41), tooth implant procedures (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.45–1.89), female sex (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.17–1.25), and visits occurring in the western United States (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06–1.25) were associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis.

Conclusion and Relevance

More than 80% of antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental visits were unnecessary. Implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in dental practices is an opportunity to improve antibiotic prescribing for infection prophylaxis.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^117H7Qjf]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective To quantify the change in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures for patients at risk of infective endocarditis, and any concurrent change in the incidence of infective endocarditis, following introduction of a clinical guideline from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in March 2008 recommending the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom.

Design Before and after study.

Setting England.

Population All patients admitted to hospital in England with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of acute or subacute infective endocarditis.

Main outcome measures Monthly number of prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis consisting of a single 3 g oral dose of amoxicillin or a single 600 mg oral dose of clindamycin, and monthly number of cases of infective endocarditis, infective endocarditis related deaths in hospital, or cases of infective endocarditis with a possible oral origin for streptococci.

Results After the introduction of the NICE guideline there was a highly significant 78.6% reduction (P < 0.001) in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis, from a mean 10 277 (SD 1068) prescriptions per month to 2292 (SD 176). Evidence that the general upward trend in cases of infective endocarditis before the guideline was significantly altered after the guideline was lacking (P = 0.61). Using a non-inferiority test, an increase in the number of cases of 9.3% or more could be excluded after the introduction of the guideline. Similarly an increase in infective endocarditis related deaths in hospital of 12.3% or more could also be excluded.

Conclusion Despite a 78.6% reduction in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis after the introduction of the NICE guideline, this study excluded any large increase in the incidence of cases of or deaths from infective endocarditis in the two years after the guideline. Although this lends support to the guideline, ongoing data monitoring is needed to confirm this, and further clinical trials should determine if antibiotic prophylaxis still has a role in protecting some patients at particularly high risk.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures — level of certainty categories define High, Moderate, and Low certainty in effect estimates. High indicates that "The body of evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative populations", is "unlikely to be affected strongly by the results of future studies", and is "established strongly by use of the best available evidence". Moderate indicates that "the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change" and that the statement is "based on preliminary determination from the current best available evidence, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by 1 or more factors". Low indicates that "More information could allow a reliable estimation of effects on health outcomes", that "The available evidence is insufficient to support the statement, or the statement is based on extrapolation from the best available evidence", and that reliability may be "limited by factors such as" those noted on-page.

### Dentists: improve patient safety by optimizing antibiotic prescribing… [^113Csqkh]. blogs.cdc.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

Dentists: Improve patient safety by optimizing antibiotic prescribingPosted on by Dentists prescribe approximately 10% of all outpatient antibiotics in the United States. 1 Many of these antibiotic prescriptions may not be needed based on existing guidelines. Studies show that patients with total joint replacement commonly receive unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis despite clinical practice guidelines from the American Dental Association and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons that recommend against using antibiotics to prevent late prosthetic joint infection in most cases.
2. How can a dental procedure impact a prosthetic joint. When you have a dental procedure, bacteria in your mouth can enter your bloodstream. This also happens during normal daily activities, such as brushing and flossing your teeth. For most people, the immune system kills the bacteria and prevents them from causing infection somewhere else in the body.

However, people with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of infection and may need to take an antibiotic before some dental procedures. Taking an antibiotic to prevent an infection is called antibiotic prophylaxis. In the past, antibiotic prophylaxis was commonly prescribed to patients with prosthetic joints before certain dental procedures to prevent joint infections. However, expert guidelines no longer recommend pre-dental procedure antibiotic prophylaxis for most patients with prosthetic joints. This is because studies have shown that antibiotics given before dental procedures do not prevent prosthetic joint infections and can lead to side effects and the development of antimicrobial resistance. Patients who have other indications for dental antibiotic prophylaxis should continue to receive antibiotics. Talk to a healthcare professional about when antibiotics are needed.

And increasing evidence suggests that dental procedures pose no greater risk for bacteremia for patients with TJR than activities of daily living, such as brushing teeth or eating. 3–6 Thus, the risks of antibiotic prophylaxis, including adverse drug reactions and the threat of antimicrobial resistance, outweigh the potential benefit for most patients. How can the dental team improve antibiotic prescribing for patients with TJR. Stay up to dateon current dental prophylaxis guidelines for patients with TJR, from the ADA and AAOS. 8–9 Collaboratewith the orthopedic surgeon and involve the patient in shared decision-making when deciding if antibiotic prophylaxis is needed.

Prophylactic antibiotics guideline — balancing level of certainty and net benefit rating maps to clinical recommendation strength as follows. With a High level of certainty and "Benefits Outweigh Potential Harms", the strength is "Strong"; with High certainty "With Potential Harms", the strength is "In Favor"; and with High certainty and "No Benefit, Potential Harms, or No Association", the strength is "Against". For a Low level of certainty, guidance states "Expert opinion for or expert opinion against".

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^116TE3rZ]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Antibiotic follow-up and modification — patients with a history of a penicillin allergy (with or without anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives): Clinicians should reevaluate patient within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call), and dentists should instruct patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after patient's symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d. In cases in which patients with a history of a penicillin allergy and with or without a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives with penicillin, ampicillin, or amoxicillin fail to respond to first-line treatment with oral cephalexin, oral azithromycin, or oral clindamycin, the panel suggests that dentists should broaden antibiotic therapy to complement first-line treatment with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d).

### Does the use of prophylactic antibiotics decrease implant failure? [^113CRXKC]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The use of prophylactic antibiotics in implant dentistry is controversial. Given the known risks of antibiotic treatment and lack of consensus on using antibiotics at the time of implant insertion, the purpose of this article was to review available studies on use of perioperative prophylactic antibiotics at the time of implant placement and to provide evidence-based recommendations for antibiotic use. The reviewed studies suggest that a single preoperative dose of 2 g amoxicillin 1 hour before implant placement or 1 g amoxicillin 1 hour preoperatively and 500 mg 4 times daily 2 days postoperatively can reduce the rate of implant failure.

The panel advises "Clinicians should reevaluate within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call)" and "Dentists should instruct patients to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after their symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d". Among first-line options, "amoxicillin is preferred over penicillin because it is more effective against various gram-negative anaerobes and is associated with lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects". Cautions include "Bacterial resistance rates for azithromycin are higher than for other antibiotics, and clindamycin substantially increases the risk of developing Clostridioides difficile infection even after a single dose", and "clindamycin has a US Food and Drug Administration black box warning for Clostridioides difficile infection, which can be fatal". Patients receiving azithromycin "should be instructed to closely monitor their symptoms and call a dentist or primary care provider if their infection worsens while on therapy", and patients should "call their primary care provider if they develop fever, abdominal cramping, or ≥ 3 loose bowel movements/d". The text also notes "If the patient currently is taking an antibiotic within the same spectrum as the one indicated, additional antibiotics do not need to be prescribed. If the patient currently is taking an antibiotic outside of the spectrum as the one indicated, the intended antibiotic still can be prescribed, considering potential contraindications".

### Appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2016–2018 [^1128pnob]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis is common yet unnecessary for many dental visits. In this analysis, our objective was to assess whether the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis has improved over time.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using dental visits from 2016 to 2018 (data analyzed in 2021) using medical and prescriptions claims data of patients from the U.S. with commercial dental insurance. Antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as a ≤ 2 days' supply prescription dispensed within 7 days before a dental visit. Appropriateness of prophylaxis was defined on the basis of the manipulation of the gingiva/tooth periapex or oral mucosa perforation in patients with appropriate cardiac diagnoses. Associations between patient and visit characteristics and appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis were assessed using multiple Poisson regression.

Results

Unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis was highly prevalent in this cohort, ranging from 77.0% in 2016 to 78.5% in 2018. In the adjusted analysis, factors associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis included younger age, female sex, geographic region, rurality, type of antibiotic, and certain dental procedures. The factors associated with the highest risk of unnecessary prophylaxis in the adjusted analysis were orthodontic procedures and having a history of a prosthetic joint. Notably, the risk of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased over time in the adjusted analysis.

Conclusions

Unnecessary prescription of antibiotic prophylaxis by dentists continues to be common. Antimicrobial stewardship strategies are needed to improve prescribing by dentists.

### Patent foramen ovale closure for stroke prevention and other disorders [^117Cpxcv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

A TTE is done 1 day after the procedure or before discharge. The postprocedure TTE should carefully assess for residual shunts, device instability, evidence of device erosion, deformation of surrounding structures, and evidence of new or worsening pericardial effusion. 13 Duration and frequency of follow‐up echocardiograms post‐PFO closure is unknown. 13 In 1 study, in addition to TTE evaluation 1 day after the procedure or before discharge, contrast TTE was repeated at 6 months to document proper device implantation and assess for residual shunts. 70 Serial echocardiograms thereafter may be done in cases of persistent shunt or larger device implant. 70

Infection of a PFO device postimplant is exceedingly rare, but several case reports have reported device infection that required either intravenous antibiotics or surgical management. 71, 72 Given the scarcity of data and low infection rate of patients with intracardiac devices (including Amplatzer devices), there is no definitive evidence that postprocedure prophylaxis is warranted in the absence of high‐risk features for intracardiac infection. 73 Infective endocarditis prophylaxis, if warranted, should be done for the first 6 months only for dental procedures, which involve manipulation of the gingival tissue, perforation of the oral mucosa, or manipulation of the periapical region of the teeth. 73 Ideally, elective dental procedures should be deferred until 6 months postprocedure, but if not possible, a single dose of amoxicillin 2 mg should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before dental work. As an alternative for patients with a penicillin allergy, clindamycin 600 mg may be given. Prophylaxis is not required for nondental procedures, such as colonoscopy, cystoscopy, and TEE.

Dental procedures in patients already receiving antibiotics — agent selection guidance states that if a patient is already receiving chronic antibiotic therapy with an antibiotic that is also recommended for IE prophylaxis for a dental procedure, it is prudent to select an antibiotic from a different class rather than to increase the dosage of the current antibiotic. For those taking an oral penicillin for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever or for other purposes and likely to harbor viridans group streptococci relatively resistant to penicillin or amoxicillin, the provider should select either clindamycin, azithromycin or clarithromycin for IE prophylaxis for a dental procedure, but only for patients shown in Box 3.

Dental and oral procedures for which antimicrobial prophylaxis is or is not recommended are listed in Table 2. 2 In general, prophylaxis is recommended for procedures associated with significant bleeding from hard or soft tissues, including periodontal surgery, scaling and professional teeth cleaning. Prophylaxis is also recommended for tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is not recommended for procedures in which significant bleeding is not anticipated. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Dental, Oral, Respiratory Tract and Esophageal Procedures Alpha-hemolytic streptococci are the most common cause of endocarditis following dental and oral procedures, certain upper respiratory tract procedures, bronchoscopy with a rigid scope, esophageal procedures and surgical procedures involving the respiratory mucosa.

The recommended standard prophylactic regimen for all of these procedures is a single dose of oral amoxicillin. A follow-up dose is no longer recommended, both because of the prolonged serum levels above the minimal inhibitory concentration of most oral streptococci. 25 and the prolonged serum inhibitory activity induced by amoxicillin against such strains. 26 Although amoxicillin, ampicillin and penicillin V are equally effective in vitro against alpha-hemolytic streptococci, amoxicillin is recommended because it is better absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and because it provides higher and more sustained serum antimicrobial levels. Parenterally administered ampicillin is recommended in patients who are unable to take or to absorb oral medications. Amoxicillin for parenteral administration is not available in the United States.

The oral cavities of patients who are taking an oral penicillin for the secondary prevention of rheumatic fever or for other purposes may contain alpha-hemolytic streptococci that are relatively resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin or ampicillin. These patients should be given one of the alternative antibiotics for endocarditis prophylaxis. 2 Because of possible cross-resistance, the cephalosporins should be avoided. Cardiac Surgery Patients A careful preoperative dental evaluation is recommended in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, so that, whenever possible, required dental treatment can be completed before the surgery. Such measures may decrease the incidence of late postoperative endocarditis.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^11516RgW]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Study Population

Prescription claims were identified in the Truven prescription claims data, and dental procedures were identified in the Truven dental commercial claims data (2011–2015), with prevalence of cardiac or other conditions identified in the Truven medical and hospital claims data (2009–2015) before the dispensing of antibiotic prescriptions for the dental visit. The dates of analysis were August 2018 to January 2019. Eligible study patients were those with 12 months of continuous enrollment in plans with medical and prescription coverage and 30 days with dental coverage before and including the date of the visit with a dentist. We identified patients with a prescription claim for any systemic antibiotic with a days' supply of 2 days or less that occurred within 7 days before the dental visit. In this study, these antibiotics were defined as being prescribed for preprocedural infection prophylaxis and meet the standard from prior studies, manual review of dental records, and per guidance from clinical experts. Antibiotics with a days' supply of 2 days or less dispensed within 7 days before the dental visit met our definition of use for antibiotic prophylaxis vs treatment of an oral or systemic infection (requiring ≥ 3 days' treatment). We further excluded visits at which patients had a recent hospitalization or active or recent extraoral infection (eg, recent respiratory tract infection) defined by diagnosis codes from any outpatient encounter. A recent hospitalization or extraoral infection was defined as occurring within 14 days before the antibiotic dispense date.

The routine use of amoxicillin antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures for patients with total joint prostheses in place remains controversial. This analysis shows that the practice may not be cost-effective for patients in whom the risk of infection with dental work is low. However, specific data quantifying the risk and the impact prophylactic antibiotics can have is needed. Patients and physicians will need to continue to consider their use on an individual basis and should consider the risk of infection as well as the risk of adverse drug reaction when making treatment decisions.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures after total hip and knee arthroplasty does not decrease the risk of periprosthetic joint infection [^116ZcYQs]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a devastating complication after total hip and total knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA). While some guidelines no longer recommend routine use of prophylactic antibiotics for dental procedures, many surgeons continue to prescribe antibiotics for their THA/TKA patients. In a setting of increasing antibiotic resistance, it is important to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. This study aims to evaluate antibiotics prior to dental procedures and the association between dental procedures and PJI.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent THA/TKA between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020. The primary outcome was late-presenting PJI, occurring > 90 days after surgery. Patients were designated in the antibiotic group (2,000 mg of amoxicillin) or non-antibiotic group based on their surgeon's prophylaxis protocol. Dental-associated PJIs were considered if the patient had evidence of poor dentition or a recent dental procedure prior to the onset of PJI symptoms.

Results

There were 2,871 (26.4%) patients in the no antibiotics group and 8,023 (73.6%) patients in the antibiotics group. We found 27 (0.3%) late-presenting PJIs and 4 dental-associated PJIs. In the univariate and multivariable analyses, body mass index ≥ -30 and revision surgery were the only variables that increased the odds of late-presenting PJI. All 4 dental-associated PJIs occurred in patients prescribed antibiotics.

Conclusions

We found a low rate of late-presenting PJI. Routine antibiotics prior to dental procedures were not shown to affect the risk of late-presenting PJI. These findings suggest that routine antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures is not necessary after THA/TKA.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing bacterial endocarditis following dental procedures [^112j5foy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Infective endocarditis is a severe infection arising in the lining of the chambers of the heart. It can be caused by fungi, but most often is caused by bacteria. Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia, which could lead to bacterial endocarditis in a small proportion of people. The incidence of bacterial endocarditis is low, but it has a high mortality rate. Guidelines in many countries have recommended that antibiotics be administered to people at high risk of endocarditis prior to invasive dental procedures. However, guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales states that antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis is not recommended routinely for people undergoing dental procedures. This is an update of a review that we first conducted in 2004 and last updated in 2013.

Objectives

Primary objective To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration, compared to no antibiotic administration or placebo, before invasive dental procedures in people at risk or at high risk of bacterial endocarditis, influences mortality, serious illness or the incidence of endocarditis. Secondary objectives To determine whether the effect of dental antibiotic prophylaxis differs in people with different cardiac conditions predisposing them to increased risk of endocarditis, and in people undergoing different high risk dental procedures. Harms Had we foundno evidence from randomised controlled trials or cohort studies on whether prophylactic antibiotics affected mortality or serious illness, and we had found evidence from these or case-control studies suggesting that prophylaxis with antibiotics reduced the incidence of endocarditis, then we would also have assessed whether the harms of prophylaxis with single antibiotic doses, such as with penicillin (amoxicillin 2 g or 3 g) before invasive dental procedures, compared with no antibiotic or placebo, equalled the benefits in prevention of endocarditis in people at high risk of this disease.

Search Methods

An information specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 10 May 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies SELECTION CRITERIA: Due to the low incidence of bacterial endocarditis, we anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, we included cohort and case-control studies with suitably matched control or comparison groups. The intervention was antibiotic prophylaxis, compared to no antibiotic prophylaxis or placebo, before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk of bacterial endocarditis. Cohort studies would need to follow at-risk individuals and assess outcomes following any invasive dental procedures, grouping participants according to whether or not they had received prophylaxis. Case-control studies would need to match people who had developed endocarditis after undergoing an invasive dental procedure (and who were known to be at increased risk before undergoing the procedure) with those at similar risk who had not developed endocarditis. Our outcomes of interest were mortality or serious adverse events requiring hospital admission; development of endocarditis following any dental procedure in a defined time period; development of endocarditis due to other non-dental causes; any recorded adverse effects of the antibiotics; and the cost of antibiotic provision compared to that of caring for patients who developed endocarditis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search records, selected studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in the included study and extracted data from the included study. As an author team, we judged the certainty of the evidence identified for the main comparison and key outcomes using GRADE criteria. We presented the main results in a summary of findings table.

Main Results

Our new search did not find any new studies for inclusion since the last version of the review in 2013. No randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or cohort studies were included in the previous versions of the review, but one case-control study met the inclusion criteria. The trial authors collected information on 48 people who had contracted bacterial endocarditis over a specific two-year period and had undergone a medical or dental procedure with an indication for prophylaxis within the past 180 days. These people were matched to a similar group of people who had not contracted bacterial endocarditis. All study participants had undergone an invasive medical or dental procedure. The two groups were compared to establish whether those who had received preventive antibiotics (penicillin) were less likely to have developed endocarditis. The authors found no significant effect of penicillin prophylaxis on the incidence of endocarditis. No data on other outcomes were reported. The level of certainty we have about the evidence is very low.

Authors' Conclusions

There remains no clear evidence about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in at-risk people who are about to undergo an invasive dental procedure. We cannot determine whether the potential harms and costs of antibiotic administration outweigh any beneficial effect. Ethically, practitioners should discuss the potential benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis with their patients before a decision is made about administration.

### Antibiotics for the prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry [^112KK3nW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Infective endocarditis is a severe infection arising in the lining of the chambers of the heart with a high mortality rate. Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia and it was believed that this may lead to bacterial endocarditis (BE) in a few people. Guidelines in many countries have recommended that prior to invasive dental procedures antibiotics are administered to people at high risk of endocarditis. However, recent guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales has recommended that antibiotics are not required.

Objectives

To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration, compared to no such administration or placebo, before invasive dental procedures in people at risk or at high risk of bacterial endocarditis influences mortality, serious illness or the incidence of endocarditis.

Search Methods

The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 21 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 21 January 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 21 January 2013). We searched for ongoing trials in the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Due to the low incidence of BE it was anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, cohort and case-control studies were included where suitably matched control or comparison groups had been studied. The intervention was the administration of antibiotic, compared to no such administration, before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk of BE. Cohort studies would need to follow those individuals at increased risk and assess outcomes following any invasive dental procedures, grouping by whether prophylaxis was received or not. Included case-control studies would need to match people who had developed endocarditis (and who were known to be at increased risk before undergoing an invasive dental procedure preceding the onset of endocarditis) with those at similar risk but who had not developed endocarditis. Outcomes of interest were mortality or serious adverse events requiring hospital admission; development of endocarditis following any dental procedure in a defined time period; development of endocarditis due to other non-dental causes; any recorded adverse events to the antibiotics; and cost implications of the antibiotic provision for the care of those patients who developed endocarditis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion then assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included study.

Main Results

No randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or cohort studies were included. One case-control study met the inclusion criteria. It collected all the cases of endocarditis in the Netherlands over two years, finding a total of 24 people who developed endocarditis within 180 days of an invasive dental procedure, definitely requiring prophylaxis according to current guidelines, and who were at increased risk of endocarditis due to a pre-existing cardiac problem. This study included participants who died because of the endocarditis (using proxies). Controls attended local cardiology outpatient clinics for similar cardiac problems, had undergone an invasive dental procedure within the past 180 days, and were matched by age with the cases. No significant effect of penicillin prophylaxis on the incidence of endocarditis could be seen. No data were found on other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

There remains no evidence about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in people at risk who are about to undergo an invasive dental procedure. It is not clear whether the potential harms and costs of antibiotic administration outweigh any beneficial effect. Ethically, practitioners need to discuss the potential benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis with their patients before a decision is made about administration.

### Infective endocarditis among high-risk individuals before and after the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in dentistry: a national cohort study [^113c8LHo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Although our results seem reassuring for Swedish policy makers, any extrapolation of them depends on the assumption that Swedish dentists have adhered to the recommendation not to prescribe AP to high-risk individuals. In Sweden, AP is in general prescribed by the dentist, who is ultimately responsible for the decision to administer or not to administer AP before dental procedures. In the Swedish national recommendations, there are remaining indications for amoxicillin prophylaxis other than prevention of IE, such as such as prevention of osteoradionecrosis and before specific oral surgical procedures. Therefore, the overall 40% reduction of amoxicillin prescriptions among Swedish dentists showed by national administrative data may indicate adherence to guidelines, although this was not evaluated in each specific case.

During the study period, in March 2016, a revision of the recommendations for AP in Swedish dentistry was made, stating that although the recommendation not to administer AP in dentistry to high-risk individuals for the prevention of IE remained, AP could be considered if recommended by the patient's physician. It is unclear to what extent, if any, this has affected the prescription of AP among dentists. Another limitation is that the frequency and nature of dental procedures carried out among the cohorts is unknown. Differences in exposure to dental treatment among the cohorts from, for example, oral status could skew the results. Such information bias should be nondifferential, such as tooth extractions, oral surgery, and subgingival scaling are dental treatments indicated by national Swedish guidelines to treat oral disease, and indications for these treatments have not changed during the study period. Furthermore, such differences may, at least in part, be considered as the results were adjusted for age and educational attainment. Nevertheless, future studies should include detailed data on the frequency and nature of invasive dental procedures among the high-risk individuals. This study adds to the existing evidence indicating that AP in dentistry for the prevention of IE may be discontinued. In the future, internationally congruent guidelines similar to the Swedish recommendations could reduce antibiotic use and thereby the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^114ZXStH]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Prior to the introduction of the NICE guideline in March 2008 a single 3 g oral dose of amoxicillin or a 600 mg oral dose of clindamycin was used as antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis in people at risk undergoing invasive dental procedures. We obtained national monthly prescribing data for all such prescriptions issued in England between January 2004 and April 2010 (25 months after the introduction of the guideline), from the prescription pricing division of the NHS Business Services Authority.

Figures on the incidence of infective endocarditis in England were obtained from national data on inpatient hospital activity from January 2000 until April 2010. All patients admitted to hospitals in the United Kingdom have standard data recorded, including their primary discharge diagnosis and up to 12 secondary diagnoses, using the ICD-10 coding system. These anonymised data are reported to the data warehouse of the Secondary Uses Service. We used Dr Foster Intelligence, a public-private partnership health service information and intelligence organisation, to access and assess the data from the Secondary Uses Service. The data presented are for England only.

We identified all patients, including those who died in hospital, with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of "acute or subacute infectious endocarditis" (ICD-10 I33.0). We also identified patients with such a diagnosis where a streptococcal or staphylococcal cause was also recorded (ICD-10 A40, A41 codes for septicaemia or B95 supplementary causal organism codes). Codes A40.0 to A40.3 and B95.0 to B95.3, respectively, identify group A, B, and D streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae as causal organisms. Codes A40.4, A40.5, B95.4, and B95.5 identify other streptococci or unspecified streptococci as the cause of disease. For analysis purposes we grouped cases of infective endocarditis with an A40.4, A40.5, B95.4, or B95.5 code as cases with a possible oral streptococcal cause. For comparison we also identified cases with a staphylococcal cause by grouping cases with codes A41.0 to A41.2 or B95.6 to B95.8.

By searching individual patient level data we were able to identify when patients admitted to one hospital were transferred to another as part of their management. We counted such continuous periods of illness, known as "superspells", only once.

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis in dentistry: survey among dental surgeons in porto alegre, Brazil, and the metropolitan region [^1127vGMB]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

The irrational use of antimicrobial drugs has become a serious epidemiological problem due to the development of bacterial resistance, causing consequences for global health. In dentistry, antibiotics are the second most common pharmacological class prescribed. Thus, we evaluated the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis by dentists in Porto Alegre, Brazil, and the metropolitan region using an online questionnaire. Dentists were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire concerning antimicrobial prescription. The questionnaire was prepared on the Microsoft Forms platform and shared with dentists through social media and was available for a period of 40 days. The questionnaire was answered by 82 dentists, and 85.3% of them reported prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis (AP). Many different protocols were observed, but the majority of dentists prescribe amoxicillin (2 g) 1 hour before a procedure. The greatest diversity was found in the prescriptions for post-procedure prophylaxis, but most professionals prescribe 500 mg of antibiotics every 8 hours for 7 days. An overwhelming 91.5% of participants think that guidelines for prescribing antibiotics in dentistry are necessary, and 62.2% believe that the use of AP can have some impact on bacterial resistance. There is a wide range of different prescriptions for antimicrobials, suggesting a need for better aligned guidelines and education of professionals on the proper use of antimicrobials and its consequences on bacterial resistance to antibiotics.

Clinical recommendation and rationale — prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joints: The 2014 Panel judged with moderate certainty that there is no association between dental procedures and the occurrence of PJIs. Consistent with the ADA's methods, when there is moderate certainty of no association, the strength of the recommendation is against, and against means that evidence suggests not implementing this intervention or discontinuing ineffective practices. On this basis, the Panel states: In general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures to prevent prosthetic joint infection. The Panel also made the assumption that the evidence regarding hip and knee joint infections can be extrapolated to all joints because, to our knowledge, no studies have been published addressing the relationship between dental treatment and infections of other types of prosthetic joints.

Probability of IE Following a High-Risk Dental Procedure

The probability of IE after a high-risk dental procedure was based on analysis of recent English datathat estimated that reduced use of AP was associated with 34.9 (95% confidence interval, 7.9–61.9) additional IE cases per month.

The incidence of IE with AP use was derived from 2007, the year immediately before the introduction of NICE guidance (1486 cases, 28.91 per million). Table 1 reports parameter estimates required to translate this incidence into an estimate of the probability of IE. All other probabilities are shown in Table 2. Duval et alprovided data on the proportion of IE cases associated with a predisposing cardiac condition, the proportion associated with a high-risk dental procedure, the mean number of high-risk dental procedures per year in those with a predisposing cardiac condition, and the prevalence of a predisposing cardiac condition, resulting in an estimated probability of IE of 17.98 per million high-risk dental procedures where routine AP would be provided.

Table 1.
Data Used to Estimate the Probability of IE After a High-Risk (Invasive) Dental Procedure

Table 2.
Summary of Transitional Probabilities for Adverse Health States, Mortality, and Adverse Side Effects

The higher estimated annual incidence of IE in the absence of AP leads to an estimated probability of IE of 1785.13 cases per million in the high-risk group and 204.33 cases per million dental procedures in the all-at-risk group.

Mortality From IE

All patients were tracked for mortality within 1 year of IE diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision code I33.0) using HES. Deaths in the community secondary to IE were not included because HES only records in-hospital mortality, resulting in a small underestimate of IE-related mortality, a limitation of this data set.

Fatal and Nonfatal Reactions to AP

NHS Business Service Authority prescribing data were cross-referenced with adverse drug reaction data for prescriptions of standard AP (single oral dose amoxicillin 3 g or clindamycin 600 mg) from the Medicine and Health Products Regulatory Agency Yellow Card reporting scheme. The fatal and nonfatal adverse drug reaction rates per million prescriptions were 0 and 22.6, and 12.6 and 149.1 for amoxicillin and clindamycin, respectively.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures following total joint arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1125jr99]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a serious complication following total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Hematogenous spread, including from dental procedures, is a proposed mechanism for PJI. While prophylactic antibiotics (PAs) have traditionally been recommended before dental procedures in patients with joint prostheses, recent guidelines question their effectiveness. This study aimed to evaluate the association between dental antibiotic prophylaxis and PJI risk through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies included adult patients who had TJAs undergoing dental procedures, with and without antibiotic prophylaxis, and reported PJI outcomes. There were four retrospective cohort studies, encompassing 157,466 patients, that met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A random-effects meta-analysis with Hartung-Knapp adjustment was used to pool odds ratios (OR).

Results

Incidence of PJI ranged from 0.07 to 0.3% across included studies. There were no studies that demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in PJI rates among patients who received prophylactic antibiotics. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in PJI risk between antibiotic and non-antibiotic groups, with a slight, non-significant increase in risk among patients receiving antibiotics. Several studies identified other PJI risk factors, including revision arthroplasty, obesity, congestive heart failure, and diabetes with end-organ damage.

Conclusion

Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures in patients who have primary total hip or knee arthroplasty does not reduce the risk of PJI. Given the low overall incidence of PJI and the potential harms of unnecessary antibiotic use, including resistance and adverse effects, current evidence supports limiting prophylaxis to select high-risk populations. Updated clinical guidelines should reflect these findings to enhance antibiotic stewardship and reduce healthcare costs.

### Interventions for replacing missing teeth: antibiotics at dental implant placement to prevent complications [^1125xure]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Some dental implant failures may be due to bacterial contamination at implant insertion. Infections around biomaterials are difficult to treat and almost all infected implants have to be removed. In general, antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery is only indicated for patients at risk of infectious endocarditis, for patients with reduced host-response, when surgery is performed in infected sites, in cases of extensive and prolonged surgical interventions and when large foreign materials are implanted. To minimise infections after dental implant placement various prophylactic systemic antibiotic regimens have been suggested. More recent protocols recommended short term prophylaxis, if antibiotics have to be used. With the administration of antibiotics adverse events may occur, ranging from diarrhoea to life-threatening allergic reactions. Another major concern associated with the widespread use of antibiotics is the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The use of prophylactic antibiotics in implant dentistry is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial or harmful effects of systemic prophylactic antibiotics at dental implant placement versus no antibiotic/placebo administration and, if antibiotics are of benefit, to find which type, dosage and duration is the most effective.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched up to 2nd June 2010. Several dental journals were handsearched. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) with a follow up of at least 3 months comparing the administration of various prophylactic antibiotic regimens versus no antibiotics to patients undergoing dental implant placement. Outcome measures were prosthesis failures, implant failures, postoperative infections and adverse events (gastrointestinal, hypersensitivity, etc).

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted in duplicate and independently by two review authors. Results were expressed as random-effects models using risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was to be investigated including both clinical and methodological factors.

Main Results

Four RCTs were identified: three comparing 2 g of preoperative amoxicillin versus placebo (927 patients) and the other comparing 1 g of preoperative amoxicillin plus 500 mg 4 times a day for 2 days versus no antibiotics (80 patients). The meta-analyses of the four trials showed a statistically significant higher number of patients experiencing implant failures in the group not receiving antibiotics: RR = 0.40 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.84). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one patient having an implant failure is 33 (95% CI 17 to 100), based on a patient implant failure rate of 5% in patients not receiving antibiotics. The other outcomes were not statistically significant, and only two minor adverse events were recorded, one in the placebo group.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence suggesting that 2 g of amoxicillin given orally 1 hour preoperatively significantly reduce failures of dental implants placed in ordinary conditions. No significant adverse events were reported. It might be sensible to suggest the use of a single dose of 2 g prophylactic amoxicillin prior to dental implant placement. It is still unknown whether postoperative antibiotics are beneficial, and which is the most effective antibiotic.

### The cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis [^1146QAvm]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) is a widely used prevention measure for those at risk of developing infective endocarditis (IE). Following the suggestion that bacteremia secondary to invasive dental procedures might cause IE, the American Heart Association's Committee on Prevention of Rheumatic Fever and Bacterial Endocarditis was the first to recommend that individuals at increased risk of IE should be given antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) before invasive dental procedures some 60 years ago. Over time, the American Heart Association and other international guideline committees have gradually restricted AP use, moving to single-dose AP strategies and restricting the types of patients for whom AP is recommended. In 2008, this culminated with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommending that the use of AP to prevent IE should cease in the United Kingdom. This recommendation was confirmed in a recent review of the NICE guidelinesbut is in contrast with current European, North American, and other international guidelines that recommend AP for high-risk individuals undergoing invasive dental procedures.

A recent interrupted time series study found that AP prescribing in England fell sharply after the 2008 NICE guidance with a significant increase in the incidence of IE. By March 2013, it was estimated that there were 34.9 (95% confidence interval, 7.9–61.9) more cases of IE per month than would have been expected from the previous trend. This increase was statistically significant both for those at high risk (previous history of IE, prosthetic heart valve, valve repaired with prosthetic material, unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, or some repaired congenital heart defects) and moderate risk (native valve disease, unrepaired congenital heart valve anomalies, or previous rheumatic fever) of IE. This study provides unique evidence for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of AP, because the United Kingdom is the only country to have transitioned from recommending AP for those at high risk or moderate risk of IE to recommending its complete cessation. Another recent UK study demonstrated that the incidence of adverse drug reactions associated with AP was much lower than previously estimated.

This article estimates the cost-effectiveness of AP (single-dose amoxicillin or clindamycin for those allergic to penicillin) in patients at risk of IE by using (1) recent estimates of the effect of AP on IE in the English population,(2) rates of AP adverse drug reactions, and (3) estimates for the probability of developing IE after dental procedures derived from French dataas the foundation for analysis of cost and health benefits.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^112L7ViC]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that despite a substantial decrease in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis in England since the introduction of NICE guideline No 64 in March 2008 there has been no significant increase in the number of cases of infective endocarditis, as measured using data from hospital episode statistics.

Some clinicians remain concerned that the NICE recommendation to stop antibiotic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom, and the reduced number of patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis in the United States and Europe as a result of the restriction of antibiotic prophylaxis to patients thought to be at high risk in the latest American Heart Associationand European Society of Cardiologyguidelines, will result in an increased incidence of infective endocarditis. Although one small study found no cause for concern after the change in the American Heart Association guidelinesthe present trial is the first large scale study to evaluate the effect of the NICE guideline recommendation to stop antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis.

Although these findings lend support to the NICE guideline recommendations and suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures is unlikely to be of value in preventing infective endocarditis in patients with a history of rheumatic fever or a heart murmur, our findings do not exclude the possibility that a small number of patients at highest risk, such as those with prosthetic valves, might benefit. Ongoing monitoring of the data is required for confirmation, and further studies are needed to determine if antibiotic prophylaxis has a role in protecting a small group of patients at highest risk from infective endocarditis.

### Penicillins for the prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry [^112hDVQE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia and it is believed that this may lead to bacterial endocarditis (BE) in a few people. Guidelines in many countries recommend that prior to invasive dental procedures antibiotics are administered to people at high risk of endocarditis. However, it is unclear whether the potential risks of this prophylaxis outweigh the potential benefits.

Objectives

To determine whether prophylactic penicillin administration compared to no such administration or placebo before invasive dental procedures in people at increased risk of BE influences mortality, serious illness or endocarditis incidence.

Search Strategy

The search strategy was developed on MEDLINE and adapted for use on the Cochrane Oral Health, Heart and Infectious Diseases Groups' Trials Registers (to October 2003), as well as the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2002), OLDMEDLINE (1966 to June 2002); EMBASE (1980 to June 2002); SIGLE (to June 2002); and the Meta-register of current controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Due to the low incidence of BE it was anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, cohort and case controlled studies were included where suitably matched control or comparison groups had been studied. The intervention was the administration of penicillin compared to no such administration before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk of BE. Cohort studies would need to follow those at increased risk and assess outcomes following any invasive dental procedures, grouping by whether prophylaxis was received. Included case control studies would need to match people who had developed endocarditis (and who were known to be at increased risk before undergoing an invasive dental procedure preceding the onset of endocarditis) with those at similar risk but who had not developed endocarditis. Outcomes of interest were: mortality or serious adverse event requiring hospital admission; development of endocarditis following any dental procedure in a defined time period; development of endocarditis due to other non-dental causes; any recorded adverse events to the antibiotics; and cost implications of the antibiotic provision for the care of those patients who develop endocarditis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion, then assessed quality and extracted data from the included study.

Main Results

No RCTs, CCTs or cohort studies were included. One case-control study met the inclusion criteria. It collected all the cases of endocarditis in the Netherlands over 2 years, finding a total of 24 people who developed endocarditis within 180 days of an invasive dental procedure, definitely requiring prophylaxis according to current guidelines and who were at increased risk of endocarditis due to a pre-existing cardiac problem. This study included participants who died because of the endocarditis (using proxys). Controls attended local cardiology outpatient clinics for similar cardiac problems, had undergone an invasive dental procedure within the past 180 days and were matched by age with the cases. No significant effect of penicillin prophylaxis on the incidence of endocarditis could be seen. No data were found on other outcomes.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is no evidence about whether penicillin prophylaxis is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in people at risk who are about to undergo an invasive dental procedure. There is a lack of evidence to support published guidelines in this area. It is not clear whether the potential harms and costs of penicillin administration outweigh any beneficial effect. Ethically practitioners need to discuss the potential benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis with their patients before a decision is made about administration.

### Can we really do without antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis? [^1129fVBS]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Current guidance recommends against the use of antibiotic prophylaxis around the time of dental intervention for the prevention of infective endocarditis. The authors report the case of a previously well-patient with an asymptomatic isolated ventricular septal defect (VSD) who developed evidence of infective systemic and pulmonary emboli following dental treatment. A diagnosis of severe endocarditis of a previously normal native mitral valve was made. She subsequently underwent surgical repair of her mitral valve, and closure of her VSD. She was deemed fit for discharge on parenteral antibiotics on the thirtieth postoperative day. The authors highlight the need for further re-evaluation of the issues surrounding antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis in the context of dental procedures.

### Decision-making on the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for dental procedures: a survey of infectious disease consultants and review [^114xgRqi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

There is debate concerning use of antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures for patients at risk of acquiring distant site infection (DSI). We determined the opinions and practices of infectious disease consultants (IDCs) regarding antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent DSIs that result from invasive dental procedures by conducting a survey of the 797 members of the Infectious Diseases Society of America Emerging Infections Network (477 members [60%] responded). Ninety percent of respondents closely follow the American Heart Association guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with valvular heart disease who undergo invasive dental procedures. In contrast, few IDCs recommend prophylaxis for patients with lupus erythematosus, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, dialysis catheters or shunts, cardiac pacemakers, or ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Twenty-five percent to forty percent of respondents recommended prophylaxis for prosthetic vascular grafts, orthopedic implants, or chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. We conclude that IDCs differ considerably in their assessment of the need for prophylaxis for patients who have noncardiac risk factors for DSI. These differences underscore the need for definitive studies to delineate appropriate candidates for antimicrobial prophylaxis in dental practice.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^113aGGqE]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are antibiotics appropriately prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures?

Findings

In this cohort study of 91 438 patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis for 168 420 dental visits from 2011 to 2015, a total of 90.7% of dental visits had manipulation of the gingiva or tooth periapex, but only 20.9% of patients had a cardiac condition at the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis. Therefore, 80.9% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions were discordant with guidelines.

Meaning

Most antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures are unnecessary.

- prosthetic cardiac valves, including transcatheter-implanted prostheses and homografts

- prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repairs, such as annuloplasty rings, chords, or clips

- previous IE

- unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease or repaired congenital heart disease, with residual shunts or valvular regurgitation at the site of or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device.

Dental management with abnormal blood counts — neutropenia and infection control — In severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 500 cells per microliter), only dental treatment that is a medical necessity is advised. If invasive dental treatment is deemed necessary, antibiotic prophylaxis may be suggested for neutropenic patients, and clinician discretion is essential — the more severe the neutropenia and the more invasive the dental procedure, the stronger the consideration for antibiotic prophylaxis; the decision about antibiotic prophylaxis should be made collaboratively with the dentist, dental oncologist and the hemato-oncologist. The antibiotic is administered 30–60 minutes prior to the invasive dental procedure, with commonly prescribed protocols including Amoxicillin 2 g, Doxycycline 100 mg, Cephalexin 2 g, or Azithromycin or clarithromycin 500 mg. The patient should be informed about the risk and benefit of the antibiotic prophylaxis, the antibiotic regimen should be alternated if the interval between sequential invasive dental appointments is < 10 days, and during and following an invasive procedure, actions to reduce infection are advised, such as pre-operative chlorhexidine rinses and post-operative copious saline irrigation.

Results

In comparison with no AP, both amoxicillin and clindamycin AP were associated with lower costs and better health outcomes (Table 5) for both high-risk and all-at-risk populations. In the all-at-risk group, there were mean cost savings of £2.47 (95% credible interval [CrI], £0.48–£6.96) ($3.29; CrI $0.64–$9.26; €2.96, CrI €0.58–€8.35) per person with amoxicillin AP and £3.65 (95% CrI, £0.69–£8.14) ($4.86; 95% CrI, $0.92–$10.83; €4.38, 95% CrI, €0.83–€9.77) with clindamycin AP, in comparison with no AP (the difference between the drugs being driven by the lower cost of clindamycin: £1.14 versus £2.28 [$1.52 versus $3.03; €1.37 versus €2.74]). With an estimated 2.24 million dental procedures per year in this population (Table 1), AP would lead to savings of £5.5 million to £8.2 million per annum ($7.3 million to $10.9 million; €6.6 million to €9.8 million). We calculated a mean health improvement of 0.0012 (95% CrI, 0.000–0.003) and 0.0010 (95% CrI, 0.000–0.002) QALYs per person for amoxicillin and clindamycin, respectively (equivalent to 2687 QALYs gained per annum at the population level if amoxicillin AP were used for all-at-risk patients).

Table 5.

These cost savings were substantially greater in the high-risk group at a mean of ≈£40 ($53.2; €48.00) per patient (or £4.0 million [$5.3 million; €4.8 million] per annum in England on the basis of an estimated 100 000 dental procedures in this population). The most effective strategy would be amoxicillin, leading to gains of 0.0107 QALYs per person (or 1071 QALYs for the population) per annum.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^113iEJ2P]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we performed an analysis of adult patients with visits to a dentist from 2011 to 2015 using Truven MarketScan commercial claims and encounters, Medicare supplemental, and coordination of benefits. Truven is a national integrated health claims database of deidentified outpatient medical, hospital, prescription, and dental claims. While the medical claims are nationally representative of the insured US population in terms of age, sex, and geographic area, the dental domain is a convenience sample of 8 million persons with enrollment in both medical (commercial insurance or Medicare) and dental (commercial) health plans. This is the only national data set with detailed data on dental claims and links medical and prescription claims. Per other health services research performed by the American Dental Association, we collected individual-level demographics (patient age and sex), inpatient and outpatient medical diagnoses (in International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] or International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10-CM] format), medical procedures (in Current Procedural Terminology and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System format), retail and mail-order prescription claims, and dental claims (in Code on Dental Procedures and Nomenclature [CDT] format). Dental visit CDT codes were aggregated into categories per a standardized coding structure established by the American Dental Association. Because multiple CDT codes could be coded for a visit, our analyses assessed visits with a specific CDT category coded as compared with visits without the CDT category coded. For all analyses herein, ICD-9 codes before October 1, 2015, were converted to ICD-10-CM codes per guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline. The University of Illinois at Chicago Investigational Review Board deemed that this study was exempt from review and informed consent.

After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 168 420 eligible dental visits (or episodes of care) with antibiotic prophylaxis for 91 438 unique patients were included in this analysis (Figure 1). The characteristics of the sample are listed in Table 2. The median age of the cohort was 63 years (interquartile range, 55–72 years) and was majority female (57.2%). Overall, these 168 420 dental visits were associated with 287 029 dental procedure codes (range, 1–14 per visit). Most visits with antibiotic prophylaxis occurred in the midwestern United States (46.9%), followed by the southern United States (31.5%), and occurred in an urban setting (56.7%). Most dental procedures conducted during the dental visits with antibiotic prophylaxis were classified as diagnostic (70.2%), followed by preventive (58.8%), and involved some type of gingival manipulation and/or mucosal incision (90.7%). Comorbidities were common in the cohort, especially prosthetic joint devices (42.5%) and cardiac conditions at the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis (20.9%). Health care use in the previous 6 months was common, with half having a primary care visit (50.7%) and most having a specialty care visit (80.4%).

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^116hH2yN]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Unadjusted Analysis

Of the 168 420 eligible dental visits with antibiotic prophylaxis, the most frequent antibiotics prescribed were amoxicillin (69.4%), followed by clindamycin (16.0%) (Table 2). Only 19.1% of antibiotics prescribed were appropriate; therefore, 80.9% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions before dental visits were discordant with guidelines. Those with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis had a lower percentage of amoxicillin prescribed but a higher percentage of cephalexin and other types of antibiotics than those with appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis. Compared with those visits with appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, visits with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis were associated with a higher percentage of women, urban locations, and prosthetic joints but a lower percentage of diagnostic and preventive dental procedure categories, gingival manipulation, cardiac conditions, and previous health care use. There was also significant variation by US Census geographic region and the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis. The highest unnecessary prescribing was observed in the West (84.5% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions were unnecessary in the West) and the lowest in the Northeast (78.2% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions were unnecessary in the Northeast). Unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased over time between 2011 and 2015 from 84.5% to 78.8% overall and across all geographic regions (P < .001) (Figure 2).

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^1144WRma]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To quantify the change in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures for patients at risk of infective endocarditis, and any concurrent change in the incidence of infective endocarditis, following introduction of a clinical guideline from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in March 2008 recommending the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom.

Design

Before and after study.

Setting

England. Population All patients admitted to hospital in England with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of acute or subacute infective endocarditis.

Main Outcome Measures

Monthly number of prescriptions for antibiotic prophylaxis consisting of a single 3 g oral dose of amoxicillin or a single 600 mg oral dose of clindamycin, and monthly number of cases of infective endocarditis, infective endocarditis related deaths in hospital, or cases of infective endocarditis with a possible oral origin for streptococci.

Results

After the introduction of the NICE guideline there was a highly significant 78.6% reduction (P < 0.001) in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis, from a mean 10,277 (SD 1068) prescriptions per month to 2292 (SD 176). Evidence that the general upward trend in cases of infective endocarditis before the guideline was significantly altered after the guideline was lacking (P = 0.61). Using a non-inferiority test, an increase in the number of cases of 9.3% or more could be excluded after the introduction of the guideline. Similarly an increase in infective endocarditis related deaths in hospital of 12.3% or more could also be excluded.

Conclusion

Despite a 78.6% reduction in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis after the introduction of the NICE guideline, this study excluded any large increase in the incidence of cases of or deaths from infective endocarditis in the two years after the guideline. Although this lends support to the guideline, ongoing data monitoring is needed to confirm this, and further clinical trials should determine if antibiotic prophylaxis still has a role in protecting some patients at particularly high risk.

### Antibiotics for the prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry [^117VUob7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Infective endocarditis is a severe infection arising in the lining of the heart with a high mortality rate. Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia and it was believed that this may lead to bacterial endocarditis (BE) in a few people. Guidelines in many countries have recommended that prior to invasive dental procedures antibiotics are administered to people at high risk of endocarditis. However, recent guidance by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales has recommended that antibiotics are not required.

Objectives

To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration compared to no such administration or placebo before invasive dental procedures in people at increased risk of BE influences mortality, serious illness or endocarditis incidence.

Search Strategy

The search strategy from the previous review was expanded and run on MEDLINE (1950 to June 2008) and adapted for use on the Cochrane Oral Health, Heart and Infectious Diseases Groups' Trials Registers, as well as the following databases: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2); EMBASE (1980 to June 2008); and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (to June 2008).

Selection Criteria

Due to the low incidence of BE it was anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, cohort and case-control studies were included where suitably matched control or comparison groups had been studied. The intervention was the administration of antibiotic compared to no such administration before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk of BE. Cohort studies would need to follow those at increased risk and assess outcomes following any invasive dental procedures, grouping by whether prophylaxis was received. Included case-control studies would need to match people who had developed endocarditis (and who were known to be at increased risk before undergoing an invasive dental procedure preceding the onset of endocarditis) with those at similar risk but who had not developed endocarditis. Outcomes of interest were: mortality or serious adverse event requiring hospital admission; development of endocarditis following any dental procedure in a defined time period; development of endocarditis due to other non-dental causes; any recorded adverse events to the antibiotics; and cost implications of the antibiotic provision for the care of those patients who develop endocarditis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, then assessed quality and extracted data from the included study.

Main Results

No randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or cohort studies were included. One case-control study met the inclusion criteria. It collected all the cases of endocarditis in The Netherlands over 2 years, finding a total of 24 people who developed endocarditis within 180 days of an invasive dental procedure, definitely requiring prophylaxis according to current guidelines and who were at increased risk of endocarditis due to a pre-existing cardiac problem. This study included participants who died because of the endocarditis (using proxys). Controls attended local cardiology outpatient clinics for similar cardiac problems, had undergone an invasive dental procedure within the past 180 days and were matched by age with the cases. No significant effect of penicillin prophylaxis on the incidence of endocarditis could be seen. No data were found on other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

There remains no evidence about whether penicillin prophylaxis is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in people at risk who are about to undergo an invasive dental procedure. There is a lack of evidence to support previously published guidelines in this area. It is not clear whether the potential harms and costs of antibiotic administration outweigh any beneficial effect. Ethically practitioners need to discuss the potential benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis with their patients before a decision is made about administration.

### Infective endocarditis by HACEK: a review [^116fNEt1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Prevention and prophylaxis

Recently, prophylaxis attributable to invasive dental operations was a normal precaution for the prevention of infections endocarditis from oropharyngeal bacteria especially HACEK and viridians streptococci group. However, this suggestion was withdrawn by AHA in 2007, after population-based evidence showed that only a minimal percentage of IE cases are eliminated by the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures. Scientific studies and growing evidence continue to contradict and refine the suggested prophylactic techniques. Antibacterial prophylaxis is now approved for use in particular high-risk cases, such as the involvement of a prosthetic heart valve, prior history of IE, uncorrected or newly corrected CHD, and the occurrence of prosthetic heart valve disorders. For patients in these high-risk groups, prophylaxis is recommended prior to dental operations involving stimulation of the gingival tissue or For patients in these high-risk groups, prophylaxis is recommended prior to dental operations involving stimulation of the gingival tissue or periapical area of the teeth or destruction of oral mucosa such as root canal processes. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not approved for using local anesthetic of non — infected areas, for the prevention of superficial caries, for the insertion of sutures, dental x-rays, for the positioning or modification of removable implantation of prosthesis or orthodontics, or for damage to the lips and mucous membranes. The key focus for antibiotic prophylaxis in these groups is oral streptococci, although HACEK group are also considered. The most prescribed prophylaxis are amoxicillin or ampicillin, 2 g orally or intravenously in adults and 50 mg/kg orally or intravenously in non-adults, according to the ESC 2015 standards. In the penicillin or ampicillin allergic patient, clindamycin can be chosen to give at 600 mg for adults and 20 mg/kg in in non-adults. The antibiotics are supplied as a single dose 30–60 min prior to the dental procedure. However, while antibacterial prophylaxis is limited to high-risk populations, such prevention steps should be extended to all cardiac disease. The ESC Standards recommend non-specific preventive steps, such as stringent oral and skin care, 2-yearly dental follow-up, wound disinfection, therapeutic antibiotics for bacterial infection, no antibiotic self-medication and minimal use of catheters and aggressive methods.

### Research agenda for antibiotic stewardship within the veterans' health administration, 2024–2028 [^112B6Ys7]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Other settings

Periprocedural and surgical areas

Major evidence gaps for optimizing antibiotic use in procedural and surgical areas include the comparative effectiveness of different antibiotic agents for surgical prophylaxis, situations when surgical antibiotic prophylaxis can be replaced with other interventions to reduce infection risk, and the real-world effectiveness of weight-based antibiotic dosing and intraoperative redosing. Other knowledge gaps include limited data to inform reporting of direct clinical harms associated with unnecessary or suboptimal periprocedural and perioperative antibiotic use [Question 17]. Although professional guidelines recommend stopping antibiotic prophylaxis once the surgical incision is closed in the operating room, even in the presence of a drain, this guidance is frequently ignored and difficult to implement. Given the VA population of older men, there are abundant opportunities to deimplement this practice after urologic procedures.

Dental settings

Although professional dental associations support antibiotic stewardship in dental settings, there are few examples of successful programs. Even within the VA, 85% of antibiotics prescribed for prophylaxis by dentists are discordant with clinical treatment guidelines. Reasons for discordant antibiotic use include demands by patients and medical clinicians, social norms, and limited information on harms of short-term use of antibiotics for dental indications [Question 17].VA dentistry has been a leader within the profession on quality improvement, and this bodes well for research that seeks to incorporate antibiotic stewardship into the workflow of a dental encounter.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

Impact of antibiotic therapy on bacteremia from a dental procedure — the ability of antibiotic therapy to prevent or reduce the frequency, magnitude or duration of bacteremia associated with a dental procedure is controversial. Amoxicillin therapy has a statistically significant impact on reducing the incidence, nature and duration of bacteremia from dental procedures but does not eliminate bacteremia, and no data show that such a reduction as a result of amoxicillin therapy reduces the risk of or prevents IE. Trials report mixed results: neither penicillin V nor amoxicillin reduced the frequency of bacteremia versus untreated control subjects; penicillin or ampicillin reduced certain organisms yet there was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with positive cultures 10 minutes after tooth extraction; and patients treated with cefaclor did not have a reduction of postprocedure bacteremia. Contradictory results are also reported for erythromycin and clindamycin. For topical antiseptics, the preponderance of evidence suggests that there is no clear benefit; topical antiseptic rinses do not penetrate beyond 3 mm into the periodontal pocket, and on the basis of these data, it is unlikely that topical antiseptics are effective to significantly reduce the frequency, magnitude and duration of bacteremia associated with a dental procedure.

### The cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis [^116RZAk8]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Comparators and Patient Population

The cost-effectiveness of the AP regimen that was in use in the United Kingdom before the 2008 NICE guidelines (a single 3-g oral dose of amoxicillin or a single 600-mg oral dose of clindamycin for those allergic to penicillin or who had received amoxicillin in the previous month) for all at risk individuals (ie, those at moderate risk or high risk of IE) was compared with a strategy of no AP (as per the NICE guidelines). We also compared no AP with a strategy restricting AP to just those at high risk of IE (as per the Europeanand North Americanguidelines). English National Health Service costs were estimated and health effects measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).

Model Structure

A decision model, based on the decision model used by NICE for the health-economic analysis performed to inform the 2008 guidelines, was constructed to estimate differences in costs and health benefits accruing from the short-term consequences of the decision to administer AP, or not, and the longer-term sequelae of AP and IE (Figure). AP-related adverse events and IE may be fatal or lead to differences in the probability of a patient being otherwise healthy, requiring valve replacement surgery or experiencing congestive heart failure (CHF). These longer-term impacts were captured by using a state transition model, with 1-year cycle periods and a lifetime (50 years) time horizon. We used Treeage Pro software and the Sheffield Accelerated Value of Information Tool.

Dashed arrows represent patient pathways from the decision tree to Markov models (ie, all living patients begin in either the well or valve surgery states).

Parameter Values

Data used to calculate the probability of IE after a high-risk (invasive) dental procedure were based on previous definitions and estimates of the risk of adults with predisposing cardiac conditions developing IE. The number of IE hospital admissions (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision code I33.0) was obtained from Hospital Episode statistics (HES;)and population data from the Office of National Statistics.

### Infective endocarditis by HACEK: a review [^115XUEH1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatments

Delay in diagnosis and its complications can be fatal for humans. Ampicillin in combination with gentamicin is standard treatment for 4 weeks for normal valve infection and for 6 weeks for synthetic valve infection. Surgical procedures follow the recommendations of the Endocarditis Working Group of the International Society of Chemotherapy.

The guidelines recommend that ampicillin-resistant organisms be considered because of the difficulty in detecting susceptibility and the potential for resistance among HACEK microorganisms. Therefore, broad-spectrum cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones are considered the first line of treatment for HE (HACEK endocarditis).

Ampicillin should not be prescribed to patients with HE unless the organism is found to be sensitive, and gentamicin is no longer recommended due to its nephrotoxic risks. The standard treatment for HE is intravenous ceftriaxone monotherapy with 2 g per day. The diet should be given for 4 weeks in NVE (native valve endocarditis) and for 6 weeks in prosthetic valve endocarditis. Alternative, rarely used options in cases of β- lactam allergy include fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin or moxifloxacin.

One of the benefits of surgical intervention is valve tissue resection, which can be used for microbiological documentation. However, surgical intervention is necessary in case of heart failure, paravular proliferation, persistence of infection despite appropriate antimicrobial treatment and/or prevention of embolism. These indications for surgery apply to native, as well as prosthetic, valve HE. After surgical treatment, If tissue cultures are negative, antibiotic treatment should be continued to complete the preoperative period, starting with the first negative blood culture after diagnosis of HE. In case of positive tissue cultures, a full course of antibiotics should be started from the time of surgery according to the sensitivity characteristics of the operated cultures.

A recently published study by Lee et al. illuminated that surgical mitral valve repair with lifting annuloplasty strip for patients with acute phase infective endocarditis, including HE, which sometimes has a 5-year survival. This study also showed a significant decrease in left ventricular diastolic end dimensions with no/minimal regurgitation up to a median follow-up of 54 months post operation. In the past, prevention before invasive dental procedures was a model recommendation for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis of oral and pharyngeal organisms, especially HACEK organisms and streptococci of the viridans group. The recommendation was overturned by the AHA in 2007 after population-based data showed that only a few cases of IE could be prevented by prescribing prophylactic antibiotics for dental procedures.

Conclusions

More than 80% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions before dental procedures are unnecessary: clindamycin use, the presence of prosthetic joints, and residence in the western United States were associated with unnecessary prescribing. While antibiotic prophylaxis is appropriately prescribed for indicated dental procedures in patients with cardiac conditions, most antibiotic prophylaxis is prescribed to patients in whom guideline-identified risk factors are not present. Although prescribing is slowly improving, the high proportion of antibiotics that were found to be unnecessary in our study is worrisome. Implementing antimicrobial stewardship efforts in dental practices is an opportunity to improve antibiotic prescribing for infection prophylaxis.

Discussion

Our results demonstrate that most antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental visits are unnecessary. These findings are concerning because dentists prescribe a significant proportion of antibiotics and are the top prescribers of clindamycin in the United States. Antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis by dentists have been associated with community-associated C difficile infection. One dose of clindamycin has an equivalent risk of C difficile compared with a prolonged course. Therefore, it is alarming that clindamycin was more likely to be inappropriately prescribed than amoxicillin. However, there was a significant decrease in antibiotic prophylaxis over the study period. This may indicate that the 2013 guidelines for the prevention of prosthetic joint infections are being applied to patient care.

These results are consistent with those from other countries, where 58% to 81% of dental antibiotic prescriptions are inconsistent with guidelines, particularly for infection prophylaxis. However, dentists are knowledgeable about and generally satisfied with the antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines. Regardless, 70% of dentists surveyed reported prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis when not indicated. Dentists in the United States identified factors associated with guideline-consistent antibiotic prescribing to be postgraduate education, urban locale, and a smaller patient panel. Reasons for higher antibiotic prescribing rates included increasing use of dental implants, an aging population, underinsurance driving antibiotics as an oral surgery substitute, slow adoption of new guidelines, lack of awareness of the role of dentists in antibiotic resistance, and physician and patient pressure. These characteristics are similar to those associated with physician antibiotic overprescribing. Therefore, antibiotic stewardship strategies shown to be effective in outpatient medical clinics may also improve antibiotic prescribing in dentistry. In fact, a recent example has provided early evidence that implementing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Core Elements of Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship in dental practices was effective.

Limitations and Public Health Implications

These results are not without limitations. The cohort is a convenience sample of US patients with commercial dental insurance. Therefore, our results may not be representative of the uninsured and underrepresents persons with Medicaid and Medicare benefits. Medicare does not generally cover dental care, and the state provision of dental benefits to adults with Medicaid is optional. As a result, these persons are not included in our sample unless supplemental commercial dental benefits were purchased. Due to limitations in the data set, the prescriptions cannot be directly linked with the health care encounter or prescriber. We adapted methods used by other investigators to link antibiotic prescriptions to health care encounters and exclude other indications for antibiotics. To increase the specificity of our antibiotic-related dental visits, we conservatively defined a cohort in which other indications for antibiotics are unlikely. In contrast to medical care providers, dentists rarely use diagnostic codes (ICD-9 or ICD-10-CM) and are reimbursed based on procedure codes (CDT). Therefore, it is difficult to associate a diagnosis with the prescription. To increase the likelihood that an antibiotic was prescribed for infection prophylaxis (vs treatment of an oral infection), the days' supply for the antibiotic prescription was limited to 2 days or less (whereas oral infections are likely to be treated for ≥ 3 days). We did not assess dental visits at which an antibiotic was indicated but not dispensed. Although the 2007 infective endocarditis guidelines significantly decreased the number of patients with a prophylaxis indication, data are conflicting regarding the association of this change with the incidence of endocarditis. However, the sole studywith results identifying an increase in infective endocarditis in the United States did not include dental visit data and was not able to adjust for increases in infective endocarditis observed with the opioid epidemic. So, it is difficult to elucidate the causal factor (dental visit vs substance misuse). We did not apply 2017 (after our study period) expert panel recommendations of clinical scenarios in which antibiotic prophylaxis may be appropriate in patients with prosthetic joints. All scenarios include patients with multiple comorbidities (eg, prosthetic joint plus uncontrolled diabetes and prosthetic joint plus immunocompromised state). Because the comorbidities in the expert panel recommendationsare similar to those in the 2003 prosthetic joint guidelines, we anticipate the results from the expert panel recommendations to be similar to the results from the 2003 prosthetic joint guidelines. Due to the difficulty in identifying specific diagnoses, we broadened the definition for certain conditions to include all cardiac transplantation (removing cardiac valvulopathy), all diabetes (vs just type 1), and all congenital heart diseases. Therefore, unnecessary prescribing is likely higher than our results indicate.

Prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joint implants — clinical recommendation and evidence basis: American Dental Association clinical guidance states that, "In general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures to prevent prosthetic joint infection". The 2014 Panel judged that the current best evidence failed to demonstrate an association between dental procedures and prosthetic joint infection (PJI). The 2014 Panel also presented information about antibiotic resistance, adverse drug reactions, and costs associated with prescribing antibiotics for PJI prophylaxis. The practitioner and patient should consider possible clinical circumstances that may suggest the presence of a significant medical risk in providing dental care without antibiotic prophylaxis, as well as the known risks of frequent or widespread antibiotic use. As part of the evidence-based approach to care, this clinical recommendation should be integrated with the practitioner's professional judgment and the patient's needs and preferences.

### New British and American guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of infective endocarditis: do the changes make sense? A critical review [^111JqndQ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and the American Heart Association have radically revised their guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis. This review discusses the evidence behind the most controversial changes and considers possible future developments.

Recent Findings

The new guidelines emphasize good oral hygiene for preventing viridans streptococcal endocarditis. Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures is only recommended for patients with the highest-risk cardiac conditions. American Heart Association guidelines no longer recommend prophylaxis for urological and gastrointestinal procedures.

Summary

While only up to 6% of endocarditis cases may be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis there is controversy as to what to recommend for the individual cardiac patient undergoing a given procedure. The new guidelines about dental prophylaxis are based on epidemiological studies that failed to include sufficient subjects undergoing specific interventions. When considering viridans streptococcal rather than total bacteraemia rates, asserting that the prevalence of bacteraemia after invasive dental procedures is similar to that after toothbrushing may be incorrect. The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy report probably overestimates the risk of fatal anaphylaxis after an oral dose of amoxicillin. In contrast, the American Heart Association guidelines comment on the absence of any reports of fatal anaphylaxis associated with the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^112DEFQs]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Infective endocarditis is a rare disease with a high morbidity and mortality. For more than 50 years antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive procedures has been the primary focus for preventing infective endocarditis and remains the standard of care for patients with the disease in most parts of the world. The rationale for such treatment is to reduce or eliminate the bacteraemia that may result from such procedures. A particular focus is on antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, as oral streptococci have been implicated in between 18% and 65% of cases of infective endocarditis, although most studies suggest the proportion is closer to 35–45%. Regardless, little or no firm scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing infective endocarditis, and two case-control studies provide evidence that dental treatment is unlikely to be a risk factor. Some authors therefore suggest that the current focus on antibiotic prophylaxis is an unproved, expensive, and potentially harmful standard of care, whereas others argue that it prevents cases of infective endocarditis. Owing to ethical and medicolegal issues, cost, and the large number of patients necessary to achieve statistically significant results, a randomised placebo controlled trial of antibiotic prophylaxis has never been attempted.

In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom produced controversial new guidance recommending the cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for all patients at risk of infective endocarditis undergoing dental and a wide range of other invasive procedures. Although the American Heart Associationand the European Society for Cardiologychanged their guidelines around the same time, they did not recommend the complete cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis. Both continued to recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with prosthetic heart valves undergoing invasive dental procedures, patients with cardiac valves repaired using prosthetic material, and patients with significant congenital heart lesions, a heart transplant with valvular lesions, or a history of endocarditis.

We hypothesised that by studying national prescribing data as well as data recorded for all inpatient hospital activity in the United Kingdom, we would be able to quantify the effect of the new NICE guideline on prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis and the incidence of infective endocarditis. We describe the effect of the guideline on the prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis in England and the changes in the incidence of cases of infective endocarditis and deaths from the disease in hospital over that period.

### The use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joints: evidence-based clinical practice guideline for dental practitioners – a report of the American dental association council on scientific affairs [^111YDZ28]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis–related harms and resistance in patients with prosthetic joints are outlined, noting that there is a long-standing and increasing concern that repeated exposure to antibiotics is a risk factor for the development of resistant bacterial species. Although there are no data regarding the risk of developing a drug reaction from 1 dose of amoxicillin prescribed to prevent a distant site infection such as PJI, older regimens with intramuscular injections and multiple oral doses suggest that more people who are given antibiotic prophylaxis would experience drug reactions from penicillin-type drugs — some of which may be fatal — than would be prevented from developing PJI, and there also is an increased risk of experiencing adverse reactions with increasing patient age (that is, in patients 70 years or older). Prolonged treatment with antibiotics is associated with infections secondary to changes in the gastrointestinal microbial flora, and Clostridium difficile infection potentially can cause pseudomembranous colitis; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that annually there are approximately 250,000 people with C difficile infections that require hospitalization or already affect hospitalized patients, resulting in 14,000 deaths per year, and investigators have identified clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones as the inducing agents.

### Impact of amoxicillin prophylaxis on the incidence, nature, and duration of bacteremia in children after intubation and dental procedures [^11398RTm]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy exists about the impact of prophylactic antibiotics on bacteremia after invasive dental procedures. The purpose of this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was to determine the impact of amoxicillin prophylaxis on the incidence, nature, and duration of bacteremia from nasotracheal intubation and dental procedures in children.

Methods and Results

Children were randomly assigned before surgery to the American Heart Association (AHA)-recommended dose of amoxicillin or to a placebo. Aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures were drawn at 8 specific time points after intubation, dental restorative and cleaning procedures, and before, during, and after dental extraction(s), to include blood drawings up to 45 minutes after the last extraction. Aerobic and anaerobic blood culture results were used to determine the incidence, nature, and duration of bacteremia from these procedures. For the 100 children enrolled (mean age, 3.5 years), the overall incidence of positive blood cultures, defined as at least 1 positive culture of the 8, was significantly higher in the placebo (84%) than the amoxicillin group (33%) (P < 0.0001). Bacteremia occurrence rates after intubation and after dental restorations and cleaning were 18% and 20% in the placebo group and 4% and 6% in the amoxicillin group (P = 0.05 and P = 0.07, respectively). At 1.5 minutes after the initiation of dental extractions, bacteremia occurred in 76% of the placebo group versus 15% of the amoxicillin group (P < 0.001). The majority of the 152 positive cultures and of the 29 different bacteria identified were Gram-positive cocci. Bacteremia persisted longer in the placebo group.

Conclusions

Bacteremia from these procedures occurs more often, from a wider variety of bacterial species, and for a longer duration after dental extractions than previously reported in any age group. Amoxicillin has a significant impact on the incidence, nature, and duration of bacteremia after nasal intubation, dental restorative and cleaning procedures, and dental extractions.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^1141hHsg]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

There is the concern that the period of follow-up was not long enough. However, in over 90% of cases the incubation period for infective endocarditis is less than six weeks, and other studies have used three months as the cut off for capturing all cases of infective endocarditis that will develop after exposure to the risk of infection. We therefore believe that if antibiotic prophylaxis was effective in preventing infective endocarditis the large decrease in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis that occurred after the introduction of the NICE guideline would have resulted in a detectable increase in cases during the 25 months of the study. Any such change should have been particularly noticeable among those cases where the causal organism was of possible oral streptococcal origin. Regardless, we intend to periodically monitor the rate of endocarditis in the English population over time.

The 78.6% decrease in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis in the months after the introduction of the guideline was large and suggests much better compliance than is often seen after policy changes in medicine. Compliance was particularly good among dentists who, as well as being strongly urged to adopt the new guidelines by the chief dental officer, NICE, and the dental press, were advised by the malpractice insurance organisations that it would be difficult to defend cases where the new guidelines had not been followed. A residual level of prescribing does, however, seem to persist at around 20% of the level before the guideline. There are several possible explanations for this. Firstly, the guideline allows antibiotic prophylaxis to be prescribed to patients who have previously received it and insist on continuing to have it, even after the rationale for the change in policy has been fully explained. Secondly, anecdotal evidence suggests that some cardiologists are pressurising dentists or, where dentists refuse to prescribe, the patient's general medical practitioner to provide antibiotic prophylaxis for patients they regard at particularly high risk of infective endocarditis, such as patients with significant congenital heart lesions, prosthetic heart valves, or a history of infective endocarditis. In other words, some clinicians in the United Kingdom may be implementing the European Society for Cardiology or American Heart Association guidelines rather than the NICE guideline. Finally, anecdotal evidence also suggests that a small proportion of dentists in the United Kingdom prescribe a 3 g dose of amoxicillin (or 600 mg dose of clindamycin) to treat acute dental infections. The precise contribution of each of these explanations to the residual 20% prescribing figure is hard to quantify.

### I PREVENT bacterial resistance. An update on the use of antibiotics in dermatologic surgery [^115L4UaJ]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Prophylaxis may be given to prevent a surgical wound infection, infective endocarditis (IE), or infection of a prosthetic joint, but its use before cutaneous surgery is controversial. Our aim was to review the current literature and provide a mnemonic to assist providers in appropriately prescribing prophylactic antibiotics.

Methods and Materials

We reviewed the current literature, including the new guidelines provided by the American Heart Association (AHA).

Results

The new AHA guidelines recommend prophylaxis for patients with high risk of an adverse outcome from IE instead of high risk of developing IE. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons and the American Dental Association also provide guidelines. Given the paucity of conclusive studies, prophylaxis against a surgical wound infection is based more on clinical judgment.

Conclusion

The mnemonic we propose, "I PREVENT", represents: Immunosuppressed patients; patients with a Prosthetic valve; some patients with a joint Replacement; a history of infective Endocarditis; a Valvulopathy in cardiac transplant recipients; Endocrine disorders such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus; Neonatal disorders including unrepaired cyanotic heart disorders (CHDs), repaired CHD with prosthetic material, or repaired CHD with residual defects; and the Tetrad of antibiotics: amoxicillin, cephalexin, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin.

### Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study [^114rJxHb]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Over the past 10 years a general move has been to reduce antibiotic prescribing to save cost and to prevent the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Although this could have played a part in the reduction in prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis, it seems unlikely given the size and suddenness of the reduction, its coincidence with the introduction of the NICE guideline, the low cost of a single dose of amoxicillin or clindamycin, and national prescribing data that show a slight increase in the general prescribing of penicillins and macrolide antibiotics over the same period.

The results of this analysis cover a large group of patients for whom antibiotic prophylaxis was prescribed before the introduction of the NICE guideline. Our results suggest that for most of these patients, including those with a history of rheumatic fever or a heart murmur, there may be little or no benefit in giving antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis. However, because we cannot exclude the possibility that residual antibiotic prophylaxis prescribing targets those perceived to be at highest risk of infective endocarditis, it does not completely tackle the problem of whether a subset of patients, particularly those with prosthetic heart valves or a history of infective endocarditis, might still benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis. To more directly answer this question a carefully designed, randomised, placebo controlled trial of antibiotic prophylaxis in these patients would be required.

Interpretation of the findings

Given that oral viridians group streptococci are clearly implicated in some cases of infective endocarditis, our findings provide support for the growing view that the frequent episodes of bacteraemia that follow daily routines such as eating and tooth brushing may be a greater risk factor for the development of infective endocarditis than the transient bacteraemia that follows an invasive dental procedure. Furthermore, the evidence that the bacteraemia after tooth brushing is significantly greater and more common in patients with poor oral hygiene and gingival diseasesuggests that improving oral hygiene might be more effective at reducing the number of cases caused by oral bacteria than providing antibiotic prophylaxis for invasive dental procedures.

### Should prophylactic antibiotics be used for patients having removal of erupted teeth? [^114qZXLk]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Generally, antibiotics should not be required before the removal of erupted carious or periodontally involved teeth unless a significant risk of postoperative infection is present. The decision to use prophylactic antibiotics in noninfected cases should also be based on whether patients have any significant medical risk factors that could adversely affect their humoral and cellular defense mechanisms, and whether any systemic risks are associated with the bacteremia that accompanies tooth extraction. This article discusses the various indications for using prophylactic antibiotics in patients having erupted teeth extracted based on a consideration of these factors.

Table 3.
Multivariable Analysis of Factors Associated With Unnecessary Antibiotic Prophylaxis Among 168 420 Dental Visits

Abbreviations: ADA, American Dental Association; ED, emergency department; PCP, primary care provider.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess whether our findings were robust to assumptions of selection criteria within a plausible range. In the event that medical coding missed a cardiac condition diagnosis, we limited our cohort to those patients continuously enrolled in the medical plan from 2009 until the date of the visit. In this continuous enrollment analysis, 60.1% (n = 101 231) of the cohort were included, and 80.2% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions were defined as unnecessary. The 2003 guidelines for the prevention of prosthetic joint infections also changed during our study period (updated guidelines were published in 2013 [released online in 2012]) (Table 1). The results were similar after modifying our definition of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis with recommendations in the 2003 prosthetic joint infection guidelines(75.7% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions were unnecessary overall [76.7% in 2011–2013 and 74.1% in 2014–2015]). The highest-risk period of a prosthetic joint infection after joint implant placement is 2 years. After including prosthetic joint placement within 2 years in our definition of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, 80.9% of antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental visits were unnecessary. A subanalysis of the cohort with visits clustered into episodes of care (n = 13 825), 82.7% of patients at the first visit, 84.6% at the second visit, and 84.3% at the third visit received unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis. Stratifying the overall cohort by the presence or absence of a prosthetic joint, 11.2% of patients with a prosthetic joint received appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis secondary to a concomitant cardiac condition (n = 71 651). After excluding those with a prosthetic joint, the percentage of visits with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased to 75.0% (n = 96 769). Similar characteristics were found to be associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis as identified in the full analysis (eTables 1, 2, and 3 in the Supplement).

American Heart Association antibiotic regimens — general principles for dental prophylaxis specify that an antibiotic for prophylaxis should be administered in a single dose before the procedure; if the preprocedural dose is inadvertently not given, the dosage may be administered up to two hours after the procedure, and administration after the procedure should be considered only when the patient did not receive the preprocedural dose. When fever or other manifestations of systemic infection are present, it is important to obtain blood cultures and other relevant tests before administration of antibiotics intended to prevent infective endocarditis.

### Interventions for replacing missing teeth: antibiotics at dental implant placement to prevent complications [^11374GSp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Some dental implant failures may be due to bacterial contamination at implant insertion. Infections around biomaterials are difficult to treat, and almost all infected implants have to be removed. In general, antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery is only indicated for patients at risk of infectious endocarditis; with reduced host-response; when surgery is performed in infected sites; in cases of extensive and prolonged surgical interventions; and when large foreign materials are implanted. A variety of prophylactic systemic antibiotic regimens have been suggested to minimise infections after dental implant placement. More recent protocols recommended short-term prophylaxis, if antibiotics have to be used. Adverse events may occur with the administration of antibiotics, and can range from diarrhoea to life-threatening allergic reactions. Another major concern associated with the widespread use of antibiotics is the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The use of prophylactic antibiotics in implant dentistry is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial or harmful effects of systemic prophylactic antibiotics at dental implant placement versus no antibiotic or placebo administration and, if antibiotics are beneficial, to determine which type, dosage and duration is the most effective.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 17 June 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 17 June 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 17 June 2013). There were no language or date restrictions placed on the searches of the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) with a follow-up of at least three months, that compared the administration of various prophylactic antibiotic regimens versus no antibiotics to people undergoing dental implant placement. Outcome measures included prosthesis failures, implant failures, postoperative infections and adverse events (gastrointestinal, hypersensitivity, etc).

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the risk of bias of the trials and data extraction were conducted in duplicate and independently by two review authors. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RRs) using a random-effects model for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity, including both clinical and methodological factors, was to be investigated.

Main Results

Six RCTs with 1162 participants were included: three trials compared 2 g of preoperative amoxicillin versus placebo (927 participants), one compared 3 g of preoperative amoxicillin versus placebo (55 participants), one compared 1 g of preoperative amoxicillin plus 500 mg four times a day for two days versus no antibiotics (80 participants), and one compared four groups: (1) 2 g of preoperative amoxicillin; (2) 2 g of preoperative amoxicillin plus 1 g twice a day for seven days; (3) 1 g of postoperative amoxicillin twice a day for seven days, and (4) no antibiotics (100 participants). The overall body of evidence was considered to be of moderate quality. The meta-analyses of the six trials showed a statistically significant higher number of participants experiencing implant failures in the group not receiving antibiotics (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.67, P value 0.002, heterogeneity: Tau(2) 0.00; Chi(2) 2.87, df = 5 (P value 0.57); I(2) 0%). The number needed to treat for one additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) to prevent one person having an implant failure is 25 (95% CI 14 to 100), based on an implant failure rate of 6% in participants not receiving antibiotics. There was borderline statistical significance for prosthesis failures (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00), with no statistically significant differences for infections (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.35), or adverse events (RR 1; 95% CI 0.06 to 15.85) (only two minor adverse events were recorded, one in the placebo group). No conclusive information can be derived from the only trial that compared three different durations of antibiotic prophylaxis since no event (implant/prosthesis failures, infections or adverse events) occurred in any of the 25 participants included in each study group. There were no trials that evaluated different antibiotics or different antibiotic dosages.

Authors' Conclusions

Scientific evidence suggests that, in general, antibiotics are beneficial for reducing failure of dental implants placed in ordinary conditions. Specifically 2 g or 3 g of amoxicillin given orally, as a single administration, one hour preoperatively significantly reduces failure of dental implants. No significant adverse events were reported. It might be sensible to suggest the use of a single dose of 2 g prophylactic amoxicillin prior to dental implant placement. It is still unknown whether postoperative antibiotics are beneficial, and which antibiotic is the most effective.
