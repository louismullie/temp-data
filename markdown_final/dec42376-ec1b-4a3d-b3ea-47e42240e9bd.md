## Question

cocaine induced angina

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage cocaine-induced angina or chest pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology that distinguishes cocaine-associated chest pain from atherosclerotic ACS. Then, I should verify the initial assessment priorities, including history, ECG, and biomarkers. Next, I will review first-line pharmacologic management and the beta-blocker controversy. After that, I need to check indications for invasive strategies and special considerations like sodium channel blockade and hypertensive emergencies. Finally, I will consider disposition, secondary prevention, and long-term management, including addiction treatment and cardiomyopathy care, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't anchor on atherosclerotic mechanisms. Cocaine increases myocardial oxygen demand via sympathetic stimulation while simultaneously decreasing supply through potent coronary vasospasm, platelet activation, and thrombus formation; it also has sodium channel–blocking effects that can precipitate conduction abnormalities and malignant arrhythmias, which together explain ischemia even in structurally normal coronaries and the risk of delayed ischemia after use [^112hCTtZ] [^113sH5cL] [^116sfBQ2] [^117LxkLW].

> Wait, let me verify the initial assessment priorities. I need to ask explicitly about timing and route of cocaine use because patients often underreport. Urine toxicology is typically positive within 1–4 hours and can remain positive for 2–4 days, so a negative test does not exclude very recent use, and I should maintain a high index of suspicion in young patients with chest pain or hyperadrenergic states [^11764TxU] [^1111pPSc] [^117PvQVC]. I should obtain a 12-lead ECG and serial high-sensitivity troponins, recognizing that cocaine-associated ischemia can be transient and ECG/troponin may be initially nondiagnostic, and I must also consider alternative etiologies such as aortic dissection, pneumothorax, myocarditis, and pulmonary embolism in the differential [^115JPCFA] [^112TNRnP] [^112hCTtZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about analgesia. I initially thought morphine might be contraindicated due to vagal effects, but wait, I should double-check the evidence. While older teaching cautioned against opioids, contemporary guidance emphasizes that nitrates and opioids can be used thoughtfully for pain control in suspected ACS, with the caveat that rapid coronary revascularization should be pursued if ischemia persists despite nitrates, so I should titrate nitrates and consider opioids for refractory pain while monitoring hemodynamics rather than withhold them outright [^112VwZwq]. I need to ensure I also treat the hyperadrenergic state with benzodiazepines, which reduce sympathetic drive and can improve ischemia; lorazepam combined with nitroglycerin provides superior pain relief compared with nitroglycerin alone in cocaine-associated chest pain, and benzodiazepines are first-line for stimulant intoxication with cardiovascular symptoms [^114j1z7j] [^116K7pve] [^111Wph89].

> I will now examine the beta-blocker controversy carefully. Traditional teaching warns against unopposed alpha stimulation with pure beta-1 blockade in acute cocaine intoxication, and ACC/AHA NSTE-ACS guidance advises avoiding beta-blockers in patients with recent cocaine use and signs of intoxication unless adequate vasodilator therapy is in place, which I should respect in the acute setting [^111VnEmS] [^111PFkLv] [^1169n5TJ]. But wait, what if the evidence has evolved; observational studies and meta-analyses have not shown increased MI or mortality with beta-blocker use in cocaine-associated chest pain, suggesting the risk may be lower than historically feared, though confounding by indication remains a limitation, so I should individualize decisions and, if beta-blockade is chosen, prefer agents with alpha-1 antagonism such as labetalol or carvedilol and ensure concurrent vasodilation to mitigate vasospasm risk [^113dJQFo] [^112negw3] [^1163DpLa] [^111Se8kD] [^11193Xw5] [^112jdMS3].

> Next, I should review vasodilator therapy because vasospasm is central here. Nitrates are first-line for suspected vasospastic angina in cocaine-associated presentations and should be titrated to relieve pain while monitoring blood pressure; calcium channel blockers, particularly dihydropyridines, are also recommended for vasospastic angina and can be added if symptoms persist or recur, aligning with both ACC/AHA and ESC guidance on vasospastic angina management [^113abVGv] [^115xH9CC] [^111QtZor]. If there is refractory vasospasm or hypertensive crisis features, I should consider alpha-blockade with phentolamine as a targeted vasodilator, recognizing the evidence base is limited but case-based support exists for its utility in cocaine-associated vasospasm [^115QoxCv].

> Let me consider antithrombotic therapy and invasive strategies. I should administer aspirin unless contraindicated, and if ACS is confirmed or strongly suspected, manage anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy per standard ACS protocols, with early invasive angiography for ongoing ischemia, dynamic ST changes, or positive troponins. However, I need to ensure I distinguish vasospasm from fixed disease because cocaine-related ACS often reflects spasm or thrombus superimposed on minimal atherosclerosis, and stent thrombosis risk is higher in active users, so if PCI is required, bare-metal stents and a plan for adherence support may be preferable to mitigate very late stent thrombosis risk [^112HjJid] [^116inYbF] [^114QZCd9]. But wait, I should verify reperfusion choices; fibrinolysis is generally avoided when primary PCI is available due to diagnostic uncertainty and bleeding risk, and mechanical strategies like thrombectomy can be considered when thrombus predominates, as illustrated in case series of cocaine-related left main thrombosis managed surgically when anatomy and instability warrant it [^116dHQzS] [^117SQRuY] [^114m3Uii].

> I need to check for sodium channel blockade and conduction abnormalities. Cocaine can widen the QRS and impair contractility. If QRS is greater than 100 ms with hemodynamic compromise, I should administer sodium bicarbonate to overcome sodium channel blockade and correct acidosis, while monitoring for arrhythmias and using standard ACLS protocols for malignant ventricular rhythms, keeping in mind the proarrhythmic potential of cocaine and the need to address ischemia and electrolyte disturbances concurrently [^1118vAsA] [^116sfBQ2] [^111DVS1a].

> Now, I should review hypertensive emergencies and hemodynamic management. Short-acting agents such as sodium nitroprusside, phentolamine, or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred to avoid abrupt hemodynamic collapse; I should avoid long-acting antihypertensives in the acute intoxication window and ensure close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate as benzodiazepines and vasodilators take effect [^1112Hjf6] [^113VEtM1].

> Let me think about disposition and risk stratification. Many patients with cocaine-associated chest pain are low to intermediate risk, with ACS frequency under 10% in most studies and very low short-term event rates after observation protocols. A negative coronary CTA in carefully selected low-risk patients can identify a cohort safe for early discharge with close follow-up, though I should confirm that ECG and biomarkers are reassuring and that the patient has reliable follow-up and addiction support in place [^117PvQVC] [^1111pPSc] [^1162hXPX] [^115nDaHG]. I should double-check that I am not underestimating risk in those with persistent symptoms, dynamic ECG changes, or positive biomarkers, who warrant admission and invasive evaluation per standard ACS pathways [^115JPCFA].

> Next, I should review secondary prevention and long-term management. Abstinence from cocaine and other cardiotoxins is foundational. Once sustained abstinence is demonstrated, standard guideline-directed therapy for LV dysfunction, including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and statins, is appropriate, and in patients at risk for relapse, nonselective beta-blockers with alpha-1 antagonism such as carvedilol may mitigate unopposed alpha effects and are reasonable choices for cardiomyopathy management after detoxification [^112VPmwf] [^1166y9TU] [^114zvN8r] [^116EQEZb] [^115pzFEG]. I need to ensure referral to addiction treatment and consider that structured observation or residential programs can support recovery and reduce recidivism, which in turn improves cardiovascular outcomes [^112TNRnP].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of screening and systems issues. Because cocaine use is frequently underrecognized in ED chest pain evaluations, routine inquiry and selective urine testing can improve identification and guide appropriate management. National registries show that cocaine-positive ACS patients are younger, have fewer traditional risk factors, and often present with STEMI, yet adjusted mortality is similar, underscoring the importance of guideline-concordant care with attention to the unique risks of vasospasm and thrombosis in this population [^112hCTtZ] [^1135kZRs] [^112p92u3].

> To synthesize a practical approach, I will treat suspected cocaine-associated angina as vasospastic ischemia superimposed on a hyperadrenergic state: give benzodiazepines for sympathetic tone, nitrates and calcium channel blockers for vasospasm, aspirin for antiplatelet effect, avoid unopposed beta-1 blockade in acute intoxication, and escalate to invasive evaluation when ischemia persists or biomarkers/ECG indicate ACS. Throughout, I will monitor for arrhythmias, QRS widening, and hypertensive emergencies, and I will plan for addiction treatment and long-term cardioprotective therapy once abstinence is established, aligning each step with contemporary guidelines and the best available evidence [^111VnEmS] [^116K7pve] [^111Wph89].

Cocaine-induced angina is chest pain due to **coronary vasospasm** [^113sH5cL], increased myocardial oxygen demand, and thrombosis from cocaine use [^112hCTtZ]. It is common in young adults and can occur even without underlying coronary disease [^112J1RBc] [^1135kZRs]. Immediate management includes **benzodiazepines, nitrates, and calcium channel blockers** [^116K7pve] [^113abVGv]; avoid beta-blockers unless combined with alpha-blockade due to risk of unopposed alpha stimulation [^111PFkLv] [^111Wph89]. Evaluate for acute coronary syndrome with ECG and troponins [^115JPCFA] [^114og56J], and use coronary angiography if indicated [^115JPCFA]. Most patients have a favorable short-term prognosis, but recurrence is common without abstinence and addiction treatment [^115nDaHG].

---

## Pathophysiology

Cocaine-induced angina results from **interrelated mechanisms**:

- **Coronary vasospasm**: Cocaine blocks norepinephrine reuptake, causing alpha-adrenergic–mediated vasoconstriction and reduced coronary blood flow [^112hCTtZ] [^111Se8kD].

- **Increased myocardial oxygen demand**: Sympathetic stimulation increases heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility, raising oxygen demand [^113sH5cL].

- **Thrombosis**: Cocaine activates platelets and promotes thrombus formation, further reducing perfusion [^11762SGU].

- **Delayed vasoconstriction**: Metabolites can cause prolonged vasoconstriction, explaining delayed or recurrent ischemia [^11469XQB].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with:

- **Chest pain**: Retrosternal, pressure-like, often radiating to the arm, neck, or jaw [^116orube].

- **Associated symptoms**: Dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, palpitations, anxiety.

- **Timing**: Pain may occur immediately or hours after use due to delayed vasoconstriction [^117LxkLW].

- **Demographics**: Young adults, often male, with or without coronary artery disease [^112J1RBc] [^112HjJid].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential:

| **Diagnostic modality** | **Role in evaluation** |
|-|-|
| ECG | Identify ischemia, infarction, arrhythmias; may be normal or nonspecific initially [^112hCTtZ] [^1162hXPX] |
| Cardiac biomarkers (troponin, CK-MB) | Detect myocardial injury; may be elevated in cocaine-induced MI [^114og56J] [^117Angnk] |
| Coronary angiography | - Define coronary anatomy <br/> - Identify vasospasm <br/> - Thrombus <br/> - Or fixed lesions [^111AGMUx] [^117SQRuY] |
| Toxicology screening | Confirm cocaine use; urine positive for 1–4 hours, up to 2–4 days [^117PvQVC] |

---

## Management

### Acute management

- **Benzodiazepines**: First-line to reduce sympathetic tone, heart rate, blood pressure, and vasospasm [^116K7pve] [^111Wph89].

- **Nitrates**: Relieve vasospasm and ischemic pain [^115xH9CC].

- **Calcium channel blockers**: Treat and prevent vasospasm; preferred over beta-blockers acutely [^113abVGv].

- **Avoid beta-blockers**: Risk of unopposed alpha stimulation and worsening vasospasm; if used, combine with alpha-blockade (e.g. labetalol) [^111PFkLv] [^11193Xw5].

- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Aspirin indicated if ACS suspected [^116dHQzS].

- **Coronary angiography**: Perform if persistent ischemia, STEMI, or high-risk features [^112HjJid].

---

### Long-term management

Long-term management focuses on **abstinence** [^112VPmwf] and addiction treatment, along with risk-factor modification and cardioprotective therapy. Beta-blockers can be considered only after confirmed abstinence and ideally with alpha-blockade [^114zvN8r]. Regular follow-up is needed to monitor for recurrence and complications [^112TNRnP].

---

## Prognosis

Short-term outcomes are **generally favorable** with appropriate management, though recurrence is common without abstinence [^115nDaHG]. Long-term outcomes hinge on sustained abstinence and risk-factor control; continued use increases risks of MI, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmias [^113sH5cL] [^116uB5s2].

---

## Preventive strategies

Prevention centers on **education** on the cardiovascular risks of cocaine and structured addiction treatment with counseling and support [^1146a5LH]. Routine screening for cocaine use in patients with chest pain can improve detection and guide management [^112hCTtZ] [^1135kZRs].

---

Cocaine-induced angina is a vasospastic, high-demand ischemic syndrome; **early benzodiazepines, nitrates, and calcium channel blockers** are key, with beta-blockers avoided acutely unless combined with alpha-blockade. Outcomes depend on prompt care and sustained abstinence.

Drug Use

An important risk factor for AMI in young adults is illicit drug abuse, which is associated with a poor prognosis. For this reason, a detailed history of illicit drug use is a necessary part of assessment of a young individual with an AMI. The most implicated substances are stimulants such as cocaine, amphetamines, and 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy). Mechanisms that lead to cardiac complications with these drugs typically involve vessel damage, prothrombotic effects and direct myocardial injury. In contrast, cocaine may increase myocardial oxygen demand because of increase in blood pressure and heart rate, while also promoting platelet activationor coronary vasospasm, resulting in acute myocardial ischemia. The exact pathophysiological mechanism of AMI following amphetamine use is not well understood but likely because of a combination of coronary vasospasm, intracoronary thrombus formation, and increased myocardial oxygen demand. Management of AMI secondary to amphetamine and cocaine abuse is not clearly defined but includes calcium channel blockers for treatment of suspected coronary vasospasm or thrombolytics/anticoagulants for coronary thrombi. Selective beta‐1 adrenergic receptor blockade is generally avoided until the absence of illicit drug use is confirmed as it may exacerbate coronary vasospasm via unopposed alpha adrenergic agonism. The incidence of cocaine‐induced AMI has been reported as high as 25% among AMI patients aged 18 to 45 years, particularly in those with other cardiac risk factors. When there is clear thrombus, plaque disruption, or occlusive disease the treatment of ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction in patients with recent substance use within 6 hours of onset of chest pain follows standard protocol with immediate PCI or thrombolytic therapy if PCI is not available.

### Cocaine-induced very late stent thrombosis [^114QZCd9]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Cocaine misuse is a known cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Management of these patients has always been a challenge due to medication compliance and eventual risk of stent thrombosis. However, even cocaine misusers who are compliant with dual antiplatelet therapy have been reported to have stent thrombosis. All cases of cocaine-induced stent thrombosis reported in the literature have occurred within first year of stent placement (acute, subacute or late). We report a first case of very late stent thrombosis in a 54-year-old active cocaine misuser who presented with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, which was successfully managed with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. A review of all the reported cases of cocaine-induced stent thrombosis is also discussed. Given the high mortality associated with stent thrombosis, treatment option for cocaine misusers presenting with ACS should be conservative when possible. If percutaneous coronary intervention is needed, bare metal stent should be preferred.

### Transient cocaine-induced chest pain: a case series [^114WBcHz]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Acute chest pain and myocardial infarction are frequent complications of cocaine use. Indeed, these represent 40% of emergency department visits associated with cocaine use and 2% to 7% of all patients attending the emergency department for chest pain. Nevertheless, the prevalence of past cocaine-associated chest pain has never been evaluated in an outpatient facility for addiction. Our objective was to assess lifetime episodes of cocaine-associated chest pain in current cocaine users in an outpatient facility.

Methods

Fifty consecutive, nonselected current cocaine users were retrospectively evaluated with a standardized interview and a medical assessment. The patients and the pain characteristics are described, and clinical and biological factors associated with experiencing cocaine-associated chest pain are studied with univariate and logistic regressions analyses.

Results

Twenty-six subjects (52%) reported a history of chest pain associated with cocaine use. This pain was frequently described as oppressive (28%) and located in the retrosternal area (61.5%). The mean (± SD) time between cocaine use and the occurrence of the pain was 8 (± 8) minutes and the mean duration was 22 (± 236) minutes. Subjects who reported cocaine-associated chest pain reported an average of 12 (± 7) distinct episodes. Patients describing chest pain could be predicted with one independent factor in our sample: age of onset of cocaine use (P = 0.042).

Conclusions

Transient cocaine-associated chest pains are frequent in current cocaine users attending specialized addiction facilities. Cardiological explorations and monitoring and risk-reduction interventions need to be provided to this specific population.

### Hospital admissions for chest pain associated with cocaine use in the United States [^1113nmCf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The outcomes related to chest pain associated with cocaine use and its burden on the healthcare system are not well studied.

Methods

Data were collected from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2001–2012). Subjects were identified by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Primary outcome was a composite of mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac arrest.

Results

We identified 363,143 admissions for cocaine-induced chest pain. Mean age was 44.9 (± 21.1) years with male predominance. Left heart catheterizations were performed in 6.7%, whereas the frequency of acute myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary interventions were 0.69% and 0.22%, respectively. The in-hospital mortality was 0.09%, and the primary outcome occurred in 1.19% of patients. Statistically significant predictors of primary outcome included female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; confidence interval [CI] 1.00–1.35; p = 0.046), age > 50 years (OR, 1.24, CI, 1.07–1.43; p = 0.004), history of heart failure (OR, 1.63, CI, 1.37–1.93; P < .001), supraventricular tachycardia (OR, 2.94, CI, 1.34–6.42; p = 0.007), endocarditis (OR, 3.5, CI, 1.50–8.18, P = 0.004), tobacco use (OR, 1.3, CI, 1.13–1.49; P < .001), dyslipidemia (OR, 1.5, CI, 1.29–1.77; P < .001), coronary artery disease (OR, 2.37, CI, 2.03–2.76; P < .001), and renal failure (OR, 1.27, CI, 1.08–1.50; p = 0.005). The total annual projected economic burden ranged from $155 to $226 million with a cumulative accruement of more than $2 billion over a decade.

Conclusion

Hospital admissions due to chest pain and concomitant cocaine use are associated with low rates of adverse outcomes. For the low-risk cohort in whom acute coronary syndrome has been ruled out, hospitalization may not be beneficial and may result in unnecessary cardiac procedures.

### Prevalence of cocaine use among patients attending the emergency department with chest pain [^1135kZRs]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cocaine is the only drug to show a rise in misuse between 1996 and 2007 in England and Wales. It can cause chest pain and myocardial infarction. This study assessed the prevalence of cocaine use in patients presenting with chest pain, and determined the association between cocaine use and chest pain.

Methods

Patients presenting with chest pain had a urine sample collected at presentation. Each patient with chest pain was matched with a non-chest pain control. Demographic detail, drug history and clinical outcome was recorded, samples anonymised and subsequently tested for cocaine and metabolites.

Results

Of the 1469 patients, 101 (6.9%) tested positive for cocaine compared with 3.8% of controls (p < 0.001). Men (8%) were more likely than women (5.1%) to test positive for cocaine. Two patients developed a myocardial infarction. Cocaine use was highest in those aged 18–30 years for both sexes and decreased with age. Cocaine-positive patients with chest pain were more likely to present in the evening, after midnight or at the weekend. Only 18% of all patients presenting with chest pain had a specific drug history recorded in their notes.

Conclusions

As many patients do not admit to use of an illegal drug, routine testing would enable cocaine-related ischaemic events to be identified more easily but this remains controversial. As management of cocaine-induced chest pain is different from other causes of chest pain, doctors should routinely question patients with chest pain about cocaine use in addition to well recognised risk factors.

### Acute left main coronary artery thrombosis due to cocaine use [^11762SGU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The first relationship between myocardial ischemia or acute coronary syndrome and cocaine use, was reported by Coleman D, et al, in 1982. Many studies have investigated and documented the mentioned relationship concerning its pathophysiology and management. The risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is increased 24-fold during the first hour after cocaine use in patients with normal coronary arteries (CA). According to several studies, most cocaine-abusers with myocardial related complications are young, smokers, nonwhite and male, without other risk factors for atherosclerosis. Therefore, when young patients with no or few risk factors for atherosclerosis, are present with AMI, they should be questioned about cocaine use, and urine plus blood samples should be analyzed for cocaine and its metabolites. Cocaine induces vasoconstriction of epicardial CA in patients with or without coronary artery disease (CAD), combined with an enhanced platelet activation and aggregation, leading in thrombus formation. Of note, in most of the reported cases the affected CA is a distal coronary branch and not the left main coronary artery (LM). We describe herein a LM thrombosis in a young cocaine-abuser, who underwent emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for persistent post-infarction angina and acute heart failure.

### Acute left main coronary artery thrombosis due to cocaine use [^1151n1ya]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

It is common knowledge that cocaine has been linked to the development of various acute and chronic cardiovascular complications including acute coronary syndromes. We present a young, male patient, drug abuser who underwent CABG due to anterolateral myocardial infarction. Our presentation is one of the very rare cases reported in literature regarding acute thrombosis of left main coronary artery related to cocaine use, in a patient with normal coronary arteries, successfully operated. Drug-abusers seem to have increased mortality and morbidity after surgery and high possibility for stent thrombosis after percutaneous coronary interventions, because of their usually terrible medical compliance and coexistent several problems of general health. There are no specific guidelines about treatment of thrombus formation in coronary arteries, as a consequence of cocaine use. So, any decision making concerning the final treatment of these patient is a unique and individualized approach. We strongly recommend that all these patients should be treated surgically, especially patients with thrombus into the left main artery.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^114SRpSS]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease evaluation in long-term or heavy stimulant use — Clinicians should have an elevated degree of suspicion for cardiovascular disease when evaluating patients with long-term or heavy stimulant use, and clinicians should have a lower threshold for conducting cardiac evaluation based on patient history and physical exam results; at this time, the CGC does not recommend that all patients with long-term or heavy stimulant use receive an electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical management remains individualized with strong clinical suspicion of cardiac injury guiding screening, diagnostics, and treatment.

Angina pectoris — symptom pattern and diagnostic caveat: Angina pectoris is perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation to the left arm, neck, or jaw and associated symptoms such as dyspnea, nausea, and lightheadedness. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and a detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

Evaluation of acute chest pain in patients with cocaine and methamphetamine use — In patients presenting with acute chest pain, it is reasonable to consider cocaine and methamphetamine use as a cause of their symptoms (COR 2a; LOE B-NR). Among such patients, the frequency of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is < 10% in most studies and death is rare, a person's urine typically tests positive within 1 to 4 hours and will continue to test positive for 2 to 4 days, and it has been reported that up to 70% of methamphetamine users have an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) with tachycardia the most common finding.

### Cocaine and the heart [^112J1RBc]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The use of cocaine may be associated with either acute or chronic toxicity, and approximately 5% to 10% of emergency department visits in the United States are believed to be secondary to cocaine usage. Chest pain is the most common cocaine-related medical problem, leading to the evaluation of approximately 64,000 patients annually for possible myocardial infarction, of which approximately 57% are admitted to the hospital, resulting in an annual cost greater than $83 million. There is a plethora of cocaine-related cardiovascular complications, including acute myocardial ischemia and infarction, arrhythmias, sudden death, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, aortic ruptures, and endocarditis. There is no evidence to suggest that preexisting vascular disease is a prerequisite for the development of a cocaine-related cardiovascular event, although it may be a potentiating factor, as may be nicotine and alcohol.

### Clinical outcomes after treatment of cocaine-induced chest pain with beta-blockers: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112negw3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent guidelines have suggested avoiding beta-blockers in the setting of cocaine-associated acute coronary syndrome. However, the available evidence is both scarce and conflicted. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the evidence pertaining to the use of beta-blockers in the setting of acute cocaine-related chest pain and its implication on clinical outcomes.

Methods

Electronic databases were systematically searched to identify literature relevant to patients with cocaine-associated chest pain who were treated with or without beta-blockers. We examined the end-points of in-hospital all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for all outcomes using a random-effects model.

Results

Five studies with a total of 1447 patients were included. Our analyses found no differences between patients treated with or without beta-blockers for either myocardial infarction (RR 1.08; 95% CI, 0.61–1.91) or all-cause mortality (RR 0.75; 95% CI, 0.46–1.24). Heterogeneity among included studies was low to moderate.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that beta-blocker use is not associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients presenting with acute chest pain related to cocaine use.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116uB5s2]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Cocaine-related cardiomyopathy — Definition, prevalence, and treatment considerations: Long-term cocaine use has been associated with global dilated cardiomyopathy without the presence of coronary artery disease or segmental infarct pattern; this has been termed cocaine-related cardiomyopathy and implies direct toxicity of cocaine on the myocardium. Depressed left ventricular function has been reported in 4% to 18% of asymptomatic cocaine users without evidence of myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease. Other than abstinence, very little is known about treatment, although there are case reports of reversibility of cardiac function after cessation of drug use. Early reports of unopposed α-effects of β1-adrenergic blocking agents in cocaine-related chest pain resulted in caution against the use of β-blockers in cocaine-related cardiac presentations, and the routine use of propranolol and subsequently all β1-specific blockers was not recommended in the acute setting of cocaine-related acute coronary syndrome. The safety and efficacy of β-blockers in patients with chronic heart failure or cardiomyopathy related to cocaine are unknown, but β-blockers with α-blocking properties such as carvedilol (an α1-, β1-, and β2-receptor antagonist) might not have significant unopposed α-agonism with cocaine and might be beneficial in patients with cocaine-associated cardiomyopathy, especially after declaration of abstinence.

### Coronary computerized tomography angiography for rapid discharge of low-risk patients with cocaine-associated chest pain [^1162hXPX]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with cocaine-associated chest pain are admitted for at least 12 hours and receive a "rule out acute coronary syndrome" protocol, often with noninvasive testing prior to discharge. In patients without cocaine use, coronary computerized tomography angiography (CTA) has been shown to be useful for identifying a group of patients at low risk for cardiac events who can be safely discharged. It is unclear whether a coronary CTA strategy would be efficacious in cocaine-associated chest pain, as coronary vasospasm may account for some of the ischemia. We studied whether a negative coronary CTA in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain could identify a subset safe for discharge.

Methods

We prospectively evaluated the safety of coronary CTA for low-risk patients who presented to the ED with cocaineassociated chest pain (self-reported or positive urine test). Consecutive patients received either immediate coronary CTA in the ED (without serial markers) or underwent coronary CTA after a brief observation period with serial cardiac marker measurements. Patients with negative coronary CTA (maximal stenosis less than 50%) were discharged. The main outcome was 30-day cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction.

Results

A total of 59 patients with cocaine-associated chest pain were evaluated. Patients had a mean age of 45.6 ± 6.6 yrs and were 86% black, 66% male. Seventy-nine percent had a normal or nonspecific ECG and 85% had a TIMI score < 2. Twenty patients received coronary CTA immediately in the ED, 18 of whom were discharged following CTA (90%). Thirty-nine received coronary CTA after a brief observation period, with 37 discharged home following CTA (95%). Six patients had coronary stenosis ≥ 50%. During the 30-day follow-up period, no patients died of a cardiovascular event (0%; 95% CI, 0–6.1%) and no patient sustained a nonfatal myocardial infarction (0%; 95% CI, 0–6.1%).

Conclusions

Although cocaine-associated myocardial ischemia can result from coronary vasoconstriction, patients with cocaine associated chest pain, a non-ischemic ECG, and a TIMI risk score < 2 may be safely discharged from the ED after a negative coronary CTA with a low risk of 30-day adverse events.

### Acute coronary syndromes: mechanisms, challenges, and new opportunities [^113Fw5nY]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Premature acute coronary syndromes: the need for refined risk factor concepts

Historically, ACS typically affected middle-aged, hypercholesterolaemic male smokers with hypertension. However, population ageing coupled with emerging risk factors which young individuals now increasingly encounter (e.g. vaping, oral smokeless tobacco products, marijuana, cocaine) has changed ACS epidemiology: the total numbers of admissions for ACS declined in the USA, while incidence among young patients remained stable. Some one in four patients presenting with ACS are < 55 years old. Among these patients, those without standard modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (SMuRFs; potentially representing patients with underdiagnosed, incompletely controlled, or yet-to-be-identified risk factors) deserve particular focus. Indeed, these patients display lower prescription rates for guideline-directed medical therapy and in some studies are at higher mortality risk, and may benefit from an intensive preventive approach, as proposed by Figtree et al.

### Characteristics, management, and outcomes of cocaine-positive patients with acute coronary syndrome (from the national cardiovascular data registry) [^112p92u3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although cocaine ingestion may cause or contribute to myocardial infarction (MI), few contemporary data are available describing cocaine-associated MI. We describe the characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with MI and recent cocaine use from the Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With The Guidelines (ACTION Registry-GWTG) program. The study population was 102,952 patients enrolled in the American College of Cardiology ACTION Registry-GWTG from July 2008 to March 31, 2010 from 460 sites across the United States. Cocaine exposure was defined as self-reported cocaine use within the last 72 hours or a positive urine test for cocaine. Demographics and medical history, presenting characteristics, treatments, and in-hospital outcomes were reported on a standard case record form. A total of 924 patients (0.9%) were cocaine positive. Compared with cocaine-negative patients, cocaine-positive patients were younger and predominantly men with fewer cardiovascular risk factors. There was a higher percentage of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (46.3% vs 39.7%) and cardiogenic shock at presentation in the cocaine-positive group, but the percentage of multivessel coronary artery disease was lower (53.3% vs 64.5%). Beta blockers within 24 hours (85.8% vs 90.1%, p < 0.0001) and drug-eluting stents (40.1% vs 68.8%, p < 0.0001 in patients with non-STEMI; 27.6% vs 54.6%, p < 0.0001 in patients with STEMI) were used less commonly in cocaine-positive patients. Multivariable-adjusted in-hospital mortality was similar between cocaine-positive and cocaine-negative patients (adjusted odds ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.44, p value = 0.98). In conclusion cocaine-positive patients with acute coronary syndrome are younger with fewer risk factors, multivessel coronary artery disease and lower drug-eluting stent and β-blocker usage. Cocaine use was not associated with in-hospital mortality.

### Cocaine and buerger disease… [^115psmoT]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

A patient with a diagnosis of Buerger disease is described with peripheral limb ischemia and toe amputations, 2 recent small myocardial infarctions, and a long history of cigarette use. Peripheral angiography findings were incompatible with the clinical impression, and further workup revealed heavy recreational use of cocaine. A literature review of the clinical and pathologic manifestations of Buerger disease and of cocaine exposure shows them to have remarkable similarities. Based on our case observation and suggestive evidence from the literature, we propose that cocaine exposure may masquerade as Buerger disease, and further, that unrecognized cocaine exposure may underlie such cases, even including those originally described by Buerger in 1908.

### Safety of β-blockers in the acute management of cocaine-associated chest pain [^117Angnk]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Cocaine is the most commonly abused illegal drug in patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) because of chest pain and accounts for almost 40% of all drug-related visits. It is not known whether all β-blockers (BB) and β1-selective agents or mixed α1/β-adrenergic antagonists (α1/β-BB) are safe in the acute management of cocaine-associated chest pain, due to concerns of unopposed α-receptor activity resulting in coronary artery spasm and hypertensive urgency.

Methods

Patients who presented to the EDs of 2 large inner city hospitals because of chest pain and who tested positive for cocaine were identified by retrospective chart review. Demographic characteristics, symptoms, vital signs, electrocardiographic abnormalities, medication use, comorbidities, and troponin values were documented. The presence and type of BB used were studied in relation to peak elevation in troponin T and troponin I. Troponin elevation was defined as a troponin I greater than 0.6 ng/mL and troponin T greater than 0.1 ng/mL if serum creatinine was less than 2 mg/dL.

Results

A total of 378 patients were included in the study; of these, 78% (n = 296) were black; 12% (n = 44), white; and 10% (n = 38), of other race. Twelve percent (n = 46) of the patients had typical chest pain, 22% (n = 84) had coronary artery disease, 56% (n = 213) had hypertension, and 21% (n = 79) had diabetes mellitus. The admission electrocardiogram showed changes (ST elevation, ST depression, or T-wave inversion) in 43% (n = 163) of the patients. β-Blockers were used in 43% (n = 162) of the encounters. Troponin elevation occurred in 11% (n = 42) of patients. There was no difference in the number of patients with troponin rise in the BB and non-BB groups, 22 of 162 vs 20 of 213 (P = 0.2). There was no difference in mean peak troponin levels in patients with troponin rise who were treated with BB vs no BB, 6.7 vs 5.7 ng/mL (P = 0.6). There was no difference in mean peak troponin levels in patients with troponin rise who were treated with a β1-selective agents vs a α1/β-BB, 7.5 vs 4.1 ng/mL (P = 0.4). No cases of hypertensive urgency were identified after taking any BB.

Conclusion

Troponin rise is not uncommon in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain and occurred in 11% of the patients. In patients with cocaine-associated chest pain, BBs did not appear to change the incidence of troponin rise. β1-Selective BBs did not appear to worsen troponin levels compared with mixed α1/β-BB.

### Assessment of cocaine use in patients with chest pain syndromes… [^112hCTtZ]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

In phase 1 of the study, we reviewed the medical records of all patients with chest pain who presented to the emergency department during February 1996 to assess historical documentation of the presence or absence of cocaine use. In phase 2, we evaluated whether cocaine questions were asked but not documented. After hospital admission, patients were interviewed to see if they were asked about cocaine use. In phase 3, we evaluated possible recall bias by using standardized questioning in the emergency department and used subsequent interviews to assess recall. Assessment of other cardiac risk factors served as the comparison group. Acutely, cocaine increases coronary artery vasoconstriction, myocardial oxygen demand, platelet aggregation, and thrombus formation. 16–28 As a result, cocaine use can result in acute myocardial infarction, even in the absence of underlying coronary artery disease.

16, 17 Long-term users may develop left ventricular hypertrophy29–31 and atherosclerosis, 32–38 possibly placing them at higher risk for future ischemic events. 16, 39. The evidence that cocaine use may result in myocardial ischemia, along with the recognition that the pharmacologic treatment and disposition of patients with myocardial ischemia14, 18, 40–43 may differ depending on whether the patient has recently used cocaine, has led to recommendations by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research44 and the American College of Emergency Physicians45 that patients with chest pain syndromes be questioned about recent cocaine use. The marked increase in recreational cocaine use in the past decade, combined with the recognition that cocaine can induce myocardial ischemia26, 27 and infarction, 12–18, 43, 50, 55 has fundamentally altered the treatment of patients with chest pain.

Patients who have myocardial ischemia secondary to cocaine use are treated differently from patients who have myocardial ischemia unrelated to cocaine use. Recommendations for the treatment of patients with cocaine-associated myocardial ischemia include early use of benzodiazepines, 42, 43, 55 avoidance of β-antagonists, 16, 18, 42, 43 and more cautious use of thrombolytic agents40, 48 and lidocaine. 41 In patients with cocaine-associated chest pain, electrocardiograms, clinical history, and laboratory markers of myocardial infarction appear to be less specific for acute infarction. 14, 18, 46, 47, 56–58. Because the treatment and diagnosis of a patient with symptoms of acute cardiac ischemia may differ based on whether or not that patient has recently used cocaine, it is important to determine whether individual patients have recently used cocaine.

### Characteristics and outcomes of young adults who present to the emergency department with chest pain [^115J1nfg]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Most studies of emergency department (ED) chest pain patients exclude patients < 30–40 years old. As a result, the clinical course of these patients is poorly described.

Objective

To study the clinical characteristics, hospital course, and 30-day outcomes of ED chest pain patients < 40 years old. The hypothesis was that patients < 40 years old without a cardiac history and with normal electro-cardiograms (ECGs) or no cardiac risk factors would be at a < 1% risk for acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) and 30-day adverse cardiovascular (CV) events.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of non-cocaine-using ED patients, 24–39 years old, who received an ECG for chest pain between July 9, 1999, and October 23, 2000. Structured data collection at presentation included demographics, chest pain description, history, laboratory, and ECG data. Hospital course was followed daily. Thirty-day follow-up was performed by telephone. The main outcomes were discharge diagnosis and 30-day adverse CV events [acute myocardial infarction (AMI), death, percutaneous intervention (PCI), or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)].

Results

A total of 487 patients presented 527 times and comprised the study group. Patients were most often 30–39 years old (71%), female (60%), and African-American (73%). Thirty-two percent were admitted. Five hundred seven of 527 patient visits (96%) had 30-day follow-up. Patients had the following cardiac risk factors: tobacco, 37%; hypertension, 22%; family history, 19%; diabetes mellitus, 6%; cholesterol, 6%; prior angina, 3%; known coronary artery disease, 3%; and prior AMI, 2%. Patients usually had unremarkable ECGs (61% normal, 98% nonischemic). Overall, 11 of 527 patients had adverse CV events (2.1%; 95% CI = 0.9% to 3.3%): 8 AMIs (1.5%), 4 deaths (0.8%), 5 PCIs (0.9%), and no CABG. Twenty-five patients had a final diagnosis of ACS (4.7%; 95% CI = 2.9% to 6.5%). The incidence of ACS in the 210 patients without a cardiac history and without cardiac risk factors was 0.5% (95% CI = 0% to 1.4%). At 30 days, none of these 210 patients had AMI, PCI, CABG, or death (0%, 95% CI = 0% to 1.4%). The incidence of ACS in the 312 patients with normal ECGs and a negative cardiac history was 0.3% (95% CI = 0% to 0.9%). At 30 days, there was no AMI, PCI, or CABG in these 312 patients, and one patient with metastatic cancer died (adverse CV event 0.3%, 95% CI = 0% to 0.9%).

Conclusions

Although young patients, as a whole, have a 4.7% risk of ACSs and a 2.1% risk of adverse CV events at 30 days, those without known cardiac disease or any cardiac risk factors had a < 1% risk of ACSs and were free from adverse CV events over 30 days. Likewise, young patients without a cardiac history and with a normal ECG had a < 1% risk of ACSs and adverse CV events at 30 days. It may be reasonable to expedite outpatient management and limit unnecessary admissions in these cohorts.

### Percutaneous interventions in patients with cocaine-associated myocardial infarction: a case series and review [^116dHQzS]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2002). Low credibility.

Cocaine-associated myocardial infarction (CAMI) is a well-reported entity. Most previous reports on CAMI have been limited to conservative care utilizing benzodiazepines, aspirin, nitroglycerin, calcium channel blockers, and thrombolytics. Current guidelines on CAMI advocate immediate use of angiography and angioplasty if available rather than routine administration of thrombolytics. However, based on literature search from 1966 to 2001 (using keywords "cocaine", "myocardial infarction", and "angioplasty"), there have been only two case reports of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with cocaine-associated myocardial infarction. Both were notable for complications either during or immediately after the procedure. We report a series of 10 patients with cocaine-associated myocardial infarction who were treated with percutaneous interventions, which included angioplasty, stenting, and AngioJet mechanical extraction of thrombus. Despite the different arteriopathic process involved, our findings suggest that PCI can be performed safely and with a high degree of procedural success in patients with CAMI.

Chest pain during stimulant intoxication — For patients experiencing chest pain during stimulant intoxication, clinicians should initiate treatment for the underlying intoxication with GABAergic agents (eg, benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, propofol) as long as there are no clinical contraindications (Moderate certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Alternative agents (eg, calcium channel blockers, vasodilators) are generally preferred for management of cardiac ischemia in patients experiencing stimulant intoxication; however, if beta blockers are used in patients with stimulant intoxication, clinicians should consider using a medication with concomitant alpha-1 antagonism (eg, carvedilol, labetalol), and if an unopposed beta blocker was used, clinicians should also consider providing a coronary vasodilator (eg, nitroglycerin, calcium channel blocker); for complex cases, consult with cardiology and/or medical toxicology (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). While treating underlying stimulant intoxication in patients experiencing chest pain, clinicians should concomitantly evaluate for ACS and other causes of acute chest pain in stimulant intoxication, and chest pain that does not fully resolve as signs and symptoms of stimulant intoxication improve should be evaluated and treated following current standards of care (Moderate certainty, Strong Recommendation).

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Control of conditions that may cause cardiac injury — Many therapeutic and recreational agents can exert important cardiotoxic effects, and patients should be strongly advised about the hazards of smoking, as well as the use of alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, and other illicit drugs. Although several epidemiological studies have revealed no correlation between the amount of alcohol ingested and the subsequent development of HF, the Writing Committee strongly believed that any patient with a history of alcohol abuse or with current substantial routine alcohol consumption and new-onset HF without other obvious cause should be counseled to become abstinent, and many HF programs limit alcoholic beverage consumption to no more than 1 alcoholic beverage serving daily for all patients with LV dysfunction, regardless of cause. Treatments for cancer that can injure the heart include ionizing radiation that involves the mediastinum and chemotherapeutic agents such as anthracyclines, immunotherapy such as trastuzumab, or high-dose cyclophosphamide; patients who take trastuzumab in combination with anthracyclines are at particular risk of HF. Use of ephedra, formerly a common ingredient in over-the-counter weight loss preparations, may contribute to the development of HF as well.

The authors sought to validate a clinical decision rule that young adult (younger than 40 years) chest pain patients without known cardiac disease who had either no cardiac risk factors and/or a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) are at low risk (< 1%) for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and 30-day adverse cardiovascular (CV) events.

A prospective cohort study of patients 24–39 years old who received an ECG for chest pain from July 1999 to March 2002 were included. Cocaine users were excluded. Data collection was structured at presentation, hospital course was followed daily, and 30-day follow-up was obtained by telephone. The main outcome was 30-day adverse CV events (death, acute myocardial infarction, percutaneous intervention, and coronary artery bypass graft). Descriptive statistics were used.

Results

Of 4,492 visits for chest pain, 1,023 met criteria. Patients were most often female (61%) and African American (73%). Ninety-eight percent were available for 30-day follow-up. The overall risks of ACS and 30-day adverse CV events were 5.4% and 2.2%, respectively, in our entire cohort. For patients with no cardiac history and no cardiac risk factors, the risk of ACS and 30-day adverse CV events was 1.8%. The risk in patients with no cardiac history and a normal ECG was 1.3%. Patients with no cardiac history, no cardiac risk factors, and a normal ECG had a risk of 1.0%. A modified clinical decision rule found that in young adult patients without a known cardiac history, either no classic cardiac risk factors or a normal ECG, and initially normal cardiac marker studies, the risk of ACS was also extremely low (0.14%) and there were no adverse CV events at 30-day follow-up (95% confidence interval = 0.1% to 0.2%).

Conclusions

A modified clinical decision rule described a group of patients with a 0.14% risk of ACS that was free from 30-day adverse CV events.

Chronic coronary disease diagnostic evaluation — synopsis of testing approach: In patients with CCD, clinicians should first intensify guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and defer testing when feasible; assessing the severity of ischemia may be useful to guide clinical decision-making regarding the use of invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and for intensification of preventive and anti-ischemic therapy; imaging should be considered for new-onset or persistent stable chest pain; and in patients with frequent angina or severe stress-induced ischemia, referral to ICA or coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is an option.

### Cardiovascular consequences of cocaine use [^113sH5cL]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The cardiovascular consequences of cocaine use are numerous and can be severe, with mechanisms of cardiotoxicity unique to cocaine that include sympathomimetic effects, blockade of sodium and potassium channels, oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, and disruption of excitation-contraction coupling. In combination, these effects increase myocardial oxygen demand while simultaneously decreasing oxygen supply. Cocaine-associated chest pain is particularly common and, in some instances, associated with a more severe cardiac syndrome, such as myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, aortic dissection, or endocarditis. Therapy for cocaine-associated chest pain and myocardial infarction is similar to treatment in non-cocaine users, except for differences in the use of benzodiazepines and phentolamine and avoidance of beta-blockers in the acute setting. In this review, we discuss the most up-to-date literature regarding the mechanisms of cocaine-associated cardiotoxicity and clinical consequences, diagnosis, and treatment; we also discuss relevant controversies while proposing several important areas for future research.

### A prospective, randomized, controlled trial of benzodiazepines and nitroglycerine or nitroglycerine alone in the treatment of cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes [^114j1z7j]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present study was to compare the use of lorazepam plus nitroglycerine (NTG) versus NTG alone in the reduction of cocaine induced chest pain in the emergency department. The secondary objective of the study was to help determine the safety of lorazepam in the treatment of cocaine- associated chest pain. The study was a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial conducted at an university-affiliated urban emergency department (ED). All patients who presented with cocaine-associated chest pain were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included age greater than 45 years, documented coronary artery disease, chest pain of more than 72 hours duration, or pretreatment with nitroglycerin. Patients were given either sublingual nitroglycerine (SL NTG) (Group 1) or SL NTG plus 1 mg of lorazepam intravenously (Group 2) every 5 minutes for a total of 2 doses. Chest pain was recorded on an ordinal scale of 0 to 10 at baseline, and then at 5 minutes after each dose. Adverse reactions to medication were also recorded. Twenty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. The average age of these subjects was 34.1 years, and 67% were men. The NTG-only group consisted of 15 patients and the NTG-plus-lorazepam group consisted of 12 patients. Baseline mean chest-pain scores were 6.87 in Group 1 and 6.54 in Group 2, with no differences between groups. Five minutes after initial treatment, mean scores for the two groups were 5.2 and 3.9, respectively, with a difference in means of 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.8–3.8). Five minutes after the second treatment, the mean scores were 4.6 and 1.5, respectively, with a difference in means of 3.1 (95% CI 1.2–5). Kruskal-Wallis testing showed a significant difference in pain relief between the two study groups (P = 0.003), with greater pain relief noted at 5 and 10 minutes in the NTG-plus-lorazepam group (P = 0.02 and P = 0.005, respectively). All patients in the study were admitted to the hospital, but no patient in either group had an acute myocardial infarction or cardiac complications in the ED. No adverse side effects were noted for either group. The early use of lorazepam with NTG was more efficacious than NTG alone, and appears to be safe in relieving cocaine-associated chest pain.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether nitrates are better than benzodiazepines in the treatment of cocaine induced chest pain. Seven citations were reviewed of which two answered the three part question. The clinical bottom line is that in patients with cocaine induced chest pain it appears that nitrates or benzodiazepines are effective in combination or alone in resolving chest pain and improving cardiac performance. We recommend that the agent of choice may be influenced by the presence or absence of concurrent CNS symptoms.

Comprehensive assessment recommendations — stimulant intoxication and withdrawal are primarily diagnosed based on the patient history and physical examination, as well as findings from any clinical, diagnostic, and/or toxicology testing (Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation). If some elements of the medical workup are not available in given a setting, the results from a basic assessment of vital signs and focused mental status evaluation should be used to determine the urgency of further medical evaluation or referral for more comprehensive medical evaluation (Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinical testing should be based on presenting signs and symptoms and should include a CBC, a CMP, LFTs, markers for muscle breakdown (eg, CK, lactate [in cases of muscle breakdown and acidosis]) or cardiac injury (eg, CK, troponin; Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation). When analyzing CBC results for patients with cocaine intoxication or withdrawal, clinicians should be alert to neutrophil levels, as levamisole is a common adulterant in the cocaine supply and can cause immunosuppression — in particular, neutropenia — and small vessel vasculitis (Clinical consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

### Cocaine-induced pseudo-wellens' syndrome: a wellens' phenocopy [^113YMFNk]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Wellens' syndrome represents critical occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Electrocardiographic changes similar to Wellens' wave are not exceptional to acute coronary occlusion and can also be seen in cardiac and non-cardiac conditions, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, persistent juvenile T wave, bundle branch blocks, cerebral haemorrhage, pulmonary oedema, pulmonary embolism, pheochromocytoma, Takotsubo syndrome, digitalis and cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm. Cocaine-induced pseudo-Wellens' syndrome should be considered as one of the differentials, since cocaine is used frequently by young adults and can cause left anterior descending coronary vasospasm mimicking Wellens' syndrome. Initiation of the beta-blocking agent in pseudo-Wellens' syndrome as a part of acute coronary syndrome management can be disastrous. We illustrated a case of cocaine-induced pseudo-Wellens' syndrome presented with typical chest pain associated with Wellenoid ECG.

### Acute left main coronary artery thrombosis due to cocaine use [^117SQRuY]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 28-year-old man smoker and substance abuser (cocaine and circumstantial intravenous heroin) for the last 8 years, without known familiar history for CAD, presented to a local hospital with an antero-lateral ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (Figure 1A), associated with a low cardiac output syndrome. Heart ultrasound revealed severe hypokinesia of anterolatelar wall with ejection fraction of 30%. The patient was given immediately thrombolysis with tenecteplase (Metalyse) and his symptoms and ECG changes almost resolved. Few hours later he was transferred to our hospital for urgent catheterization due to recurrent ischemia and hemodynamic instability. At his admission the patient suffered from AMI complicated with cardiogenic shock and symptoms of congestive heart failure. Chest x-ray examination showed mild cardiomegaly, diffuse pulmonary congestion and perihilar infiltrates with the classic butterfly pattern, and Kerley B lines (Figure 1B). He was supported medically by combination of dobutamine, dopamine and furosemide. Coronary angiography revealed a huge thrombus formation of LM and suspicion of mobile parts to the rest of the left coronary system (Figures 1C, D). He stabilized hemodynamically using an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP), but due to a lot of episodes of angina and no clear-cut guidelines describing the best management approach for patients under this condition we decided to operate him under an estimated risk of 30% according to logistic EURO-score. Urgent CABG by using cardiopulmonary bypass at normothermia (37°C) with continuous warm blood cardioplegia was done. An organized thrombus was found in the opened left anterior descending artery and removed. Finally, the vessel was bypassed by the left internal thoracic artery. In addition, the first obtuse marginal branch was bypassed by a free left radial graft. After a successful bypass weaning, he was transferred in intensive care unit and extubated 12 hours later. The IABP was removed 24 hours later. Inotropes infusion was interrupted at 36 hours and he discharged from the hospital on the 8 th postoperative day in a good condition.

### A prehospital acute coronary syndrome in a cocaine user: an unstable clinical situation [^111AGMUx]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Chest pain is a common reason why cocaine-addicted patients call the emergency department, and acute coronary syndromes are difficult to diagnose in these situations. A 30-year-old cocaine-user patient contacts the Emergency Medical Assistance Service with constrictive chest pain. A doctor is sent out to the patient at home. The initial ECG is normal. No other aetiology of chest pain is revealed, except nicotine and cocaine addictions. First, a coronary artery spasm is suggested, caused by the injection of cocaine. During the journey, the patient indicates that the chest pain has returned. A 12-lead ECG shows repolarisation abnormality in the form of a subepicardial ischaemia. Fibrinolysis is not prescribed in view of the patient's history and of the proximity of the interventional cardiology team. The coronary angiogram enables the diagnosis of myocardial bridging in the middle anterior interventricular artery, and no significant lesion of the coronary arteries is noted. A particular feature of prehospital management in France is that medical care can be given in the early stages by a physician who is called by the patient. This case report discusses the specific care requirements of which the emergency physician needs to be aware in the context of this unstable clinical situation due to the urgency associated with the difficulties of ECG diagnosis of ST-segment elevation in cocaine users.

### Treatment of cocaine cardiovascular toxicity: a systematic review [^113H24q9]. Clinical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cocaine abuse is a major worldwide health problem. Patients with acute cocaine toxicity presenting to the emergency department may require urgent treatment for tachycardia, dysrhythmia, hypertension, and coronary vasospasm, leading to pathological sequelae such as acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and death.

Objective

The objective of this study is to review the current evidence for pharmacological treatment of cardiovascular toxicity resulting from cocaine abuse.

Methods

MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), OpenGrey, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to November 2015. Articles on pharmacological treatment involving human subjects and cocaine were selected and reviewed. Evidence was graded using Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines. Treatment recommendations were compared to current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. Special attention was given to adverse drug events or treatment failure. The search resulted in 2376 articles with 120 eligible involving 2358 human subjects. Benzodiazepines and other GABA-active agents: There were five high-quality (CEBM Level I/II) studies, three retrospective (Level III), and 25 case series/reports (Level IV/V) supporting the use of benzodiazepines and other GABA-active agents in 234 subjects with eight treatment failures. Benzodiazepines may not always effectively mitigate tachycardia, hypertension, and vasospasm from cocaine toxicity. Calcium channel blockers: There were seven Level I/II, one Level III, and seven Level IV/V studies involving 107 subjects and one treatment failure. Calcium channel blockers may decrease hypertension and coronary vasospasm, but not necessarily tachycardia. Nitric oxide-mediated vasodilators: There were six Level I/II, one Level III, and 25 Level IV/V studies conducted in 246 subjects with 11 treatment failures and two adverse drug events. Nitroglycerin may lead to severe hypotension and reflex tachycardia. Alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs: There were two Level I studies and three case reports. Alpha-1 blockers may improve hypertension and vasospasm, but not tachycardia, although evidence is limited. Alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonists: There were two high-quality studies and one case report detailing the successful use of dexmedetomidine. Beta-blockers and β/α-blockers: There were nine Level I/II, seven Level III, and 34 Level IV/V studies of β-blockers, with 1744 subjects, seven adverse drug events, and three treatment failures. No adverse events were reported for use of combined β/α-blockers such as labetalol and carvedilol, which were effective in attenuating both hypertension and tachycardia. Antipsychotics: Seven Level I/II studies, three Level III studies, and seven Level IV/V case series and reports involving 168 subjects have been published. Antipsychotics may improve agitation and psychosis, but with inconsistent reduction in tachycardia and hypertension and risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Other agents: There was only one high level study of morphine, which reversed cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction but increased heart rate. Other agents reviewed included lidocaine, sodium bicarbonate, amiodarone, procainamide, propofol, intravenous lipid emulsion, propofol, and ketamine.

Conclusions

High-quality evidence for pharmacological treatment of cocaine cardiovascular toxicity is limited but can guide acute management of associated tachycardia, dysrhythmia, hypertension, and coronary vasospasm. Future randomized prospective trials are needed to evaluate new agents and further define optimal treatment of cocaine-toxic patients.

### Cocaine use and acute myocardial infarction [^112TNRnP]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Cocaine use in the United States is widespread, affecting more than 30 million Americans. Although many of these persons do not seek healthcare, the overriding cause for hospitalization is cocaine-associated chest pain. Because only a minority of these patients suffer myocardial injury, it is important to exclude even rarer life-threatening causes for chest pain, such as aortic dissection or pneumothorax. Following that, a thorough knowledge of the pathophysiology and existing literature helps to provide cost-effective care, which focuses resources on those patients most likely to suffer complications. Regardless of the severity of complications, referral to cocaine detoxification programs, counseling, social support, and outpatient follow-up care for modification of cardiac risk factors is a fundamental component of long-term patient care.

Regarding medical management for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to management of acute coronary syndrome, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to do not administer β-blockers in patients with acute coronary syndrome with a recent history of cocaine or methamphetamine use demonstrating signs of acute intoxication because of the risk of potentiating coronary spasm.

### Relationship between cocaine use and cardiovascular events… [^111VVqrW]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

to the editor: We would like to express our concern regarding the statement in the American Family Physician article "Diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome" 1 by Dr. Achar and colleagues that patients who use cocaine and subsequently develop chest pain are at a "low risk" for developing an acute cardiovascular event. In their discussion of cocaine-associated chest pain, the authors cite a study that suggests "only" 2 percent of patients with cocaine-associated chest pain had an acute coronary syndrome event. 2 Unfortunately, this study was not only of patients with cocaine-related chest pain, but a subset of a larger study of patients presenting to emergency departments with any cocaine-related complaints. 2 Because this was not a study of only cocaine-related chest pain, we believe the referenced study dilutes the true incidence of ACS associated with cocaine use.

To better determine the rate of ACS associated with cocaine-related chest pain, we cite a prospective study that evaluated 246 patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. 3 Results of this study noted that 5. 7 percent of these patients sustained a myocardial infarction. 3 A review of this topic concluded that these patients should indeed be evaluated for possible myocardial damage.
4. **In reply**: Drs. Joslin and Dachs note an important difference in the incidence of acute coronary syndrome in patients who have chest pain following cocaine use. In the study they cite by Hollander and colleagues "fourteen of 246 patients had myocardial infarction, as diagnosed by elevated CK-MB isoenzyme levels".

Although admission rates of patients with chest pain with or without cocaine exposure were approximately the same, patients with cocaine-induced chest pain or related symptoms were much less likely to have had confirmed unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction.
2. Although these two studies 1, 2 differ on the degree of risk that cocaine-induced chest pain confers for ACS, decisions about hospitalization and treatment should be made based on the same risk factor analysis, examination, electrocardiogram criteria, cardiac markers, and advanced testing that is included in our article. 3.

### Treatment of patients with unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [^112P14SA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Emergency department (ED) management of patients who present with suspected unstable angina (UA) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is especially challenging. Therapies that demonstrate benefit in patients who experience proven disease may not be indicated in patients who present with suspected disease. The emergency practitioner must have a clear understanding of the benefit and harm of each therapy, allowing formulation of a simple approach to treatment selection based on disease presentation. This article reviews current literature and discusses the treatment recommendations from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) for patients who experience UA and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^111DVS1a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — stimulant poisoning/overdose key considerations emphasize that recognition and treatment of hyperthermia (including sedatives to decrease heat production from muscular activity) is essential as many deaths are attributable to hyperthermia. If law enforcement has placed the patient in handcuffs, this patient needs ongoing physical security for safe transport. Have law enforcement in back of ambulance for the handcuffed patient or make sure proper non-handcuff physical management devices are in place before law enforcement leaves and ambulance departs from scene. If patient has signs and symptoms of ACS, consider giving nitroglycerin sublingual (SL) q 3–5 minutes if SBP greater than 100 mmHg and until pain resolves (if range not desired, use q 3 minutes). Vasospasm is often the problem in this case as opposed to a fixed coronary artery lesion, and consider administration of benzodiazepines as if to treat anxiety. Maintaining IV access, cardiac monitor, and SpO2/EtCO2 monitors are key to being able to catch and intervene decompensations in a timely manner. If agitated, consider restraining the patient to facilitate patient assessment and lessen likelihood of vascular access or monitor displacements. Cocaine has sodium channel blocking effects and can cause significant cardiac conduction abnormalities with a widened QRS. Treatment is with sodium bicarbonate similar to a tricyclic antidepressant. Check a 12-lead EKG to assess for these complications.

### Should β-blockers be used in the treatment of cocaine-associated acute coronary syndrome? [^114z35UG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To critically evaluate the 30 year debate of beta-blocker use in cocaine-induced acute coronary syndrome (CIACS).

Data Sources

An Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, and Ovid MEDLINE (1966-August 21, 2007) search of the medical literature was conducted using the key terms cocaine, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, and adrenergic beta-antagonists.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All clinical trials, case reports, national cardiovascular guidelines, and reviews published in English were evaluated. Case reports were included based on whether (1) acute coronary syndrome was suspected, (2) a beta-blocker was used during the treatment course, and (3) objective and subjective patient-specific information was documented.

Data Synthesis

Three case reports and 2 placebo-controlled trials were identified that used 4 beta-blockers (atenolol, labetalol, metoprolol, propranolol). Three national guidelines addressed beta-blocker use. Although published data are limited, propranolol and labetalol exert minimal to no effect on alleviating cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction. None of the evaluated national guidelines recommends beta-blockers as first-line agents in CIACS management.

Conclusion

Beta-blockers should not be considered first-line agents for controlling chest pain in patients with documented CIACS. If long-term beta-blockade is warranted, its benefits should be weighed against recurrent use of cocaine and possible exacerbation of acute coronary syndrome. Given that carvedilol exhibits ancillary pharmacologic proprieties beneficial in CIACS, and post-myocardial infarction mortality data are available regarding its use, this agent could be considered to be appropriate therapy.

### Β-blockers for chest pain associated with recent cocaine use… [^111Se8kD]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion β-Blockers do not appear to be associated with adverse events in patients with chest pain with recent cocaine use. -4 As a sodium channel blocker, cocaine may also be proarrhythmic, potentially resulting in malignant ventricular arrhythmias. 4 Owing to these multiple effects, cocaine may trigger severe hypertension, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and death. 3, 4 Traditional teaching dictates that β-blockers are contraindicated in the setting of cocaine-associated chest pain. Secondary outcomes included peak troponin level in the first 24 hours of admission, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia requiring defibrillation, need for intubation, and need for vasopressor agents. Cardiovascular death as determined by death certificates from the National Death Index was also a secondary outcome.

The systolic blood pressure and electrocardiogram recorded just prior to and just after receipt of a β-blocker was recorded; changes in BP and ECG findings were compared between those receiving β-blockers in the ED and those who only received β-blockers after transfer to the inpatient ward. When available from the index hospitalization or subsequent to the index hospitalization, reports of ECGs, stress tests, and cardiac catheterizations obtained at San Francisco General Hospital were also recorded. The majority of patients received a β-blocker at some point during their hospitalization. This finding persisted after restricting the analysis to those who received β-blockers within the first 6 hours of presentation.

In addition, patients with cocaine-associated chest pain discharged on a β-blocker regimen exhibited a nonsignificant point estimate in favor of decreased overall mortality, and, after adjustment for potential confounders, exhibited a statistically significant 70% reduction in cardiovascular mortality. There are thought to be approximately 2 million cocaine users in the United States, 1 and the drug is estimated to be involved in more than 500 000 ED visits a year. 18 Cocaine is a powerful sympathomimetic drug that works by blocking reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and epinephrine at adrenergic nerve terminals, leading to vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and increased cardiac contractility. 2 Coronary artery thrombus formation following cocaine abuse has been described, 19 and the sodium channel–blocking properties of cocaine increase the risk of dangerous arrhythmias. 4.

Objectives

Beta blockers (β-blockers) remain a standard therapy in the early treatment of acute coronary syndromes. However, β-blocker therapy in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain (CACP) continues to be an area of debate due to the potential risk of unopposed α-adrenergic stimulation and coronary vasospasm. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of available studies to compare outcomes of β-blocker versus no β-blocker use among patients with CACP.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through September 2016 using the keywords 'beta blocker', 'cocaine' and commonly used β-blockers ('atenolol', 'bisoprolol', 'carvedilol', 'esmolol', 'metoprolol' and 'propranolol') to identify studies evaluating β-blocker use among patients with CACP. We specifically focused on studies comparing outcomes between β-blocker versus no β-blocker usage in patients with CACP. Studies without a comparison between β-blocker and no β-blocker use were excluded. Outcomes of interest included non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and all-cause mortality. Quantitative data synthesis was performed using a random-effects model and heterogeneity was assessed using Q and I 2 statistics.

Results

A total of five studies evaluating 1794 subjects were included. Overall, there was no significant difference on MI in patients with CACP on β-blocker versus no β-blocker (OR 1.36, 95%CI 0.68 to 2.75; p = 0.39). Similarly, there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality in patients on β-blocker versus no β-blocker (OR 0.68, 95%CI 0.26 to 1.79; p = 0.43).

Conclusions

In patients presenting with acute chest pain and underlying cocaine, β-blocker use does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of MI or all-cause mortality.

### Acute left main coronary artery thrombosis due to cocaine use [^114m3Uii]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Our presentation is one of the rare cases reported in literature referring in AMI due to thrombosis of LM related to cocaine use, in a young patient with normal CA, successfully operated. Drug-abusers seem to have increased mortality and morbidity because of their usually coexistent several problems of general health. Furthermore, a majority of patients that suffer ST continue cocaine and are noncompliant with medical therapy. Improved handling techniques and postoperative long term dual antiplatelet therapy additionally to special consultation services could reduce the incidence of this terrible event. The lack of specific guidelines about treatment of thrombus formation in CA, especially in LM, a catastrophic consequence of cocaine use, leads to a unique and individualized approach to these patients. The small number of reported cases prevents the development of an evidence-based management, but due to high probability of post PCI ST, as mentioned before, we strongly recommend that all these patients should be treated surgically.

### Cocaine use is associated with an increased risk of stent thrombosis after percutaneous coronary intervention [^116inYbF]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of cocaine-related acute coronary syndromes presents unique challenges. Although percutaneous coronary intervention in cocaine abusers appears to be safe in the short term, longer-term outcomes have not been reported. We postulated that cocaine use would be associated with increased risk for stent thrombosis.

Methods

We report 30-day and 9-month clinical outcomes including stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, and death in 71 cocaine abusers who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention at our institution (66 of whom received a stent) compared with 3216 control patients. Propensity score-matched analysis was performed to control for statistical bias present in nonrandomized study populations.

Results

Stent thrombosis occurred in 5 (7.6%) of the 66 stented cocaine abusers during the 9-month follow-up period compared to a 0.6% rate of stent thrombosis in the control database, a highly statistically significant difference (P < .001). In the propensity analysis, stent thrombosis occurred in 4 stented cocaine abusers and 0 of 70 matched controls (6.2% vs 0%; p = 0.04) throughout the 9-month follow-up period. There was no significant difference in overall rates of myocardial infarction, death, or repeat revascularization at 9 months.

Conclusions

Because of the increased risk of stent thrombosis, consideration should be given to a more conservative approach in cocaine abusers who present with acute coronary syndromes.

### Cocaine-associated chest pain [^117Wguno]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Current estimates establish that more than 30 million people in the United States use cocaine. Cardiovascular complaints commonly occur among patients who present to emergency departments(EDs) after cocaine use, with chest pain the most common complaint in several studies. Although myocardial ischemia and infarction account for only a small percentage of cocaine-associated chest-pain, physicians must understand the pathophysiology of cocaine and appropriate diagnostic and treatment strategies to best manage these patients and minimize adverse outcomes. This article reviews the pharmacology of cocaine, its role in the pathogenesis of chest pain with specific emphasis on inducing myocardial ischemia and infarction, and current diagnostic and management strategies for cocaine-associated chest pain encountered in the ED.

Cocaine use continues to be prevalent among all races and socioeconomic groups in the United States. Patients presenting to emergency departments after cocaine ingestion frequently present with a chief complaint of chest pain. Although acute myocardial infarction is perhaps the most concerning diagnosis in this setting, there are many other potential causes of chest pain after cocaine ingestion. This article reviews the pharmacology of cocaine, as well as the etiologies and treatment of cocaine-associated chest pain, with an emphasis on this drug's range of cardiovascular effects.

### Cocaine-induced cerebral vasoconstriction detected in humans with magnetic resonance angiography… [^11469XQB]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

reporting median cocaine use of 8 lifetime exposures. Intervention. — Double-blind intravenous administration of cocaine or placebo, with cerebral magnetic resonance angiography performed at baseline and 20 minutes following infusion. Main Outcome Measure. — Cocaine-induced angiographic change indicative of vasoconstriction. Conclusions. — Cocaine administration induced dose-related cerebral vasoconstriction on magnetic resonance angiograms. These changes occurred at low cocaine doses and in the absence of other risk factors, including polydrug abuse, hypertension, or cerebrovascular disease. Outcome stratification by prior cocaine use statistically strengthened the relationship between cocaine administration and vasoconstriction. Slight increases in heart rate and systolic and diastolic pressures were observed in the placebo group and were attributed to expectancy effects.

Both cocaine doses elevated heart rate for the duration of the experiment, with peak increases in heart rate, systolic, and diastolic pressures, suggesting that prior cocaine use may have a cumulative effect in promoting angiographic changes indicative of vasoconstriction. The subjective reporting data were analyzed with a repeated-measures ANOVA for the effect of time. Subjects reported. cocaine doses, respectively.

These values and their time course closely parallel those published in a recent report of the venous plasma cocaine level time course following intravenous cocaine administration. 30 These results are the first to document that intravenous administration of a relatively low dose of cocaine to otherwise healthy humans can induce angiographic changes indicative of cerebral vasoconstriction. This finding. mediate vasoconstriction. Cocaine metabolites may play an important role in inducing delayed cerebral vasoconstriction, because their levels gradually increase over several hours, 3 and in extreme cases persist for up to several weeks. 38 Thus, cocaine metabolites may trigger prolonged cerebral vasoconstriction associated with decreased cerebral perfusion. 39 Further.

### Comparison of in-hospital outcomes for β-blocker use versus non-beta blocker use in patients presenting with cocaine-associated chest pain [^113dJQFo]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Beta blockers are indicated for management of acute coronary syndromes, but they generally are withheld in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain because of concerns for adverse outcomes related to the unique physiological effects of cocaine. Because few clinical studies have evaluated this interaction, we identified patients with toxicology screen results positive for cocaine treated for chest pain at 2 academic hospitals. Clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were compared between patients with and without β-blocker therapy. We then constructed propensity scores to evaluate the independent relation between β-blocker use and the composite primary end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, ventricular arrhythmia, or all-cause mortality after adjusting for clinical characteristics. Of 376 consecutive patients with cocaine-related chest pain, β blockers were used in 164 (44%). Compared with no β blockers, patients treated with β blockers were more likely to describe anginal chest pain, to have known cardiovascular risk factors, and to receive other antiatherosclerotic therapies. Despite these higher risk clinical characteristics, patients treated with β blockers experienced similar peak troponin levels, individual adverse events, and rates of the composite primary end point (15.9% vs 12.3%, p = 0.32). The primary end point also was similar after propensity score analysis (odds ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 2.93, p = 0.42), including specific comparisons of beta-1 selective (odds ratio 1.83, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 4.24) and nonselective (odds ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 2.42) β blockers, when compared with patients not receiving β blockers. In conclusion, no differences in outcomes were observed between patients treated versus not treated with β-blocker therapy in the setting of cocaine-related chest pain.

### Management of cocaine-induced cardiac arrhythmias due to cardiac ion channel dysfunction [^116sfBQ2]. Clinical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Cocaine use is common in many areas of the world, particularly the United States and Western Europe. Toxicity following the use of cocaine is associated with a wide range of clinical features. In this review, we will focus on the cocaine-associated cardiac arrhythmias and, in particular, some of the controversies in their etiology and management. Cocaine can produce arrhythmias either through the production of myocardial ischemia or as a direct result of ion channel alterations. Excessive catecholamines, combined with sodium and potassium channel blockades, give rise to a wide variety of supra-ventricular and ventricular rhythms. The animal and human evidence for ion channel dysfunction is reviewed, and the effects of catecholamines are followed from the cardiac action potential to the development of arrhythmias. Finally, theoretical constructs are combined with existing evidence to develop a rational treatment strategy for patients with cocaine-induced cardiac arrhythmias. In particular, we review the evidence concerning the controversies relating to the use of lidocaine in comparison with sodium bicarbonate, in terms of QRS prolongation secondary to sodium channel blockade.

### One-year medical outcomes and emergency department recidivism after emergency department observation for cocaine-associated chest pain [^115nDaHG]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Chest pain is the most common complaint among cocaine users who present to the emergency department (ED) seeking care, and many hospital resources are applied to stratify cocaine users in regard to future cardiac morbidity and mortality. Little is known about the longitudinal cardiac and noncardiac medical outcomes of cocaine users who have been stratified to an ED observation period after their ED visit. We examine 1-year cardiac outcomes in a low- to intermediate-risk sample of patients with cocaine-associated chest pain in an urban ED, as well as examine ED recidivism at 1 year for cardiac and noncardiac complaints.

Methods

Prospective consecutive cohort study of patients (18 to 60 years) who presented to an urban Level I ED with cocaine-associated chest pain and were risk stratified to low to intermediate cardiac risk. Exclusion criteria were ECG suggestive of acute myocardial infarction, increased serum cardiac markers, history of acute myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass graft, hemodynamic instability, or unstable angina. Baseline interviews using validated measures of health functioning and substance use were conducted during chest pain observation unit stay and at 3, 6, and 12 months. ED utilization during the study year was abstracted from the medical chart. Zero-inflated Poisson regression analyses were conducted to predict recurrent ED visits.

Results

Two hundred nineteen participants (73%) were enrolled, 65% returned to the ED post-index visit, and 23% returned for chest pain; of these, 66% had a positive cocaine urine screening result. No patient had an acute myocardial infarction within the 1-year follow-up period. Patients with continued cocaine use were more likely to have a recurrent ED visit (P < .001), but these repeated visits were most often related to musculoskeletal pain (21%) and injury (30%), rather than potential cardiac complaints.

Conclusion

Patients with cocaine-associated chest pain who have low to intermediate cardiac risk and complete a chest pain observation unit protocol have a less than 1% rate of myocardial infarction in the subsequent 12 months.

The acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is now used to describe a spectrum of clinical presentations that share an underlying pathophysiology, replacing the previous nomenclature of ischemic chest pain. The accurate diagnosis and proper management of patients with these entities require the emergency medicine physician to consider the entire spectrum of ACS, with emphasis placed on early diagnosis and rapid treatment. Each of these syndromes has its own prognosis, pathophysiology, and specific management strategy.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — analgesics: Patients presenting with known or suspected ACS often experience chest pain or other uncomfortable symptoms, and rapid and effective pain relief remains an important treatment goal to prevent sympathetic activation and adverse clinical sequelae. Analgesic therapies may provide symptomatic relief, but they have not been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with ACS. Nitrates and opiate medications remain effective treatment options for management of pain in ACS but should be thoughtfully utilized to prevent potential harm, and rapid coronary revascularization should be pursued for patients with ongoing ischemic symptoms that are not relieved with nitrates.

Beta blocker use in cocaine intoxication — risk context and consultation: Historically, beta blockers have been avoided when treating cocaine intoxication due to case reports theorizing risks associated with unopposed alpha stimulation, which can result in an acute increase in blood pressure and/or coronary artery vasoconstriction following beta blocker administration. Evidence suggests that this risk is lower than hypothesized, and a systematic review and meta-analysis found beta blockers were not associated with adverse events — including myocardial infarction (MI), myocardial necrosis, or death — during hospitalization and long-term follow-up; however, this issue remains an area of controversy in the field and for complex cases, consult with cardiology and/or medical toxicology.
