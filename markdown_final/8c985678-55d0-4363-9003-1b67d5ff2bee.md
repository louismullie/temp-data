## Question

how to long to continue GLP for weightloss

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to continue GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight loss, including questions about monitoring, stopping rules, and maintenance strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the chronic disease framework and whether these agents are intended for long-term use. Then, I should verify the weight trajectory during treatment and what happens after discontinuation. Next, I will review early response criteria and stopping rules. After that, I need to check the evidence base for long-term efficacy and safety, including real-world adherence and cost-effectiveness. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations for duration, dose strategies, and follow-up, and consider special populations and alternatives if therapy must be stopped.

> Let me first confirm the disease model and intent of therapy. Obesity is a chronic, relapsing condition with durable physiologic drivers; pharmacotherapy modifies but does not cure the underlying biology, so GLP-1 RAs are generally intended as long-term, chronic therapy to maintain weight loss and cardiometabolic benefits, not as time-limited courses, and abrupt discontinuation predictably leads to weight regain and reversal of benefits [^1154aeeq] [^116tR938] [^1158SHgA].

> I will now examine the weight trajectory during treatment and after stopping. Weight loss with GLP-1 RAs is front-loaded, with rapid early loss that slows and plateaus by about 12–18 months. Importantly, when therapy is continued, weight reduction is sustained for at least 4 years, whereas discontinuation typically results in regain of roughly one-half to two-thirds of lost weight within a year, often approaching baseline by 12 months, which underscores the need for ongoing pharmacotherapy in most patients [^117DDcMb] [^114qLrEB] [^1158SHgA].

> Wait, let me verify the early response thresholds that guide continuation decisions. For liraglutide 3.0 mg, the FDA label uses a ≥ 4% weight loss at 16 weeks to predict meaningful long-term benefit. The EMA uses ≥ 5% at 12 weeks on the full dose, and more broadly, expert guidance recommends continuing only if there is ≥ 5% weight loss at about 3 months, with reassessment of benefit–risk if early loss is modest. These stopping rules help avoid prolonged exposure in nonresponders while capturing those likely to benefit long term [^117AjMRc] [^116wwedY] [^1154aeeq].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence on maintenance therapy. The STEP 4 randomized withdrawal trial showed that after 20 weeks of semaglutide run-in, those who continued semaglutide lost an additional 7.9% over 48 weeks, whereas those switched to placebo regained 6.9%, yielding a 14.8% between-group difference. SURMOUNT-4 with tirzepatide demonstrated similar patterns, confirming that continued pharmacotherapy is required to maintain weight loss and cardiometabolic gains [^112VfZbG] [^114qLrEB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about indefinite therapy without checking safety and durability. Observational and trial data suggest sustained efficacy over years, with liraglutide demonstrating maintained weight loss and improved cardiovascular risk factors through 2 years and longer-term observational cohorts showing durable benefits; cardiovascular outcome data, including SELECT for semaglutide, reinforce long-term cardiometabolic value, though ongoing surveillance is prudent as longer-term obesity-specific safety data continue to mature [^112UYAaX] [^114kWjHi] [^114qLrEB].

> I need to ensure we account for real-world adherence and cost, because duration on therapy is constrained by persistence. In practice, adherence to GLP-1 RAs is substantially lower than in trials, with about one-third to one-half persisting at 1 year and far fewer at 2 years; discontinuation is driven by GI intolerance, costs, and coverage gaps, and cost-effectiveness analyses often find unfavorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios at current prices unless paired with structured lifestyle programs that may improve durability and value [^111ABKy7] [^113NBNLv] [^11138mPZ].

> Let me consider dose strategies that might extend effective use. For patients who achieve goals but have cost or tolerability barriers, reducing frequency to every 2–4 weeks or using the lowest effective dose may maintain a meaningful fraction of weight loss, and some modeling suggests even monthly dosing could retain about half of the achieved loss. While not universally validated, this approach may be preferable to complete cessation when full-dose, weekly therapy is unsustainable [^1123UQ1V] [^113iXbhq].

> I should double-check the role of lifestyle integration, because medication alone rarely suffices for long-term maintenance. Structured nutrition and resistance exercise mitigate muscle loss, enhance adherence, and improve weight maintenance; adding supervised exercise to GLP-1 therapy improves maintenance after treatment ends compared with pharmacotherapy alone, and expert advisories emphasize comprehensive lifestyle support before, during, and after active weight loss to preserve lean mass and function [^113iWLk6] [^116ZFucs] [^112xUwyK].

> But wait, what if therapy must be stopped despite best efforts. If discontinuation is unavoidable, anticipate rapid weight regain and plan mitigation: taper the dose when feasible, intensify behavioral support, consider transitioning to lower-cost agents such as generic anti-obesity medications, and monitor weight closely. Real-world programs show that some patients can maintain a substantial portion of GLP-1–induced weight loss using generic agents and structured follow-up, though vigilance for regain is essential [^1149nxXb] [^114bcN9D] [^1154aeeq].

> Let me synthesize a practical, evidence-aligned recommendation. For most patients with obesity who respond and tolerate therapy, continue GLP-1 RA treatment long term, analogous to other chronic disease pharmacotherapies, with reassessment every 3 months initially and then semiannually; use early response thresholds to affirm benefit, titrate to the lowest effective dose or consider reduced-frequency regimens if needed, and pair with resistance training and nutrition counseling to preserve muscle and enhance durability; if therapy is stopped, implement a structured maintenance plan and monitor weight frequently to catch and address regain early [^1154aeeq] [^114kWjHi] [^117DDcMb].

> I should confirm special populations and caveats. In older adults or those with prefrailty, balance weight loss benefits against sarcopenia risk and prioritize resistance exercise. In patients with type 2 diabetes, GLP-1 RAs remain preferred for their glycemic and weight effects, and discontinuation is associated with higher MACE risk in observational cohorts. In women planning pregnancy, stop GLP-1 RAs in advance due to fetal risk and anticipated weight regain on withdrawal, with individualized glycemic planning during the transition [^1173EyS2] [^115pQNjy] [^117PCnv3].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear: GLP-1 RAs are intended as chronic therapy for obesity. Continue treatment as long as benefits outweigh risks, using early response criteria to validate efficacy, and layer lifestyle interventions to sustain outcomes and mitigate harms. If therapy is discontinued, expect substantial regain and deploy active maintenance strategies to preserve health gains [^1154aeeq] [^112VfZbG] [^117DDcMb].

GLP-1 receptor agonists are intended for **long-term use** in obesity management, with treatment continuing as long as the patient maintains clinically meaningful weight loss (≥ 5% at 3 months) [^1154aeeq] and experiences no significant adverse effects [^116tR938]. Discontinuation leads to **weight regain** [^112VfZbG], so therapy should be sustained to maintain weight loss and metabolic benefits [^114qLrEB]. Ongoing monitoring and shared decision-making are essential to balance benefits, risks, and patient preferences [^1154aeeq].

## Clinical evidence on duration of GLP-1 therapy

- **STEP 4 trial**: Continued semaglutide after 20-week run-in led to additional weight loss (-7.9% vs +6.9% with placebo; total -14.8% difference) over 48 weeks, whereas switching to placebo caused significant regain [^112VfZbG].

- **SURMOUNT-4 trial**: Continued tirzepatide maintained weight loss (-20.2% total), while switching to placebo led to regain (+6.9%) over 52 weeks.

- **Real-world data**: Persistent use (> 90% adherence) sustains weight loss; discontinuation results in regain, with ~50% regain by 1 year and ~70% by 2 years.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **ADA 2025**: GLP-1 RAs are recommended for chronic weight management in adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities, with therapy continued long term if effective and tolerated [^11222hio] [^1154aeeq].

- **Endocrine Society**: Continue weight-loss medications if ≥ 5% weight loss is achieved at 3 months and there are no safety concerns; discontinue if ineffective or intolerable [^116tR938].

- **ACC 2025**: Emphasizes chronic use for obesity as a lifelong disease, with ongoing monitoring and shared decision-making [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing duration of therapy

Several factors **influence how long** patients should continue GLP-1 therapy:

| **Factor** | **Influence on duration** |
|-|-|
| Clinical response | Continue if ≥ 5% weight loss at 3 months; reassess if < 5% [^1154aeeq] |
| Adverse effects | Discontinue if significant GI intolerance, pancreatitis, or other serious events occur [^116tR938] |
| Patient preference | Shared decision-making; some prefer long-term use, others step down or stop after goal achievement [^1154aeeq] |
| Comorbidities | Longer-term use may be beneficial in T2D, CVD, or CKD due to cardiometabolic benefits [^112jBAN4] |
| Cost and access | Financial constraints may limit duration; consider lower-cost alternatives or reduced-frequency dosing [^113iXbhq] |

## Risks and benefits of long-term GLP-1 therapy

### Benefits

- **Sustained weight loss**: Continued therapy maintains weight loss and improves metabolic health [^112VfZbG].

- **Cardiometabolic improvements**: Reduced blood pressure, lipids, and glycemic parameters; potential cardiovascular risk reduction [^114FmLQS].

- **Quality of life**: Improved physical functioning and quality of life with sustained weight loss [^112VfZbG].

---

### Risks

- **Gastrointestinal side effects**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation; often transient and manageable [^113Us47E].

- **Rare adverse events**: Pancreatitis, gallstones, thyroid C-cell tumors (animal data); monitor and individualize risk [^11378R99].

- **Muscle loss**: Potential lean mass loss; combine with resistance exercise and adequate protein intake [^113iWLk6].

---

## Strategies for discontinuation or tapering

When discontinuation is necessary, **structured tapering and lifestyle reinforcement** can mitigate regain:

- **Gradual tapering**: Reduce dose/frequency over weeks to months to minimize rebound appetite and weight regain.

- **Alternative medications**: Consider lower-cost agents (e.g. orlistat, naltrexone-bupropion) or reduced-frequency GLP-1 dosing for maintenance [^1149nxXb] [^1123UQ1V].

- **Intensive lifestyle support**: Combine with structured nutrition and exercise programs to sustain weight loss [^115kmqkf].

---

## Current research gaps and future directions

- **Long-term safety**: More data on > 5-year outcomes, cancer risk, and rare adverse events are needed [^114qLrEB].

- **Personalized medicine**: Identify predictors of long-term response to optimize duration and dosing [^117AjMRc].

- **Combination therapies**: Explore GLP-1 RAs with other agents (e.g. SGLT-2 inhibitors, amylin analogs) to enhance efficacy and tolerability [^112snv3o].

---

GLP-1 receptor agonists are intended for **long-term use** in obesity management, with therapy continued as long as the patient maintains clinically meaningful weight loss and experiences no significant adverse effects. Discontinuation leads to weight regain, so treatment should be sustained to maintain weight loss and metabolic benefits. Ongoing monitoring and shared decision-making are essential to balance benefits, risks, and patient preferences.

### Real-world weight change, adherence, and discontinuation among patients with type 2 diabetes initiating glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in the UK [^117FMFio]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are a type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment with demonstrated weight loss benefits in clinical trials. However, the extent to which real-world patients with T2DM achieve clinically meaningful weight loss (≥ 5%) has not been well characterized. Analysis of real-world data suggests adherence to injectable GLP-1 RAs is suboptimal and discontinuation following the first year of therapy is poorly characterized.

Research Design and Methods

A retrospective cohort study among patients with T2DM initiating injectable GLP-1 RA therapy was conducted using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink that includes primary care medical records for 13 million patients in the UK. This study assessed weight change, adherence (proportion of days covered (PDC) ≥ 80%), and discontinuation (≥ 90-day gap between prescriptions) at 12 and 24 months during the study period spanning January 2009-December 2017.

Results

Among 589 patients initiating a GLP-1 RA, 56.4% were female and the median age was 54 years (IQR (46, 61)). The median body mass index was 41.2 kg/m 2 (IQR (35.8, 46.4)). Among patients with weight measures available (n = 341 at 12 months; n = 232 at 24 months), 33.4% and 43.5% achieved weight loss ≥ 5% of baseline weight at 12 and 24 months, respectively. At 12 and 24 months, 64.5% and 59.2% were adherent, and 45.2% and 64.7% discontinued, respectively.

Conclusions

A minority of patients initiating GLP-1 RAs achieved ≥ 5%weight loss, suggesting the real-world benefit of these agents on weight loss may be lower than that observed in clinical trials. Patients on GLP-1 RAs may benefit from additional support to improve long-term adherence.

### Healthy weight loss maintenance with exercise, GLP-1 receptor agonist, or both combined followed by one year without treatment: a post-treatment analysis of a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^116ZFucs]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

New obesity medications result in large weight losses. However, long-term adherence in a real-world setting is challenging, and termination of obesity medication results in weight regain towards pre-treatment body weight. Therefore, we investigated whether weight loss and improved body composition are sustained better at 1 year after termination of active treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, supervised exercise program, or both combined for 1 year.

Methods

We conducted a post-treatment study in extension of a randomised, controlled trial in Copenhagen. Adults with obesity (aged 18–65 years and initial body mass index 32–43 kg/m 2) completed an eight-week low-calorie diet-induced weight loss of 13.1 kg (week -8 to 0) and were randomly allocated (1:1:1:1) to one-year weight loss maintenance (week 0–52) with either supervised exercise, the GLP-1 receptor agonist once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide 3.0 mg, the combination of exercise and liraglutide, or placebo. 166 Participants completed the weight loss maintenance phase. All randomised participants were invited to participate in the post-treatment study with outcome assessments one year after treatment termination, at week 104. The primary outcome of the post-treatment assessment was change in body weight from after the initial weight loss (at randomisation, week 0) to one year after treatment termination (week 104) in the intention-to-treat population. The secondary outcome was change in body-fat percentage (week 0–104). The study is registered with EudraCT, 2015–005585–32, and with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04122716.

Findings

Between Dec 17, 2018, and Dec 17, 2020, 109 participants attended the post-treatment study. From randomisation to one year after termination of combined exercise and liraglutide treatment (week 0–104), participants had reduced body weight (-5.1 kg [95% CI -10.0; -0.2]; P = 0.040) and body-fat percentage (-2.3%-points [-4.3 to -0.3]; P = 0.026) compared with after termination of liraglutide alone. More participants who had previously received combination treatment maintained a weight loss of at least 10% of initial body weight one year after treatment termination (week -8 to 104) compared with participants who had previously received placebo (odds ratio [OR] 7.2 [2.4; 21.3]) and liraglutide (OR 4.2 [1.6; 10.8]). More participants who had previously received supervised exercise maintained a weight loss of at least 10% compared with placebo (OR 3.7 [1.2; 11.1]). During the year after termination of treatment (week 52–104), weight regain was 6.0 kg [2.1; 10.0] larger after termination of liraglutide compared with after termination of supervised exercise and 2.5 kg [-1.5 to 6.5] compared with after termination of combination treatment.

Interpretation

The addition of supervised exercise to obesity pharmacotherapy seems to improve healthy weight maintenance after treatment termination compared with treatment termination of obesity pharmacotherapy alone. Body weight and body composition were maintained one year after termination of supervised exercise, in contrast to weight regain after termination of treatment with obesity pharmacotherapy alone.

### Weight maintenance on cost-effective antiobesity medications after 1 year of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy: a real-world study [^1149nxXb]. Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The high cost of novel glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) class agents often limits access and creates barriers to care. This real-world study evaluated the efficacy of older-generation generic antiobesity medications (AOMs) for weight maintenance after 1year of GLP-1 RA therapy in patients who had achieved successful weight loss.

Methods

We prospectively followed patients (N = 105) who had completed 12months of therapy and were part of a "medical weight loss bundle", which included 12months of GLP-1 RA therapy followed by 6months of transition care. The baseline mean BMI was 36.4 kg/m 2. Body weight outcomes were measured at 6, 12, 18, and 24months.

Results

After the medical weight loss bundle, 40 patients transitioned to generic AOMs. At 12months, this cohort lost an average of 18.3%, 95% CI [13.0%, 23.6%] body weight from baseline, with a mean BMI of 27.9kg/m 2. At 18months, they maintained the weight loss, with a mean BMI of 27.9kg/m 2. Subsequent follow-up visits (average 1.5months later) without GLP-1 RAs showed further reduction, resulting in a total average weight loss of 25.5%, 95% CI [23.1%, 27.9%] compared to the initial visit.

Conclusions

Patients successfully treated with GLP-1 RAs can maintain their weight loss using generic older-generation AOMs, suggesting potential cost savings for insurers and implications for policy regarding AOM coverage.

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^114vYeLM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity is the most prevalent chronic disease worldwideand drives significant morbidity and mortality. Obesity increases the risk of a variety of other chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. In the United States (US), approximately 71% of adults are overweight (defined as having a body mass index (BMI) in kg/m 2 greater than or equal to 25), including 41% who are obese (BMI ≥ 30) and 8% who are severely obese (BMI ≥ 40). The financial costs of excess adiposity are massive, as it is estimated that obesity results in over $170 billion in healthcare spending in the US every year.

We are currently in the midst of a revolution in weight loss interventions. Indeed, while both lifestyle and older pharmaceutical approaches have demonstrated limited efficacy, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) and dual GLP1/gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GLP‐1/GIP) receptor agonists have recently been shown to yield unprecedented levels of weight loss. For example, the incretin mimetics semaglutide and tirzepatide have been shown via meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials to induce placebo‐adjusted average body weight losses of 15.0% and 19.2%, respectively, and have shown significant weight loss in a recent head‐to‐head comparison.

### Combination of GLP-1 receptor agonists and behavioural treatment in type 2 diabetes elicits synergistic effects on body weight: a retrospective cohort study [^113e7pAL]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The report shows how much a behavioural programme may help increase weight loss in association with GLP‐1RA treatment in motivated patients. In T2DM, weight loss is highly desirable; when combined with behavioural programmes, GLP‐1RA‐associated weight loss continues to increase during the 2‐year observation period, up to values rarely achieved by individual treatments. Combination treatment is expected to reduce the burden of disease, the progression of comorbidities and eventually mortality. 23

The beneficial effects of GLP‐1RA treatment on body weight have been extensively investigated in registration trials and in the real world. In a systematic review of the literature up to May 2011 of 18 clinical trials in T2DM people with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2, Vilsboll et al 24 reported a weighted mean difference in body weight of −2.8 kg in comparison with control treatment, without differences in relation to initial BMI or trial duration. These results have been confirmed in 2015 by a systematic review and mixed treatment comparison meta‐analysis, where different GLP‐1RA therapies (exenatide 20 μg daily, exenatide 2 mg/wk, liraglutide 1.2 mg daily and liraglutide 1.8 mg daily) were compared with other glucose‐lowering drugs. 25 Real‐world Italian data confirmed an average weight loss of 3.5% with continuous long‐term use of exenatide bid treatment, 26 but larger effects of on body weight were reported with liraglutide, supporting the use of the drug for the treatment of obesity. 27 The advent of weekly injectable GLP‐1RA has opened a new era for the treatment of T2DM: both exenatide ER and dulaglutide are now available, with effects on body weight not systematically different from liraglutide (depending on treatment dosage), 28 whereas the effects of semaglutide might be even larger. 29 Notably, GLP‐1RA has been used as add‐on to behavioural treatment of obesity: in the Maintenance SCALE randomized study, liraglutide was effective in favouring weight loss maintenance and additional weight loss when superimposed to a low‐calorie weight loss programme. 30

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider including a GLP-1 receptor agonist or a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist with potential benefits in MASH for glycemic management and as an adjunctive to healthy interventions for weight loss in adult patients with T2DM, MASLD, and overweight or obesity.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^11243U9U]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Liraglutide — randomized controlled trial context, dosing, and run-in requirements: Direct comparative evidence from RCTs addressed long-term treatment "at a study duration of at least 52 weeks". In 3 studies, both groups received individualized intensive lifestyle intervention; most emphasized "at least 500-kcal" deficit and " ≥ 150 min/wk of physical activity". Liraglutide or placebo was given as a daily SC injection "starting at a dose of 0.6 mg, with weekly dose escalation until the target dose of 3.0 mg daily was reached". In 3 weight maintenance studies, participants followed a calorie-restricted run-in; in 2 studies subjects had to lose "at least 5%" and follow "LCD (800–1000 kcal/d for 8 weeks)", whereas another required " ≥ 5%" during a variable-length "(4–12 weeks)" run-in with "LCD (1200–1400 kcal/d)". In SCALE (Satiety and Clinical Adiposity – Liraglutide Evidence)-Maintenance, participants lost " ≥ 6.5 kg" during the run-in, and in the other studies they lost an average of "12.5–13.1 kg". Overall, "A total of 3964 subjects were randomized to liraglutide 3.0 mg and 2498 subjects were randomized to control groups".

### A review of incretin therapies approved and in late-stage development for overweight and obesity management [^1145SHec]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review clinical trial data for incretin therapies that are approved or in late-stage development for overweight or obesity management, along with clinical implications of these therapies and future directions.

Methods

We searched for clinical trials involving incretin therapies studied specifically for overweight or obesity management in ClinicalTrials.gov and PubMed from registry inception through December 2023.

Results

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonism, alone and in combination with glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonism or glucagon agonism, leads to significant weight reduction in people with overweight or obesity. Newer incretin therapies have demonstrated weight reduction between 15% to 25%, far outpacing non-incretin therapies for weight management and achieving levels of weight loss that may prevent weight-related complications. However, the discontinuation of incretin therapies is associated with weight regain. The main side effects of incretin therapies are transient, mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal side effects - nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting - that commonly occur in the first 4 to 8 weeks of treatment. There is a rich late-stage pipeline of incretin therapies for weight management, consisting of oral GLP-1 receptor agonists, dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists, dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonists, triple GLP-1/GIP/glucagon receptor agonists, and combination therapies with nonincretin drugs.

Conclusion

Newer incretin therapies for weight management have the potential to improve the treatment for overweight and obesity, the treatment and prevention of weight-related complications, and the individualization of weight management. Ensuring that these therapies are accessible - and that treatment with them is consistent and sustainable - is necessary to translate findings from trials into the real world.

### Efficacy and safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for weight loss among adults without diabetes: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^113Us47E]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and dual or triple co-agonists for weight loss among adults with overweight or obesity and without diabetes.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RAs and co-agonists for the treatment of obesity among adults without diabetes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception to 4 October 2024.

Study Selection

Placebo-controlled RCTs in otherwise healthy participants with overweight or obesity.

Data Extraction

The primary outcome was change in relative or absolute body weight from baseline to maximum on-treatment follow-up. Safety outcomes included death, serious adverse events (SAEs), any adverse events (AEs), and gastrointestinal AEs.

Data Synthesis

A total of 26 RCTs comprising 15491 participants (72% female; mean body mass index, 30 to 41 kg/m 2; mean age, 34 to 57 years) and 12 agents (3 commercially available agents [liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide] and 9 premarket agents for long-term weight management) were included. Treatment ranged from 16 to 104 weeks (median, 43 weeks). Compared with placebo, tirzepatide (15 mg once weekly) resulted in weight loss of up to 17.8% (95% CI, 16.3% to 19.3%) after 72 weeks of therapy; semaglutide (2.4 mg once weekly), up to 13.9% (CI, 11.0% to 16.7%) after 68 weeks; and liraglutide (3.0 mg once daily), up to 5.8% (CI, 3.6% to 8.0%) after 26 weeks. Retatrutide (12 mg once weekly) produced greater weight loss of up to 22.1% (CI, 19.3% to 24.9%) after 48 weeks; other novel single and combination GLP-1 agents were also efficacious to varying degrees. Although AEs were frequent (GLP-1 RA vs. placebo: 80% to 97% vs. 63% to 100%), the majority were gastrointestinal-related (47% to 84% vs. 13% to 63%, respectively), most commonly nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. AEs requiring treatment discontinuation (0% to 26% vs. 0% to 9%, respectively) and SAEs (0% to 10% vs. 0% to 12%, respectively) were rare.

Limitations

No head-to-head RCTs were available. Heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis.

Conclusion

GLP-1 RAs and co-agonists are efficacious for weight loss, with reported safety concerns predominantly gastrointestinal in nature, when used among adults with overweight or obesity and without diabetes.

Primary Funding Source

None. (PROSPERO: CRD42024505558).

### Role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in achieving weight loss and improving cardiovascular outcomes in people with overweight and obesity [^112nJp6w]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle Interventions, Bariatric Surgery, and Historical Pharmacologic Treatments for Obesity

Clinical practice guidelines recommend lifestyle modifications, including following a healthy diet and optimizing physical activity, for people with overweight or obesity to achieve weight loss and reduce the risk of future CVD events. This approach is supported by data from a secondary analysis of the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study, which included adults with overweight or obesity and T2D. Adults in the study were enrolled in an intensive weight loss intervention program aiming to achieve sustained weight loss and increased physical activity. Achievement of a 10% weight loss or a substantial increase in fitness (assessed in terms of metabolic equivalents) in the first year was associated with an ≈20% reduction in CVD risk. However, maintaining weight reduction is one of the most challenging aspects of obesity care. This is because weight is highly regulated by hormonal, metabolic, and neural factors, and various hormonal adaptations take place in response to weight loss that drive weight regain, with these continuing for at least 1 year after the initial weight reduction. Weight loss results in compensatory mechanisms relating to reduced resting energy expenditure and increased food preoccupation, whereas neural factors increase appetite. Unsurprisingly, therefore, data from 14 studies assessing reduced‐calorie diets demonstrated that although initial weight loss was achieved (−4.5 kg to −30 kg), most individuals regained a large proportion of their initial weight loss within a few years. These findings suggest the need for additional interventions to prevent regaining weight, including surgery or pharmaceutical treatments, to manage the serious chronic disease of obesity.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (exenatide, dulaglutide, lixisenatide, semaglutide; note: liraglutide 3 mg dose FDA-approved for long-term weight management) demonstrate weight-loss effects in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with a Cochrane review reporting weight loss of 2.87 kg for exenatide and 3.24 kg for liraglutide across 17 randomized controlled trials (6,899 participants; 26 weeks), and an open-label T2DM trial noting a mean baseline BMI approximately 34 kg/m2 with weight loss of 5.6 kg with semaglutide and 1.9 kg with exenatide; in a Phase 2 trial in patients with obesity (without DM), weight loss was significantly higher in all semaglutide groups versus placebo and compared to 3.0 mg liraglutide at semaglutide doses of 0.2 mg per day or more. Nausea is common and tends to subside with continuation of therapy, and dose escalation may be done more slowly if GI intolerance occurs. Although pancreatitis risk is a concern, in LEADER (n = 9,340 T2DM) acute pancreatitis numbers were higher with placebo (23, 0.5%, 1.7 events/1,000 patient-years of observation [PYO]) than with liraglutide (18, 0.4%, 1.1 events/1,000 PYO). Due to rat and mice data with increased C-cell tumors, there is a boxed warning of thyroid C-cell (medullary) tumor risk and GLP-1 agonists are contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2).

### Less frequent dosing of GLP-1 receptor agonists as a viable weight maintenance strategy [^113iXbhq]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

We believe a plausible explanation for their clinical response lies in the PK/PD models, which predict that less frequent dosing does not proportionally diminish treatment outcomes. Although more frequent dosing regimens lead to greater initial weight loss, our findings suggest that substantial long‐term weight loss maintenance might still be achieved with reduced dosing frequencies. Naturally, this strategy does not lessen the importance of adhering to a hypocaloric diet and increased physical activity, and further clinical studies are needed to validate our findings and optimize dosing regimens for individual patient needs.

Incretin mimetics are indeed groundbreaking weight loss therapies, but, unless their costs come down substantially, our healthcare system cannot afford their indefinite use for weight maintenance in all people with obesity. Few may adequately maintain their weight loss through lifestyle modification alone; many others will need to consider alternative AOMs or incretin mimetic booster periods over time. Although lacking broad clinical validation of long‐term efficacy and tolerability, we propose that patients and providers also explore off‐label reduced‐frequency dosing of incretin mimetics as they navigate disruptions to the pharmaceutical supply chain and the financial burdens of prolonged incretin mimetic therapy. Indeed, for patients who cannot maintain once‐weekly dosing indefinitely (perhaps because of financial constraints), reduced‐frequency dosing is very likely preferable to discontinuing treatment altogether, which tends to erase most of the weight loss achieved with treatment. Investigating reduced‐frequency dosing in clinical trials, such as one dose every 14 days, is a natural next step to validate this approach. Future studies are also needed to identify patient factors that predict a more favorable response to less frequent dosing of incretin mimetics and to examine the long‐term clinical outcomes achieved through this approach compared with other off‐ramping options (e.g. switching to alternative AOMs).

### GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight reduction in people living with obesity but without diabetes: a living benefit-harm modelling study [^114qLrEB]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The trade-off between the benefits and harms of GLP-1 RA treatment is challenging due to the multitude of parameters and outcomes to consider concurrently. But it is even more challenging when considering GLP-1 RAs for weight maintenance. The current evidence suggests that GLP-1 RAs may serve as an effective treatment strategy for rapid weight loss in conjunction with lifestyle interventions during the first years of treatment. However, all RCTs showed that weight reduction stablizes over time after the initial 1 or 2 years of treatment. This triggers an important question: whether discontinuing (but having a high risk of weight rebounding) or continuing GLP-1 RA therapy for weight maintenance (with no further weight loss but higher harm risks) is beneficial for the overall health of individuals, which needs a separate analysis. For instance, the STEP 1 and STEP 4 trials demonstrated that patients who stopped taking semaglutide experienced significant weight regain and a reversal of cardiometabolic benefits, whereas those who continued the treatment maintained their weight loss. Similarly, the S-LITE and SURMOUNT-4 trials also reported weight regain following the discontinuation of liraglutide and tirzepatide, respectively. This was supported by an observational study, albeit in people living with diabetes, that reported an increased risk of CVD events in those who withdrew GLP-1 RAs.

The long-term harms and benefits are also not clear. Although they are too short to observe long-term benefits or harm outcomes, the RCTs available so far have signaled some important harms, including pancreatitis, renal failure, and alopecia, which warrant close monitoring. Long-term data, such as the LOOBesity cohort, and post-marketing surveillance data, are needed to better understand the long-term benefits and harms. On the other hand, GLP-1 RA therapy may also have a long-term positive effect on preventing weight-related comorbidities such as CVD. The SELECT trial, revealed that semaglutide reduced the risk of recurrent CVD events by 20%. This supports the findings in the diabetic population showing the preventive benefit of GLP-1 RAs for CVD and related conditions. This points to a promising future for GLP-1 RAs in CVD prevention, potentially tipping the benefit-harm trade-off in favour of a net benefit.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^112GVAVv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Adverse events in obesity

As our review shows (Table 3), our knowledge on adverse events for the GLP‐1RAs is largely based on the study of these drugs in the management of diabetes. There are several reasons why data on adverse events might not translate between these populations. For one, the users of GLP‐1RAs for weight management are roughly 20–25 years younger on average than those using the same drugs for the management of diabetes. Even under the strong assumption that the relative risk increases translate between these populations, the much lower baseline risk of most diseases among younger individuals will make the absolute magnitude of such risks markedly different. Second, some adverse effects might be directly or indirectly linked to the indication of diabetes and hyperglycaemia. This is obvious for diabetic retinopathy, and also hypothesized for the use of GLP‐1RA and risk of NAION, making it uncertain whether the same effect can be expected with the use of the drugs for weight management. As such, there is a need to study the occurrence of adverse effects specifically among users of GLP‐1RA for weight management and in particular the absolute risk of these effects.

5.9 Methodological quality

With the growing body of literature on the real‐world use and effects of GLP‐1RA, there is an increasing need to not only summarise this literature but also to evaluate and strengthen its methodological quality. Areas of particular focus are how to avoid selection bias, which is a frequent concern in studies that only include 'drug survivors', that is, those retaining treatment over a prolonged period, or those restricting their analyses to high‐dose users.

### Impact of dose-escalation schemes and drug discontinuation on weight loss outcomes with liraglutide 3.0 mg: a model-based approach [^113LdcBt]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The global obesity epidemic continues to grow, with an estimated 38% of the world's adult population predicted to be overweight and 20% obese by 2030. 1, 2, 3 Even though first‐line interventions, such as diet and increased physical activity, can lead to weight loss, studies show that people tend to regain the lost weight in the long term, potentially owing to well‐regulated body weight homeostatic mechanisms and decreased effort regarding weight maintenance over time. 4, 5, 6 Thus, effective and well‐tolerated interventions are needed to aid with weight reduction and help sustain the lost weight in the long term. Novel incretin hormone‐based pharmacotherapeutic approaches have been proposed as a viable strategy for weight management in overweight or obese patients. Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) is a member of the incretin hormone family that stimulates insulin secretion and dose‐dependently inhibits glucagon secretion. It has been shown to lead to weight loss via a reduction in energy intake by increasing satiety and reducing hunger. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

### Real-world GLP-1 RA therapy in type 2 diabetes: a long-term effectiveness observational study [^115JxNVZ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

All drugs significantly reduced BMI throughout follow‐up visits, but considering the important differences observed in baseline BMI of different GLP‐1 RAs, direct comparisons among agents in this setting would be undoubtedly biased. Interestingly, the higher BMI at baseline observed in our cohort deemed a greater weight loss (4.74 kg) as compared to RCTs. Average weight reduction in LEAD, DURATION and AWARD programmes was 2.4 kg. This observation is confirmed by other RW studies with weight reductions ranging from 3.4 to 4.5 kg. 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40

Thong and colleagues critically evaluated NICE recommendations on use of GLP‐1 RA therapy, 44 concluding that few patients achieved proposed criterion of HbA1c reduction ≥ 1% as a requirement for continued GLP‐1ra treatment as this would unfairly favour patients with higher baseline HbA1c. They recommended that this should be replaced by a target HbA1c reduction that is indexed to an individual's baseline HbA1. Following these criteria, and based upon a general recommendation for antidiabetic therapy, we evaluated clinical effectiveness of GLP‐1 RA in our cohort with a modified definition, including a HbA1c reduction of ≥ 0.5%. Conversely, and based upon the same reasoning by Thong and colleagues, a BMI reduction of ≥ 3% was considered appropriate, for a cohort with a high baseline BMI. In this context, we found that 38.63% of patients did not reach efficacy goals for HbA1c or weight reduction, taken together.

### Safety, tolerability and sustained weight loss over 2 years with the once-daily human GLP-1 analog, liraglutide [^112UYAaX]. International Journal of Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Objective:

Having demonstrated short-term weight loss with liraglutide in this group of obese adults, we now evaluate safety/tolerability (primary outcome) and long-term efficacy for sustaining weight loss (secondary outcome) over 2 years.

Design:

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 20-week study with 2-year extension (sponsor unblinded at 20 weeks, participants/investigators at 1 year) in 19 European clinical research centers.

Subjects:

A total of 564 adults (n = 90–98 per group; body mass index 30–40 kg m −2) enrolled, 398 entered the extension and 268 completed the 2-year trial. Participants received diet (500 kcal deficit per day) and exercise counseling during 2-week run-in, before being randomly assigned (with a telephone or web-based system) to once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide (1.2, 1.8, 2.4 or 3.0 mg, n = 90–95), placebo (n = 98) or open-label orlistat (120 mg × 3, n = 95). After 1 year, liraglutide/placebo recipients switched to liraglutide 2.4 mg, then 3.0 mg (based on 20-week and 1-year results, respectively). The trial ran from January 2007–April 2009 and is registered with, number NCT00480909.

Results:

From randomization to year 1, liraglutide 3.0 mg recipients lost 5.8 kg (95% confidence interval 3.7–8.0) more weight than those on placebo and 3.8 kg (1.6–6.0) more than those on orlistat (P ≤ 0.0001; intention-to-treat, last-observation-carried-forward). At year 2, participants on liraglutide 2.4/3.0 mg for the full 2 years (pooled group, n = 184) lost 3.0 kg (1.3–4.7) more weight than those on orlistat (n = 95; P < 0.001). Completers on liraglutide 2.4/3.0 mg (n = 92) maintained a 2-year weight loss of 7.8 kg from screening. With liraglutide 3.0 mg, 20-week body fat decreased by 15.4% and lean tissue by 2.0%. The most frequent drug-related side effects were mild to moderate, transient nausea and vomiting. With liraglutide 2.4/3.0 mg, the 2-year prevalence of prediabetes and metabolic syndrome decreased by 52 and 59%, with improvements in blood pressure and lipids.

Conclusion:

Liraglutide is well tolerated, sustains weight loss over 2 years and improves cardiovascular risk factors.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^1126sjna]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects management during GLP-1 therapy — Gradual dose escalation helps the body adapt over time, minimizing frequency and severity of GI symptoms, and during dose escalation in the clinical trials subjects were allowed to remain at a GLP-1 dose for up to 8 weeks, as needed, to allow GI side effects to dissipate; in the clinical experience of some authors of this Advisory, another approach is to maintain individuals at the lowest effective dose and escalate only as needed (i.e., when weight reduction ceases or efficacy wanes), although shortages of medications at lower doses may be a barrier. Before initiating therapy, clinicians should present GI side effects in detail, advise individuals to contact them early if side effects develop and provide mitigation strategies should side effects occur.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^1133XJYd]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

GLP-1 initiation with a patient-centered approach emphasizes that the approach to initiating pharmacologic therapy for obesity should be individualized and consider overall physical and mental health and well-being rather than body weight alone; because many individuals request GLP-1s due to a focus on body weight, other key components in the obesity management journey must be considered and discussed before initiating these therapies; a patient-centered discussion should consider the individual's circumstances, preferences, values, and medical conditions; and decisions about how quickly or slowly to titrate therapy or restrict calories should be guided by the individual's needs, with others who may benefit from a slower titration schedule of medications.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists: nonglycemic clinical effects in weight loss and beyond [^112NAah8]. Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are indicated for treatment of type 2 diabetes since they mimic the actions of native GLP-1 on pancreatic islet cells, stimulating insulin release, while inhibiting glucagon release, in a glucose-dependent manner. The observation of weight loss has led to exploration of their potential as antiobesity agents, with liraglutide 3.0 mg day(-1) approved for weight management in the US on December 23, 2014, and in the EU on March 23, 2015. This review examines the potential nonglycemic effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Methods

A literature search was conducted to identify preclinical and clinical evidence on nonglycemic effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Results

GLP-1 receptors are distributed widely in a number of tissues in humans, and their effects are not limited to the well-recognized effects on glycemia. Nonglycemic effects include weight loss, which is perhaps the most widely recognized nonglycemic effect. In addition, effects on the cardiovascular, neurologic, and renal systems and on taste perception may occur independently of weight loss.

Conclusions

GLP-1 receptor agonists may provide other nonglycemic clinical effects besides weight loss. Understanding these effects is important for prescribers in using GLP-1 receptor agonists for diabetic patients, but also if approved for chronic weight management.

Liraglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity and T2D: doses "up to 1.8 mg/day are approved for glycemic control and to reduce the risk of major adverse CVD events", while "3 mg per day is approved for chronic weight management". Across three 56-week studies, weight loss "averaged from 6.2% to 8.0% in those without T2D, and between 4.4% and 6.1% in persons with T2D", compared with " ≤ 2.1%" using orlistat and "placebo (2.0%)". Liraglutide 3 mg "significantly improved" multiple lipids and UACR versus placebo, and "the incidence of cholelithiasis was greater than placebo".

### Effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on weight loss: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^117A84zB]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Review methods and selection criteria

Eligible trials were listed and the inclusion criteria were assessed independently by all authors. Excluded trials were listed with the reason for exclusion. Three authors (TV, MC, and LLG) extracted data independently. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Randomised controlled trials were eligible irrespective of their publication status. We included trials of adult patients with or without type 2 diabetes and who had a body mass index of 25 or more. The GLP-1R agonists assessed were exenatide given twice daily, exenatide given once weekly (as a long acting release), and liraglutide given once daily. The control groups were placebo, no intervention, or antidiabetic drugs. If trials included more than one control group, we included data from the most weight neutral intervention (for example, placebo instead of insulin). We also included randomised comparisons between exenatide and liraglutide. To undertake a review that applied to clinical practice, we only included trials with a duration of at least 20 weeks that assessed clinically relevant doses of at least 10 µg/day for exenatide (5 µg twice daily), 2 mg/week for exenatide once weekly, and 1.2 mg/day for liraglutide once daily.

Assessment of risk of bias

Based on previous evidence, we classed the randomisation methods of selected trials as the primary measure of bias control. We assessed randomisation methods by how the allocation sequence was generated (classed as adequate if based on a table of random numbers, computer generated random numbers, or similar) and concealed (classed as adequate if based on central randomisation, identically coded drug containers, serially numbered opaque sealed envelopes, or similar).

We also extracted information on the following:

(1) Blinding (whether the trial was described as double blind or single blind, the method of blinding; whether patients, investigators, outcome assessors, or other individuals participating in the trial were blinded; and whether the adequacy of blinding was assessed)
(2) Risk of attrition bias (numbers of and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals, and whether all patients were accounted for in the report and analysis of the trial)
(3) Whether the primary outcome measure was defined and reported
(4) Whether sample size calculations were done
(5) Whether the preset sample size was achieved
(6) For trials terminated prematurely, whether this termination was based on predefined criteria

### Time-dependent effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on cardiovascular benefits: a real-world study [^115pQNjy]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Similar to REWIND, the majority of the subjects included in our population was in primary CV prevention (72%), and the protection offered by continued GLP-1 RA treatment was similar in those with and without previous CV events. Also, GLP-1 RA treatment withdrawal (i.e.: before MACE or end of follow-up), considered as a time-dependent variable, significantly increased the risk of MACE in both groups. Interestingly, two of the most recent meta-analyses that included subgroup analyses of subjects with or without established CVD, suggest similar favorable effects in patients with and without CVD, but with a smaller reduction in absolute risk in those in primary prevention.

Over half of the patients in the cohort were able to continue a GLP-1 RA in the long term (four to ten years). These subjects exhibited long-term benefits in terms of glycemic control, with a significant decrease in HbA1c of approximately -1% that was maintained over time, and a significant weight loss which increased in magnitude over the years, reaching a maximum of − 6.6 kg at eight years of follow-up.

When analyzing the possible variables associated with cardiovascular outcomes, we found that discontinuation of GLP-1 RA treatment was independently associated to a strong significant increase in the risk of developing a MACE. This finding is consistent with and reinforces the recent hypothesis that GLP-1 RAs appear to exert CV protection as long as patients are exposed to the individual drug for a sufficiently long amount of time. Indeed, the percentage of time of exposure to the investigational GLP-1 RA in individual CVOTs showed a positive correlation with MACE absolute risk reduction.

We may also note that our patients showed a greater treatment persistence compared to other real-world studies from other countries. In a retrospective study from a large cohort (8698 patients) in the United States, over half of the patients initiating GLP-1 RA were non-adherent and the majority (70.1%) discontinued therapy by 24 months. Similarly, in another real-world study conducted in the UK among 589 patients initiating a GLP-1 RA, 45.2% and 64.7% of the subjects discontinued the treatment, at 12 and 24 months respectively.

### Safety, tolerability and sustained weight loss over 2 years with the once-daily human GLP-1 analog, liraglutide [^115hsgT4]. International Journal of Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Liraglutide was generally well tolerated and improved quality of life. Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate. Gastrointestinal events (particularly nausea and vomiting), consistent with the known physiological effects of GLP-1, were more frequent than with placebo. At year 1, nausea and/or vomiting was associated with greater weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg, but even those who did not experience these events lost more weight than those on placebo or orlistat. The injection regimen did not impair adherence or cause significant withdrawal during treatment or run-in.

The main study limitations are the complex study design and the open-label nature of the orlistat treatment arm, although this represents existing best pharmacological practice and provides a comparison for the long-term safety data of liraglutide over the 2-year period. The lack of the placebo comparison at 2 years is also a limitation, but it did not seem feasible in terms of participant retention to maintain the placebo arm. The presence of a diet and exercise run-in period in the study design complicates analyses, and limits the capacity of the trial to anticipate the total maintained effects of treatment. Most secondary endpoints were not measured at screening, therefore several biochemical changes brought about by weight loss during run-in cannot be evaluated. Lipids are likely to have improved; a 6% decrease in low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol concentrations was previously observed during 2-week run-in in a trial of orlistat versus placebo treatment. Analyses from randomization should be interpreted in this light. The initial choice of 2.4 mg as a long-term maintenance dose after 1 year was based on 20-week data. However, when the 12-month data were analyzed, and the decision taken to move up to 3.0 mg, the non-uniform time for dose-switch from liraglutide 2.4 to 3.0 mg during year 2 (as a result of differences in local ethical committee efficiency) is also a limitation. No participants had the benefit of the 3.0 mg dose for the full 2 years, and some for as little as 8 weeks.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Dosing and tolerability of weekly NuSh agents — semaglutide and tirzepatide are dosed once weekly, and all agents require dose titration to minimize largely gastrointestinal adverse effects; slow titration mitigates intolerance, and for patients with adverse effects, decreasing the dose to a previously tolerated dose is recommended. In clinical trials, 4.3% to 7.1% of participants discontinued therapy due to adverse events. Among published clinical trials, the longest duration of treatment with a NuSh (liraglutide) was 3.8 years, and observational data across 5 years suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective; given that obesity is a chronic disease, weight regain after discontinuation of therapy is expected. Access and affordability challenges can lead to missed doses; should a patient miss doses due to lack of access, strategies exist to guide therapeutic interchanges, and if ≥ 3 missed dosages of once-weekly semaglutide or tirzepatide occur, a dose reduction may be considered.

### Primary-care observational database study of the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists and insulin in the UK [^114aL9GZ]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The short-term aim of therapy for hyperglycaemia is improved blood glucose control without significant tolerability or safety issues, and with the longer-term objective of reducing vascular damage. Although initial pharmaceutical therapy is with an oral glucose-lowering agent, a steady decline in islet β-cell function results in progressive hyperglycaemia, which requires a stepwise escalation of treatment. Eventually insulin is often required as the only therapy independent of the need for endogenous insulin production.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have recently become a therapy option, with exenatide introduced into the UK market in 2007 and liraglutide in 2009. GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic, at supra-physiological levels, the action of endogenous GLP-1, in stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and by suppressing glucagon secretion. Gastric emptying is delayed, especially in the early weeks of therapy. This, and perhaps a direct or indirect hypothalamic action, results in appetite/satiety changes and thus loss of body weight. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends a GLP-1 receptor agonist predominantly as a third-line treatment option in people who would otherwise start insulin and have a BMI ≥ 35.0 kg/m 2. NICE recommendations also state that therapy should be discontinued if the person has not had a beneficial metabolic response (a reduction of at least 11 mmol/mol (1.0%) in HbA 1c and weight loss of at least 3% of initial body weight at 6 months).

A review of 28 randomized clinical trials reported that GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy reduced HbA 1c by approximately 11 mmol/mol (1.0%), with weight loss of 2.3–5.5 kg. Comparisons with basal insulin have shown weight loss rather than gain with GLP-1 receptor agonists over 6 or 12 months and either no difference in HbA 1c reduction–or a greater decrease. Abstracts of observational studies in the USA and Germany have reported differences in populations who start a GLP-1 receptor agonist compared with those who initiate basal insulin therapy, and either no differenceor a greater reduction in HbA 1c on insulin.

The primary objective of the current study is to understand the characteristics of people beginning GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy in UK routine care, their metabolic response to treatment (glycaemic and weight control), which characteristics are associated with achieving glycaemic and weight control, and what percentage achieve the UK NICE targets. The characteristics and response to treatment were compared with those in people starting insulin therapy.

### Association of glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs and agonists administered for obesity with weight loss and adverse events: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111kSM2d]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Comparative effectiveness of 7 glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agents on weight loss (WL) in obesity remains unknown.

Methods

We performed a systematic review, network meta-analysis (NMA) utilizing the following data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Central and clinical trial registries, from inception to March 2, 2021. The prespecified criteria for study inclusion were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of ≥ 12 weeks' duration. The data appraisal and extraction were performed by two investigators independently, using the published reports. The main outcomes and statistical methods were weight loss over placebo (WLOP) and adverse events (AEs) among GLP-1 agents using random-effects NMA (frequentist approach); relative ranking using surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) method and certainty of evidence using grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations (GRADE).

Findings

64 RCTs (from 2004 to 2021) included 27018 patients (median of age, 55.1 years old; 57.4% women; baseline weight 94.8kg and BMI 33.0kg/m 2; trial duration 26 weeks). Direct meta-analysis showed significant WLOP with: -1.44kg (95% CI, -2.14 to -0.74) with dulaglutide ≥ 1.5 mg; -1.82kg (-2.42 to -1.23) with exenatide immediate release (IR); -2.20kg (-4.31 to -0.08) with exenatide extended release (ER); -3.20kg (-6.53 to 0.15) with efpeglenatide; -2.72kg (-3.35 to -2.09) with liraglutide ≤ 1.8mg; -4.49kg (-5.26 to -3.72) with liraglutide > 1.8mg; -0.62kg (-1.22 to -0.02) with lixisenatide; -4.33kg (-5.71 to -3.00) with semaglutide SQ < 2.4mg; -9.88kg (-13.17 to -6.59) with semaglutide SQ 2.4mg; -2.73kg (-4.81 to -0.65) with semaglutide oral; and -1.71kg (-2.64 to -0.78) with taspoglutide. Highest WLOP were with semaglutide SQ 2.4mg and < 2.4mg, and liraglutide > 1.8mg (SUCRAs 100, 86.1, 82.8 respectively). Highest SUCRAs for discontinuation due to AEs were with taspoglutide and liraglutide > 1.8mg. Risk of bias was high or unclear for random sequence generation (29.7%), allocation concealment (26.6%), and incomplete outcome data (26.6%). Heterogeneity (I 2 > 50%) in WL and AEs reflected magnitude, not direction of effect.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists: differentiating the new medications [^114DuXzF]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

GLP-1 receptor agonists have been developed to address the direct pathophysiologic defects observed in T2DM. Because GLP-1 receptor agonists work in a glucose-dependent manner, they are likely to reduce hyperglycemia safely, without a marked fluctuation toward hypoglycemia. In the process of acutely restoring β-cell function, GLP-1 agonists may allow patients to achieve HbA 1c < 7%, without experiencing weight gain or hypoglycemia.

The safety and efficacy of this class of medications appears to be promising. Although no medication has been shown to be effective at reducing cardiovascular events, GLP-1 agonists are being studied in long-term clinical trials to determine whether they may play a role in reducing long-term cardiovascular mortality. The ability of GLP-1 receptor agonists to improve blood pressure and postprandial lipidemia in the context of weight neutrality or weight loss may have the potential to ameliorate some of the cardiovascular risks observed in patients with T2DM.

### How do we continue treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes when therapeutic goals are not reached with oral antidiabetes agents and lifestyle? Incretin versus insulin treatment [^115jT2rt]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The recent ADA/EASD Position Statement for the therapy of type 2 diabetes has already changed the positioning of GLP-1 RA treatment from "less validated treatments" in the preceding statement to an equal positioning as second-line therapy with insulin. The novel statement evaluates therapies not only by their efficacy in glucose lowering but also by treatment side effects, hypoglycemia incidence, body weight development, and costs as well as individual considerations concerning patient characteristics (e.g. disease duration, comorbidities, cardiovascular risk). In conclusion, the indications and outcomes for GLP-1 RA treatment compared with insulin therapy seem favorable for patients with type 2 diabetes when oral antidiabetes therapy and lifestyle intervention do not achieve the therapeutic goals. In this case, an injectable therapy with a GLP-1 RA is feasible, especially when body weight reduction and prevention of hypoglycemia are further important therapeutic aims.

### The expanding role of GLP-1 receptor agonists: a narrative review of current evidence and future directions [^112snv3o]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Future research

Long-term efficacy and safety

The long-term effects of GLP-1 RA use for weight loss remains an important area for future research. While current studies have demonstrated substantial short-term weight loss and metabolic improvements, the sustainability of these outcomes over extended periods requires further exploration. Longitudinal studies should investigate how these agents impact long-term health outcomes, such as the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Additionally, long-term safety needs to be established. Comprehensive long-term studies will help clarify the risk-benefit ratio of prolonged GLP-1 RA therapy.

Oral formulations

The development of oral GLP-1 RAs offers an alternative to injectable formulations, potentially improving access and adherence for some patients. Oral semaglutide has demonstrated efficacy in both diabetes and obesity management. Cardiovascular safety was first established in the PIONEER 6 trial, with the more recent SOUL trial demonstrating a significant reduction in MACE compared to placebo among individuals with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular or renal risk. These findings support the potential of oral semaglutide for broader clinical use. Orforglipron, a novel non-peptide oral GLP-1 RA, has also shown promising glycemic and weight-lowering effects in phase 2 trials. While oral formulations have demonstrated acceptable tolerability overall, gastrointestinal side effects remain common and may occur at similar or slightly higher rates than with injectable agents. Daily dosing and pill burden may also pose practical challenges in long-term use, highlighting the need to tailor treatment choices to individual patient needs and preferences.

Combination therapies

Combination therapies represent a promising strategy to enhance the efficacy and tolerability of GLP-1 RAs. Several novel agents now combine GLP-1 receptor agonism with other metabolic targets. Dual agonists such as tirzepatide (GLP-1/GIP) have demonstrated superior weight loss and glycemic control compared to GLP-1 RAs alone, likely due to complementary mechanisms involving both incretin pathways. Triple agonists that target GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors, such as retatrutide, are also in development and have shown even greater weight loss effects in early-phase trials. Other potential combinations include GLP-1 RAs with SGLT-2 inhibitors, amylin analogs, or central nervous system appetite modulators, such as phentermine or bupropion. These combination therapies could provide synergistic effects on weight loss, glycemic control, or cardiometabolic risk while potentially minimizing the gastrointestinal side effects commonly associated with GLP-1 RAs. Future studies should also explore optimal sequencing, dosing strategies, and patient selection to maximize clinical benefit.

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114mTL8u]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Metabolic surgery and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) — perioperative and postoperative use: No definitive evidence supports the pre- and post–metabolic surgery use of nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapeutics for chronic obesity; among individuals with a BMI > 50 kg/m2, GLP-1 RAs are associated with significant preoperative weight loss with no increase in complications or time to surgery. GLP-1 RAs can effectively treat weight regain after metabolic surgery and therefore could be considered as an alternative to revisional surgery, but long-term outcomes are lacking.

### GIPR / GLP-1R dual agonist therapies for diabetes and weight loss-chemistry, physiology, and clinical applications [^111h7ume]. Cell Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The incretin system is an essential metabolic axis that regulates postprandial metabolism. The two incretin peptides that enable this effect are the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which have cognate receptors (GIPR and GLP-1R) on islet β cells as well as in other tissues. Pharmacologic engagement of the GLP-1R is a proven strategy for treating hyperglycemia in diabetes and reducing body weight. Tirzepatide is the first monomeric peptide with dual activity at both incretin receptors now available for clinical use, and in clinical trials it has shown unprecedented effects to reduce blood glucose and body weight. Here, we discuss the foundational science that led to the development of monomeric multi-incretin receptor agonists, culminating in the development of tirzepatide. We also look to the future of this field and comment on how the concept of multi-receptor agonists will continue to progress for the treatment of metabolic disease.

### A review of GLP-1 receptor agonists: evolution and advancement, through the lens of randomised controlled trials [^115uP3Ca]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To review the evolution and advancement of GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) therapy, through the lens of randomised controlled trials, from differentiating characteristics, efficacy, safety, tolerability, and cardiovascular outcomes, to evidence gaps and next steps.

Methods

Clinical review of published phase 3 or later RCT data studying efficacy, safety, and outcomes of approved GLP-1 RA therapies.

Results

Through a wealth of studies, including both placebo-controlled and active-controlled studies, GLP-1 RAs have demonstrated high glycemic efficacy and ability to facilitate weight loss, with minimal risk of hypoglycemia, potential to restore beta cell function, and evidence for improved cardiovascular outcomes in those at risk.

Conclusions

Over a decade of clinical studies have established the unique contributions of GLP-1 RAs in the treatment of diabetes. Individual differences between the different GLP-1 RAs, in delivery, pharmacokinetic and clinical effects, exist, allowing for tailored approaches to clinical care. The strength of evidence generated through RCTs, both short-term and long-term studies, will continue to evolve and inform our current paradigms in diabetes care.

### A GIPR antagonist conjugated to GLP-1 analogues promotes weight loss with improved metabolic parameters in preclinical and phase 1 settings [^114dKNfy]. Nature Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Obesity is a major public health crisis. Multi-specific peptides have emerged as promising therapeutic strategies for clinical weight loss. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are endogenous incretins that regulate weight through their receptors (R). AMG 133 (maridebart cafraglutide) is a bispecific molecule engineered by conjugating a fully human monoclonal anti-human GIPR antagonist antibody to two GLP-1 analogue agonist peptides using amino acid linkers. Here, we confirm the GIPR antagonist and GLP-1R agonist activities in cell-based systems and report the ability of AMG 133 to reduce body weight and improve metabolic markers in male obese mice and cynomolgus monkeys. In a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in participants with obesity (NCT04478708), AMG 133 had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile along with pronounced dose-dependent weight loss. In the multiple ascending dose cohorts, weight loss was maintained for up to 150days after the last dose. These findings support continued clinical evaluation of AMG 133.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight reduction in people living with obesity but without diabetes: a living benefit-harm modelling study [^113nEiz5]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our analyses show that GLP-1 RAs used for weight reduction in people with overweight and obesity result in a net benefit in achieving a 10% weight loss during the initial phases of treatment, particularly in the first and second year. The 5% weight loss was not large enough to outweigh the harms associated with the treatments; however, it could be net beneficial for some individuals, depending on their willingness to accept the harm outcomes.

Most GLP-1 RA harms were mild and could decrease over the duration of treatment. Assuming a contant rate may thus result in an underestimation of the net benefit. This was partially exhibited in some of the included RCTs, wherethe most common adverse effects occurred during the initiation of the treatment and decreased over time. We accounted for this declining rates of harms in our benefit-harm analysis, mainly for those associated with tolerance and adaptation problems, as well as the placebo effect. However, despite this adjustment, the net benefit of achieving a 5% weight loss did not show any important improvement. It is important to note that these findings are specific to individuals strictly adhering to lifestyle changes, including exercise and diet.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight reduction in people living with obesity but without diabetes: a living benefit-harm modelling study [^116C9d4M]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) were initially approved for improvement of metabolic control in patients living with diabetes. However, recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the efficacy of some GLP-1 RAs for weight reduction in adults even without diabetes, leading to semaglutide and liraglutide approval as adjuncts to a calorie-restricted diet and exercise for weight management. Tirzepatide, a newer dual receptor agonist, has also been demonstrated to induce greater weight reductions, and has recently been approved for patients without diabetes in some countries. Early-phase investigations on other emerging medications, particularly retatrutide and orforglipron that target multiple incretin hormone pathways, have shown even greater effects on weight loss.

GLP-1 RAs modulate appetite regulation, which includes slowing gastric emptying, increasing satiety, and reducing appetite, resulting in weight loss. The benefits of weight reduction are consistent across RCTs, with great potential to address the obesity pandemic. Although less studied, GLP-1 RAs may also contribute to a reduction in the risk of weight-related comorbidities. The SELECT trial indicated a 20% reduction in recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events with the GLP-1 RA analogue semaglutide. Despite these impressive clinical effects, questions remain regarding whether the benefits of weight reduction outweigh the associated harms of GLP-1 RAs, including their cost-effectiveness and economic impact. Another challenge is the rapid and steep increase in off-label GLP-1 RAs prescriptions, often lacking physicians' supervision and posing a relevant risk of overuse and misuse. The widespread usage is largely exacerbated by social media hype and celebrity endorsements for "cosmetic" weight loss. Extensive use — without scrutinising in whom the benefits outweigh the harms — not only escalates healthcare expenditure but, more critically, has led to supply shortages, restricting access for individuals living with diabetes.,

The use of GLP-1 RAs for weight control in patients living without diabetes is a relatively new indication for weight management in people living with obesity, with largely unknown long-term effects. However, as evidence on the topic is accumulating rapidly, there is a need for continuous evaluation and monitoring of the benefit-harm balance to guide up-to-date decisions. In the present study, we aim to conduct a benefit harm-balance assessment of GLP-1 RAs, which will be regularly updated as evidence emerges to inform decision-makers, including regulatory bodies, clinical guideline developers, and personalized treatment planning.

### DURATION-1: exenatide once weekly produces sustained glycemic control and weight loss over 52 weeks [^1171MF28]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

In the Diabetes Therapy Utilization: Researching Changes in A1C, Weight and Other Factors Through Intervention with Exenatide Once Weekly (DURATION-1) study, the safety and efficacy of 30 weeks of treatment with the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist exenatide once weekly (exenatide QW; 2 mg) was compared with exenatide BID in 295 patients with type 2 diabetes. We now report the safety and efficacy of exenatide QW in 1) patients who continued treatment for an additional 22 weeks (52 weeks total) and 2) patients who switched from exenatide BID to exenatide QW after 30 weeks.

Research Design and Methods

In this randomized, multicenter, comparator-controlled, open-label trial, 258 patients entered the 22-week open-ended assessment phase (n = 128 QW-only; n = 130 BID→QW). A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, blood pressure, fasting lipids, safety, and tolerability were assessed.

Results

Patients continuing exenatide QW maintained A1C improvements through 52 weeks (least squares mean -2.0% [95% CI -2.1 to -1.8%]). Patients switching from exenatide BID to exenatide QW achieved further A1C improvements; both groups exhibited the same A1C reduction and mean A1C (6.6%) at week 52. At week 52, 71 and 54% of all patients achieved A1C < 7.0% and ≤ 6.5%, respectively. In both treatment arms, FPG was reduced by > 40 mg/dl, and body weight was reduced by > 4 kg after 52 weeks. Nausea occurred less frequently in this assessment period and was predominantly mild. No major hypoglycemia was observed.

Conclusion

Exenatide QW elicited sustained improvements in glycemic control and body weight through 52 weeks of treatment. Patients switching to exenatide QW experienced further improvements in A1C and FPG, with sustained weight loss.

The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies have estimated the cost-effectiveness of GLP-1s for obesity from a healthcare perspective, considering costs for screening and treatment against savings from improved weight and health outcomes and corresponding long-term reductions in healthcare utilization, including downstream accumulated health benefits. All have found that GLP-1 treatment costs exceed healthcare savings. In one analysis, individuals with obesity treated with GLP-1s incurred significantly higher annual healthcare costs than individuals with obesity without GLP-1 use (∼$7000 higher in the first year, and $4200 higher in the second year). Considering cost-effectiveness, i.e. health gained per dollar spent, most studies find that GLP-1s, even at currently discounted prices, do not meet accepted thresholds for cost-effective therapy (e.g. < $150,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained). In nonindustry-sponsored analyses, net costs per quality-adjusted life year have ranged from $237,000 to $483,000, with low cost-effectiveness related to plateauing of weight benefits but continued high costs of treatment, as well as weight regain following any cessation of use. These high costs, lower adherence in practice, and frequent weight regain after discontinuation, each highlight the importance of complementary nutritional and lifestyle counseling to help maximize overall efficacy and cost-effectiveness.

### Why does GLP-1 agonist combined with GIP and / or GCG agonist have greater weight loss effect than GLP-1 agonist alone in obese adults without type 2 diabetes? [^112AAPVj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a chronic condition demanding effective treatment strategies, among which pharmacotherapy plays a critical role. As glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for long-term weight management in adults with obesity, liraglutide and semaglutide have great weight loss effect through reducing food intake and delaying gastric emptying. The emergence of unimolecular polypharmacology, which utilizes single molecules to simultaneously target multiple receptors or pathways, marked a revolutionary improvement in GLP-1-based obesity pharmacotherapy. The dual agonist tirzepatide activates both GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors and has shown enhanced potency for weight loss compared to conventional GLP-1 mono agonist. Furthermore, emerging data suggests that unimolecular GLP-1/glucagon (GCG) dual agonist, as well as GLP-1/GIP/GCG triple agonist, may offer superior weight loss efficacy over GLP-1 agonist. This review summarizes the comprehensive mechanisms underlying the pronounced advantages of GLP-1/GIP dual agonist, GLP-1/GCG dual agonist and GLP-1/GIP/GCG triple agonist over GLP-1 mono agonist in weight reduction in obese adults without type 2 diabetes. A deeper understanding of these unimolecular multitargeting GLP-1-based agonists will provide insights for their clinical application and guide the development of new drugs for obesity treatment.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight reduction in people living with obesity but without diabetes: a living benefit-harm modelling study [^1119hpAP]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The benefit of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) in weight reduction against potential harms remains unclear. This study aimed at evaluating the benefit-harm balance of initiating GLP-1 RAs versus placebo for weight loss in people living with overweight and obesity but without diabetes.

Methods

We performed benefit-harm balance modelling, which will be updated as new evidence emerges. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in PubMed, controlled trials registry, drug approval and regulatory documents, and outcome preference weights as of April 10, 2024. We synthesize data using pairwise meta-analysis to estimate the effect of GLP-1 RAs to inform the benefit-harm balance modelling. We predicted the absolute effects of the positive and negative outcomes over 1 and 2 years of treatment using exponential models. We applied preference weights to the outcomes, ranging from 0 for least concerning to 1.0 for most concerning. We then calculated whether the benefit of achieving 5% and 10% weight loss outweighed the harms on a common scale. The analyses accounted for the statistical uncertainties of treatment effects, preference weights, and outcome risks.

Findings

We included 8 RCTs involving 8847 participants. The pooled average age was 46.7 years, with the majority being women (74%) and people living with obesity (96%). Of 1000 persons treated with GLP-1 RAs for 2 years, 375 (95% confidence interval 352 to 399) achieved a 10% weight loss, and 318 (296 to 339) achieved a 5% weight loss compared to those treated with placebo. Several harm outcomes were more frequent in the GLP-1 RA group, including 41 abdominal pain events per 1000 persons over 2 years (19 to 69), cholelithiasis (8, 1 to 21), constipation (118, 78 to 164), diarrhoea (100, 42 to 173), alopecia (57, 10 to 176), hypoglycaemia (17, 1 to 68), injection site reactions (4, -3 to 19), and vomiting (110, 80 to 145) among others. Achieving a 10% weight loss with GLP-1 RA therapy outweighed the cumulative harms, with a net benefit probability of 0.97 at year 1 and 0.91 at year 2. The absolute net benefit was equivalent to 104 (100 to 112) per 1000 persons achieving a 10% weight loss over 2 years without experiencing any worrisome harm. A 5% weight loss did not show a net benefit, with probabilities of 0.13 and 0.01 at year 1 and year 2, respectively. However, these benefits were sensitive to preference weights, suggesting that even a 5% weight loss could be net beneficial for individuals with less concern about harm outcomes. The net benefit for a 10% weight loss was highest for semaglutide, followed by liraglutide and tirzepatide, with 2-year probabilities of 0.96, 0.72, and 0.60, respectively.

Interpretation

The benefit of GLP-1 RAs exceeded the harms for weight loss in the first 2 years of treatment, yet the net benefit was dependent on individual' treatment goals (10% or 5% weight loss) and willingness to accept harms in pursuit of weight loss. This implies that treatment decisions have to be personalized to individuals to optimize benefits and reduce harms and overuse of treatments. Due to varying evidence, especially regarding harm outcomes across studies, it is necessary to continuously update and monitor the benefit-harm balance of GLP-1 RAs.

### Muscle mass and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: adaptive or maladaptive response to weight loss? [^1173EyS2]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have shown that pharmacologic weight loss with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and combination therapies is approaching magnitudes achieved with surgery. However, as more weight loss is achieved, there is concern for potential adverse effects on muscle quantity, composition, and function. This primer aims to address whether muscle-related changes associated with weight loss treatments such as GLP-1 RAs may be maladaptive (ie, adversely affecting muscle health or function), adaptive (ie, a physiologic response to weight loss maintaining or minimally affecting muscle health or function), or perhaps an enhanced response to weight loss (ie, improved muscle health or function after treatment). Based on contemporary evidence with the addition of studies using magnetic resonance imaging, skeletal muscle changes with GLP-1 RA treatments appear to be adaptive: changes in muscle volume z-score indicate a change in muscle volume that is commensurate with what is expected given aging, disease status, and weight loss achieved, and the improvement in insulin sensitivity and muscle fat infiltration likely contributes to an adaptive process with improved muscle quality, lowering the probability for loss in strength and function. Nevertheless, factors such as older age and prefrailty may influence the selection of appropriate candidates for these therapies because of risk for sarcopenia. Several pharmacologic treatments to maintain or improve muscle mass designed in combination with GLP-1-based therapies are under development. For future development of GLP-1-based therapies (and other therapies) designed for weight loss, as well as for patient-centered treatment optimization, the introduction of more objective and comprehensive ways of assessing muscle health (including accurate and meaningful assessments of muscle quantity, composition, function, mobility, and strength) is important for the substantial numbers of patients who will likely be taking these medications well into the future.

### Analysis of the long-term impact of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists for control of obesity and obesity-related comorbidities: a meta-analysis [^1128XZzW]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

GLP-1 receptor agonist medications are a promising new medical weight loss therapy and have been shown to reduce rates of obesity-related comorbidities. The aim of this meta-analysis was to examine the long-term effects of these medications.

Methods

A meta-analysis was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Data were collected on weight change, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension prevalence with GLP-1 or placebo therapy in studies meeting inclusion criteria per study protocol.

Results

A total of 54 articles and 59,856 patients were included in this study. GLP-1-treated patients were noted to lose an average of 10.6% of total body weight (TBW) compared to placebo at 3.9%, with a peak occurring at 12–18 months of treatment. When subdivided into intention-to-treat and adherent patients, those maintaining medication use lost more weight at a peak of 12% TBW loss. Weight regain with medication discontinuation was found to occur within weeks at a rate of 0.55% original TBW per month. The incident rate of type 2 diabetes was reduced sevenfold by GLP therapy over placebo. Hypertension resolution was also noted to be higher in the GLP-1-treated patients at a peak of 23% reduction compared to 11% for placebo.

Conclusion

GLP-1 medications are effective at weight reduction and can produce diabetes and hypertension remission. Medication adherence is critical for efficacy, and non-compliance dramatically reduces the impact of these therapies. Additionally, medication discontinuation results in rapid weight regain within weeks; however, longer-term data are needed to qualify the durability of GLP-1-mediated weight loss.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in gynecologic surgery [^117NbRCy]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have rapidly expanded beyond their initial role in diabetes management to become prominent agents for weight loss and metabolic optimization. A growing number of patients receiving these therapies are presenting for gynecologic surgery. This narrative review summarizes current evidence on GLP-1 RAs, including their mechanisms of action, clinical benefits, and perioperative considerations, with particular attention to their effects on gastric emptying and the associated risk of aspiration. Early recommendations advised routine discontinuation of GLP-1 RAs before surgery because of theoretical concerns about delayed gastric emptying. However, recent multisociety guidance supports continued use for most patients, with individualized risk assessment and perioperative strategies such as preoperative liquid diets for those at higher risk. These evolving recommendations reflect a shift toward balancing the metabolic and weight loss benefits of GLP-1 RAs with perioperative safety considerations. As clinical experience with these agents grows, ongoing research and multidisciplinary collaboration remain essential to ensure optimal outcomes for patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.

Statistical analysis

Sample size estimation for the 20-week trial was based on the primary outcome weight. It was assumed that the s.d. for weight change at week 20 would be 5.6 kg;547 randomized individuals (91 per group) provided ⩾85% confidence to detect a clinically relevant 3 kg difference (P = 0.05, two-sided) in mean weight between people dosed with liraglutide and placebo, based on Dunnett's test. A drop-out rate of 30% after 20 weeks was assumed. The objective of the extension was to evaluate safety and weight-loss durability. Data were analyzed according to a pre-established analysis plan. All analyses were performed on a modified intention-to-treat population, comprising all randomized individuals who received at least one treatment dose and had at least one post-randomization assessment of body weight, with the last-observation-carried-forward for efficacy endpoints (unless stated). Analysis of completers (those in the intention-to-treat population who completed the trial period) from screening was also performed post hoc. All analyses were two-sided, with 5% significance. The numbers of values that were imputed at year 1 and year 2 for the parameters weight, waist circumference, BP, fasting lipids, prediabetes and metabolic syndrome are shown in Supplementary Table 1.

### Role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in achieving weight loss and improving cardiovascular outcomes in people with overweight and obesity [^1158SHgA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Although the cardiovascular outcome trials in people with T2D have reassuring safety data up to ≥ 5 years (Table 2), the length of trial follow‐up in people with overweight or obesity was of shorter duration, up to 72 weeks (Table 1). The ongoing SELECT cardiovascular outcome trial (NCT03574597) will provide additional insights into longer‐term safety data in this population, as well as data from continued postmarketing surveillance.

Generally, after initiation, GLP‐1 RA therapy is intended to be long term. Data from the STEP 1 trial showed that 1 year after stopping their GLP‐1 RA therapy, participants regained approximately two‐thirds of their prior weight loss. It should be noted that weight regain has been commonly reported with cessation of other pharmacotherapies such as orlistat and locaserin, as well as with lifestyle interventions.

### Effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on weight loss: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^112XaQjv]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and clinical implications

Participants who are overweight are likely to develop type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, liver disease, and eventually cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, these participants have a considerably elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. Traditional treatments for obesity are, unfortunately, often short lived and consequently not especially effective.

Current treatments for patients with type 2 diabetes are associated with shortcomings (weight gain, hypoglycaemia, and other side effects) that limit the number of patients reaching acceptable therapeutic goals. The present meta-analysis provides convincing evidence that GLP-1R agonists, when given to obese patients with or without diabetes, results in clinically relevant beneficial effects on body weight. Additional beneficial effects on blood pressure and total cholesterol might also be achieved. The intervention should be considered in patients with diabetes who are obese or overweight. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of GLP-1R agonists in the treatment of obese patients without diabetes.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^116JEHaY]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outside randomized clinical trial settings, data on weight loss with semaglutide or liraglutide for obesity are generally limited to 6 months of follow-up, based on brand names approved by the FDA for T2D only, or cohorts that exclude patients who did not persist with the treatment. Furthermore, emerging data suggest that persistent coverage with GLP-1 RAs (ie, a cumulative gap of less than 90 days), is difficult to achieve, but little is known about how persistence affects weight loss. Such understanding could inform the need and scope of future research, as well as clinical and policy interventions aimed at addressing the barriers to the use of these medications. We examined weight outcomes at 1 year in patients with obesity who received injectable forms of liraglutide or semaglutide and compared outcomes by GLP-1 RA agent, indication, dosage, and persistent coverage with the medication.

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^11222hio]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes — weight management pharmacotherapy indications and preferred agents: Pharmacotherapy is indicated for individuals with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 or ≥ 27 kg/m2 with comorbidities, and in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, agents with both glucose-lowering and weight loss effects are preferred and include GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and the dual GIP and GLP-1 RA class; some agents (liraglutide, semaglutide, tirzepatide) have an indication for glucose lowering as well as weight management. Phentermine and other older adrenergic agents are approved for short-term treatment, while others are approved for long-term treatment. If these medications do not achieve weight goals or are not tolerated or are contraindicated, other obesity treatment approaches should be considered.

### Slow and steady wins the race: 25 years developing the GLP-1 receptor as an effective target for weight loss [^111iSNyj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Recent evidence from clinical trials supports the efficacy and tolerability of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists as useful agents for weight loss. Although originally developed as glucose lowering agents for people with type 2 diabetes, progress in research over the last 3 decades has demonstrated that GLP-1 receptor agonists act in the central nervous system to reduce food intake. This minireview summarizes key aspects of GLP-1 biology and the clinical studies supporting the utility of the GLP-1 receptor signaling system as a therapeutic target for weight loss.

Fig 2 Meta-analysis of change in body weight (kg) in included trials after at least 20 weeks of treatment, using random effects model

A repeat of the initial meta-analyses with fixed effects models confirmed the primary meta-analysis. The regression analysis did not show any clear evidence of bias or small study effects (Egger's test, P > 0.1 for all analyses). We saw no difference in bodyweight changes for patients assigned liraglutide versus exenatide twice daily (−0.4 kg, 95% confidence interval –1.3 to 0.6), or for those assigned exenatide as a long acting release versus exenatide twice daily (–0.6 kg, –1.5 to 0.3). Subgroup analyses showed a weight reduction in trials assessing exenatide twice daily (–2.8 kg, –2.9 to –2.7), exenatide once weekly (–2.8 kg, –5.2 to –0.3), and liraglutide (–2.2 kg, –3.5 to –0.9). We also saw a weight reduction for trials in which the control group received placebo (–1.9 kg, –2.9 to –0.9; 10 trials), insulin (–4.8 kg, –5.1 to –4.5; six trials), oral antidiabetic drugs including metformin or sulphonylurea compounds (–3.0 kg, –4.9 to –1.2; three trials), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (–2.0 kg, –2.9 to –1.1; two trials). Random effects meta-regression of the primary meta-analysis found that body mass index at baseline and trial duration did not predict the size of the estimated intervention or explain intertrial heterogeneity (P = 0.293 and P = 0.284, respectively).

We did the sequential analysis based on the results of the primary meta-analysis, including the highest dose of GLP-1R agonists assessed compared with controls. The analysis showed that the cumulative Z curve crossed the monitoring boundary after the seventh trial, which suggested that we had sufficient evidence (that is, the optimal information size was reached) to confirm the intervention effect after adjusting for multiple testing and random error.

### GLP-1 single, dual, and triple receptor agonists for treating type 2 diabetes and obesity: a narrative review [^114iZozK]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) offers a multifaceted approach to addressing both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. By enhancing insulin secretion, improving insulin sensitivity, and decreasing hepatic glucose production, GLP-1RAs play a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels. Additionally, their effects on appetite suppression and satiety contribute to weight loss and management. The wide array of available GLP-1RAs, from short-acting to long-acting formulations, provide clinicians with various options to tailor treatment to individual patient needs. Furthermore, the emergence of novel agents such as tirzepatide, dual and triple hormonal agonists, expands the therapeutic landscape for managing T2DM effectively. While the potential of GLP-1RAs in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) treatment shows promise, further research is warranted to elucidate their efficacy and safety profile in this population fully. Overall, GLP-1RAs represent a valuable class of medications with diverse applications in diabetes management, offering hope for improved outcomes and better quality of life for patients with diabetes and obesity.

GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in managing obesity have demonstrated significant efficacy in promoting weight loss and improving cardiometabolic parameters. Liraglutide, semaglutide, tirzepatide, orforglipron, retatrutide, and other emerging agents have shown substantial reductions in body weight when used as monotherapy or combined with lifestyle interventions. These agents aid in weight reduction and exhibit beneficial effects on appetite control, glycemic control, and cardiovascular health.

Furthermore, dual and triple receptor agonists, such as tirzepatide and retatrutide, offer additional advantages by targeting multiple pathways involved in energy regulation, resulting in enhanced weight loss and improved metabolic outcomes compared to traditional GLP-1 RAs. Despite the promising efficacy of these agents, it is essential to consider their safety profiles, particularly regarding gastrointestinal adverse effects, which are common but generally transient and manageable. Additionally, concerns regarding the risk of pancreatitis, thyroid disorders, and depression with the use of GLP-1 RAs require careful monitoring and further investigation. While current evidence suggests no significant increase in these risks, ongoing research is needed to understand better the long-term safety and efficacy of these medications in diverse patient populations.

Overall, GLP-1 RAs represent a valuable therapeutic option for individuals with obesity, offering not only significant weight loss but also potential benefits for cardiometabolic health. Continued research and clinical monitoring will help optimize their use and maximize patient outcomes in managing obesity and related metabolic conditions.

### Managing insulin resistance: the forgotten pathophysiological component of type 2 diabetes [^113To2QV]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have gained widespread use in the treatment of individuals with type 2 diabetes because of their potent weight loss promoting effect, ability to augment β-cell function, and cardiovascular protective effects. However, despite causing impressive weight loss, GLP-1 receptor agonists do not normalise insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes and obesity, and the long-term effects of this class of antidiabetic medication on muscle mass, frailty, and bone density have been poorly studied. Although GLP-1 receptor agonists improve insulin sensitivity secondary to weight loss, the only true direct insulin-sensitising drugs are thiazolidinediones. Because of side-effects associated with type 2 diabetes therapy, these drugs have not gained widespread use. In lieu of the important role of insulin resistance in the cause of type 2 diabetes and in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes, development of potent insulin-sensitising drugs that can be used in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists remains a large unmet need in the management of individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Trial Data Supporting the Use of‐1in Obesity

GLP‐1 RAs have also been shown to be effective for weight management and maintenance of weight loss in the treatment of people with overweight or obesity (Table 1). Because absolute weight losses are greater for individuals without diabetes, trials included individuals with obesity, both with and without T2D. In the Phase 3a Satiety and Clinical Adiposity – Liraglutide Evidence in individuals with and without diabetes (SCALE) program, treatment with once‐daily subcutaneous liraglutide 3.0 mg was associated with significantly greater and sustained weight loss compared with placebo in individuals with overweight and obesity with and without diabetes. Additionally, improvements in various cardiometabolic risk factors were also seen (Table 1). Similarly, in a post hoc analysis of the SCALE trials, it was determined that liraglutide 3.0 mg was not associated with excess cardiovascular risk.

Summary Takeaway Messages

- Despite the ability of GLP-1s to produce significant weight reduction and related health benefits, challenges such as GI side effects, risk of nutrient inadequacies, loss of muscle and bone mass, high costs, frequent discontinuation, and weight regain limit the use of these drugs for long-term success in individuals and populations.
- Clinicians prescribing GLP-1s for obesity management should focus on and help mitigate these challenges by developing care plans that include thorough nutritional and lifestyle counseling before, during, and after the weight reduction period.
- Such comprehensive care will support treatment benefits beyond body weight alone and will make clinicians more effective stewards of GLP-1s and, ultimately, of patients' overall health.

### Effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on weight loss: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^112eu2FN]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of the findings

Unlike previous reviews, we were able to gather data for outcomes that were not described in the published reports. Outcome measures are less likely to be described in published reports if the result is not significant. Therefore, the retrieval of unpublished outcome data could reduce the risk of reporting bias (that is, selective reporting of outcomes with a positive result). The present review also differed from previous reviews by the inclusion of patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although the non-specific inclusion criteria increased intertrial heterogeneity, they also improved the external validity of our findings. Furthermore, to achieve and maintain clinically relevant weight loss, we only included trials that followed participants for a sufficient period (20 weeks or more).

Inadequate randomisation and attrition bias could lead to overestimated benefits of an intervention. None of the included trials had deficiencies in the reported randomisation methods and all accounted for the intention to treat population in their results and analyses. These aspects support the internal validity of our findings. Since we only included trials that used clinically relevant doses given for clinically relevant treatment periods, the results can be extrapolated to clinical practice. Accordingly, the present review can help evidence based practitioners determine the size of the treatment benefit.

All the included trials received industry funding. Previous evidence and clinical examples have described that financial interests could lead to bias in intervention comparisons. On the other hand, funding could be associated with adequate control of bias. Furthermore, in a large cohort of randomised trials, industry funding was associated with more positive author conclusions, but not with the quantitative results of the trials. Since we did not identify trials without funding, we were unable to make subgroup analyses to explore the potential effect of competing interests. We did, however, undertake rigorous assessments of the quality of included trials. None of our analyses showed any evidence of selection, assessment, attrition, or outcome reporting bias. These analyses support the validity of our results.

### Real-world weight-loss effectiveness of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists among patients with type 2 diabetes: a retrospective cohort study [^117692RN]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Weight loss achieved with standard doses of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists among real-world patients with type 2 diabetes has not been determined. This study sought to describe the percent change in body weight 72weeks after starting a GLP-1 agonist.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of nonpregnant adults who were first dispensed a GLP-1 agonist between 2011 and 2018 was conducted using electronic health record data from patients receiving care at a large health system. Linear mixed models were used, with a person-level random intercept controlling for baseline variables associated with missing weight data to estimate percent body weight change during follow-up.

Results

The cohort included 2405 patients (mean [SD] age 48 [10] years, 53% female), with a mean BMI of 37 (8) kg/m 2 and a mean baseline weight of 238 (54) lb. Mean percent weight loss significantly increased from 1.1% (95% CI: 0.6%-1.6%) 8weeks after GLP-1-agonist dispensing to 2.2% (95% CI: 1.7%-2.6%) 72weeks after GLP-1-agonist dispensing (p value for quadratic trend < 0.001). One-third of patients lost ≥ 5% body weight at 72weeks.

Conclusions

In this real-world study of more than 2400 patients with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes, starting a GLP-1 agonist at standard glycemic control doses was associated with modest weight loss through 72weeks.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^117DDcMb]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

GLP-1 therapy efficacy magnitude and durability summarize trial and real-world effects and temporal patterns. In the original phase 3 randomized trials for obesity, average weight reduction compared to placebo has ranged from 5.3% to 17.8% after 56–72 weeks. In real-world practice, the efficacy for weight reduction is often lower: for example, about 8% for individuals with diabetes and 11% for individuals without diabetes at 60 weeks with semaglutide 2.4 mg/day. Generally, weight reduction is more rapid during the first 6 months and then slower thereafter, with relative plateauing at 18 months. When GLP-1 use is continued, weight reduction is sustained for at least 4 years, whereas when GLP-1s are stopped, weight regain is common — typically nearly to baseline within one year.

### Time-dependent effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on cardiovascular benefits: a real-world study [^115ZVTTG]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have shown cardiovascular benefits in cardiovascular outcome trials in type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the most convincing evidence was obtained in subjects with established cardiovascular (CV) disease. We analyzed the determinants of GLP-1 RA-mediated CV protection in a real-world population of persons with type 2 diabetes with and without a history of CV events with long-term follow-up.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of 550 individuals with type 2 diabetes (395 in primary CV prevention, 155 in secondary CV prevention), followed at a single center after the first prescription of a GLP-1 RA between 2009 and 2019. CV and metabolic outcomes were assessed.

Results

Median duration of follow-up was 5.0 years (0.25–10.8) in primary prevention and 3.6 years (0–10.3) in secondary prevention, with a median duration of treatment of 3.2 years (0–10.8) and 2.5 years (0–10.3) respectively. In the multivariable Cox regression model considering GLP-1 RA treatment as a time-dependent covariate, in the primary prevention group, changes in BMI and glycated hemoglobin did not have an impact on MACE risk, while age at the time of GLP-1 initiation (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03–1.14, p = 0.001) and GLP-1 RA cessation by time (HR 3.40, 95% CI 1.82–6.32, p < 0.001) increased the risk of MACE. Regarding the secondary prevention group, only GLP-1 RA cessation by time (HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.46–5.01, p = 0.002) increased the risk of MACE. With respect to those who withdrew treatment, subjects who continued the GLP-1 RA had significantly greater weight loss and lower glycated hemoglobin levels during follow-up.

Conclusions

In this real-world type 2 diabetes population, discontinuation of GLP-1 RA treatment was associated to a higher risk of major cardiovascular events, in both subjects with and without a history of CV events.

### Early weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg predicts 1-year weight loss and is associated with improvements in clinical markers [^117AjMRc]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

It is well documented that early response to a weight loss intervention can predict long‐term weight loss 8, 9, 10, 11; this is the basis for the stopping rules for all recently approved weight loss medications 19, 20, 21. Weight loss response after 1 to 4 months has been used to predict weight loss at 1 year. Interestingly, in the Look AHEAD study, 1‐ and 2‐month weight loss was associated with weight loss through year 8 among individuals with T2D who received an intensive lifestyle intervention 7.

In order to identify an optimal early response criterion for liraglutide 3.0 mg, we examined weight loss of ≥ 3%, 4%, or 5% at 8, 12, or 16 weeks in a pooled analysis predefined with the US FDA before trial data became available. Weight loss of ≥ 4% at week 16 was shown to be the best predictor of ≥ 5% weight loss at 56 weeks and to be appropriate for individuals with and without T2D and for both genders (Table 1, Supporting Information Table S1). Earlier time points would result in discontinuation of treatment in a significant number of individuals who would indeed achieve ≥ 5% weight loss after 56 weeks, while later time points would likely have achieved even greater predictive accuracy but were not considered as they would have entailed additional unnecessary exposure in nonresponders. Accordingly, the stopping rule in the USA specifies a weight loss of ≥ 4% at 16 weeks 22. While health authorities across the world focus on limiting treatment to those who will benefit, their approaches differ slightly. The European Medicines Agency required an early response criterion optimized to exclude individuals who were unlikely to achieve ≥ 10% weight loss at 56 weeks; this was best fulfilled by weight loss of ≥ 5% after 16 weeks (data not shown). Accordingly, the European label requires ≥ 5% weight loss after 12 weeks on the full 3.0 mg dose to qualify for continued treatment 23.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^117BNsw4]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With high and rising rates of adiposity and related morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditures, recently approved glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and related combination obesity medications are shifting the treatment landscape (we collectively refer to these as "GLP-1s" given this common practical usage by clinicians, policymakers, and the public; we acknowledge the lack of any widely accepted terminology to describe this new class of obesity medications. In randomized trials, GLP-1s produce placebo-adjusted weight reduction of 5% to 18% among individuals with obesity or overweight and weight-related complications. This efficacy has generated enormous attention and utilization. In 2024, 6% of United States (US) adults report current GLP-1 use, and 12% report current or past use — rising to 22% among individuals told by a clinician that they have overweight or obesity.

Despite the efficacy and growing utilization of these medications, real-world challenges are increasingly evident. These include gastrointestinal (GI) side effects; risk of inadequate nutrient intake from reduced food intake combined with insufficient nutritional counseling; potential loss of significant muscle mass and bone density; high discontinuation rates (e.g. 50%–67% at 1 y and 85% at 2 y) that may relate to side effects, costs, variable individual efficacy, or patient preferences; and limited public and clinician knowledge on the importance and implementation of complementary nutritional and lifestyle changes.

All these challenges may be partially mitigated by an evidence-based, structured lifestyle program, particularly around food, when prescribing GLP-1s for obesity. However, practical guidance for clinicians to implement such an approach is limited. This Advisory combines expertise across clinical and research societies focused on obesity, lifestyle, and nutrition to provide such guidance. It addresses current topics of interest among patients and clinicians, summarizes uncertainties, and highlights future research directions. Although the general focus is on the US context, the recommendations have implications for use of GLP-1s for obesity management globally.

### Intervention with therapeutic agents, understanding the path to remission to type 2 diabetes: part 2 [^116yKcDM]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by progressive decline in pancreatic β-cell function. Newer agents, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) and dual incretin agonists, can augment β-cell function and delay the need for additional antihyperglycemics. However, the effect on β-cell function ceases after stopping the medications. When combined with intensive lifestyle modifications, higher doses of GLP-1RA than those used for diabetes treatment can be used to induce weight loss. More research is needed on whether the weight loss achieved with GLP1-RA can be sustained after stopping medication and in turn can sustain diabetes remission.

2.3 Research outcomes

The dual primary outcomes of the study were to describe the proportion of patients with (1) HbA1c < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) and (2) no weight loss or weight loss of > 0%– < 5%, ≥ 5%– < 10%, ≥ 10%– < 15% and ≥ 15% compared with baseline, both after 6 months of continuous QW injectable GLP‐1 RA therapy. Additional stratification was also performed by T2D duration.

Secondary outcomes were to describe baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of the study population and, after 6 months of continuous QW injectable GLP‐RA use, the proportion of patients (1) achieving both a 1% (11 mmol/mol) HbA1c reduction and no weight loss or weight loss of > 0%– < 5%, ≥ 5%– < 10%, ≥ 10%– < 15% and ≥ 15%, overall and stratified by clinical/treatment characteristics and socio‐demographics; and (2) achieving a composite of HbA1c < 7% and no weight loss or weight loss of > 0%– < 5%, ≥ 5%– < 10%, ≥ 10%– < 15% and ≥ 15%. The proportion of patients not achieving ≥ 1% HbA1c reduction and ≥ 3% weight loss but continuing with index GLP‐1 RA therapy after 6 months of continuous QW injectable GLP‐1 RA use was also described. After 6, 12 and 18 months, the proportion of patients achieving (1) HbA1c < 7% or < 7.5% (< 58 mmol/mol) and (2) no weight loss or weight loss of > 0– < 5%, ≥ 5%– < 10%, ≥ 10%– < 15% and ≥ 15% was also described, overall and stratified by baseline HbA1c and body mass index (BMI), respectively. Additional analyses for BMI were carried out within ethnic minorities to reflect NICE guidelines on GLP‐1 RA therapy, which recommend BMI adjustment for certain ethnic groups.

### Effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on weight loss: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^112PTYtv]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

The patient characteristics at baseline and the diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes were very similar across trials. Mean body mass index ranged from 29 to 41, and mean weight from 82 to 111 kg, for both the GLP-1R agonist groups and the control groups. For patients with type 2 diabetes, the mean concentration of fasting plasma glucose at baseline ranged from 8.0 to 11.7 mmol/L for GLP-1R agonist groups, and from 8.2 to 11.2 mmol/L for control groups. Mean values of HbA 1c at baseline ranged from 7.6% to 10.4% for GLP-1R agonists and 7.4% to 10.3% for controls, respectively.

Table 1
Characteristics of included trials

The included trials assessed exenatide twice daily (n = 13 trials), liraglutide (n = 8), and exenatide once weekly (n = 4; table 1). Three trials directly compared exenatide twice daily with liraglutide or with exenatide once weekly. The dose of liraglutide given in most trials was 1.2 or 1.8 mg/day; one trial of obese individuals without diabetes also used doses of 2.4 and 3 mg/day. The doses of exenatide used were 10 to 20 µg/day or 2 mg/week. The GLP-1R agonists were given as subcutaneous injections once daily for liraglutide, and twice daily and once weekly for exenatide. The control groups received placebo, third generation sulphonylurea compounds, insulin, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, or metformin. In trials of patients with type 2 diabetes, cointerventions given to the intervention and control group included metformin, sulphonylurea compounds, or thiazolidinediones.

Quality of bias control

Allocation sequence generation and allocation concealment were adequate in all trials. None of the trials found differences in the baseline characteristics of participants between the GLP-1R agonist and control groups. Thirteen trials were double blind, with masking of both patients and investigators. None of the included trials reported the success of blinding. All trials reported clinically relevant outcome measures, provided a clear description of losses to follow-up, accounted for patients with missing data in the analyses, and undertook sample size calculations. None of the trials were terminated prematurely. We found no evidence of reporting bias when comparing published trial protocols with subsequent trial reports.

### Safety, tolerability and sustained weight loss over 2 years with the once-daily human GLP-1 analog, liraglutide [^11579aad]. International Journal of Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Having demonstrated short-term weight loss with liraglutide in this group of obese adults, we now evaluate safety/tolerability (primary outcome) and long-term efficacy for sustaining weight loss (secondary outcome) over 2 years.

Design

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 20-week study with 2-year extension (sponsor unblinded at 20 weeks, participants/investigators at 1 year) in 19 European clinical research centers.

Subjects

A total of 564 adults (n = 90–98 per group; body mass index 30–40kgm(-2)) enrolled, 398 entered the extension and 268 completed the 2-year trial. Participants received diet (500kcaldeficit per day) and exercise counseling during 2-week run-in, before being randomly assigned (with a telephone or web-based system) to once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide (1.2, 1.8, 2.4 or 3.0mg, n = 90–95), placebo (n = 98) or open-label orlistat (120mg × 3, n = 95). After 1 year, liraglutide/placebo recipients switched to liraglutide 2.4mg, then 3.0mg (based on 20-week and 1-year results, respectively). The trial ran from January 2007-April 2009 and is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT00480909.

Results

From randomization to year 1, liraglutide 3.0mg recipients lost 5.8kg (95% confidence interval 3.7–8.0) more weight than those on placebo and 3.8kg (1.6–6.0) more than those on orlistat (P0.0001; intention-to-treat, last-observation-carried-forward). At year 2, participants on liraglutide 2.4/3.0mg for the full 2 years (pooled group, n = 184) lost 3.0kg (1.3–4.7) more weight than those on orlistat (n = 95; P < 0.001). Completers on liraglutide 2.4/3.0mg (n = 92) maintained a 2-year weight loss of 7.8kg from screening. With liraglutide 3.0mg, 20-week body fat decreased by 15.4% and lean tissue by 2.0%. The most frequent drug-related side effects were mild to moderate, transient nausea and vomiting. With liraglutide 2.4/3.0mg, the 2-year prevalence of prediabetes and metabolic syndrome decreased by 52 and 59%, with improvements in blood pressure and lipids.

Conclusion

Liraglutide is well tolerated, sustains weight loss over 2 years and improves cardiovascular risk factors.

The ASA used such terms as "suggest", "consider", and "advise". We suggest that an individualized approach be taken to managing patients on GLP-1 RAs in the pre-endoscopic setting, and if patients are taking GLP-1 RAs solely for weight loss a dose of the medication could be withheld before endoscopy with likely little harm, although this should not be considered mandatory or evidence-based; there is insufficient evidence to suggest this practice be performed for patients taking these medications to treat diabetes, particularly because good glycemic control is important before sedation/ anesthesia and endoscopy.

### Incretin-based weight loss pharmacotherapy: can resistance exercise optimize changes in body composition? [^113iWLk6]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

This narrative review highlights the degree to which new antiobesity medications based on gut-derived nutrient-stimulated hormones (incretins) cause loss of lean mass, and the importance of resistance exercise to preserve muscle. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) induce substantial weight loss in randomized trials, effects that may be enhanced in combination with glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonists. Liraglutide and semaglutide (GLP-1RA), tirzepatide (GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist), and retatrutide (GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptor triple agonist) are peptides with incretin agonist activity that induce ∼15–24% weight loss in adults with overweight and obesity, alongside beneficial impacts on blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose, and insulin. However, these agents also cause rapid and significant loss of lean mass (∼10% or ∼6 kg), comparable to a decade or more of aging. Maintaining muscle mass and function as humans age is crucial to avoiding sarcopenia and frailty, which are strongly linked to morbidity and mortality. Studies indicate that supervised resistance exercise training interventions with a duration > 10 weeks can elicit large increases in lean mass (∼3 kg) and strength (∼25%) in men and women. After a low-calorie diet, combining aerobic exercise with liraglutide improved weight loss maintenance compared with either alone. Retaining lean mass during incretin therapy could blunt body weight (and fat) regain on cessation of weight loss pharmacotherapy. We propose that tailored resistance exercise training be recommended as an adjunct to incretin therapy to optimize changes in body composition by preserving lean mass while achieving fat loss.

### Obesity therapeutics: the end of the beginning [^115kDenk]. Cell Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Obese non-diabetic patients receiving semaglutide, an injectable long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, in a large randomized placebo-controlled trial, lost and maintained ∼15% of their body weight for over a year (Wilding et al., 2021). This impressive result is likely to usher in a new era of anti-obesity drugs based on hormones that suppress food intake, largely through acting on the brain.

### GLP-1 physiology in obesity and development of incretin-based drugs for chronic weight management [^116JUTw4]. Nature Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The introduction of the highly potent incretin receptor agonists semaglutide and tirzepatide has marked a new era in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. With normalisation of glycated haemoglobin levels and weight losses around 15–25%, therapeutic goals that were previously unrealistic are now within reach, and clinical trials have documented that these effects are associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events and premature mortality. Here, I review this remarkable development from the earliest observations of glucose lowering and modest weight losses with native glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and short acting compounds, to the recent development of highly active formulations and new molecules. I will classify these agents as GLP-1-based therapies in the understanding that these compounds or combinations may have actions on other receptors as well. The physiology of GLP-1 is discussed as well as its mechanisms of actions in obesity, in particular, the role of sensory afferents and GLP-1 receptors in the brain. I provide details regarding the development of GLP-1 receptor agonists for anti-obesity therapy and discuss the possible mechanism behind their beneficial effects on adverse cardiovascular events. Finally, I highlight new pharmacological developments, including oral agents, and discuss important questions regarding maintenance therapy.

### Weight maintenance on cost-effective antiobesity medications after 1 year of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy: a real-world study [^114bcN9D]. Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

In total, 105 patients enrolled in the MWLB achieved an average weight loss of 22.2% ± 3.3% at 12 months compared to baseline (Table 4). Of note, this includes all patients who received 12 months of AOM therapy, regardless of treatment completion or type (novel GLP‐1 RA therapy and/or older generic options). At 18 months, 27 patients had extractable body weight data from the obesity clinic within 45 days of the 18‐month window and maintained their weight, with an average BMI of 29.0 ± 0.8 kg/m 2. At an average of 576 ± 20.2 days after the initial visit, weight loss was maintained at a mean of 25.2% ± 2.2% compared to baseline (n = 77 with extractable weight data available in electronic health record from primary care or specialist visits). At 24 months, patients maintained a mean weight loss of 16.1% ± 1.6% (n = 5 with extractable weight data available). Although some weight regain was observed by 24 months, the difference in weight reduction between 18 months and 24 months was not statistically significant. Notably, 25.7% (n = 27) of patients followed up with a specialist obesity medicine provider at 18 months, whereas 73.3% (n = 77) of patients followed up with their primary care physician and/or another provider at the 576‐day time frame and had extractable weight data in the electronic health record, likely due to end of bundle enrollment coverage and discharge from the obesity clinic with a referral back to primary care. However, compliance and adherence dropped significantly at the 24‐month mark, with only 4.7% of the patients following up with either an obesity provider or a primary care physician. This suggests that the 18‐ to 24‐month weight maintenance phase may be a critical time to educate primary care providers on the importance of continued and more frequent medical visits to prevent weight regain until stability is achieved.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^113NBNLv]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Improving long-term adherence

While persistent GLP-1 therapy is recommended for obesity control and weight maintenance, most individuals prescribed GLP-1s for obesity treatment stop taking the drug within one year. Although demographic and clinical predictors of discontinuation have been assessed, the underlying reasons for discontinuation remain poorly quantified. In the authors' clinical experience, some individuals have challenges with side effects, out-of-pocket costs, or changes in payer coverage. Others tolerate the drug but, once meaningful weight reduction is achieved, do not wish to stay on the medication for life.

Adherence challenges are not unique to GLP-1s. Nearly 1 in 3 prescribed medications are never filled, and individuals regularly adhere to only half of prescribed agents. Evidence-based strategies to improve general medication adherence include dose simplification, patient education, electronic reminders, reduced out-of-pocket costs, and patient incentives. Integrating GLP-1 use with longitudinal, structured nutrition and lifestyle programming might also support simplified dose titration schedules and management of side effects. These interventions could be coupled with electronic reminders and FIM benefits, such as medically tailored groceries or produce prescriptions, to encourage medication adherence in the setting of dietary pattern changes. Standardized clinical workflows that incorporate structured programs of stepped therapy, supported by nutritional and lifestyle interventions, could also help promote more effective and cost-effective use for individuals and healthcare systems.

Importantly, adherence with dietary and other lifestyle changes is also challenging for many people. Just as occurs following GLP-1 discontinuation, weight regain is common with waning adherence to dietary and physical activity weight loss interventions. Approaches to address and support the ability of individuals to achieve long-term success with their overall weight management program are a critical area for future implementation research.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112ykCej]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, pharmacotherapy, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering weight management pharmacotherapy along with lifestyle changes in patients with T2DM and overweight or obesity. Prefer GLP-1 receptor agonist or dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist with greater weight loss efficacy (semaglutide or tirzepatide), especially considering their added weight-independent benefits (glycemic and cardiometabolic).

### Early weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg predicts 1-year weight loss and is associated with improvements in clinical markers [^115HUpmD]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Managing obesity with pharmacotherapy plus lifestyle intervention can help increase the proportion of people reaching ≥ 5% weight loss, the regulatory benchmark for clinically meaningful weight loss 1, 2, but use of pharmacotherapy must be balanced against potential adverse effects of treatment and costs. One strategy to increase benefit versus risk in obesity pharmacotherapy is through identification of long‐term weight loss predictors. By stopping drug therapy early in patients unlikely to achieve clinical benefit, clinicians can minimize drug exposure, improve the benefit:risk ratio for the patient 3, and use health resources more effectively. Early weight loss, whether through lifestyle 4, 5, 6, 7 or pharmacotherapy 8, 9, 10, 11, is a good predictor of long‐term weight loss. Indeed, all recently approved weight loss medication labels include "stopping rules" stating when pharmacotherapy should be discontinued if clinically relevant weight loss is not, or is unlikely to be, achieved. However, current labels provide little information on outcomes in those individuals eligible for continued treatment beyond the early milestone; reported results are for all randomized individuals.

Liraglutide is a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 analog with 97% homology to human glucagon‐like peptide‐1, a physiological regulator of appetite 12, 13. Liraglutide at doses up to 1.8 mg once daily (Victoza ®, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) has been licensed for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) since 2009. More recently, liraglutide 3.0 mg (Saxenda ®; Novo Nordisk), as an adjunct to a reduced‐calorie diet and increased physical activity, has been approved for weight management in the USA, EU, and elsewhere.

This article describes how the early treatment criterion that best predicts ≥ 5% weight loss with liraglutide 3.0 mg at week 56 was identified, based on data from the two largest trials in the SCALE program of phase 3a trials of liraglutide 3.0 mg for weight management. Post hoc analyses are presented of the efficacy and safety results from these trials by early responder status, using this early response criterion.

### Effect of continued weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo on weight loss maintenance in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 4 randomized clinical trial [^112VfZbG]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The effect of continuing vs withdrawing treatment with semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, on weight loss maintenance in people with overweight or obesity is unknown.

Objective

To compare continued once-weekly treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, with switch to placebo for weight maintenance (both with lifestyle intervention) in adults with overweight or obesity after a 20-week run-in with subcutaneous semaglutide titrated to 2.4 mg weekly.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, 68-week phase 3a withdrawal study conducted at 73 sites in 10 countries from June 2018 to March 2020 in adults with body mass index of at least 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related comorbidity) and without diabetes.

Interventions

A total of 902 participants received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide during run-in. After 20 weeks (16 weeks of dose escalation; 4 weeks of maintenance dose), 803 participants (89.0%) who reached the 2.4-mg/wk semaglutide maintenance dose were randomized (2:1) to 48 weeks of continued subcutaneous semaglutide (n = 535) or switched to placebo (n = 268), plus lifestyle intervention in both groups.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was percent change in body weight from week 20 to week 68; confirmatory secondary end points were changes in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and physical functioning (assessed using the Short Form 36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version [SF-36]).

Results

Among 803 study participants who completed the 20-week run-in period (with a mean weight loss of 10.6%) and were randomized (mean age, 46 [SD, 12] years; 634 [79%] women; mean body weight, 107.2 kg [SD, 22.7 kg]), 787 participants (98.0%) completed the trial and 741 (92.3%) completed treatment. With continued semaglutide, mean body weight change from week 20 to week 68 was -7.9% vs +6.9% with the switch to placebo (difference, -14.8 [95% CI, -16.0 to -13.5] percentage points; P < .001). Waist circumference (-9.7 cm [95% CI, -10.9 to -8.5 cm]), systolic blood pressure (-3.9 mm Hg [95% CI, -5.8 to -2.0 mm Hg]), and SF-36 physical functioning score (2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.3]) also improved with continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo (all P < .001). Gastrointestinal events were reported in 49.1% of participants who continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs 26.1% with placebo; similar proportions discontinued treatment because of adverse events with continued semaglutide (2.4%) and placebo (2.2%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity who completed a 20-week run-in period with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg once weekly, maintaining treatment with semaglutide compared with switching to placebo resulted in continued weight loss over the following 48 weeks.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and glucagon receptor poly-agonists: a new era in obesity pharmacotherapy [^115B63sv]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Achieving successful long-term weight loss with lifestyle modification in people with obesity is difficult and underscores the need for effective pharmacotherapy. Since 1947, a total of 18 medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating obesity; however, only 5 remain available for long-term use in the US. Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved in 2021, demonstrated much greater weight loss than previous medications, which stimulated the development of poly-agonists that combine GLP-1 receptor agonism with glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon receptor agonism. The potential of this approach was recently demonstrated by the extraordinary weight loss achieved by tirzepatide, a GLP-1/GIP receptor dual agonist. The therapeutic efficacy of poly-agonists is likely to change the treatment paradigm for obesity. However, the use of medications for obesity, as for other chronic diseases, will likely require lifelong treatment, which makes it important to analyze the long-term efficacy, safety, and economic implications of chronic pharmacotherapy.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^115kmqkf]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

Combination or staged GLP-1 with intensive lifestyle intervention — trial features and outcomes — reports that STEP-1 and SURMOUNT-4 included diet counseling and recommendations to exercise 150 min/week during treatment, with notable weight regain for most participants upon GLP-1 discontinuation without continued nutrition support; in SURMOUNT-3, individuals receiving tirzepatide after a comprehensive 12-week lifestyle intervention achieved a mean 25% weight reduction compared to 4.8% with placebo, suggesting a benefit for staged lifestyle intervention with GLP-1s, and given high discontinuation rates, intensive lifestyle management could aid longer-term weight maintenance, with simulation modeling projecting substantial net healthcare cost savings and minimal loss of health-related quality of life for a staged program.

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1154aeeq]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Assessing efficacy and safety of weight management pharmacotherapy — upon initiating medications for obesity, assess their effectiveness and safety at least monthly for the first 3 months and at least quarterly thereafter; those who achieve sufficient early weight loss upon starting a chronic weight management medication (typically defined as > 5% weight loss after 3 months of use) should continue the medication long-term, whereas when early weight loss results are modest (typically < 5% weight loss after 3 months of use), the benefits of ongoing treatment need to be examined in the context of the glycemic response, alternative options, tolerance, and burden. Ongoing monitoring of the achievement and maintenance of weight management goals is recommended, and sudden discontinuation of semaglutide and tirzepatide results in regain of one-half to two-thirds of the weight loss within 1 year. Shared decision-making should be used to determine the best long-term approach (continuing on the lowest effective dose, using intermittent therapy, or stopping medication followed by close weight monitoring), and for those not reaching or maintaining goals, avoid treatment inertia by reevaluating therapies and intensifying with additional approaches (e.g., metabolic surgery, additional pharmacologic agents, structured lifestyle programs).

### Novel pharmacotherapies for weight loss: understanding the role of incretins to enable weight loss and improved health outcomes [^112jBAN4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are widespread diseases that significantly impact cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. In the recent years, intensive research has been performed to assess the role of adipose tissue and body fat distribution in the development of metabolic and non-metabolic complications in individuals with obesity. In addition to lifestyle modifications, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1-RA) have become a meaningful treatment expansion for the management of both disorders. In addition to improving metabolic control and reducing body weight, treatment with GLP-1-RAs reduces cardiovascular and renal events in individuals with obesity with and without diabetes. These important benefits of GLP-1-RAs have triggered new interest in other enteroendocrine and enteropancreatic peptides for treating obesity and its metabolic and non-metabolic consequences. The first peptide dual-agonist targeting glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptors has been approved for the treatment of T2D and obesity. GIP/GLP-1 dual-agonism appear to provide better metabolic control and greater weight reduction compared with GLP-1-R mono-agonism. Other peptide and non-peptide co-agonists are in clinical development for obesity, T2D, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and other metabolic disorders. This narrative review aims to summarize the available data on approved and emerging enteroendocrine and enteropancreatic based treatment approaches for obesity and metabolic disorders. In addition to available clinical efficacy measures, side effects, limitations and open challenges will also be addressed.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^117PCnv3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists

Background

Rates of preconception use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are increasing, due to their benefits in weight loss, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease and their low risk for hypoglycemia, high efficacy, and potential to simplify treatment regimens. GLP-1RAs are also being used for weight management before conception and improved fertility in individuals with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

Manufacturers have cited early pregnancy losses and fetal abnormalities in animal studies when exposed during organogenesis that coincided with marked maternal body weight loss, leading to a recommendation to stop using semaglutide 2 months before pregnancy and a recommendation against routine use of all GLP-1RAs during pregnancy. Before discontinuation, it is also recommended to evaluate the risks and benefits, incorporating the implications of hyperglycemia during pregnancy. The risk of fetal exposure on discontinuation likely differs significantly among GLP-1RAs due to differences in structure, pharmacokinetics, and potency. Tirzepatide is a dual GLP-1RA and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) agonist and so it must be evaluated for risk independently from GLP-1RAs.

Discontinuing GLP-1RAs has also been associated with rebound weight gain in nonpregnant adults and weight gain is expected with transition to insulin. Excess gestational weight gain (GWG) has been observed in those exposed to GLP-1RAs before pregnancy compared with those who were not. Another concern is the development of hyperglycemia without appropriate glycemic management and risk of teratogenicity if this occurs during the first trimester. The impact of GLP-1RA discontinuation earlier in the preconception period compared with the start of pregnancy has an unknown impact on pregnancy outcomes.

Question 3. Should discontinuation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist before pregnancy vs glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester be used in individuals with preexisting type 2 diabetes?

### Efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists on weight loss, BMI, and waist circumference for patients with obesity or overweight: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of 47 randomized controlled trials [^114dPR9o]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide an updated synthesis on effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on weight, BMI, and waist circumference incorporating newer randomized controlled trials (RCTs), particularly in individuals with overweight or obesity.

Research Design and Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for RCTs published from inception to 4 October 2024. The search was limited to RCTs evaluating the use of GLP-1 RAs for mean differences from baseline in weight, BMI, and waist circumference in adults with obesity or overweight with or without diabetes. Two independent reviewers performed the literature search and data extraction, resolving disagreements via consensus or third-reviewer consultation.

Results

Forty-seven RCTs were included, with a combined cohort of 23,244 patients. GLP-1 RAs demonstrated a mean weight reduction of -4.57 kg (95% CI -5.35 to -3.78), mean BMI reduction of -2.07 kg/m2 (95% CI -2.53 to -1.62), and mean waist circumference reduction of -4.55 cm (95% CI -5.72 to -3.38) compared with placebo. This effect was consistent across diabetes status, GLP-1 RA used, and route of administration. The greatest treatment benefit appeared to favor patients who were younger, female, without diabetes, with higher baseline weight and BMI but lower baseline HbA1c, and treated over a longer duration. Limitations include substantial statistical heterogeneity, in part due to broad inclusion criteria. However, this heterogeneity may improve generalizability by reflecting a wide range of study designs and patient populations.

Conclusions

GLP-1 RAs demonstrated significant weight, BMI, and waist circumference reduction benefits in this meta-analysis.

### The new bridge to hernia surgery: achieving preoperative weight optimization with GLP-1 receptor agonists for abdominal wall hernia repair [^11216kHS]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

In our cohort, 47.1% of patients who were prescribed GLP-1 agonists were able to achieve substantial preoperative weight loss and undergo hernia surgery. On average, these patients had a mean total weight loss of 14% from the time of starting GLP-1 therapy to the day of surgery. Our weight loss outcomes and the time needed to achieve them are comparable to larger prospective and retrospective studies on GLP-1 agonists. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) randomized trials found that patients receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg lost an average of 6% of their total weight by week 12 and 12% of their total weight by week 28. In a retrospective cohort study of 175 patients with obesity prescribed semaglutide for weight loss, the mean weight loss after 6 months was 12.3 kg, equivalent to a mean total weight loss of 10.9%. In addition, 54.9% of patients in the study achieved a total weight loss of 10% or more at 6 months. While only 7 patients in our cohort elected to continue GLP-1 therapy postoperatively and were available for follow-up at 6 months, these patients effectively maintained their preoperative weight loss. Large-scale randomized trials have shown that the weight loss trajectory with semaglutide occurs over a period of 65 weeks and is sustained for up to 4 years. Although the impact of postoperative GLP-1 therapy on long-term hernia-related outcomes is unknown, it's feasible that maintaining weight loss after surgery with GLP-1 agonists may help to reduce the likelihood of postoperative complications and hernia recurrence. Prospective studies with long-term follow-up are needed to compare the weight loss efficacy of GLP-1 agonists with and without lifestyle modifications in hernia patients to investigate this question. A quantifiable benefit of these medications with regard to hernia complications may support broader use of GLP-1 agonists for hernia prehabilitation.

### Effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on weight loss: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^115ansew]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

In the United States, more than two thirds of the population is overweight (body mass index 25–29.9) or obese (body mass index ≥ 30). This proportion is smaller in Europe, but continues to increase. The World Health Organization estimates that 1.5 billion adults worldwide are overweight and 500 million are obese. Almost three million adults die each year as a result of being overweight or obese. An estimated 44% of the burden for diabetes has been attributed to these weight problems, as well as 23% and 7–41% of the burdens for ischaemic heart disease and specific cancers, respectively.

Weight loss is not easily accomplished or maintained. Meta-analyses of clinical trials on non-pharmacological strategies for weight reduction have reported 1–6 kg losses that have been difficult to maintain. Meta-analyses of sibutramine and orlistat trials report average weight reductions of 3 kg to 5 kg, but some of the included trials had attrition rates of up to 50% that were possibly due to adverse events, suggesting that the interventions could be less effective in clinical practice. Meta-analyses have found that bariatric surgery reduces long term mortality in obese patients, but the safety risks and the costs of this intervention limit the use for large patient populations.

### The efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists for insufficient weight loss or regain after metabolic / bariatric surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Qqjzb]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is a successful surgical option for obesity. However, many patients can experience insufficient weight loss and weight regain post-operatively. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have become available for effective weight loss treatment due to their effects of suppressing appetite, slowing gastric emptying, and promoting fat loss. This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy of using GLP-1 agonists to treat insufficient weight loss or regain after metabolic/bariatric surgery. Pooled analysis demonstrated that GLP-1 agonists have a moderate effect on weight loss after failed weight loss or weight regain following MBS, with a Cohen's d-score of 0.470 (p ≤ 0.001). GLP-1 agonists show promise and deserve additional research as part of the standard of care following MBS with insufficient weight loss.
