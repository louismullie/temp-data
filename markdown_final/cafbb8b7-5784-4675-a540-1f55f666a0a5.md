## Question

what does mean by enhances inhibitory effects of GABA

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what it means when something "enhances inhibitory effects of GABA", specifically looking for the mechanistic and clinical interpretation of that phrase. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline physiology of GABAergic inhibition and its two modes, phasic and tonic. Then, I should verify the molecular targets and binding sites on GABA A receptors that mediate enhancement. Next, I will examine the principal pharmacologic mechanisms that increase inhibitory tone. After that, I need to consider network-level consequences and clinical implications, including disease-specific examples. Finally, I should review limitations, exceptions, and safety considerations to avoid overgeneralization.

> Let me first confirm the physiological meaning of "inhibitory effects of GABA". In the mature brain, GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. Activation of GABA A receptors typically increases chloride influx, hyperpolarizes the membrane, and reduces the likelihood of action potential firing, thereby suppressing excitability and synchronizing neural circuits. This is the canonical inhibitory effect that most drugs aim to enhance [^114oX6zg] [^1147E8ey].

> Wait, let me verify the two distinct modes of inhibition because conflating them can mislead interpretation. Phasic inhibition refers to rapid, transient synaptic currents triggered by vesicular GABA release, whereas tonic inhibition reflects a persistent, low-level conductance driven by ambient extracellular GABA acting on high-affinity extrasynaptic receptors; these modes differ in kinetics, receptor subunit composition, and pharmacology, so "enhancing GABA" can mean different things depending on which mode is targeted [^114oX6zg] [^112uasCi].

> I will now examine the molecular targets and binding sites. Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) bind to sites distinct from the orthosteric GABA site and increase receptor open probability or prolong inhibitory currents. Classical benzodiazepines occupy the extracellular α/γ interface, whereas neurosteroids engage transmembrane sites at the receptor–bilayer interface, and general anesthetics like propofol and etomidate bind within transmembrane pockets between subunits. These binding modes converge on potentiating inhibitory signaling despite different structural contacts [^1153K2Nf] [^114oqDCc] [^1122fRj9].

> Hold on, I should verify the principal mechanisms that "enhance" inhibitory effects. Mechanistically, enhancement includes: increasing chloride influx and hyperpolarization; prolonging inhibitory postsynaptic current duration; shifting gating toward open states; increasing receptor surface expression or clustering; and raising extracellular GABA availability by blocking uptake or degradation. Clinically used examples include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neurosteroids, propofol, and GABA reuptake or metabolism inhibitors, each with distinct pharmacodynamic profiles [^1148TMwu] [^1144YR62] [^1155uj2j] [^115KgQXw].

> Let me consider network-level consequences next, because "enhancement" is not just a local receptor effect. Potentiating GABA A signaling reduces neuronal firing rates, dampens oscillatory activity, and can disrupt the formation of coherent neuronal assemblies; these effects underlie sedation, hypnosis, anxiolysis, anticonvulsant activity, and memory impairment observed with GABAergic drugs, and they align with computational models showing impaired assembly formation under GABA A potentiation [^11653Pup] [^115xSRyE].

> But wait, what if the context changes the direction of "enhancement"? I should double-check disease-specific examples. After stroke, reducing tonic GABA A inhibition in the peri-infarct cortex improves functional recovery, whereas enhancing phasic inhibition can be beneficial in some settings; in neuropathic pain, α2/α3-selective benzodiazepine-site ligands can restore analgesia when chloride homeostasis is corrected; in status epilepticus, chloride accumulation can render GABAergic transmission excitatory, so simply "enhancing GABA" may worsen seizures unless chloride gradients are restored; these examples underscore that "enhancement" must be interpreted in circuit- and pathology-specific terms [^114aHCeU] [^111qabWd] [^117CitoX] [^117GEJYM].

> I need to ensure I address receptor subtypes and pharmacologic selectivity. α1-containing receptors are linked to sedation and hypnosis, α2/α3 to anxiolysis, and δ-containing extrasynaptic receptors to tonic inhibition. Drugs like zolpidem are α1-preferring, while neurosteroids can potentiate both synaptic and extrasynaptic currents, and benzodiazepines generally do not modulate δ-containing receptors. This pharmacologic heterogeneity explains differing clinical profiles and guides efforts to develop subtype-selective agents [^112uasCi] [^113WwzcB].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerance considerations, because chronic "enhancement" can backfire. Prolonged benzodiazepine exposure can trigger receptor internalization and loss of inhibitory synapses via PLCδ/Ca2+/calcineurin signaling, contributing to tolerance and withdrawal; dependence risk and cognitive effects also constrain chronic use, so clinical decisions must weigh acute benefits against long-term liabilities and consider alternatives or adjuncts that modulate GABAergic tone more selectively [^111d7H7z] [^114s2e42] [^117VvTrN].

> Let me reconsider the core answer to ensure it is precise. "Enhances inhibitory effects of GABA" means pharmacologically augmenting GABA's capacity to reduce neuronal excitability, either by potentiating GABA A receptor function, increasing effective GABA concentrations, or favorably shifting inhibitory network dynamics. Clinically, this manifests as reduced anxiety, anticonvulsant effects, sedation, or anesthesia, but the directionality and benefit depend on which inhibitory mode is targeted and the underlying pathophysiology, so enhancement is context-dependent rather than universally beneficial [^114oX6zg] [^1153K2Nf] [^114aHCeU].

"Enhances inhibitory effects of GABA" means **increasing GABA's ability to reduce neuronal excitability** by **potentiating GABA-A receptor function** (via positive allosteric modulators like benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or neurosteroids) [^1148TMwu] or by **raising synaptic GABA levels** (via GABA transporter inhibition or GABA transaminase blockade) [^1148TMwu] [^115KgQXw]. This leads to **increased chloride influx**, hyperpolarization, and reduced action potential firing, producing anxiolytic, sedative, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant effects [^1153K2Nf] [^114oX6zg].

## Molecular mechanisms of GABAergic inhibition

GABA is the **primary inhibitory neurotransmitter** in the CNS; it binds to GABA-A and GABA-B receptors to reduce neuronal excitability [^1147E8ey] [^1168W67M]. GABA-A receptors are ligand-gated chloride channels; GABA binding increases chloride influx, hyperpolarizes the membrane, and suppresses action potentials [^1168W67M]. GABA-B receptors are metabotropic and act via second messengers to inhibit neurotransmitter release and reduce excitability [^1168W67M].

## Mechanisms of enhancing GABAergic inhibition

Several pharmacological strategies enhance GABAergic inhibition:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Positive allosteric modulation | Agents bind GABA-A receptors at non-GABA sites to increase receptor sensitivity and chloride influx | - Benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam) <br/> - Barbiturates <br/> - Neurosteroids (allopregnanolone) [^1153K2Nf] [^1123qa6k] [^116fQZgE] |
| Increased synaptic GABA levels | Inhibit GABA reuptake or degradation to prolong GABA's action | - Tiagabine (GAT-1 inhibitor) <br/> - Vigabatrin (GABA-T inhibitor) [^1148TMwu] [^115KgQXw] |
| Direct receptor agonism | Agents directly activate GABA receptors | - Muscimol (GABA-A agonist) <br/> - Baclofen (GABA-B agonist) [^114cVPJP] |

---

## Physiological consequences of enhanced GABAergic inhibition

Enhancing GABAergic inhibition produces broad CNS effects:

- **Reduced neuronal excitability**: Increased chloride influx and hyperpolarization lower action potential firing [^1168W67M].
- **Anxiolytic effects**: Reduced anxiety via modulation of limbic circuits [^113ek6bo].
- **Sedative and hypnotic effects**: CNS depression promoting sleep and sedation [^116Xr68F].
- **Anticonvulsant effects**: Suppression of abnormal discharges [^114ffQAZ].
- **Muscle relaxant effects**: Reduced spinal motor neuron excitability [^117VvTrN].

---

## Clinical implications and therapeutic applications

Enhancing GABAergic inhibition is clinically important:

- **Anxiety disorders**: Benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics reduce anxiety [^notfound].
- **Insomnia**: Sedative-hypnotics improve sleep onset and maintenance [^notfound].
- **Epilepsy**: Antiseizure drugs control seizures [^114ffQAZ].
- **Muscle spasticity**: Muscle relaxants reduce spasticity [^117VvTrN].
- **Alcohol withdrawal**: Benzodiazepines prevent withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens [^notfound].

---

## Potential side effects and risks

While therapeutic, enhancing GABAergic inhibition can cause:

- **Sedation and cognitive impairment**: Dose-dependent CNS depression [^117VvTrN].
- **Respiratory depression**: Risk at high doses, especially with other CNS depressants [^117VvTrN].
- **Tolerance and dependence**: With chronic benzodiazepine or barbiturate use [^111d7H7z] [^114s2e42].
- **Withdrawal symptoms**: Rebound anxiety, seizures, and autonomic hyperactivity on cessation [^117VvTrN].

---

## Conclusion

"Enhances inhibitory effects of GABA" refers to pharmacologically augmenting GABA's capacity to reduce neuronal excitability, mainly by **potentiating GABA-A receptors** or increasing synaptic GABA. This yields anxiolytic, sedative, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant effects, but requires careful use due to sedation, respiratory depression, tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal risks [^117VvTrN] [^1153K2Nf].

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Mechanism of Action

The precise mechanism by which tiagabine exerts its antiseizure effect is unknown, although it is believed to be related to its ability, documented in in vitro experiments, to enhance the activity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. These experiments have shown that tiagabine binds to recognition sites associated with the GABA uptake carrier. It is thought that, by this action, tiagabine blocks GABA uptake into presynaptic neurons, permitting more GABA to be available for receptor binding on the surfaces of post-synaptic cells. Inhibition of GABA uptake has been shown for synaptosomes, neuronal cell cultures, and glial cell cultures. In rat-derived hippocampal slices, tiagabine has been shown to prolong GABA-mediated inhibitory post-synaptic potentials. Tiagabine increases the amount of GABA available in the extracellular space of the globus pallidus, ventral palladum, and substantia nigra in rats at the ED50and ED85doses for inhibition of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) -induced tonic seizures. This suggests that tiagabine prevents the propagation of neural impulses that contribute to seizures by a GABA-ergic action.

Tiagabine has shown efficacy in several animal models of seizures. It is effective against the tonic phase of subcutaneous PTZ-induced seizures in mice and rats, seizures induced by the proconvulsant DMCM in mice, audiogenic seizures in genetically epilepsy-prone rats (GEPR), and amygdala-kindled seizures in rats. Tiagabine has little efficacy against maximal electroshock seizures in rats and is only partially effective against subcutaneous PTZ-induced clonic seizures in mice, picrotoxin-induced tonic seizures in the mouse, bicuculline-induced seizures in the rat, and photic seizures in photosensitive baboons. Tiagabine produces a biphasic dose-response curve against PTZ- and DMCM-induced convulsions, with attenuated effectiveness at higher doses.

Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of AEDs

Pharmacodynamics

AEDs depress abnormal neuronal firing by various mechanisms of action including altering ion channel activity, enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, or reducing glutamate-mediated excitation. While some AEDs have a single mechanism of action, others have multiple mechanisms of action and, in some, the exact mechanism of action is not yet known (Table 1).

AMPA, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, GABA gamma-aminobutyric acid, NMDA, N -methyl — aspartate, SV2A synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A

When using multiple AEDs, it is reasonable to select medications with different mechanisms of action.

### Structure of a human synaptic GABAreceptor [^1147E8ey]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain is principally mediated by the neurotransmitter GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) and its synaptic target, the type A GABA receptor (GABA A receptor). Dysfunction of this receptor results in neurological disorders and mental illnesses including epilepsy, anxiety and insomnia. The GABA A receptor is also a prolific target for therapeutic, illicit and recreational drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, anaesthetics and ethanol. Here we present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human α1β2γ2 GABA A receptor, the predominant isoform in the adult brain, in complex with GABA and the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil, the first-line clinical treatment for benzodiazepine overdose. The receptor architecture reveals unique heteromeric interactions for this important class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor. This work provides a template for understanding receptor modulation by GABA and benzodiazepines, and will assist rational approaches to therapeutic targeting of this receptor for neurological disorders and mental illness.

### From bugs to brain: unravelling the GABA signalling networks in the brain-gut-microbiome axis [^112uasCi]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

This GABA A R diversity gives rise to an extensive pharmacology, with numerous therapeutically useful agents that enhance receptor function allosterically. These agents act via sites distinct from that of GABA itself, functioning as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). Such ligands include benzodiazepines (BZs), a variety of general intravenous anaesthetics, including etomidate and propofol, and a class of brain-made steroids called neurosteroids (NSs) — notably the progesterone metabolite, 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one, known as allopregnanolone (ALLO), and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC), which are devoid of classical hormonal actions[Fig. 1A(iv) and Box 3].

The receptor subunit composition impacts function, localization and pharmacology. For example, receptors incorporating the γ2 subunit together with either the α1,2,3 or 5 subunits are particularly sensitive to BZ ligands and localize, albeit not exclusively, to synaptic locations to mediate fast synaptic inhibition. Receptors without the γ2 subunit are not responsive to BZs, whereas receptors incorporating the δ subunit are insensitive to classical BZ ligands but exquisitely sensitive to the agonist gaboxadol and exclusively localized to extrasynaptic neuronal domains. In each instance, the receptor subtypes display unique properties ideally suited to the form of inhibition they mediate. For example, δ-subunit containing GABA A Rs (δ-GABA A Rs) have a high affinity for GABA and exhibit limited desensitization, both congruent for mediating sustained tonic inhibition. Indeed, some δ-GABA A Rs spontaneously open in the absence of GABA. We refer to comprehensive reviews for an in-depth discussion.

### Physiological role for GABAreceptor desensitization in the induction of long-term potentiation at inhibitory synapses [^113wBxAp]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In exploring and establishing the role that desensitization of GABA A Rs can play in the brain, we have uncovered a mechanism by which inhibitory synapses can directly regulate their level of plasticity, in the form of an inhibitory long-term potentiation that is manifest by increased synaptic current amplitudes.

In essence, iLTP is induced following the increased entry of GABA A Rs into one or more desensitized states, which appear to serve as a signal for the activity state of the inhibitory synapse. Receptor desensitization increases the phosphorylation of GABA A R subunits by PKC leading to a subsequent long-term increase in inhibitory synaptic efficacy. In this context, the physiological role of the desensitized state appears to be largely as a mechanism of signal transduction. This is a role to which it is well suited, especially given current structural and kinetic evidence, as it represents a relatively long-lived conformational change transduced from the external to internal faces of the plasma membrane upon the binding of agonist.

### Propofol [^1155uj2j]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Propofol injectable emulsion is an intravenous general anesthetic and sedation drug for use in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia or sedation. Intravenous injection of a therapeutic dose of propofol induces anesthesia, with minimal excitation, usually within 40 seconds from the start of injection (the time for one arm-brain circulation). As with other rapidly acting intravenous anesthetic agents, the half-time of the blood-brain equilibration is approximately 1 to 3 minutes, accounting for the rate of induction of anesthesia.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action, like all general anesthetics, is poorly understood. However, propofol is thought to produce its sedative/anesthetic effects by the positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter GABA through the ligand-gated GABAAreceptors.

### Traditional and non-traditional treatments for autism spectrum disorder with seizures: an on-line survey [^115vYAAP]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a 3 to 22-fold increase in the risk of developing epilepsy as compared to typically developing individuals and up to 25% of individuals with ASD will experience a clinical seizures at some point in their life. However, the relationship between epilepsy and ASD is complex. For example, a significant number of individuals with ASD manifest epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalograph (EEG) despite a lack of clinical seizures, and many of these epileptiform abnormalities do not meet criteria for electrographic seizures.

Despite the high prevalence of seizure, epilepsy and abnormal EEGs in individuals with ASD, there is little information regarding the relative effectiveness of treatments for epilepsy, seizure or subclinical epileptiform discharges in this population. There is good reason to believe that specific antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) might be effective for individuals with ASD. For example, ASD is associated with cortical hyperexcitability, potentially due to deficits in cortical inhibitory circuits. This suggests that AEDs that enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid pathways might be relatively better treatments for individuals with ASD. Additionally, the non-seizure effects of AEDs, such as mood regulation, could be particularly helpful in individuals with ASD. Finally, older AEDs tend to have higher rates of adverse effects, particularly with respect to attention, mood and cognition. Since individuals with ASD already have problems with attention, mood and cognition, prescribing an AED with such adverse effects might result in poor overall function even if seizures are controlled. Thus, the first purpose of this study was to determine whether there are specific AEDs that are more appropriate to use in children with ASD.

### Understanding the mechanism of action and clinical effects of neuroactive steroids and GABAergic compounds in major depressive disorder [^1168W67M]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

GABA receptors

GABA mediates neural inhibition in the brain by activating the 2 major GABA receptors: (1) GABA A, ionotropic ligand-gated ion channels that signal via direct ligand-mediated opening; and (2) GABA B, metabotropic G protein-coupled receptors that act indirectly via intracellular signaling cascades. GABA B receptor-mediated signaling relies on the activation of G protein signaling pathways to inhibit neurotransmitter release and modulate action potential propagation. GABA B receptor expression or activity does not appear to be consistently altered in individuals with depression and has therefore attracted less research interest compared with GABA A receptors in this disease. However, GABA B receptor activation has been reported to increase membrane trafficking of GABA A receptors in dentate gyrus granule cells, resulting in enhanced GABA A receptor current.

GABA A receptors are widely distributed in the brain and play an important role in many brain functions. In addition to GABA, other endogenous ligands include zinc, NASs, and certain amino acids. GABA A receptors are encoded by 19 subunit genes, six α (α1-α6), three β (β1-β3), three γ (γ1-γ3), three ρ (ρ1-ρ3), and one each of the δ, ε, π, and θ subunits. GABA A receptors belong to a large heterogeneous class of pentameric chloride channels comprising 2 α, 2 β, and 1 γ, δ, ρ, θ, or ε subunits, with the α1β2γ2 GABA A receptors being the most abundant. The complex and heterogenous nature of GABA A receptors results in considerable diversity in their physiology, location, and pharmacologic profile. Upon GABA binding and activation of the GABA A receptor, chloride ions flow into the cell, leading to rapid membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of action potentials in the postsynaptic neuron. A subclass of GABA A receptors, termed GABA A -ρ (previously GABA C) receptors, is a group of receptors composed exclusively of ρ subunits, which are typically insensitive to GABA A allosteric modulators (eg, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and most NASs). However, there are some GABA A receptor modulators that can also engage GABA A -ρ receptors, such as pregnanolone, allopregnanolone, and some synthetic NASs.

### Enhanced phasic GABA inhibition during the repair phase of stroke: a novel therapeutic target [^113SD7ep]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Decreased expression of synaptic GABA A R subunits, combined with studies reporting decreased phasic GABA signalling in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons at the onset of functional recovery, suggest that phasic GABA signalling is reduced in the repair phase of stroke, but the significance of this for recovery is not known. Another study found no change in GABA signalling in layer 2/3 in the first 3 days after stroke. Importantly, recent case reports demonstrate that treatment with zolpidem, an FDA-approved GABA A positive allosteric modulator with highest affinity for α1-containing receptors, improved brain function in patients with severe brain injuries, including stroke. Although it is hard to extrapolate the involvement of phasic GABA in brain recovery from these patient studies, these reports suggest that, unlike tonic inhibition, enhanced GABA A Rα1-mediated phasic signalling in the repair phase may be beneficial for recovery. Furthermore, little is known about the overall changes in inhibitory signalling in cortical circuitry. For instance, it is unknown how stroke affects phasic GABA signalling in all the different cell types across the structurally organized layers of the somatosensory cortex. This information is crucial to understand the functional implication(s) of modified phasic GABA signalling. For example, modifying signalling in pyramidal layer 5 neurons, which provide the major output to subcortical structures, may have a different functional consequence than modifying layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, which are primarily dedicated to cortico-cortical communication.

### Presynaptic glycine receptors enhance transmitter release at a mammalian central synapse [^115xKo9G]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Glycine and GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid A) receptors are inhibitory neurotransmitter-gated Cl- channels localized in postsynaptic membranes. In some cases, GABAA receptors are also found presynaptically, but they retain their inhibitory effect as their activation reduces excitatory transmitter release. Here we report evidence for presynaptic ionotropic glycine receptors, using pre- and postsynaptic recordings of a calyceal synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Unlike the classical action of glycine, presynaptic glycine receptors triggered a weakly depolarizing Cl- current in the nerve terminal. The depolarization enhanced transmitter release by activating Ca2+ channels and increasing resting intraterminal Ca2+ concentrations. Repetitive activation of glycinergic synapses on MNTB neurons also enhanced glutamatergic synaptic currents, indicating that presynaptic glycine receptors are activated by glycine spillover. These results reveal a novel site of action of the transmitter glycine, and indicate that under certain conditions presynaptic Cl- channels may increase transmitter release.

### Structural and dynamic mechanisms of GABAreceptor modulators with opposing activities [^116dSctS]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels abundant in the central nervous system and are prolific drug targets for treating anxiety, sleep disorders and epilepsy. Diverse small molecules exert a spectrum of effects on γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptors by acting at the classical benzodiazepine site. They can potentiate the response to GABA, attenuate channel activity, or counteract modulation by other ligands. Structural mechanisms underlying the actions of these drugs are not fully understood. Here we present two high-resolution structures of GABA A receptors in complex with zolpidem, a positive allosteric modulator and heavily prescribed hypnotic, and DMCM, a negative allosteric modulator with convulsant and anxiogenic properties. These two drugs share the extracellular benzodiazepine site at the α/γ subunit interface and two transmembrane sites at β/α interfaces. Structural analyses reveal a basis for the subtype selectivity of zolpidem that underlies its clinical success. Molecular dynamics simulations provide insight into how DMCM switches from a negative to a positive modulator as a function of binding site occupancy. Together, these findings expand our understanding of how GABA A receptor allosteric modulators acting through a common site can have diverging activities.

### Physiological role for GABAreceptor desensitization in the induction of long-term potentiation at inhibitory synapses [^1144YR62]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

GABA A receptors (GABA A Rs) are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels distributed throughout the brain where they mediate synaptic and tonic inhibition. Following activation, these receptors undergo desensitization which involves entry into long-lived agonist-bound closed states. Although the kinetic effects of this state are recognised and its structural basis has been uncovered, the physiological impact of desensitization on inhibitory neurotransmission remains unknown. Here we describe an enduring form of long-term potentiation at inhibitory synapses that elevates synaptic current amplitude for 24h following desensitization of GABA A Rs in response to agonist exposure or allosteric modulation. Using receptor mutants and allosteric modulators we demonstrate that desensitization of GABA A Rs facilitates their phosphorylation by PKC, which increases the number of receptors at inhibitory synapses. These observations provide a physiological relevance to the desensitized state of GABA A Rs, acting as a signal to regulate the efficacy of inhibitory synapses during prolonged periods of inhibitory neurotransmission.

### Divergence of volatile anesthetic effects in inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors [^113ttKpU]. Anesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The mechanism of volatile anesthetic (VA) action is unknown. Inhibitory receptors for the neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glycine are typically positively modulated by VAs and may be important targets for their action. The existence of a GABA receptor subtype (p), which is uniquely inhibited by VAs, suggested a chimeric receptor approach to identify portions of these proteins that may be necessary for anesthetic effects.

Methods

A silent mutation resulting in the addition of a unique restriction enzyme recognition site was introduced in GABA receptor type A alpha2, glycine alpha1, and p subunit cDNAs. Chimeras were constructed by rejoining restriction digest fragments and were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Modulation of submaximal agonist-evoked peak currents by the VAs chloroform, enflurane, halothane, or isoflurane was measured using two-electrode voltage clamp.

Results

Four chimeras were constructed and designated glyrho, rhogly, alpha2rho, and rhoalpha2. Glyrho formed glycine-gated receptors with currents that were enhanced by chloroform or halothane but were inhibited by enflurane or isoflurane. Chimeras rhogly and rhoalpha2 each formed GABA-gated receptors with currents that were inhibited by chloroform or halothane but enhanced by enflurane or isoflurane.

Conclusions

These data show, for the first time, functional divergence of VA action on a single protein target. The VAs in this study fall into two distinct groups with respect to their effects on these receptors. This grouping parallels the chemistry of these compounds. Our results support the involvement of multiple protein domains in the mechanism of VA modulation of GABA and glycine receptors.

Fig. 4
Neuroactive steroid (NAS) positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptors amplify the inhibitory signal of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain.

NAS GABA A receptor PAMs, such as allopregnanolone, bind to GABA A receptors at sites distinctive from those for benzodiazepines (BZDs). NAS GABA A receptor PAMs bind to both synaptic γ subunit-containing and extrasynaptic δ subunit-containing GABA A receptors, potentiating phasic and tonic currents, respectively. In contrast, benzodiazepines bind to γ subunit-containing GABA A receptors only and primarily augment phasic inhibition. Extrasynaptic GABA A receptors containing δ subunits are insensitive to benzodiazepines.

Barbiturates bind to the α-β subunit interface on synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors and to γ-β subunit interfaces on synaptic receptors. Barbiturates also non-selectively bind to the entire superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels. Barbiturates act as antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors, such as α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and kainate receptors, thus inhibiting the bulk of fast excitatory synaptic transmission and glutamate release throughout the CNS. These actions may account for the antidepressant, anxiolytic, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant activities of barbiturates, but may also account for the physical and psychological addiction potential and high rates of tolerance and dependence associated with this class of drugs. Barbiturates also have a high overdose potential due to a very narrow dosage margin. Barbiturates were used to treat depression, anxiety, and insomnia in the early part of the 20th century but were generally replaced by benzodiazepines in the 1960s because the many potential drawbacks outweighed their usefulness.

### GABA systems, benzodiazepines, and substance dependence [^114s2e42]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Alterations in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex and GABA neurotransmission influence the reinforcing and intoxicating effects of alcohol and benzodiazepines. Chronic modulation of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex plays a major role in central nervous system dysregulation during alcohol abstinence. Withdrawal symptoms stem in part from a decreased GABAergic inhibitory function and an increase in glutamatergic excitatory function. GABA(A) receptors play a role in both reward and withdrawal phenomena from alcohol and sedative-hypnotics. Although less well understood, GABA(B) receptor complexes appear to play a role in inhibition of motivation and diminish relapse potential to reinforcing drugs. Evidence suggests that long-term alcohol use and concomitant serial withdrawals permanently alter GABAergic function, down-regulate benzodiazepine binding sites, and in preclinical models lead to cell death. Benzodiazepines have substantial drawbacks in the treatment of substance use-related disorders that include interactions with alcohol, rebound effects, alcohol priming, and the risk of supplanting alcohol dependency with addiction to both alcohol and benzodiazepines. Polysubstance-dependent individuals frequently self-medicate with benzodiazepines. Selective GABA agents with novel mechanisms of action have anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and reward inhibition profiles that have potential in treating substance use and withdrawal and enhancing relapse prevention with less liability than benzodiazepines. The GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen has promise in relapse prevention in a number of substance dependence disorders. The GABA(A) and GABA(B) pump reuptake inhibitor tiagabine has potential for managing alcohol and sedative-hypnotic withdrawal and also possibly a role in relapse prevention.

### Opposite actions of alcohol on tonic GABA (A) receptor currents mediated by nNOS and PKC activity [^116ki3j6]. Nature Neuroscience (2013). Medium credibility.

The molecular mechanisms that mediate genetic variability in response to alcohol are unclear. We found that alcohol had opposite actions (enhancement or suppression) on GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) inhibition in granule cells from the cerebellum of behaviorally sensitive, low alcohol-consuming Sprague-Dawley rats and DBA/2 mice and behaviorally insensitive, high alcohol-consuming C57BL/6 mice, respectively. The effect of alcohol on granule cell GABA(A)R inhibition was determined by a balance between two opposing effects: enhanced presynaptic vesicular release of GABA via alcohol inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and a direct suppression of the activity of postsynaptic GABA(A)Rs. The balance of these two processes was determined by differential expression of neuronal NOS (nNOS) and postsynaptic PKC activity, both of which varied across the rodent genotypes. These findings identify opposing molecular processes that differentially control the magnitude and polarity of GABA(A)R responses to alcohol across rodent genotypes.

### Role of GABAA receptor subtypes in the behavioural effects of intravenous general anaesthetics [^117H9UAJ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of general anaesthetics into clinical practice, researchers have been mystified as to how these chemically disparate drugs act to produce their dramatic effects on central nervous system function and behaviour. Scientific advances, particularly during the last 25years, have now begun to reveal the molecular mechanisms underpinning their behavioural effects. For certain i.v. general anaesthetics, such as etomidate and propofol, a persuasive case can now be made that the GABAA receptor, a major inhibitory receptor in the mammalian central nervous system, is an important target. Advances in molecular pharmacology and in genetic manipulation of rodent genes reveal that different subtypes of the GABAA receptor are responsible for mediating particular aspects of the anaesthetic behavioural repertoire. Such studies provide a better understanding of the neuronal circuitry involved in the various anaesthetic-induced behaviours and, in the future, may result in the development of novel therapeutics with a reduced propensity for side-effects.

### Structural insights into opposing actions of neurosteroids on GABAreceptors [^114oqDCc]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptors mediate fast inhibitory signaling in the brain and are targets of numerous drugs and endogenous neurosteroids. A subset of neurosteroids are GABA A receptor positive allosteric modulators; one of these, allopregnanolone, is the only drug approved specifically for treating postpartum depression. There is a consensus emerging from structural, physiological and photolabeling studies as to where positive modulators bind, but how they potentiate GABA activation remains unclear. Other neurosteroids are negative modulators of GABA A receptors, but their binding sites remain debated. Here we present structures of a synaptic GABA A receptor bound to allopregnanolone and two inhibitory sulfated neurosteroids. Allopregnanolone binds at the receptor-bilayer interface, in the consensus potentiator site. In contrast, inhibitory neurosteroids bind in the pore. MD simulations and electrophysiology support a mechanism by which allopregnanolone potentiates channel activity and suggest the dominant mechanism for sulfated neurosteroid inhibition is through pore block.

### Selective synaptic actions of thiopental and its enantiomers [^116KbjMf]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

There is conflicting evidence concerning the extent to which the intravenous general anesthetic thiopental acts by enhancing inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated (GABAergic) synaptic transmission or by inhibiting excitatory glutamatergic transmission. Yet there are remarkably few studies on the effects of thiopental on functional synapses. In addition, the degree of stereoselectivity of thiopental acting at synapses has yet to be tested.

Methods

The actions of thiopental and its enantiomers on GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses were investigated using voltage clamp techniques on microisland cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, a preparation that avoids the confounding effects of complex neuronal networks.

Results

Racemic thiopental markedly enhanced the charge transfer at GABAergic synapses without significantly affecting the peak of the postsynaptic current. At a surgically relevant concentration (25 microm), charge transfer was increased by approximately 230%. However, even at twice this concentration there were no significant effects on glutamatergic postsynaptic currents. At GABAergic synapses, thiopental acted stereoselectively, with the S(-) enantiomer being approximately twice as effective as the R(+) enantiomer at enhancing charge transfer.

Conclusions

Thiopental stereoselectively enhances inhibitory GABAergic synaptic transmission in a way that reflects animal potencies, supporting the idea that this is a principal mode of action for this drug. The absence of any effect on glutamatergic synapses at surgically relevant concentrations suggests that the inhibition of these excitatory synapses is not an important factor in producing thiopental general anesthesia.

### What Do we want? INHIBITION. when Do we want it? NOW [^113A1VK2]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Sema4D promotes inhibitory synapse formation, decreases seizure susceptibility, and has the potential to reverse pharmacoresistant SE. (A) Sema4D signals through PlexinB1 to increase the density of inhibitory synapses. (B) Sema4D exerts anticonvulsant actions, decreasing seizure susceptibility to PTZ- and kindling-induced seizures. (C) Sema4D-mediated increase in inhibitory synapses may reverse the downregulation of benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAARs associated with pharmacoresistant SE, thereby restoring diazepam (DZP) sensitivity.

A potential caveat to the translational relevance of Sema4D is the transient effect. The effects of Sema4D on inhibitory synapse formation and the anticonvulsant effects were observed 3 hours but not 48 hours following treatment. These data suggest that the effects of Sema4D on inhibitory synaptogenesis are transient, which may be viewed as a limitation of this approach. However, there may be benefits of the reversible effects of Sema4D treatment on inhibitory synaptogenesis in regard to treatment approaches, which is unique from other strategies involving cell-based therapies or delivery of opsins. Being able to rapidly and transiently enhance GABAergic signaling may be beneficial in restoring healthy brain activity without long-term consequences and potential adverse side effects, tolerance issues, and/or abuse potential.

Although few laboratory test results have focused on the mechanisms regulating inhibitory synaptogenesis, this pioneering work may contribute toward novel antiseizure drug development, focused on selectively enhancing the inhibitory network. This work supports a novel mechanism for AED targets, facilitating an increase in the expression of inhibitory synapses rather than trying to target existing receptors which may be compromised. There is much work yet to be done, but this preclinical study provides hope that enhancing inhibitory function through noninvasive means remains possible and effective.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome… [^1131cUBs]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

3 It is estimated that only 10 to 20 percent of patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal are treated as inpatients, 4 so it is possible that as many as 2 million Americans may experience symptoms of alcohol withdrawal conditions each year. Pathophysiology Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is mediated by a variety of mechanisms. The brain maintains neurochemical balance through inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters. The main inhibitory neurotransmitter is γ-amino-butyric acid, which acts through the GABA-alpha neuroreceptor. One of the major excitatory neurotransmitters is glutamate, which acts through the. N-methyl-D-aspartate neuroreceptor. Alcohol enhances the effect of GABA on GABA-A neuroreceptors, resulting in decreased overall brain excitability. Chronic exposure to alcohol results in a compensatory decrease of GABA-A neuroreceptor response to GABA, evidenced by increasing tolerance of the effects of alcohol.

Lorazepam and oxazepam are intermediate-acting medications with excellent records of efficacy. Treatment with these agents may be preferable in patients who metabolize medications less effectively, particularly the elderly and those with liver failure. Lorazepam is the only benzodiazepine with predictable intramuscular absorption. One randomized controlled trial 19 affirmed previous findings that carbamazepine is an effective alternative to benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Patients in the study received 800 mg of carbamazepine on the first day, with the dosage tapered to 200 mg by the fifth day. Carbamazepine also appears to decrease the craving for alcohol after withdrawal. It is not sedating and has little potential for abuse.

Although carbamazepine is used extensively in Europe, its use in the United States has been limited by lack of sufficient evidence that it prevents seizures and delirium. Future Directions Gabapentin, which is structurally similar to GABA, has been effective in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal in small studies. 25, 26 The low toxicity of gabapentin makes it a promising agent. In another study, 27 the anticonvulsant agent vigabatrin, which irreversibly blocks GABA transaminase, improved withdrawal symptoms after only three days of treatment.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^117VvTrN]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

Table 4 — Most commonly used oral medications in spasticity treatment — diazepam dosing, onset, and cautions: In children, the usual dose is 0.2 to 0.8 mg/kg of body weight per 24 h in divided every 6 to 8 h; in adults, the recommended oral dose starts with 2 mg twice a day and can be titrated up to 60 mg a day in divided doses. IV onset of action is within 1 to 3 min and oral dosing onset ranges between 15 and 60 min, and diazepam is long lasting with a duration of action of more than 12 h. Reported side effects include somnolence, impaired memory/cognition, respiratory depression with higher doses, physical and psychological dependence, hypotension, blurred vision, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and it is contraindicated for patients with glaucoma, coma, and respiratory disorders. Additional information notes that diazepam is a GABA-A agonist which facilitates postsynaptic effects of GABA resulting in increased presynaptic inhibition, that careful dosing and monitoring is important due to potential for dependence and implications of withdrawal, that it readily crosses the placental barrier and using during pregnancy may result in neonatal withdrawal soon after birth, that elderly patients are at increased risk of accumulation due to decreased renal function and clearing capability, and that in long-term use and abrupt cessation there is potential for hallucinations and epileptic seizures to occur.

### Tonic excitation or inhibition is set by GABA (A) conductance in hippocampal interneurons [^113SjFkZ]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

Inhibition is a physiological process that decreases the probability of a neuron generating an action potential. The two main mechanisms that have been proposed for inhibition are hyperpolarization and shunting. Shunting results from increased membrane conductance, and it reduces the neuron-firing probability. Here we show that ambient GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, can excite adult hippocampal interneurons. In these cells, the GABA A current reversal potential is depolarizing, making baseline tonic GABA A conductance excitatory. Increasing the tonic conductance enhances shunting-mediated inhibition, which eventually overpowers the excitation. Such a biphasic change in interneuron firing leads to corresponding changes in the GABA A -mediated synaptic signalling. The described phenomenon suggests that the excitatory or inhibitory actions of the current are set not only by the reversal potential, but also by the conductance.

### Propofol (Diprivan) [^113qTAEH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

DIPRIVAN is an intravenous general anesthetic and sedation drug for use in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia or sedation. Intravenous injection of a therapeutic dose of propofol induces anesthesia, with minimal excitation, usually within 40 seconds from the start of injection (the time for one arm-brain circulation). As with other rapidly acting intravenous anesthetic agents, the half-time of the blood-brain equilibration is approximately 1 to 3 minutes, accounting for the rate of induction of anesthesia.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action, like all general anesthetics, is poorly understood. However, propofol is thought to produce its sedative/anesthetic effects by the positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter GABA through the ligand-gated GABAAreceptors.

### Enhanced phasic GABA inhibition during the repair phase of stroke: a novel therapeutic target [^111qabWd]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Given that GABA A Rα1 mediates the majority of phasic inhibition, and the recent clinical evidence for its potential role in brain repair, we used a combination of approaches to examine cortical layer- and cell-specific phasic GABA signalling in the repair phase of stroke and to determine the role of GABA A Rα1-mediated phasic inhibition in stroke recovery. We focused on layer 5, the major output layer, and layer 2/3 as this is whereobserved effects on tonic GABA signalling after stroke. We used array tomography, a high-resolution imaging method, to identify cortical layer-specific changes in GABA A- Rα1-containing synapse numbers after stroke. We performed intracellular whole-cell recordings to determine if the structural synaptic changes observed by array tomography were associated with a functional change in phasic GABA A R inhibition and to identify which cell types undergo synaptic alterations. Last, we modulated GABA A- Rα1-mediated phasic inhibition to determine its effect on functional recovery. We provide the first evidence that phasic GABA signalling is increased in the peri-infarct cortex during the onset of post-stroke functional recovery. Furthermore, the increase in phasic GABA signalling is specific to layer 5. Lastly, we found, in contrast to tonic GABA signalling, that further enhancing phasic GABA signalling during the repair phase is beneficial for stroke recovery.

### Γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor potentiation inhibits learning in a computational network model [^115xSRyE]. Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Propofol produces memory impairment at concentrations well below those abolishing consciousness. Episodic memory, mediated by the hippocampus, is most sensitive. Two potentially overlapping scenarios may explain how γ-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABAA) potentiation by propofol disrupts episodic memory-the first mediated by shifting the balance from excitation to inhibition while the second involves disruption of rhythmic oscillations. We use a hippocampal network model to explore these scenarios. The basis for these experiments is the proposal that the brain represents memories as groups of anatomically dispersed strongly connected neurons.

Methods

A neuronal network with connections modified by synaptic plasticity was exposed to patterned stimuli, after which spiking output demonstrated evidence of stimulus-related neuronal group development analogous to memory formation. The effect of GABAA potentiation on this memory model was studied in 100 unique networks.

Results

GABAA potentiation consistent with moderate propofol effects reduced neuronal group size formed in response to a patterned stimulus by around 70%. Concurrently, accuracy of a Bayesian classifier in identifying learned patterns in the network output was reduced. Greater potentiation led to near total failure of group formation. Theta rhythm variations had no effect on group size or classifier accuracy.

Conclusions

Memory formation is widely thought to depend on changes in neuronal connection strengths during learning that enable neuronal groups to respond with greater facility to familiar stimuli. This experiment suggests the ability to form such groups is sensitive to alteration in the balance between excitation and inhibition such as that resulting from administration of a γ-aminobutyric acid-mediated anesthetic agent.

### Diazepam-medical countermeasures database-CHEMM… [^117E9B4D]. chemm.hhs.gov (2013). Low credibility.

The anticonvulsant diazepam has been used therapeutically in the treatment of both convulsant and cholinergic, soman, cyclosarin, tabun, VX, and organophosphorus pesticides) agents to enhance the inhibitory effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid at GABA receptors and limit excess central nervous system excitation and seizures. Non-selective benzodiazepine binding-site full agonists, exemplified by diazepam, act by enhancing the inhibitory effects of GABA at GABA receptors containing either an alpha1, -2, -3 or -5 subunit. However, despite their proven clinical anxiolytic efficacy, such compounds possess a relatively narrow window between doses that produce anxiolysis and those that cause sedation, and are also associated with physical dependence and a potential for abuse.

More specifically, the alpha2- and/or alpha3-containing GABA receptors play a role in anxiety whereas the alpha1 subtype is involved in sedation, raising the possibility of a compound that selectively modulates alpha2- and/or alpha3-containing receptors but does not affect alpha1-containing receptors would be a non-sedating anxiolytic. The status of these and other BZ site compounds with claimed, but often not explicitly stated, GABA subtype selectivity will be reviewed in relation to their development as non-sedating anxiolytics for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. Atack JR; The benzodiazepine binding site of GABA receptors as a target for the development of novel anxiolytics. Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2005; 14: 601–618.

We found that full inhibition of AChE and partial inhibition of BuChE in blood were accompanied by the onset of clinical signs, reflected by a decline in respiratory minute volume, bronchoconstriction and a decrease in heart rate. Furthermore, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of a single dose of atropine, obidoxime and diazepam, administered at appearance of first clinical signs, versus that of repetitive dosing of these drugs on the reappearance of signs.

### Inhibition in the amygdala anxiety circuitry [^113ek6bo]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Inhibitory neurotransmission plays a key role in anxiety disorders, as evidenced by the anxiolytic effect of the benzodiazepine class of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists and the recent discovery of anxiety-associated variants in the molecular components of inhibitory synapses. Accordingly, substantial interest has focused on understanding how inhibitory neurons and synapses contribute to the circuitry underlying adaptive and pathological anxiety behaviors. A key element of the anxiety circuitry is the amygdala, which integrates information from cortical and thalamic sensory inputs to generate fear and anxiety-related behavioral outputs. Information processing within the amygdala is heavily dependent on inhibitory control, although the specific mechanisms by which amygdala GABAergic neurons and synapses regulate anxiety-related behaviors are only beginning to be uncovered. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge and highlight open questions regarding the role of inhibition in the amygdala anxiety circuitry. We discuss the inhibitory neuron subtypes that contribute to the processing of anxiety information in the basolateral and central amygdala, as well as the molecular determinants, such as GABA receptors and synapse organizer proteins, that shape inhibitory synaptic transmission within the anxiety circuitry. Finally, we conclude with an overview of current and future approaches for converting this knowledge into successful treatment strategies for anxiety disorders.

### Γ-aminobutyric acid regulates both the survival and replication of human β-cells [^115Lqw5u]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

A central focus of research in the type 1 diabetes (T1D) field is to develop ways to safely improve β-cell survival and function and promote their replication. The addition of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or the GABA B receptor (GABA B -R)–specific agonist baclofen to culture media has been shown to inhibit β-cell apoptosis in cultured rodent cell lines and islets. It remains to be determined whether GABA treatment can inhibit mouse β-cell apoptosis in vivo or, more importantly, whether it can protect human β-cells from stress-induced apoptosis. If GABA can inhibit human β-cell apoptosis, elucidating whether this effect is mediated through the G-protein–coupled GABA B -Rs, and/or the chloride channel GABA A -Rs will enable more specific drug targeting.

GABA can promote neurogenesis and neuronal proliferation and is a neuronal survival factor. GABA has also been shown to promote rodent β-cell replication. Those studies, however, differentially pointed to GABA A -Rs or GABA B -Rs as modulators of GABA's effects, making it important to clarify whether one or both types of GABA receptors modulate rodent β-cell replication. While a number of mitogens and growth factors can promote rodent β-cell replication, most fail to promote human β-cell replication (reviewed in refs.). Therefore, a key question is whether GABA can promote human β-cell replication. Even a small amount of GABA-induced human β-cell replication may be clinically useful by lowering insulin requirements and reducing the risk for long-term complications in T1D patients.

### Hippocampal µ-opioid receptors on GABAergic neurons mediate stress-induced impairment of memory retrieval [^111JFJcv]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Depression of GABAergic inhibitory transmission in the hippocampus impairs memory retrieval

The behavioural and electrophysiological results demonstrated that activation of µR GABA depresses hippocampal GABAergic transmission on pyramidal neurons and therefore impairs spatial memory retrieval. If the stress-induced impairment of memory retrieval indeed results from inhibition of GABAergic interneurons through activation of their µRs, it is reasonable to expect that diminishing GABAergic synaptic transmission by blocking GABA A receptors in the hippocampus will mimic the effects of stress on memory retrieval, whereas properly enhancing GABAergic transmission could counteract the effects of stress and attenuate the impairment. As shown in Fig. 5a, bilateral intra-hippocampal infusion of the GABA A receptor antagonist bicuculline (6.0 ng/µl) 15 min before the probe test dramatically damaged memory retrieval in the unstressed mice to an extent similar to that observed in the stressed mice with saline infusion. It is well accepted that bicuculline non-selectively blocks GABA A receptor-mediated phasic/tonic currents and L-655,708 selectively blocks the tonic inhibitory currents. Unlike the impairment observed with bicuculline, intraperitoneal administration of L-655,708 (0.7 mg/kg) or its vehicle (DMSO) 45 min before the probe test did not affect memory retrieval in the unstressed mice (Fig. 5a). It is thus reasonably concluded that depression of phasic inhibitory currents is the mechanism underlying the memory-retrieval impairment induced by EP stress.

### Enhanced phasic GABA inhibition during the repair phase of stroke: a novel therapeutic target [^1126SYj8]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Cortical circuit plasticity and remapping is important for functional recovery after stroke. Emerging evidence points to a role for GABA-mediated inhibition in modulating post-stroke plasticity as shown in a study where decreasing tonic (extrasynaptic) GABA inhibition in the repair phase of stroke, which starts days after stroke onset, significantly improved functional recovery. Much less is known about the role of phasic (synaptic) inhibition, a second mode of GABA signalling, in the repair phase of stroke. Our study provides the first structural and functional evidence of enhanced phasic GABAergic signalling in the peri-infarct cortex during the repair phase. Importantly, we demonstrate that boosting phasic GABA in the repair phase, using zolpidem, an FDA-approved positive allosteric GABA modulator, enhanced functional recovery without affecting lesion size. Thus, we identified a novel therapeutic strategy for stroke that targets plasticity-related recovery.

### Effects of isoflurane on gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors activated by full and partial agonists [^112Y1qc8]. Anesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Volatile anesthetics prolong inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in central neurons an allosteric action on the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor, an effect that may underlie the hypnotic actions of these agents. Inhaled anesthetics such as isoflurane act to enhance responses to submaximal concentrations of GABA, but it is not clear whether their effect is mediated by an increase in the binding of the agonist or by changes in receptor gating behavior. To address this question, the authors studied the effects of isoflurane on a mutant GABA(A) receptor with a gating defect that decreases receptor sensitivity by lowering agonist efficacy. They then compared the effects of clinically relevant concentrations of isoflurane on the actions of GABA and piperidine-4-sulfonic acid (P4S), a partial agonist at the GABA(A) receptor.

Methods

The authors created a mutant of the GABA receptor alpha subunit (L277A) by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant subunit was coexpressed with beta(2) and gamma(2S) subunits in HEK293 cells, and responses to GABA and P4S were recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. EC values were determined for the full agonist GABA and the partial agonist P4S. The authors also determined the relative efficacy (epsilon) of P4S. These measurements were then repeated in the presence of isoflurane.

Results

The concentration-response curve for GABA was shifted to the right (EC(50) = 278 microm) in the alpha(1)(L277A)beta(2)gamma(2S) mutant receptor, compared with the corresponding wild-type alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A) receptor (EC(50) = 16 microm). P4S is a partial agonist at both receptors, with a dramatically decreased relative efficacy at the mutant receptor (epsilon = 0.24). When the mutant receptor was studied in the presence of isoflurane, the concentration-response curves for both GABA and P4S were shifted to the left (EC(50) for GABA = 78 microm); the efficacy of P4S also increased significantly (epsilon = 0.40).

Conclusion

By studying a mutant GABA receptor with impaired gating, the authors were able to demonstrate clearly that isoflurane can increase the efficacy of a partial agonist, as well as increase agonist potency. These data suggest that the volatile anesthetic isoflurane exerts at least some of its effects on the GABA(A) receptor via alterations in gating rather than simply changing binding or unbinding of the agonist.

### The multiple facets of gamma-aminobutyric acid dysfunction in epilepsy [^111PwgGy]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The polarity of action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) changes from inhibition to excitation in the developing brain and in epilepsies. This review deals with recent observations concerning the mechanisms and clinical implications of the shift in GABA's activity from inhibition to excitation.

Recent Findings

GABAergic synapses provide most transmitter-gated inhibition and are the targets of numerous clinically active agents, notably antiepileptic drugs. In a wide range of brain structures and species, GABAergic synapses are excitatory during maturation because of a higher concentration of intracellular chloride. These findings suggest that activation of GABA synapses will excite foetal neurones while inhibiting those of the mother. In epilepsies, recurrent seizures also lead to an accumulation of chloride and an excitatory action of GABA. These observations have major implications for clinical practice and research. They suggest that use of benzodiazepines by pregnant mothers may lead to deleterious consequences when they are taken during the period when GABA is the main excitatory transmitter. Because neuronal activity alters important cell functions, including migration and morphogenesis, aberrant excessive excitation may lead to profound deleterious consequences.

Summary

In several physiological and pathological conditions, activation of GABAergic synapses excites neurones instead of producing classical inhibition. This shift, which is due to an intracellular accumulation of chloride, has major consequences for both the operation of networks and the pathogenic effects of epilepsies. This is particularly important in the immature brain, where the excitatory actions of GABA are particularly prominent.

### Effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid on working memory and attention: a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial [^116whXur]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in the central nervous system. Studies on both animals and humans show that GABA has the pharmacological potential for reducing the impact of cognitive disorders, as well as enhancing cognitive functions and mood. However, its specific effects on human attention and working memory have not yet been extensively studied.

Aims:

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and crossover trial, we aimed to test whether the administration of 800 mg GABA, dissolved in a drink, acutely affected visual working memory (VWM) maintenance, as well as temporal and spatial attention in healthy adults.

Methods:

The participants were 32 young adults (16 females and 16 males). Working memory recall precision, spatial attention and temporal attention were measured by a delayed match-to-sample task, a visual search (VS) task and a speeded rapid serial visual presentation task, respectively. Participants completed two experimental sessions (GABA and Placebo) in randomized and counterbalanced order. In each session, 45 min after administration of the drink, they completed all three aforementioned cognitive tasks.

Results:

Linear mixed model analysis results showed that GABA increased VS time, compared to the placebo, but did not affect VS accuracy, temporal attention, nor VWM precision.

Conclusions:

The results suggest that GABA increases VS time but does not affect temporal attention and memory, and that previously reported effects on cognition might rely on other functions.

### Γ-aminobutyric acid receptor type A receptor potentiation reduces firing of neuronal assemblies in a computational cortical model [^11653Pup]. Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The understanding of how general anesthetics act on individual cells and on global brain function has increased significantly during the last decade. What remains poorly understood is how anesthetics act at intermediate scales. Several major theories emphasize the importance of neuronal groups, sets of strongly connected neurons that fire in a time-locked fashion, in all aspects of brain function, particularly as a necessary substrate of consciousness. The authors have undertaken computer modeling to determine how ã-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABAA) receptor potentiating agents such as propofol may influence the dynamics of neuronal group formation and ongoing activity.

Methods

A computer model of a cortical network with connections modified by synaptic plasticity was examined. At baseline, the model spontaneously formed neuronal groups. Direct effects of GABAA receptor potentiation and indirect effects on input drive were then examined to study their effects on this process.

Results

Potentiation of GABAA inhibition and input drive reduction reduced the firing frequency of inhibitory and excitatory neurons in a dose-dependent manner. The diminution in spiking rates led to dramatic reductions in the firing frequency of neuronal groups. Simulated electroencephalographic output from the model at baseline exhibits gamma and theta rhythmicity. The direct and indirect GABAA effects reduce the amplitude of these underlying rhythms and modestly slow the gamma rhythm.

Conclusions

GABAA facilitation both directly and indirectly inhibits the ability of neurons to form groups spontaneously. A lack of group formation is consistent with some theories of anesthetic-induced loss of memory formation and consciousness.

### Enhancement of GABA-related signalling is associated with increase of functional connectivity in human cortex [^114eA6gP]. Human Brain Mapping (2004). Low credibility.

Structural or operational synchrony analysis with EEG was conducted in order to detect functional interaction between cortical areas during an enhanced inhibition induced by the GABAergic agonist lorazepam in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in eight healthy human subjects. Specifically, we investigated whether a neuronal inhibitory system in the brain mediates functional decoupling of cortical areas. Single-dose lorazepam administration resulted in a widespread increase in the inter-area functional connectivity and an increase in the strength of functional long-range and interhemispheric connections. These results suggest that inhibition can be an efficient mechanism for synchronization of large neuronal populations.

### Activation of GABAA receptors: views from outside the synaptic cleft [^116Cwf7E]. Neuron (2007). Low credibility.

Some GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are activated by low transmitter levels present in the extracellular space and generate an uninterrupted conductance referred to as "tonic". This tonic conductance is highly sensitive to all factors regulating the amount of GABA surrounding the neurons. Only a few GABA(A)Rs with particular subunit combinations are well suited to mediate the tonic conductance. These same receptors constitute important and specific targets for various endogenous and exogenous neuroactive compounds and possible therapeutic targets.

### Loss of striatonigral GABAergic presynaptic inhibition enables motor sensitization in parkinsonian mice [^116Psphw]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

Degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) causes hypokinesia, but DA replacement therapy can elicit exaggerated voluntary and involuntary behaviors that have been attributed to enhanced DA receptor sensitivity in striatal projection neurons. Here we reveal that in hemiparkinsonian mice, striatal D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs) directly projecting to the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) lose tonic presynaptic inhibition by GABAB receptors. The absence of presynaptic GABAB response potentiates evoked GABA release from MSN efferents to the SNr and drives motor sensitization. This alternative mechanism of sensitization suggests a synaptic target for PD pharmacotherapy.

### The effects of isoflurane on desensitized wild-type and alpha 1 (S270H) gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors [^111H1v2c]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)-R) mediate synaptic inhibition and meet many pharmacological criteria required of important general anesthetic targets. During synaptic transmission GABA release is sufficient to saturate, maximally activate, and transiently desensitize postsynaptic GABA(A)-Rs. The resulting inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) are prolonged by volatile anesthetics like isoflurane. We investigated the effects of isoflurane on maximally activated and desensitized GABA(A)-R currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Wild-type alpha(1)beta(2) and alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2s) receptors were exposed to 600 microM GABA until currents reached a steady-state desensitized level. At clinical concentrations (0.02–0.3 mM), isoflurane produced a dose-dependent enhancement of steady-state desensitized current in alpha(1)beta(2) receptors, an effect that was less apparent in receptors including a gamma(2s)-subunit. When serine at position 270 is mutated to histidine (alpha(1)(S270H)) in the second transmembrane segment of the alpha(1)-subunit, the currents evoked by sub-saturating concentrations of GABA became less sensitive to isoflurane enhancement. In addition, isoflurane enhancements of desensitized currents were greatly attenuated by this mutation and were undetectable in alpha(1)(S270H)beta(2)gamma(2s) receptors. In conclusion, isoflurane enhancement of GABA(A)-R currents evoked by saturating concentrations of agonist is subunit-dependent. The effects of isoflurane on desensitized receptors may be partly responsible for the prolongation of IPSCs during anesthesia.

Implications

Isoflurane enhances desensitized gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)-R) currents, an effect that is subunit-dependent and attenuated by a mutation in an alpha(1)-subunit pore residue of the GABA(A)-R. As GABA release at inhibitory synapses is typically saturating, isoflurane modulation of desensitized receptors may be partly responsible for prolongation of inhibitory postsynaptic currents during anesthesia.

### Serotonin-related rodent models of early-life exposure relevant for neurodevelopmental vulnerability to psychiatric disorders [^1146GsM2]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological models: behavioral outcomes

Psychotropic drugs can interfere directly or indirectly with the brain's developmental trajectory. Importantly, the age period when such perturbations occur will define the emergence of long-lasting detrimental consequences on the individual's brain architecture and function. Rodent models have been very useful to understand how such dysregulation of neural mechanisms during developmental critical periods can impact adult behaviors. Here, we analyze the behavioral outcomes of two pharmacological models: the exposure to SSRI antidepressants, and to the anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer, VPA. Both drugs have a high capacity of crossing the placenta to reach the fetus. While SSRIs inhibit the reuptake of 5-HT from the extracellular space by blocking the 5-HT transporter, SERT, the precise mechanism of action of VPA is less known. In fact, it is thought that one of the main actions of VPA is to modulate the synthesis and metabolism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), resulting in an enhancement of GABA neurotransmission. Besides, VPA was also shown to have a direct inhibitory action on histone deacetylases (HDACs), modulating the epigenetic control of gene expression.

### GABA induces a hormonal counter-regulatory response in subjects with long-standing type 1 diabetes [^114pWRPu]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a mediator in the central nervous system (CNS) and in peripheral tissues with effects exerted through ionotropic GABA-A and GABA-C, as well as metabotropic GABA-B receptors.GABA is synthesized from glutamate by glutamic acid decarboxylase, a well-known autoantigen in type 1 diabetes (T1D). In the adult brain, GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, while its peripheral effects vary depending on the tissue. Outside the CNS, GABA is found at the highest concentrations in beta-cells and immune cells. Most immune cells express GABA receptor subunits and the metabolic machinery required for GABA metabolism. GABA exerts a predominantly inhibitory effect on immune cells by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines.GABA receptor activation also enhances regulatory T cells, contributing to its immunosuppressive functions. In addition to beta-cells, GABA-A receptors are also expressed in a number of peripheral tissues, including the pituitary, chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla and hepatocytes. In experimental studies with rodent and human beta-cells, GABA has been shown to reverse diabetes by stimulating beta-cell regeneration, both through beta-cell proliferation and, although more controversial, transdifferentiation. The combined immune-modulatory and beta-cell effects make GABA a highly interesting candidate for the treatment of T1D. However, in many countries, including those in the European Union, GABA is considered a pharmaceutical drug. In this initial safety and dose escalation study, we have evaluated short-term GABA treatment in subjects with T1D as a first step toward testing the potential of GABA as a beta-cell regenerative treatment.

### Diazepam-induced loss of inhibitory synapses mediated by PLC δ / Ca / calcineurin signalling downstream of GABAA receptors [^111d7H7z]. Molecular Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines facilitate the inhibitory actions of GABA by binding to γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA A Rs), GABA-gated chloride/bicarbonate channels, which are the key mediators of transmission at inhibitory synapses in the brain. This activity underpins potent anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines in patients. However, extended benzodiazepine treatments lead to development of tolerance, a process which, despite its important therapeutic implications, remains poorly characterised. Here we report that prolonged exposure to diazepam, the most widely used benzodiazepine in clinic, leads to a gradual disruption of neuronal inhibitory GABAergic synapses. The loss of synapses and the preceding, time- and dose-dependent decrease in surface levels of GABA A Rs, mediated by dynamin-dependent internalisation, were blocked by Ro 15–1788, a competitive benzodiazepine antagonist, and bicuculline, a competitive GABA antagonist, indicating that prolonged enhancement of GABA A R activity by diazepam is integral to the underlying molecular mechanism. Characterisation of this mechanism has revealed a metabotropic-type signalling downstream of GABA A Rs, involving mobilisation of Ca 2+ from the intracellular stores and activation of the Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, which, in turn, dephosphorylates GABA A Rs and promotes their endocytosis, leading to disassembly of inhibitory synapses. Furthermore, functional coupling between GABA A Rs and Ca 2+ stores was sensitive to phospholipase C (PLC) inhibition by U73122, and regulated by PLCδ, a PLC isoform found in direct association with GABA A Rs. Thus, a PLCδ/Ca 2+ /calcineurin signalling cascade converts the initial enhancement of GABA A Rs by benzodiazepines to a long-term downregulation of GABAergic synapses, this potentially underpinning the development of pharmacological and behavioural tolerance to these widely prescribed drugs.

### Alprazolam [^112n3R4i]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Alprazolam is a 1,4 benzodiazepine. Alprazolam exerts its effect for the acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder through binding to the benzodiazepine site of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors in the brain and enhances GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Plasma levels of alprazolam increase proportionally to the dose over the range of 0.5 to 3.0 mg.

Absorption

Following oral administration, peak plasma concentration of alprazolam (Cmax) occurs in 1 to 2 hours post dose.

Distribution

Alprazolam is 80% bound to human serum protein, and albumin accounts for the majority of the binding.

Elimination

The mean plasma elimination half-life (T1/2) of alprazolam is approximately 11.2 hours (range: 6.3 to 26.9 hours) in healthy adults.

Metabolism

Alprazolam is extensively metabolized in humans, primarily by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), to 2 major active metabolites in the plasma: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam. The plasma circulation levels of the two active metabolites are less than 4% of the parent. The reported relative potencies in benzodiazepine receptor binding experiments and in animal models of induced seizure inhibition are 0.20 and 0.66, respectively, for 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they unlikely contribute much to the effects of alprazolam. A benzophenone derived from alprazolam is also found in humans. Their half-lives appear to be similar to that of alprazolam.

Excretion

Alprazolam and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine.

### Structural studies of the actions of anesthetic drugs on the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor [^115R2Dbc]. Anesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

The γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor is the major transmitter-gated inhibitory channel in the central nervous system. The receptor is a target for anesthetics, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, and sedatives whose actions facilitate the flow of chloride ions through the channel and enhance the inhibitory tone in the brain. Both the kinetic and structural aspects of the actions of modulators of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor are of great importance to understanding the molecular mechanisms of general anesthesia. In this review, the structural rearrangements that take place in the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor during channel activation and modulation are described, focusing on data obtained using voltage-clamp fluorometry. Voltage-clamp fluorometry entails the binding of an environmentally sensitive fluorophore molecule to a site of interest in the receptor, and measurement of changes in the fluorescence signal resulting from activation- or modulation-elicited structural changes. Detailed investigations can provide a map of structural changes that underlie or accompany the functional effects of modulators.

### GABAA receptors: subtypes, regional distribution, and function [^111ihFQM]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Modulatory agents of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors have been widely used for more than 40 years to treat anxiety, epilepsy, and sleep disorders; these drugs are generally safe, well tolerated, and effective. Recently, there has been a substantial growth in understanding of the mechanism of action of these drugs, which act at different sites on GABAA receptors. A variety of GABAA receptor subtypes with distinct functional roles have been characterized and an evolving awareness of GABAA receptor modulation holds promise for the future development of new, more sophisticated drug interventions that can elicit more selective effects by targeting specific subtypes of GABAA receptors. Advances in genetic engineering have led to the development of transgenic mouse models that have further refined our understanding of the pharmacology and physiology for various GABAA receptor subunits.

### Neuromodulation techniques-from non-invasive brain stimulation to deep brain stimulation [^114Yu4py]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) technique which uses a magnetic field to induce electric currents in the brain. This can be used with diagnostic intent – to detect subtle deficits in brain inhibition or excitation - as well as therapeutically. For diagnostic purposes, single-pulse TMS can assess cortical excitability using parameters such as the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs), resting or active motor threshold (RMT/AMT), the silent period (silence in the electromyography activity following a MEP), and recruitment curve (higher MEP amplitude with increasing stimulation intensity) (Fig. 1). Using paired-pulse TMS, several inhibitory and facilitatory intracortical circuits such as short interval cortical inhibition (SICI) and intra-cortical facilitation (ICF) can also be measured. SICI arises from the interplay of inhibitory and excitatory circuits in the brain. A weak conditioning stimulus, followed by a test stimulus within a short interval (usually 1–6 ​ms), activates inhibitory interneurons. These interneurons release inhibitory neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), reducing the excitatory response in target neurons. This leads to decreased neural output, representing a short-latency inhibitory effect. On the other hand, ICF involves a similar protocol but with a longer inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 8–30 ​ms. Here, excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate enhance synaptic transmission, amplifying neural response. ICF represents a brief facilitation of neural pathways.

### Halothane and propofol modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor single-channel currents [^112KMLrD]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Halothane and propofol enhance the activity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, which is one of the most important systems in the mechanism of anesthesia. To determine whether halothane and propofol enhance GABAergic responses by the same mechanism, we performed single-channel patch-clamp experiments with rat cortical neurons in primary culture. Each of the open-time and closed-time distributions of GABA(A) receptor single channels was expressed by a sum of fast and slow time constants. Neither halothane nor propofol changed the single-channel conductance. Halothane increased the probability of the channel being open via a prolongation of the slow phase of open time, whereas propofol increased the channel open probability via a shortening of the slow phase of closed time. Thus, although both halothane and propofol augmented the channel open probability, thereby causing an increase in charge transfer during inhibitory transmitter action, they acted by different mechanisms.

### Enhancing neuronal chloride extrusion rescues α ₂ / α 3 GABA-mediated analgesia in neuropathic pain [^117CitoX]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Spinal disinhibition has been hypothesized to underlie pain hypersensitivity in neuropathic pain. Apparently contradictory mechanisms have been reported, raising questions on the best target to produce analgesia. Here, we show that nerve injury is associated with a reduction in the number of inhibitory synapses in the spinal dorsal horn. Paradoxically, this is accompanied by a BDNF-TrkB-mediated upregulation of synaptic GABA A Rs and by an α1-to-α2GABA A R subunit switch, providing a mechanistic rationale for the analgesic action of the α2,3GABA A R benzodiazepine-site ligand L838,417 after nerve injury. Yet, we demonstrate that impaired Cl - extrusion underlies the failure of L838,417 to induce analgesia at high doses due to a resulting collapse in Cl - gradient, dramatically limiting the benzodiazepine therapeutic window. In turn, enhancing KCC2 activity not only potentiated L838,417-induced analgesia, it rescued its analgesic potential at high doses, revealing a novel strategy for analgesia in pathological pain, by combined targeting of the appropriate GABA A R-subtypes and restoring Cl - homeostasis.

### Diazepam-induced loss of inhibitory synapses mediated by PLC δ / Ca / calcineurin signalling downstream of GABAA receptors [^112WmY2q]. Molecular Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Benzodiazepines are among the most widely prescribed class of drugs worldwide. Due to their rapid anxiolytic, sedative-hypnotic, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant effects, they are prescribed for various conditions, most prominently anxiety, insomnia and epileptic seizures. Among these disorders, anxiety, often coinciding with depression, is one of the most common mental health problems in the world (World Health Organization), and is the largest cause of sickness absence in the UK, with ~1 in 6 adults being chronically affected according to Mental Health Foundation UK. Although benzodiazepines are very effective initially, the major limitation to their long-term use is the development of tolerance to their pharmacological effects, as well as dependence, resulting in severe withdrawal symptoms upon drug cessation. Nevertheless, the estimated prevalence of long-term use among patients prescribed with benzodiazepine ranges from 25 to 76%, which is equivalent to 2–7.5% of the general population. Although benzodiazepines have been prescribed for over 50 years, the molecular mechanisms leading to tolerance are still poorly understood.

In the nervous system, benzodiazepines bind exclusively to the GABA A Rs, the main inhibitory receptors in the brain, and allosterically enhance their responsiveness to GABA. GABA A Rs are GABA-gated chloride/bicarbonate channels built up as hetero-pentamers from a pool of 16 different subunits classified as α(1–6), β(1–3), γ(1–3), δ, ε, π and θ, the combination of which determines physiological and pharmacological properties, as well as the tissue and subcellular distribution of these receptors. Benzodiazepines selectively bind to γ 2 subunit-containing GABA A Rs, which are specifically localised to GABAergic inhibitory synapses, thereby enhancing the strength of synaptic inhibition in the brain. In addition to the γ 2 subunit, synaptic GABA A Rs incorporate two α subunits (α 1, α 2, α 3 or α 5) and two β subunits (β 2 or β 3), with the benzodiazepine binding site residing at the interface between the γ 2 subunit and one of the α subunits. In neurons, synaptic GABA A Rs are clustered in the vicinity of presynaptic GABA-releasing terminals, to maximise the efficacy of transmission, but they are also mobile and dynamic, being continuously trafficked between the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane and, once at the cell surface, in and out of synapses.

### Suppressing astrocytic GABA transaminase enhances tonic inhibition and weakens hippocampal spatial memory [^114o5gRa]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here, we described the causal relationship between the disruption of the astrocytic GABA degradation pathway and enhanced tonic inhibition. We found that suppressing GABA-T in astrocytes but not GABAergic neurons is an effective approach to increase tonic inhibition. Suppressing astrocytic GABA-T alone was sufficient to dampen the excitability of GCs in the dorsal DG and impair spatial long-term memory. Our study suggests that cognitive functions could be dynamically regulated by altering GABA clearance in the brain via astrocytic GABA-T.

While enzymes associated with the production of astrocytic GABA can control neuronal excitability, our findings reveal another notable and opposing mechanism in which the degradation of astrocytic GABA also plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability. Mechanistically, tonic GABA release from astrocytes can reduce the membrane resistance of neurons through the prolonged opening of extrasynaptic GABA A Rs, thereby reducing the excitatory postsynaptic potential and neuronal excitability. One approach to enhancing astrocytic tonic GABA release is the overexpression of astrocytic MAO-B. However, this approach may also increase the amount of H 2 O 2 as a byproduct of the MAO-B reaction, which might inadvertently result in neurodegeneration. Our study proposes to address this issue by suppressing astrocytic GABA-T to increase astrocytic tonic GABA release without unwanted side effects such as increased H 2 O 2 production.

Unlike physiological conditions, we used an internal solution with a high Cl − concentration to examine the effects of astrocytic GABA-T suppression on neuronal firing. Under these experimental conditions, the GABA A current reversal potential (E GABA) was depolarizing, rendering the baseline tonic GABA A conductance excitatory. However, as astrocytic GABA-T suppression substantially increased tonic GABA A conductance, the initial excitatory effect of depolarization appeared to eventually be overridden by inhibition. This shift can be explained by shunting inhibition, whereby the increase in tonic GABA A conductance diminishes the effectiveness of excitatory inputs through increased membrane conductance. Consequently, astrocytic GABA-T suppression probably increases ambient GABA to levels where shunting inhibition dominates, even with a depolarizing E GABA, thereby decreasing the spike probability. This experimental setup underscores the robustness of shunting inhibition mediated by astrocytic GABA-T suppression in modulating neuronal excitability.

### Structural insights into opposing actions of neurosteroids on GABAreceptors [^112pbvwG]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptors mediate fast inhibitory signaling in the brain and are targets of numerous drugs and endogenous neurosteroids. A subset of neurosteroids are GABA A receptor positive allosteric modulators; one of these, allopregnanolone, is the only drug approved specifically for treating postpartum depression. There is a consensus emerging from structural, physiological and photolabeling studies as to where positive modulators bind, but how they potentiate GABA activation remains unclear. Other neurosteroids are negative modulators of GABA A receptors, but their binding sites remain debated. Here we present structures of a synaptic GABA A receptor bound to allopregnanolone and two inhibitory sulfated neurosteroids. Allopregnanolone binds at the receptor-bilayer interface, in the consensus potentiator site. In contrast, inhibitory neurosteroids bind in the pore. MD simulations and electrophysiology support a mechanism by which allopregnanolone potentiates channel activity and suggest the dominant mechanism for sulfated neurosteroid inhibition is through pore block.

### Photo-antagonism of the GABAA receptor [^113nMB6Q]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The precise coordination of our behaviour requires that we have adequate temporal control over neuronal excitation. The responsibility for this control falls largely to γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA A Rs). The timing, extent and cellular location of synaptic inhibition have a critical impact on neural network activity and therefore behaviour. Under normal circumstances, inhibition will be regulated by endogenous factors, post-translational modifications and by plasticity mechanisms. It is therefore unsurprising that dysfunction to GABAergic inhibition is implicated in numerous neurological diseases.

The strength (or macroscopic efficacy) of synaptic inhibition will depend on many factors, not least the number of GABA A Rs clustered at the postsynaptic membrane, and the mean probability of GABA channel opening. Receptor clustering will be affected by numerous signalling pathways, including GABA A R phosphorylation; while channel opening will be a function of the GABA concentration in the synaptic cleft and the activity of allosteric modulators, such as the neurosteroids. Of equal importance for effective synaptic inhibition is the potential for different GABA A R isoforms with their attendant differences in physiological and pharmacological properties, to be targeted to specific domains (inhibitory synapses) in the same cell.

### A 10 week open-label pilot study to evaluate… [^112JzTrA]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

A 10 Week Open-Label Pilot Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of Memantine as Augmentation Therapy in Patients With Generalized Anxiety DisorderClinicalTrials. gov ID. -to evaluate if there is an improvement in sleep quality following memantine dosing Memantine is an FDA approved treatment which helps slow down the progression of Alzheimer's dementia. It is felt that high glutamate levels associated with Alzheimer's dementia are toxic to neurons which ultimately die off causing the dementia process to continue. Memantine partially blocks the NMDA glutamate channels located on neurons in the brain. This way, if glutamate rises, its toxic activity is blunted and neurons tend to become less toxic and suffer less atrophy and death. Glutamate is felt to play a role in the development of anxiety as well. Glutamate is often in balance with another neurotransmitter, GABA.

This GABA-glutamate balance is also felt to play a role in the development of GAD or SAD. Low GABA and high glutamate levels are implicated in causing anxiety symptoms. Sometimes, GABA-increasing sedative drugs, such as diazepam are used to raise GABA activity to ward of anxiety symptoms and create a better balance between the stimulatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA. Given memantine's ability to lower glutamate levels, it may be able to also lower anxiety without the need for a sedative medication. Lowering glutamate this way, may allow a patient's own GABA concentrations to be more effective in lowering GAD or SAD symptoms. The usual second-line choice is to treat with a serotonin-norepinephrine enhancing SNRI, such as venlafaxineXR in order to achieve remission.

If resistance occurs to the SNRI, to promote full anxiety symptom relief, addition of a GABA enhancing-sedative to the SNRI is a reasonable polypharmacy strategy. Sedatives, like alprazolam, are addictive and considered third line agents now. The authors feel that memantine, given its ability to manipulate the GABA-glutamate balance by lowering glutamate without major side effects nor addiction may be a reasonable add-on or augmentation strategy to better alleviate anxiety in SNRI or SSRI partial responders.

### Mapping general anesthetic sites in heteromeric γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors reveals a potential for targeting receptor subtypes [^1122fRj9]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

IV general anesthetics, including propofol, etomidate, alphaxalone, and barbiturates, produce important actions by enhancing γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor activation. In this article, we review scientific studies that have located and mapped IV anesthetic sites using photoaffinity labeling and substituted cysteine modification protection. These anesthetics bind in transmembrane pockets between subunits of typical synaptic GABAA receptors, and drugs that display stereoselectivity also show remarkably selective interactions with distinct interfacial sites. These results suggest strategies for developing new drugs that selectively modulate distinct GABAA receptor subtypes.

### Enhanced phasic GABA inhibition during the repair phase of stroke: a novel therapeutic target [^1144RXpj]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Zolpidem binds with high affinity to the α1 subunit and with 10-fold lower affinity to α2 and α3 subunits. Therefore, we cannot rule out the involvement of other GABA A R subunits in promoting recovery after stroke. Indeed, our electrophysiology data suggest that in addition to GABA A Rs containing the α1 subunit, GABA A R's containing other subunits also increase after stroke. α1-containing GABA A Rs have rapid decay kinetics; accordingly if only α1-containing GABA A Rs increased we would expect to see an increase in miniature or spontaneous IPSC amplitude with a decrease in duration. However, we observed an increase in charge with no significant change in amplitude and kinetics. These findings suggest changes in other GABA A R subunits after stroke, in addition to α1, may contribute to the enhanced phasic GABA signalling. Identifying which additional subunits are altered and their potential involvement in functional recovery is an important focus for future studies.

A beneficial role of phasic GABA is in contrast to the detrimental role of tonic GABA signalling in post-stroke recovery and challenges the idea that enhanced GABA function is generally detrimental after stroke. This is not the first account of phasic and tonic inhibition mediating opposing outcomes. In absence epilepsy, agents that enhance tonic inhibition exacerbate seizures, while benzodiazepines that enhance phasic inhibition are effective antiepileptic drugs. Our data offer a fresh perspective on GABA's role in brain repair after stroke. It also raises the intriguing question of why the brain activates two opposing actions in a similar time frame. A balance between promoting and inhibiting plasticity is likely important to prevent maladaptive plasticity, which could induce stroke-related epilepsy, while still driving brain repair. The increase in phasic GABA signalling we observed is predominantly in cortical layer 5, the main source of cortical output, with very little effect seen in layer 2/3, the major source of interhemispheric cortico-cortical connections. Tonic GABA signalling, by contrast, is reported to be significantly altered in layer 2/3. This cortical layer specificity suggests that distinct cortical microcircuits respond differently after stroke. However, the significance of this and the interplay between phasic and tonic GABA in modulating stroke recovery remain to be determined. Moreover, as the GABA A receptors that mediate phasic and tonic inhibition differ in their subunit composition — phasic GABA A Rs contain primarily α1–3,5 subunits whereas tonic GABA A Rs contain primarily α4,6 subunits — it highlights the importance of targeted pharmacological intervention when considering therapeutic strategies for stroke that modulate GABA signalling.

### Volatile aromatic anesthetics variably impact human gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor function [^116Kuzsb]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are important inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter receptors, respectively, in the central nervous system. At the concentrations required to produce immobility in the face of a noxious stimulus, volatile aromatic anesthetics inhibit NMDA receptors to varying degrees, strongly suggesting that they also act at other targets to produce immobilization. In this study, we sought to assess the potential role that GABA(A) receptors play in mediating the behavioral actions of volatile aromatic anesthetics.

Methods

Electrophysiological techniques were used to quantify the effects of eight volatile aromatic anesthetics and three clinical anesthetics on currents mediated by alpha1beta2gamma2L GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes.

Results

At equivalent minimal alveolar anesthetic concentration multiples, volatile aromatic anesthetics vary widely in the degrees to which they enhance GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents elicited by low concentrations of GABA. In general, anesthetics that inhibit NMDA receptors most, enhanced GABA(A) receptors least. This reciprocal relationship between anesthetic potency on GABA(A) versus NMDA receptors was also observed for the clinical anesthetics isoflurane, halothane, and cyclopropane. Studies using a range of GABA concentrations indicated that volatile aromatic anesthetics enhance GABA(A) receptor activity by shifting the open-close (gating) equilibrium towards the open channel state.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that GABA(A) receptors contribute variably to the behavioral actions of volatile anesthetics and imply that the molecular determinants of anesthetic action on NMDA and GABA(A) receptors are distinctly different.

### Shared structural mechanisms of general anaesthetics and benzodiazepines [^1153K2Nf]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

Most general anaesthetics and classical benzodiazepine drugs act through positive modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptors to dampen neuronal activity in the brain 1–5. However, direct structural information on the mechanisms of general anaesthetics at their physiological receptor sites is lacking. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of GABA A receptors bound to intravenous anaesthetics, benzodiazepines and inhibitory modulators. These structures were solved in a lipidic environment and are complemented by electrophysiology and molecular dynamics simulations. Structures of GABA A receptors in complex with the anaesthetics phenobarbital, etomidate and propofol reveal both distinct and common transmembrane binding sites, which are shared in part by the benzodiazepine drug diazepam. Structures in which GABA A receptors are bound by benzodiazepine-site ligands identify an additional membrane binding site for diazepam and suggest an allosteric mechanism for anaesthetic reversal by flumazenil. This study provides a foundation for understanding how pharmacologically diverse and clinically essential drugs act through overlapping and distinct mechanisms to potentiate inhibitory signalling in the brain.

Regardless of our model's correctness, the finding that auditory cortex gamma oscillations are an inhibitory process in tinnitus is an important one; cortical gamma oscillations are known to be generated by the action of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons and to be influenced in vivo by local concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid. These factors are potentially amenable to pharmacological manipulation, and therefore a correct understanding of their role with respect to tinnitus is important for therapeutic exploitation. If our assertion is correct that cholinergic mechanisms influence gamma oscillations in tinnitus, then this might represent a further possible avenue of pharmacological intervention. Our findings suggest that auditory cortex gamma oscillations are not generators of tinnitus, but rather an intrinsic control mechanism that exerts tonic suppression of the phantom auditory percept, and might be augmented to therapeutic effect.

### GABA-ergic drugs: exit stage left, enter stage right [^116Xr68F]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2003). Low credibility.

Drugs that enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity by interacting at post-synaptic GABA(A) receptors have long been used as hypnotics, sedatives, tranquillizers and anticonvulsants. In this category, benzodiazepines rapidly gained pride of place, replacing barbiturates and becoming the most commonly prescribed of all drugs in the Western world in the 1970s. However, problems such as dependence and withdrawal reactions became apparent in the 1980s, and it seemed that the usefulness of drugs with this mode of action was limited. Recently, focus has shifted to a new group of drugs with GABA-ergic actions mediated through various mechanisms not directly involving the GABA(A) receptor. These drugs include gabapentin, vigabatrin, tiagabine, lamotrigine, pregabalin and others. Although originally developed as anticonvulsants for epilepsy, they appear to have wider applications for use in affective disorders, especially bipolar depression, anxiety disorders and pain conditions. The current information on the properties and therapeutic potential of this new generation of GABA-ergic drugs is reviewed. It remains to be seen whether long-term use leads to tolerance, dependence and withdrawal or discontinuation reactions.

### Reducing excessive GABA-mediated tonic inhibition promotes functional recovery after stroke [^114aHCeU]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Stroke is a leading cause of disability, but no pharmacological therapy is currently available for promoting recovery. The brain region adjacent to stroke damage-the peri-infarct zone-is critical for rehabilitation, as it shows heightened neuroplasticity, allowing sensorimotor functions to re-map from damaged areas. Thus, understanding the neuronal properties constraining this plasticity is important for the development of new treatments. Here we show that after a stroke in mice, tonic neuronal inhibition is increased in the peri-infarct zone. This increased tonic inhibition is mediated by extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors and is caused by an impairment in GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) transporter (GAT-3/GAT-4) function. To counteract the heightened inhibition, we administered in vivo a benzodiazepine inverse agonist specific for α5-subunit-containing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors at a delay after stroke. This treatment produced an early and sustained recovery of motor function. Genetically lowering the number of α5- or δ-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors responsible for tonic inhibition also proved beneficial for recovery after stroke, consistent with the therapeutic potential of diminishing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor function. Together, our results identify new pharmacological targets and provide the rationale for a novel strategy to promote recovery after stroke and possibly other brain injuries.

### GABAergic signaling linked to autophagy enhances host protection against intracellular bacterial infections [^111gPBuK]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter within the central nervous system and has been extensively studied in neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia –. In neuronal cells, GABA is produced from glutamic acid by the action of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 and GAD67. In turn, GABA is broken down by GABA transaminase to be recycled through the tricarboxylic acid cycle to form glutamic acid. The optimal regulation of GABA-glutamic acid circuits is critical for the physiological function of the central nervous system, and its imbalance may trigger a myriad of symptoms associated with numerous neurological disorders. Therefore, GABAergic medications that correct dysregulated GABAergic neurotransmission are being used to treat epilepsy, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia, as well as in anesthesia. A growing body of evidence has shown that a variety of peripheral immune cells express functional GABAergic components, including GABA-A ion channels, the GABA-B receptor, GABA transporters, and enzymes involved in GABA synthesis or degradation –. Preclinical studies suggest the potential application of GABA or GABAergic (agonistic) drugs as new therapeutics against autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including type 1 diabetes, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and collagen-induced arthritis. Nonetheless, given the potential role for GABA in the modulation of innate immune responses, it is poorly understood whether and how GABAergic signaling regulates antimicrobial host defenses in the context of bacterial infections.

### Dietary modulation of cortical excitation and inhibition [^112y9szF]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

The balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain affects both neural responses and behaviour in humans and animals. Here we investigated whether dietary intervention aimed at increasing levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can influence neural responses to basic sensory stimuli. Using a steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm, we found that the neural response to visual patterns was reduced in individuals who consumed a yeast extract product rich in substances associated with the production of GABA (glutamate and B vitamins), but not in a control group who consumed a placebo substance (n = 14 per group). This demonstrates that the balance of excitation and inhibition in the brain can be influenced by dietary interventions, suggesting possible clinical benefits in conditions (e.g. epilepsy) where inhibition is abnormal.

### Clonazepam [^11222S7o]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacodynamics:

The precise mechanism by which clonazepam exerts its antiseizure and antipanic effects is unknown, although it is believed to be related to its ability to enhance the activity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.

Pharmacokinetics:

Clonazepam is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of clonazepam is about 90%. Maximum plasma concentrations of clonazepam are reached within 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. Clonazepam is approximately 85% bound to plasma proteins. Clonazepam is highly metabolized, with less than 2% unchanged clonazepam being excreted in the urine. Biotransformation occurs mainly by reduction of the 7-nitro group to the 4-amino derivative. This derivative can be acetylated, hydroxylated and glucuronidated. Cytochrome P-450 including CYP3A, may play an important role in clonazepam reduction and oxidation. The elimination half-life of clonazepam is typically 30 to 40 hours. Clonazepam pharmacokinetics are dose-independent throughout the dosing range. There is no evidence that clonazepam induces its own metabolism or that of other drugs in humans.

Pharmacokinetics in Demographic Subpopulations and in Disease States:

Controlled studies examining the influence of gender and age on clonazepam pharmacokinetics have not been conducted, nor have the effects of renal or liver disease on clonazepam pharmacokinetics been studied. Because clonazepam undergoes hepatic metabolism, it is possible that liver disease will impair clonazepam elimination. Thus, caution should be exercised when administering clonazepam to these patients. (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

In children, clearance values of 0.42 ± 0.32 mL/min/kg (ages 2–18 years) and 0.88 ± 0.4 mL/min/kg (ages 7–12 years) were reported; these values decreased with increasing body weight. Ketogenic diet in children does not affect clonazepam concentrations.

### Suppressing astrocytic GABA transaminase enhances tonic inhibition and weakens hippocampal spatial memory [^111b2t8R]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological suppression of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase (GABA-T), the sole GABA-degrading enzyme and a potential therapeutic target for treating brain disorders such as epilepsy, increases not only phasic inhibition but also tonic inhibition. However, the specific cellular source, neuromodulatory effects and potential therapeutic benefits of this enhanced tonic inhibition remain unexplored due to the lack of cell-type-specific gene manipulation studies. Here we report that the increase in tonic GABA currents observed after GABA-T suppression is predominantly due to increased tonic GABA release from astrocytes rather than action-potential-dependent synaptic GABA spillover. General GABA-T knockdown (KD) by a short hairpin RNA considerably increased tonic GABA currents in dentate granule cells, thereby enhancing tonic inhibition. An astrocyte-specific rescue of GABA-T following general GABA-T KD normalized the elevated tonic GABA currents to near control levels. Tetrodotoxin-insensitive tonic GABA currents were significantly increased after general GABA-T KD, whereas tetrodotoxin-sensitive tonic GABA currents showed no significant increase, suggesting that this enhanced tonic inhibition is primarily action-potential independent. General GABA-T KD reduced the spike probability of granule cells and impaired dorsal hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, which were fully reversed by astrocyte-specific GABA-T rescue. These findings suggest that suppressing astrocytic GABA-T may be sufficient to influence the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain and associated behaviors. Our study implies that the therapeutic benefits of pharmacological GABA-T suppression may be largely attributed to the modulation of astrocytic GABA-T and its impact on tonic GABA release from astrocytes. Here, we report distinct effects of GABA-T suppression depending on cell type; suppressing GABA-T in astrocytes enhances tonic inhibition, while its suppression in GABAergic neurons augments phasic inhibition. Our findings demonstrate that targeted suppression of astrocytic GABA-T not only enhances tonic GABA release from astrocytes but also significantly influences the excitation/inhibition balance in the brain, with consequential effects on behavior. This suggests that astrocytic GABA-T modulation holds promising potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies aimed at treating cognitive and neurological disorders through the regulation of astrocytic GABA metabolism.

### Structural and dynamic mechanisms of GABAreceptor modulators with opposing activities [^113WwzcB]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

GABA A receptors, the ionotropic targets of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that mainly function to suppress excitability in the central nervous system. Upon GABA binding, the intrinsic ion channel opens, which in most cases enables the influx of chloride to oppose depolarization and inhibit neuronal firing. Several neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism, and anxiety disorders, have been associated with GABA A -receptor dysregulation –. The diverse physiological roles of this receptor are related to variable expression of GABA A -receptor subunits, with the most abundant synaptic isoform in adult brain composed of two α1-subunits, two β-subunits and one γ2-subunit.

The GABA A receptor is the principal site of action of benzodiazepines. These drugs act through two distinct groups of binding sites: a primary high-affinity site at the α/γ extracellular interface and three low-affinity binding sites located between subunits (γ/β and β/α) in the transmembrane domain –. Classical benzodiazepines like diazepam are used to treat epilepsy, insomnia, and anxiety disorders. However, administration of these drugs is often accompanied by the development of side effects including sedation, cognitive impairment, addiction, and tolerance, which is in part due to their non-selective modulation of many GABA A -receptor subtypes. Zolpidem, a representative of a new generation of benzodiazepine-site modulators, is the most widely prescribed hypnotic in the United States. It is an imidazopyridine, chemically distinct from benzodiazepines, but exerts similar pharmacological and physiological effects through GABA A receptors. Interestingly, zolpidem shows significantly higher binding affinity and modulatory potency at α1βγ2 receptors, exhibiting high selectivity for α1-containing GABA A receptors. However, direct structural information on zolpidem binding to GABA A receptors that would illuminate how this selectivity is determined is currently absent.

### Structural and dynamic mechanisms of GABAreceptor modulators with opposing activities [^114p6jDu]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Functionally diverse ligands interact with the benzodiazepine site in the extracellular α/γ-subunit interface of the GABA A receptor (Fig. 1a). Classical benzodiazepines and zolpidem are positive allosteric modulators (PAM) that enhance the response to GABA. Flumazenil can have variable activity but is mainly considered a silent allosteric modulator, with limited direct effects on GABA-induced currents, and antagonizes the action of benzodiazepine PAMs. Several β-carbolines such as methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) are negative allosteric modulators (NAM) that can decrease GABA A -receptor activity, particularly at low concentrations. Conversely, at high concentrations DMCM can act as a positive modulator, especially in the presence of flumazenil, to enhance GABA-elicited currents –. Identification of structural elements that couple the benzodiazepine-site binding to modulation of channel function has begun –. However, the mechanisms by which DMCM binding is transduced to both potentiation and inhibition remain unclear.

Zolpidem is shown as cyan spheres, DMCM as orange spheres, GABA as red spheres.

Here we obtained cryo-EM structures of the α1β2γ2 GABA A receptor in complex with GABA plus either zolpidem or DMCM, enabling visualization of the binding sites and protein interactions of these important ligands (Fig. 1b–e). A combination of structural pharmacology and metadynamics simulations supports a rationale for zolpidem selectivity for the α1βγ2 subtype of GABA A receptors. Furthermore, structural comparisons and all-atom simulations suggest a mechanism for the distinctive bimodal modulation profile of DMCM. This structural and simulation data shed new light on allosteric ligand binding and modulation in the GABA A -receptor family, with applications in channel biophysics and the refinement of benzodiazepine-site therapeutics.

### GABAB-mediated rescue of altered excitatory-inhibitory balance, gamma synchrony and behavioral deficits following constitutive NMDAR-hypofunction [^114cVPJP]. Translational Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Baclofen mechanism of action

Based on these results, the efficacy of baclofen may relate to its ability to dampen hyperexcitability via pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms. Baclofen stimulates metabotropic GABA B -receptors, which function as presynaptic autoreceptors to inhibit vesicular release and activate postsynaptic, inward-rectifying potassium channels. Together, these mechanisms serve to tonically hyperpolarize neurons, decrease resting membrane potential and reduce cell firing. This hyperpolarization likely affects gamma SNR in two ways. First, by decreasing intrinsic pyramidal cell excitability, as well as spontaneous and evoked synaptic input into these cells (Figure 3), we would expect that spontaneous firing of these cells ('noise') would be reduced, leading to a reduction in spontaneous LFP power. Likewise, hyperpolarization of pyramidal cells by baclofen would be expected to increase stimulus-evoked gamma-band signal, given the significant negative correlation between pre- and post-stimulus gamma power. Given the dysfunction of FSI, we speculate that such a reduction in membrane potential of postsynaptic neurons may seek to augment the downstream effects of phasic GABA release by these interneurons. Instead of attempting to directly mimic the phasic output of FSI (and other interneurons), as GABA A -receptor agonists such as L-838,417 would, baclofen places the system in a state where GABA that is released is amplified due to a lower resting membrane potential. As temporally precise GABA release by FSI onto pyramidal cells is crucial for the emergence of oscillatory activity, this amplification of the output from FSI would be expected to facilitate gamma synchrony. As such, the efficacy of tonic GABA B -agonists but not phasic GABA A -agonists suggests that elevated microcircuit noise is the primary insult following NMDAR-hypofunction. Baclofen broadly reduces the likelihood of a cell firing, in contrast to the actions of a GABA A -receptor agonist that would phasically modulate spike timing.

### GABA tone regulation and its cognitive functions in the brain [^114oX6zg]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2023). High credibility.

γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter released at GABAergic synapses, mediating fast-acting phasic inhibition. Emerging lines of evidence unequivocally indicate that a small amount of extracellular GABA - GABA tone - exists in the brain and induces a tonic GABA current that controls neuronal activity on a slow timescale relative to that of phasic inhibition. Surprisingly, studies indicate that glial cells that synthesize GABA, such as astrocytes, release GABA through non-vesicular mechanisms, such as channel-mediated release, and thereby act as the source of GABA tone in the brain. In this Review, we first provide an overview of major advances in our understanding of the cell-specific molecular and cellular mechanisms of GABA synthesis, release and clearance that regulate GABA tone in various brain regions. We next examine the diverse ways in which the tonic GABA current regulates synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity through extrasynaptic GABA A -receptor-mediated mechanisms. Last, we discuss the physiological mechanisms through which tonic inhibition modulates cognitive function on a slow timescale. In this Review, we emphasize that the cognitive functions of tonic GABA current extend beyond mere inhibition, laying a foundation for future research on the physiological and pathophysiological roles of GABA tone regulation in normal and abnormal psychiatric conditions.

### Teaching an old GABA receptor new tricks [^115uWoTo]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

The accompanying articles in this issue of the journal's special collection describe attempts to improve on the dynamics of distribution and reduce side effects of analogs of etomidate and benzodiazepines. Both classes of drugs have their principal sites of action on γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors, although at very different binding sites and by different mechanisms of action. Herein, we review the structure of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors and describe the location of the 2 likely binding sites. In addition, we describe how these drugs can interact with the nervous system at a systems level. We leave it to other reviewers to discuss whether these new drugs offer true clinical improvements.

### GABA uptake regulates cortical excitability via cell type-specific tonic inhibition [^1155LtiZ]. Nature Neuroscience (2003). Medium credibility.

GABA(A) receptors can mediate both 'phasic' synaptic inhibition and a persistent 'tonic' form of signaling. We show that, in the presence of intact GABA uptake, guinea pig hippocampal interneurons, but not pyramidal cells, express a tonic GABA(A) receptor-mediated conductance. This conductance was pharmacologically distinct from spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). Inhibiting GABA uptake resulted in the expression of a comparable GABA(A) receptor-mediated tonic conductance in pyramidal cells. Reducing the tonic conductance in interneurons enhanced their excitability and the inhibitory drive to pyramidal cells. These results point to a role for cell type-dependent tonic inhibition in regulating cortical excitability.

### Suppressing astrocytic GABA transaminase enhances tonic inhibition and weakens hippocampal spatial memory [^116KmmqD]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevating brain GABA levels is a key therapeutic strategy for counteracting excessive excitatory neurotransmission in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. To this end, suppression of the GABA degradation pathway has been proposed as a feasible and efficient method, particularly by inhibiting GABA transaminase (GABA-T), which is the only enzyme responsible for GABA degradation in mammals. This enzyme, encoded by the ABAT gene, breaks down GABA that is either produced or taken up by astrocytes and GABAergic neurons. GABA-T transforms GABA into succinic semialdehyde (SSA) while simultaneously converting α-ketoglutarate into glutamate. A downstream enzyme called SSA dehydrogenase (SSADH), encoded by the ALDH5A1 gene, subsequently converts SSA into succinate. Previous studies have primarily focused on GABAergic neurons, where pharmacological GABA-T suppression increases GABA accumulation and synaptic GABA release, changes that are expected to dampen excessive neuronal activity and provide therapeutic benefits for epilepsy and drug addiction –. However, although several studies have highlighted a substantial increase in tonic inhibition due to a disruption of the GABA degradation pathway. in-depth research into its neuromodulatory and therapeutic impacts is still lacking, largely because the cellular origin of the enhanced tonic inhibition remains ambiguous.

In the present study, we investigate whether astrocytic GABA-T is responsible for enhanced tonic inhibition upon pharmacological GABA-T suppression. We focused on the dorsal hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), a region that is not only crucial for spatial learning and memory but also susceptible to modulation by tonic inhibition. We found that astrocyte-specific suppression of GABA-T can effectively increase astrocytic tonic GABA release and tonic inhibition, thereby controlling neuronal excitability and related behaviors.

### Neuregulin-1 enhances depolarization-induced GABA release [^1133p6v6]. Neuron (2007). Low credibility.

Neuregulin-1 (NRG1), a regulator of neural development, has been shown to regulate neurotransmission at excitatory synapses. Although ErbB4, a key NRG1 receptor, is expressed in glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-positive neurons, little is known about its role in GABAergic transmission. We show that ErbB4 is localized at GABAergic terminals of the prefrontal cortex. Our data indicate a role of NRG1, both endogenous and exogenous, in regulation of GABAergic transmission. This effect was blocked by inhibition or mutation of ErbB4, suggesting the involvement of ErbB4. Together, these results indicate that NRG1 regulates GABAergic transmission via presynaptic ErbB4 receptors, identifying a novel function of NRG1. Because both NRG1 and ErbB4 have emerged as susceptibility genes of schizophrenia, these observations may suggest a mechanism for abnormal GABAergic neurotransmission in this disorder.

### Effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid on working memory and attention: a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial [^1165De85]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Humans seem to have an innate desire to enhance their abilities, physical as well as cognitive. This is why many people take dietary supplements on a regular basis. One such supplement that has been popular in recent years is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and can be found to occur naturally in various foods such as tomatoes, sweet potatoes, spinach and soybeans. Therefore, even without supplementation, many people already consume GABA daily. It is conceivable that GABA consumption may have (positive) effects on neuronal signalling, and thereby improve cognition.

Due to its concentration in the central nervous system (CNS), GABA plays a critical role in all mammals. In the CNS, GABA acts via its two primary receptors, GABA A and GABA B, which are responsible for different regulation systems and include several subtypes. GABA A receptors regulate mood, vigilance, muscle tension, and memory functions, while GABA B receptors regulate cerebral reward processes and behaviour. Whereas primarily GABA A receptors are associated with cognitive functions, it has been suggested that GABA B receptors also play a crucial role in memory, learning and neurological disorders. In particular, subtype α 5 GABA A receptors are central to the pharmacological modulation of learning and memory. These receptors thus seem crucial to the effect of GABA on cognitive functions.

GABA also seems to have region-specific effects within the brain. It has been shown that a decrease in hippocampal GABA A receptor α 5 subunits disrupts object recognition and memory in mice. Similarly, reduced hippocampal GABAergic inhibition in GABA A receptors causes lower memory and attention performance in rats. In the prefrontal cortex, GABA activations and levels also influence cognitive functions directly and indirectly.reported that dysregulation of GABAergic activity in the prefrontal cortex of aged rats negatively affected their working memory performance. Furthermore, Auger and Floresco showed that antagonism in GABA A signalling in the prefrontal cortex affects search behaviours that are guided by spatial working memory, short-term and reference memory in rats. Nevertheless, the same study showed that blocking GABA's action does not affect spatial discrimination performance. In other words, GABA's action did affect working memory performance, but not to the extent that it had a noticeable effect on the precision of memory.

### Perisomatic GABA release and thalamocortical integration onto neocortical excitatory cells are regulated by neuromodulators [^115femGj]. Neuron (2008). Low credibility.

Neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, serotonin, and noradrenaline are powerful regulators of neocortical activity. Although it is well established that cortical inhibition is the target of these modulations, little is known about their effects on GABA release from specific interneuron types. This knowledge is necessary to gain a mechanistic understanding of the actions of neuromodulators because different interneuron classes control specific aspects of excitatory cell function. Here, we report that GABA release from fast-spiking (FS) cells, the most prevalent interneuron subtype in neocortex, is robustly inhibited following activation of muscarinic, serotonin, adenosine, and GABA(B) receptors — an effect that regulates FS cell control of excitatory neuron firing. The potent muscarinic inhibition of GABA release from FS cells suppresses thalamocortical feedforward inhibition. This is supplemented by the muscarinic-mediated depolarization of thalamo-recipient excitatory neurons and the nicotinic enhancement of thalamic input onto these neurons to promote thalamocortical excitation.

### Structural and dynamic mechanisms of GABAreceptor modulators with opposing activities [^115sA7TL]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels abundant in the central nervous system and are prolific drug targets for treating anxiety, sleep disorders and epilepsy. Diverse small molecules exert a spectrum of effects on γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptors by acting at the classical benzodiazepine site. They can potentiate the response to GABA, attenuate channel activity, or counteract modulation by other ligands. Structural mechanisms underlying the actions of these drugs are not fully understood. Here we present two high-resolution structures of GABA A receptors in complex with zolpidem, a positive allosteric modulator and heavily prescribed hypnotic, and DMCM, a negative allosteric modulator with convulsant and anxiogenic properties. These two drugs share the extracellular benzodiazepine site at the α/γ subunit interface and two transmembrane sites at β/α interfaces. Structural analyses reveal a basis for the subtype selectivity of zolpidem that underlies its clinical success. Molecular dynamics simulations provide insight into how DMCM switches from a negative to a positive modulator as a function of binding site occupancy. Together, these findings expand our understanding of how GABA A receptor allosteric modulators acting through a common site can have diverging activities.

### Neurosteroids: endogenous regulators of the GABA (A) receptor [^1123qa6k]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2005). Medium credibility.

GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors mediate most of the 'fast' synaptic inhibition in the mammalian brain and are targeted by many clinically important drugs. Certain naturally occurring pregnane steroids can potently and specifically enhance GABA(A) receptor function in a nongenomic (direct) manner, and consequently have anxiolytic, analgesic, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic and anaesthetic properties. These steroids not only act as remote endocrine messengers, but also can be synthesized in the brain, where they modify neuronal activity locally by modulating GABA(A) receptor function. Such 'neurosteroids' can influence mood and behaviour in various physiological and pathophysiological situations, and might contribute to the behavioural effects of psychoactive drugs.

### When a good cop turns bad: the pro-ictal action of parvalbumin expressing interneurons during seizures [^117GEJYM]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

To confirm the hypothesis that the observed excitatory action of PV+ interneurons during seizures might be due chloride accumulation, Magloire et al used a viral strategy to enhance the expression of the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC2 in cortical pyramidal cells. They demonstrated that this was effective in improving the Cl − extrusion capacity of the neurons. In mice where KCC2 was overexpressed, the optogenetic activation of PV+ interneurons a few seconds after seizure onset no longer prolonged the seizures. However, it should be noted that seizures were not reduced in duration either. Therefore, although the authors provide compelling evidence that a breakdown in the chloride gradient underlies the seizure-associated excitatory shift in the action of PV+ interneurons, their strategy to enhance Cl− extrusion was not sufficient to rescue the inhibitory action of these interneurons. This failure may be due to the inability of overexpressed KCC2 to traffic to the cell membrane or a failure of PV cells to maintain their function during prolonged seizures. Future work could use emerging technologies to directly measure the spatial and temporal dynamics of chloride accumulation during seizures in vivo. The development of novel strategies to extrude chloride from neurons may also serve to preserve the inhibitory capacity of interneurons in the face of progressive ictal activity.

From a clinical perspective, the results generated by Magloire and colleagues have direct relevance for the treatment of patients in status epilepticus (SE), which represents a seizure which does not stop of its own accord. First-line therapy for SE currently constitutes the benzodiazepine class of drugs, which enhance GABA A R signaling. This work suggests that at least at the seizure focus, GABA A R signaling via PV+ interneurons may in fact exacerbate aberrant excitation. Benzodiazepine resistance is known to occur in SE. This study suggests that seizure-induced accumulation of intracellular Cl − may be a mechanism underlying this challenging clinical quandary. Therefore, the design of future strategies for arresting seizures would benefit from the level of mechanistic understanding provided by Magloire et al and focus on improving chloride extrusion, enhancing alternative inhibitory systems in the brain, or the more timely delivery of benzodiazepines and similar GABA-enhancing pharmacological therapies.

The anticonvulsant midazolam has been shown to be effective against both convulsant and cholinergic, soman, cyclosarin, tabun, VX, and organophosphorus pesticides) agents by enhancing the inhibitory effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid at GABA receptors and limiting excess central nervous system excitation and seizures. Mechanism of action Midazolam, like other benzodiazepines, is presumed to interact with the gamma-aminobutyric acid -benzodiazepine receptor complex, which is widespread in the brain of humans as well as other species. The pharmacodynamic consequences of benzodiazepine agonist actions include antianxiety effects, sedation, and reduction of seizure activity. Midazolam binds to the GABA receptor but does not displace GABA; rather, it enhances the affinity of GABA for its receptor site on the same receptor complex.

The pharmacodynamic consequences of benzodiazepine agonist actions include antianxiety effects, sedation, and reduction of seizure activity. The intensity of action is directly related to the degree of benzodiazepine receptor occupancy. Compared with other benzodiazepines used in emergency for iterative epileptic seizures, midazolam offers two advantages. First, its action is rapid and effective by the intramuscular route. Jawad et al3 have compared intramuscular midazolam with intramuscular and intravenous diazepam on the ability to reduce interictal spikes. The mean time needed for controlling the convulsive episodes after administration of the drugs was significantly less with intravenous diazepam. The mean time for initiation of treatment was significantly less with buccal midazolam. The mean time for controlling the convulsive episodes after noticing these first were significantly less with buccal midazolam than with intravenous diazepam that is likely to be due to longer time needed for initiating treatment with intravenous diazepam in preparing the injection and establishing an IV line. RESULTS: Plasma midazolam, propofol, and fentanyl pharmacokinetics were consistent with reports of others.

### Enhanced phasic GABA inhibition during the repair phase of stroke: a novel therapeutic target [^115ugtwZ]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our study provides the first account of increased phasic GABA activity in the early weeks following stroke injury and demonstrates that enhancing phasic GABA signalling in the repair phase with an FDA-approved drug promotes post-stroke functional recovery. Taken together our data offer new insights into mechanisms of brain repair and identify a novel therapeutic strategy and pharmacological target for stroke. Furthermore, our observations emphasize the necessity to distinguish the role of phasic and tonic GABA inhibition in stroke recovery as well as in normal brain functions.

### Allopregnanolone: the missing link to explain the effects of stress on tic exacerbation? [^113ZEMdt]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

This metabolic pathway is expressed in several brain areas implicated in emotional regulation, including the cortex and limbic regions, underscoring the role of this neurosteroid in affective modulation. In addition to this mechanism, the same two enzymes catalyse the synthesis of other neurosteroids, such as tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (3α,21‐dihydroxy‐5α‐pregnan‐20‐one; THDOC) and 3α‐androstanediol (5α‐androstane‐3α,17β‐diol).

The best‐characterised mechanism of action of AP (as well as THDOC and 3α‐androstanediol) is the activation of GABA A receptor, a chloride ion channel consisting of five subunits (out of 19 different subtypes: six α, three β, three γ and three ρ subunits, and one each of ϵ, δ, θ and π subunits). AP binds to two highly conserved sites within GABA A receptors, localised within the transmembrane domains of α and β subunits, in a distinct position from the benzodiazepine site. The strength and duration of the action of AP is also influenced by the subunit composition of GABA A receptors. For example, AP enhances either the tonic or phasic inhibition mediated by these receptors, depending on the presence of δ or γ2 subunits, respectively. In addition to GABA A receptor subunit composition, the effects of AP vary depending on its concentrations. In the nanomolar range, AP acts as a positive allosteric modulator by prolonging spontaneous chloride currents. However, at concentrations higher than 10 μ(such as those that occur in the brain at the end of the pregnancy), AP acts as a GABA A receptor agonist, and its effect is sufficient to suppress excitatory neurotransmission.

### The emerging differential roles of GABAergic and antiglutamatergic agents in bipolar disorders [^116hHPT1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Treatment options to relieve the diverse symptoms encountered in patients with bipolar disorders include not only mood stabilizers, but also anxiolytics, new anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. These agents have widely varying mechanisms of action, which could contribute to the heterogeneity of clinical effects seen in practice. Several of these medications, especially those with anticonvulsant effects, enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory neurotransmission and/or attenuate glutamate excitatory neurotransmission. We review the efficacy and tolerability of these diverse treatment options in bipolar disorders and explore possible relationships between clinical effects and GABAergic and antiglutamatergic mechanisms of action.

### Disinhibition of somatostatin-positive GABAergic interneurons results in an anxiolytic and antidepressant-like brain state [^1142bNCg]. Molecular Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with reduced concentrations of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) that are normalized by antidepressant therapies. Moreover, depressive-like phenotypes of GABA A receptor mutant mice can be reversed by treatment with conventional antidepressants drugs, as well as by subanesthetic doses of ketamine. Thus GABAergic deficits may causally contribute to depressive disorders, while antidepressant therapies may enhance GABAergic synaptic transmission. Here we tested the hypothesis that sustained enhancement of GABAergic transmission alone is sufficient to elicit antidepressant-like behavior, using disinhibition of GABAergic interneurons. We focused on somatostatin-positive (SST +) GABAergic interneurons because of evidence that their function is compromised in MDD. To disinhibit SST + interneurons, we inactivated the γ2 subunit gene of GABA A receptors selectively in these neurons (SSTCre:γ2 f/f mice). Loss of inhibitory synaptic input resulted in increased excitability of SST + interneurons. In turn, pyramidal cell targets of SST + neurons showed an increased frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents. The behavior of SSTCre:γ2 f/f mice mimicked the effects of anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs in a number of behavioral tests, without affecting performance in a spatial learning- and memory-dependent task. Finally, brain extracts of SSTCre:γ2 f/f mice showed decreased phosphorylation of the eukaryotic elongation factor eEF2, reminiscent of the effects of ketamine. Importantly, these effects occurred without altered activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway nor did they involve altered expression of SST. However, they were associated with reduced Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent auto-phosphorylation of eEF2 kinase, which controls the activity of eEF2 as its single target. Thus enhancing GABAergic inhibitory synaptic inputs from SST + interneurons to pyramidal cells and corresponding chronic reductions in the synaptic excitation:inhibition ratio represents a novel strategy for antidepressant therapies that reproduces behavioral and biochemical end points of rapidly acting antidepressants.

GABAergic transmission enhancers

GABA is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cerebral cortex which acts by binding to two types of receptors: GABA A, an ionotropic receptor (GABA A R), and GABA B (GABA B R), a metabotropic receptor.

Benzodiazepines (e.g. clobazam, clonazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam) are GABA-positive allosteric modulators able to enhance the effect of synaptically released GABA, binding a specific well-characterised site at the α+-γ2– subunit interface. Barbiturates (PHB) act in a very similar way and, at high doses, have also a partial agonist effect, in the absence of GABA itself. The binding site of barbiturates within the GABA A R remains controversial.

Stiripentol (STP) also operates as a GABA A R modulator, with a high affinity for α3- and δ-subunits. Other ASMs, such as FBM and TPM, present a positive modulating action on GABA A R within their range of action.

GABA transporters (GATs) and the GABA catabolic enzyme GABA -transaminase (GABA-T) represent major inactivating systems of GABAergic transmission, removing GABA through uptake into both glia and presynaptic nerve terminals and then catabolising respectively.

To enhance GABA neurotransmission, vigabatrin and tiagabine were designed. They are selective irreversible inhibitors of respectively GABA-T and GAT-1. The former results in an overall increase in GABA levels whereas the latter prolongs the synaptic presence of GABA transiently.

An increase in GABA levels is also suggested for TPM and GBP, although the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Lastly, it is interesting to report how other non-receptor-mediated signalling mechanisms have also been suggested for ASMs, as in the case of the VPA, which is attributed to a role in increasing GABA synthesis and reducing its degradation.

Also worthy of mention is ganaxolone, recently approved by FDA for the treatment of seizures associated with Cyclin-dependent Kinase-like 5 Deficiency Disorder.

This synthetic neuroactive steroid functions as a positive allosteric modulator for both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA A receptors, binding to a site separate from benzodiazepines or barbiturates. It has been proposed it might be able to enhance GABAergic signalling during instances when synaptic GABA A receptors are internalized and benzodiazepines exhibit reduced effectiveness, as seen in refractory status epilepticus.

### Revisiting benzodiazepines (GABA enhancers): a transdiagnostic and precision medicine approach [^112hkCyE]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Since the mid 1980's, there has been an increased focus on the side effects of benzodiazepines (GABA enhancers), and as a result there has been a decrease in their use. We have systematically reviewed recent studies of GABA enhancers in psychiatry, and highlight evidence of their utility which may impact their negative conceptualization in clinical practice. We propose a new perspective on the appropriate use of these medications and describeclinical reasoning underpinning the use of benzodiazepine (GABA enhancers) based on their effect on specific receptors. A translational approach, involving a more comprehensive characterization of GABA receptors and their neuroscience-based mechanisms allows for a more precise use of this medication class. By adopting a precision person-centered approach, instead of a categorical approach, supports the prescribing of GABA enhancers when a cross-cutting transdiagnostic assessment shows anxiety symptoms associated with clinical impairment.

### Sex-specific GABAergic microcircuits that switch vulnerability into resilience to stress and reverse the effects of chronic stress exposure [^111spz1a]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

When designing our chemogenetic stimulation protocol, we reasoned that drastically increasing GABAergic dendritic inhibition would interfere with activity-dependent plasticity at dendrites needed to increase the activity of target cells, as evidenced by the lack of antidepressant efficacy of benzodiazepines. Accordingly, we chose a low concentration of CNO (~0.2 mg/kg/h) at, if not below, the threshold required for measurable hM3Dq-induced changes in neural activity in vitro. Future experiments will need to establish the optimal level of SST neuron activation for the most effective reversal of chronic stress effects.

Our data provide a mechanistic rationale for the lack of antidepressant efficacy of benzodiazepines, which predominantly potentiate GABA A receptors underlying phasic inhibition. Benzodiazepines enhance inhibition indiscriminately at dendrites, soma, and AIS of virtually all neurons along the neuraxis, which underlies their rapid action as anxiolytics, sedatives, and myorelaxants. However, studies in mice indicate that chronically increased inhibition of PNs at the soma and AIS by PV INs has detrimental effects. On the contrary, we show that selective chronic inhibition at dendrites of PNs by SST-INs, most likely through α5-GABA A receptors (perhaps with a contribution of α2-GABA A receptors), holds promise as a target for antidepressants. Accordingly, we propose that SST INs are acutely neuro-protective during stress exposure and correspondingly high network load by limiting NMDA receptor-mediated Ca 2+ influx into dendrites via activation of postsynaptic GABA A receptors. This mechanism of GABAergic inhibition would be potentiated by benzodiazepines, which are known to be acutely neuroprotective. Subsequently, SST IN activation in between and after stressful periods facilitates the recovery of PNs through potentiation of tonic inhibition, which paradoxically increases the excitability of PNs. As a possible mechanism, tonic inhibition of dendrites through α5-GABA A receptors has been shown to lead to de-inactivation of t-type voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels, which then increases dendritic excitability and pyramidal cell output. Benzodiazepine-mediated potentiation of postsynaptic GABA A receptors and corresponding strong hyperpolarization at dendrites and the soma and AIS is likely to override SST IN-mediated activation of PNs at dendrites, which explains the absence of antidepressant properties.

### Is there more to GABA than synaptic inhibition? [^117Q9RjW]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2002). Medium credibility.

In the mature brain, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) functions primarily as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. But it can also act as a trophic factor during nervous system development to influence events such as proliferation, migration, differentiation, synapse maturation and cell death. GABA mediates these processes by the activation of traditional ionotropic and metabotropic receptors, and probably by both synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms. However, the functional properties of GABA receptor signalling in the immature brain are significantly different from, and in some ways opposite to, those found in the adult brain. The unique features of the early-appearing GABA signalling systems might help to explain how GABA acts as a developmental signal.

### Regulating the efficacy of inhibition through trafficking of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors [^113Whvui]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Trafficking of anesthetic-sensitive receptors within the plasma membrane, or from one cellular component to another, occurs continuously. Changes in receptor trafficking have implications in altering anesthetic sensitivity. γ-Aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) are anion-permeable ion channels and are the major class of receptor in the adult mammalian central nervous system that mediates inhibition. GABAergic signaling allows for precise synchronized firing of action potentials within brain circuits that is critical for cognition, behavior, and consciousness. This precision depends upon tightly controlled trafficking of GABAARs into the membrane. General anesthetics bind to and allosterically enhance GABAARs by prolonging the open state of the receptor and thereby altering neuronal and brain circuit activity. Subunit composition and GABAAR localization strongly influence anesthetic end points; therefore, changes in GABAAR trafficking could have significant consequences to anesthetic sensitivity. GABAARs are not static membrane structures but are in a constant state of flux between extrasynaptic and synaptic locations and are continually endocytosed and recycled from and to the membrane. Neuronal activity, posttranslational modifications, and some naturally occurring and synthetic compounds can influence the expression and trafficking of GABAARs. In this article, we review GABAARs, their trafficking, and how phosphorylation of GABAAR subunits can influence the surface expression and function of the receptor. Ultimately, alterations of GABAAR trafficking could modify anesthetic end points, both unintentionally through pathologic processes but potentially as a therapeutic target to adjust anesthetic-sensitive GABAARs.
