## Question

gastritis with pit microabscess

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "gastritis with pit microabscess", including definition, etiologies, diagnostic approach, management, and prognostic implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precisely defining pit microabscesses and distinguishing them from other inflammatory patterns. Then, I should verify the predominant etiologies and the biological rationale linking H. pylori to the gastric pit region. Next, I will review histopathologic grading/staging systems and why "activity" matters. After that, I need to check endoscopic and biopsy-based diagnostic workflows, including H. pylori testing strategies. I will then examine evidence-based treatment regimens and confirmatory testing, followed by alternative causes and special scenarios when H. pylori is absent. Finally, I should consider risk stratification, surveillance, and prognosis, making sure I validate each step against contemporary guidelines and consensus statements [^114kLp2q] [^112Jv52y] [^114cUymh].

> Let me first define the entity and its pathological basis to anchor the discussion: pit microabscesses are focal collections of neutrophils within the gastric pit epithelium and are best interpreted as histologic "activity" superimposed on chronic gastritis, distinct from lymphocytic gastritis (intraepithelial lymphocytosis threshold ≥ 25/100 epithelial cells) and from deeper suppurative processes such as phlegmonous gastritis or intramural gastric abscess, which involve the wall beyond the mucosa and carry very different clinical implications [^117XgAwq] [^1154bWGM] [^117RvSTp] [^114mifEr]. Hold on, I should verify the biological plausibility of pit-centric inflammation: H. pylori shows a clear tropism for differentiated pit cells, driven by TlpB-dependent chemotaxis toward urea, explaining why the inflammatory activity often localizes to the pit epithelium where organisms preferentially attach [^111CWwha] [^116tUQDo] [^11443k7F].

> Next, I will examine etiology and pathogenesis, but wait, let me verify the dominant cause before listing alternatives: worldwide, H. pylori is the leading cause of chronic active gastritis and is linked causally to peptic ulcer disease, gastric intestinal metaplasia, and gastric cancer, which makes eradication a central management principle whenever infection is present [^112Jv52y] [^114cUymh]. Mechanistically, H. pylori's preference for the pit region is explained by highly sensitive urea chemotaxis via TlpB, leading to attachment to large, differentiated pit cells, CagA translocation, and epithelial injury that histologically manifests as neutrophilic activity within pits, i.e., microabscesses [^111CWwha] [^116tUQDo] [^11443k7F]. I should also consider key differentials when H. pylori is absent or insufficient to explain the histology: autoimmune gastritis with corpus-predominant atrophy, drug-induced injury including ARB- and NSAID-associated active chronic gastritis, and less common inflammatory patterns such as immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated gastritis or bona fide H. pylori–negative gastritis, all of which can produce neutrophilic epitheliotropism in varying distributions [^1114MVkz] [^116Gdhjh] [^1124xoJm] [^1137Gcqe] [^115vYwnj].

> I need to ensure the histopathologic classification is used correctly: in the Sydney/Updated Sydney framework, "activity" reflects neutrophilic infiltration and is graded alongside chronicity, while OLGA/OLGIM staging incorporates atrophy and intestinal metaplasia to stratify cancer risk, so documenting pit microabscesses signals active injury that often correlates with bacterial density in H. pylori gastritis and may represent an early step along the Correa cascade if persistent [^115jcATq] [^111Fjpiw] [^112Jv52y]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: the presence of activity alone does not equate to high-stage atrophy; I should verify atrophy and metaplasia separately and stage appropriately to guide surveillance decisions [^115pGqN3] [^112YLL44].

> For the diagnostic approach, I will now examine endoscopic and biopsy strategy and then the testing for H. pylori: conventional white-light endoscopy can miss atrophy and metaplasia, whereas image-enhanced techniques such as NBI or BLI improve recognition of pit/microsurface alterations and permit targeted biopsies, but histology with systematic sampling remains essential for grading "activity", assessing H. pylori, and staging atrophy/metaplasia [^116qYmn8] [^111ky3op]. Let me first confirm the biopsy protocol and on-table testing: obtain antrum and body biopsies per mapping protocols, and consider biopsy-based histology and rapid urease testing, recognizing that PPIs, antibiotics, and bismuth can reduce test sensitivity and that nonserologic tests such as urea breath test or stool antigen are preferred for documenting active infection and for post-treatment test-of-cure [^114PKkEA] [^111BpyUH]. I should double-check that pit microabscesses on histology prompt a careful search for organisms with Giemsa or immunostain and a concurrent evaluation for atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and topographic patterns that refine the etiologic differential and risk profile [^115jcATq] [^115pGqN3].

> Regarding management, I need to treat the underlying cause; for H. pylori-positive cases, eradication is mandatory and should be followed by nonserologic confirmation of cure, ideally at least 4 weeks after antibiotics and 2 weeks off PPIs, with regimen selection tailored to local resistance patterns and prior antibiotic exposures [^114cUymh] [^111BpyUH]. Wait, let me verify first-line options in contemporary guidance: 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy and 14-day concomitant therapy are recommended first-line choices in many regions, while clarithromycin triple therapy is generally avoided unless susceptibility is known, and refractory infection should prompt susceptibility-guided or empiric salvage strategies per expert guidance [^111BpyUH] [^112hCqoz] [^111TLM4t]. I should also confirm the rationale relevant to pit microabscesses: eradication reduces active neutrophilic inflammation and bacterial density and can halt progression to atrophy/metaplasia, which is particularly relevant when activity localizes to pits where organisms preferentially reside [^1124xoJm] [^112Jv52y] [^111CWwha].

> For H. pylori-negative cases, hold on, I should verify alternative mechanisms and manage accordingly: evaluate for autoimmune gastritis with appropriate serology, corpus-predominant histologic features, and biochemical sequelae, and if present, still test for and eradicate H. pylori if detected because the two can coexist; discontinue offending drugs such as ARBs or NSAIDs when suspected based on histologic distribution and clinical correlation; and recognize immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated gastritis or other rare inflammatory entities in the right oncologic or clinical context [^1114MVkz] [^114eM2Dw] [^116Gdhjh] [^1124xoJm] [^1137Gcqe]. I need to ensure supportive care for mucosal healing and symptom control while the underlying cause is addressed, with reassessment if neutrophilic activity persists after appropriate etiologic therapy [^111BpyUH].

> Next, I should review risk stratification and surveillance, because this informs follow-up once activity resolves: stage atrophy/metaplasia using OLGA/OLGIM to identify patients at increased gastric cancer risk, eradicate H. pylori in all with premalignant changes, and consider surveillance endoscopy at intervals aligned with guideline-based risk tiers, typically every 3 years for advanced atrophy or extensive intestinal metaplasia in Western practice, tailored to patient-level risk and shared decision-making [^111Fjpiw] [^1158oay3] [^112YLL44] [^115pGqN3]. But wait, what if autoimmune gastritis is present? I should confirm B12 status, monitor for ECL-cell neuroendocrine changes, and still pursue H. pylori eradication if found, given its additive oncogenic field effects and the potential to diminish ongoing injury [^1114MVkz] [^115pGqN3] [^114cUymh].

> I will now examine clinical significance and prognosis to close the loop: pit microabscesses signify ongoing epithelial injury and active gastritis, most commonly due to H. pylori localized to the pit region, and this is a reversible stage in gastric carcinogenesis in which eradication can normalize histologic activity and reduce downstream risk if instituted before advanced atrophy develops [^111CWwha] [^117KnGjN] [^114cUymh]. Hmm, wait a minute, symptom correlation can be variable; while many are asymptomatic, a subset with active H. pylori gastritis experience dyspepsia, and symptom improvement post-eradication has been documented, reinforcing the clinical value of addressing pit-centered activity when present [^117KnGjN] [^111BpyUH].

> Bottom line, I should verify that the workflow remains disciplined: when histology shows pit microabscesses, actively look for H. pylori and treat to confirmed cure; if negative or if activity persists, reassess for autoimmune gastritis, drug injury, ICI-related inflammation, or other less common causes; and always document atrophy and intestinal metaplasia to stage cancer risk and determine surveillance, recognizing that this pit-focused "activity" is a key, potentially reversible inflection point in the gastric oncogenic pathway [^115jcATq] [^114cUymh] [^111Fjpiw] [^115pGqN3] [^111CWwha].

Gastritis with pit microabscesses is most often due to **H. pylori infection** [^112Jv52y] and is defined histologically by **neutrophil clusters in gastric pits**. Diagnosis relies on **gastric biopsies** with H&E and special stains, plus **H. pylori testing** [^114PKkEA]; endoscopy may show erythema, erosions, or ulcers [^116qYmn8]. Management centers on **H. pylori eradication** with bismuth or concomitant quadruple therapy, PPIs, and stopping NSAIDs [^111BpyUH] [^114cUymh]; confirm eradication and monitor for complications such as ulcers, bleeding, or cancer [^111Fjpiw].

---

## Histopathological features

- **Neutrophil clusters**: Neutrophils within gastric pits or foveolae, forming microabscesses.
- **Chronic inflammation**: Lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria [^115jcATq].
- **H. pylori organisms**: Often seen on special stains (Giemsa, Warthin-Starry, immunohistochemistry) [^114PKkEA].
- **Epithelial damage**: Erosion or ulceration may be present.

---

## Etiological factors

- **Helicobacter pylori infection**: The primary cause [^112Jv52y], with tropism for differentiated pit cells via urea chemotaxis and TlpB [^113shXuP].
- **NSAID use**: Can cause acute erosive gastritis with neutrophilic infiltration [^117TF7Fo].
- **Autoimmune gastritis**: May coexist with H. pylori gastritis, complicating diagnosis [^114NN9dJ] [^115vZGKK].
- **Other infections**: Rarely, other bacteria or fungi may cause similar inflammation [^117RvSTp].

---

## Clinical presentation

Clinical presentation typically features **epigastric pain** as the most common symptom, with nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia. Severe cases may present with **gastrointestinal bleeding**, manifesting as hematemesis or melena.

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis relies on **endoscopy** to identify erythema, erosions, or ulcers [^116qYmn8], and **biopsy** is essential for definitive confirmation [^114PKkEA]. Histopathology with H&E and special stains detects H. pylori and neutrophilic activity. Non-invasive tests such as the **urea breath test**, stool antigen, or serology can detect H. pylori [^116ov7Qz].

---

## Management strategies

- **H. pylori eradication**: Bismuth quadruple or concomitant therapy for 10–14 days [^111BpyUH] [^112hCqoz].
- **Proton pump inhibitors**: Reduce acid and promote healing [^116ov7Qz].
- **NSAID cessation**: Stop or switch to alternatives.
- **Follow-up**: Confirm eradication and monitor for complications [^114VgkT2].

---

## Potential complications

Complications include **peptic ulcer disease** and **gastrointestinal bleeding**. Chronic inflammation and atrophy increase the risk of **gastric cancer**; pernicious anemia can occur in the setting of autoimmune gastritis [^1158oay3] [^115vZGKK].

---

## Prognosis

Favorable with treatment, as **eradication** and **acid suppression** usually resolve inflammation [^116TDxwN]; **poor without treatment** carries a risk of ulcers, bleeding, and cancer [^114cUymh].

---

Gastritis with pit microabscesses is a histologic pattern of active gastritis, most often from H. pylori [^112Jv52y], and **requires biopsy-based diagnosis and targeted therapy** [^114PKkEA] [^116ov7Qz] to prevent complications.

Regarding medical management for Helicobacter pylori infection, particularly in relation to first-line regimens, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend administering bismuth quadruple therapy (PPI, bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole or tinidazole) or concomitant therapy. The non-bismuth quadruple therapy consists of PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole or tinidazole and is advised as first-line therapy in patients with H. pylori infection.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^112Jv52y]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Worldwide, the most common cause of chronic gastritis is infection with H. pylori. H. pylori causes progressive damage to the gastric mucosa and is now accepted as playing a causative role in a number of important diseases, including duodenal ulcer disease, gastric ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Indeed, H. pylori-induced gastritis is considered the most important risk factor for peptic ulcer and its complications, as well as for gastric cancer.

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), issued in 1989 by the International Conference for the Tenth Revision of the ICD, was endorsed by WHO at the 43rd general assembly in 1990 and has been used for disease statistics since 1994 among member countries of WHO. In the ICD-10, all digestive diseases are classified under the K code with different two-digit numbers. However, H. pylori was not integrated into the gastritis classification in the gastritis section (K29) of ICD-10, even though H. pylori gastritis is the predominant type of gastritis and is clinically the most relevant because of its predisposing role in severe gastroduodenal complications. Moreover, the ICD-10 classification of gastritis is not organized according to etiology but is merely a mixture of phenotype and etiology and also includes duodenitis. Therefore, a revision of the gastritis and duodenitis classification based on all possible etiologies was proposed after the working group meeting for the ICD-11 revision.

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^113shXuP]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

The human gastric epithelium forms highly organized gland structures with different subtypes of cells. The carcinogenic bacterium Helicobacter pylori can attach to gastric cells and subsequently translocate its virulence factor CagA, but the possible host cell tropism of H. pylori is currently unknown. Here, we report that H. pylori preferentially attaches to differentiated cells in the pit region of gastric units. Single-cell RNA-seq shows that organoid-derived monolayers recapitulate the pit region, while organoids capture the gland region of the gastric units. Using these models, we show that H. pylori preferentially attaches to highly differentiated pit cells, marked by high levels of GKN1, GKN2, and PSCA. Directed differentiation of host cells enables enrichment of the target cell population and confirms H. pylori preferential attachment and CagA translocation into these cells. Attachment is independent of MUC5AC or PSCA expression and instead relies on bacterial TlpB-dependent chemotaxis towards host cell-released urea, which scales with host cell size.

### Gastric wall abscess presenting as thoracic pain: Rare presentation of an old disease [^1154bWGM]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute phlegmonous gastritis, a suppurative infection of the gastric wall, has a high mortality rate. This disease remains a mystery to most clinicians. The rarity of this disease and its nonspecific presentation make early diagnosis difficult, especially in the emergency department. We describe a case of acute phlegmonous gastritis presenting as gastric wall abscess in a 55-year-old woman who visited the emergency department, illustrating the severity of this disease, the difficulty in its diagnosis, and its unusual presentation.

### Helicobacter pylori infection [^114HWZu4]. Deutsches Arzteblatt International (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Helicobacter pylori infection:

- **Definition**: H. pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes chronic infection and inflammation of the stomach and duodenum.

- **Pathophysiology**: H. pylori infection is transmitted via the fecal-oral and oral-oral routes; horizontal transmission and environmental transmission through contaminated water also occur.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of H. pylori infection in North America is decreasing over time but remains substantial at 30–40%. The infection is typically acquired in childhood and is more prevalent among non-White races and ethnicities, those living in crowded or poor sanitary conditions, and early-generation immigrants from countries where H. pylori is endemic. H. pylori resistance rates to antibiotics are increasing in most parts of the world.

- **Disease course**: H. pylori infection is associated with an increased risk of various gastrointestinal diseases, including functional dyspepsia, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric intestinal metaplasia, and gastric cancer.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Although successful eradication of H. pylori infection prevents the development and progression of H. pylori-associated diseases, the efficacy of treatment regimens has decreased due to increased antibiotic resistance. Globally, the annual recurrence, reinfection, and recrudescence rates of H. pylori are 4.3%, 3.1%, and 2.2%, respectively.

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^111CWwha]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Preference for pit cells depends on urea chemotaxis and cell size. We analyzed the possible role of secreted factors to test whether gland cells would secrete bactericidal proteins to repel or kill bacteria. Bacteria were incubated with supernatants from the differentiated cells, and the supernatants did not have an effect, although infection led to the upregulation of some known antimicrobials.

To test whether pit cells would attract bacteria, we employed a classical chemotaxis assay. All cell-conditioned media attracted bacteria, but conditioned medium from pit cells attracted about twice as many bacteria as conditioned medium from gland cells. Urea is a major chemoattractant for H. pylori. To test whether the chemotaxis observed was due to urea, we added 500 mM of urea, which has been shown to abrogate H. pylori chemotactic response to urea. Indeed, the high urea abrogated the response to the pit cell-conditioned media. Deletion of TlpB, the H. pylori gene for the chemoreceptor that recognizes urea, abrogates the preference for the pit cells. TlpB mutant bacteria also did not prefer pit cells during infections.

### Management of infection: the Maastricht VI/Florence consensus report [^114cUymh]. Gut (2022). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection is formally recognized as an infectious disease, an entity that is now included in the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision. This, in principle, leads to the recommendation that all infected patients should receive treatment. In the context of the wide clinical spectrum associated with Helicobacter pylori gastritis, specific issues persist and require regular updates for optimized management. The identification of distinct clinical scenarios, proper testing, and adoption of effective strategies for the prevention of gastric cancer and other complications are addressed.

H. pylori treatment is challenged by the continuously rising antibiotic resistance and demands for susceptibility testing with consideration of novel molecular technologies and careful selection of first line and rescue therapies. The role of H. pylori and antibiotic therapies and their impact on the gut microbiota are also considered. Progress made in the management of H. pylori infection is covered in the present sixth edition of the Maastricht/Florence 2021 Consensus Report. Key aspects related to the clinical role of H. pylori infection were re-evaluated and updated.

Forty-one experts from 29 countries, representing a global community, examined the new data related to H. pylori infection in five working groups:

- **Indications/associations**
- **Diagnosis**
- **Treatment**
- **Prevention/gastric cancer**
- **H. pylori and the gut microbiota**:

The results of the individual working groups were presented for a final consensus voting that included all participants.

### Lymphocytic gastritis and celiac disease in Indian children: Evidence of a positive relation [^117XgAwq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Lymphocytic gastritis (LG) is characterized by the presence of ≥ 25 lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells in the gastric surface and pit epithelium. An association of LG with Helicobacter pylori infection or celiac disease (CD) has been suggested. The aim of this study was to verify the relationship of LG with CD, with and without H. pylori infection, in children.

A total of 164 children with CD, diagnosed between June 2003 and October 2005, in whom gastric and duodenal biopsies were performed simultaneously, were enrolled prospectively. The control group consisted of 164 children without CD, matched for sex and age, who were undergoing upper digestive endoscopy. H. pylori was searched for in gastric biopsy specimens sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and a modified Giemsa stain was performed for confirmation. The Student t-test was used to compare quantitative measurements between groups.

LG was found in 69 (42.1%) patients with CD. Positive cases had a mean of 43.9 ± 1.5 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 surface epithelial cells, compared with a mean of 13.4 ± 0.4 in negative cases and 7.8 ± 0.5 in non-CD control children (P < 0.0001). Patients not showing LG did, however, show significantly increased gastric intraepithelial lymphocytes compared with the control children. Nine of 164 CD patients, and 4 of 69 patients with LG, had positive results for H. pylori.

This study supports a pathogenetic relation between CD and LG. CD without LG also showed increased gastric intraepithelial lymphocytes.

### Type I Helicobacter pylori lipopolysaccharide stimulates toll-like receptor 4 and activates mitogen oxidase 1 in gastric pit cells [^116opZNX]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Guinea pig gastric pit cells express an isozyme of gp91-phox, mitogen oxidase 1 (Mox1), and essential components for the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (p67-phox, p47-phox, p40-phox, and p22-phox). Helicobacter pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Escherichia coli LPS have been shown to function as potent activators for the Mox1 oxidase. These cells spontaneously secreted about 10 nmol of superoxide anion (O(2)(-))/mg of protein/h under LPS-free conditions. They expressed the mRNA and protein of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) but not those of TLR2.

LPS from type I H. pylori at 2.1 endotoxin units/ml or higher stimulated TLR4-mediated phosphorylations of transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 and its binding protein 1 induced TLR4 and p67-phox and up-regulated O(2)(-) production 10-fold. In contrast, none of these events occurred with H. pylori LPS from complete or partial deletion mutants of the cag pathogenicity island. Lipid A was confirmed to be a bioactive component for the priming effects, while removal of bisphosphates from lipid A completely eliminated the effects. This suggests the importance of the phosphorylation pattern besides the acylation pattern for the bioactivity.

H. pylori LPS is generally accepted as having low toxicity; however, our results suggest that type I H. pylori lipid A may be a potent stimulator for innate immune responses of gastric mucosa by stimulating the TLR4 cascade and Mox1 oxidase in pit cells.

### Staging and grading of chronic gastritis [^115jcATq]. Human Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic gastritis is an inflammatory condition of the gastric mucosa that may include structural alterations of the glandular compartment. The semiquantitative scoring systems advocated in the Sydney Systems and the subsequent Atrophy Club Guidelines remain essential for recognizing the spectrum of lesions detectable in gastric inflammatory disease. However, most practicing pathologists find these systems too cumbersome to use in their routine diagnostic activities. In this article, we propose a reporting system for chronic gastritis in staging and grading.

- **Staging**: Conveys information on the topography and extension of the gastric atrophic changes.
- **Grading**: Represents the semiquantitative assessment of the combined severity of both mononuclear and granulocytic inflammation.

This system could offer gastroenterologists a more immediate perception of the overall condition of the gastric mucosa while also providing useful information about gastric cancer risk.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^117KnGjN]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

H. pylori gastritis is an infectious disease and leads to chronic active gastritis of varying severity in virtually all infected subjects. There is significant variability in the interindividual expressions of gastric mucosal structural damage, and accordingly, the associated physiological perturbations also vary. H. pylori gastritis may remain clinically unapparent or evolve into severe complications. The rate of progression is unpredictable. The most severe clinical expression is gastric cancer, which is often incurable by the time of diagnosis.

Cure of H. pylori infection leads to healing of the inflamed gastric mucosa, which may return to normal. H. pylori eradication may improve or resolve dyspeptic symptoms and usually cures peptic ulcer disease (PUD). H. pylori gastritis is a disease that can be cured, thereby preventing severe complications. If H. pylori gastritis has progressed to more severe forms, including atrophic gastritis with or without intestinal metaplasia, or severe corpus predominant gastritis, the risk of gastric cancer is increased. Eradication of the infection at this stage needs to be integrated with a follow-up strategy.

- **Dyspepsia associated with H. pylori infection**: H. pylori gastritis is the cause of dyspepsia in a subset of patients. The grade of recommendation is strong, with a high level of evidence and a 100% consensus level.

### New classification of gastric pit patterns and vessel architecture using probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy [^115kmfAN]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The goal of this study is to propose a new probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) classification of gastric pit patterns and vessel architecture, and to assess the accuracy and interobserver agreement.

pCLE is a newly developed endoscopic device that allows the application of laser microscopy with any conventional endoscope and mosaic imaging.

- **Study**: A total of 291 pCLE videos from 32 patients were recruited in phase I to establish the new pCLE image classification in the stomach. Eligible patients were then prospectively investigated by pCLE using the newly established classification system. All patients were examined first with high-definition endoscopy followed by pCLE at seven standardized locations and endoscopic-suspected lesions. Targeted biopsies were performed with precise matching of pCLE recordings.

- **Results**: The sensitivity and specificity of type 2b pit pattern for predicting atrophic gastritis were 88.51% and 99.19%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of type 2c pit pattern for predicting intestinal metaplasia were 92.34% and 99.34%, respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity of type 3 pit pattern or vessel architecture for predicting neoplasia were 89.89% and 99.44%, respectively. The interobserver agreement was "substantial" (kappa = 0.70) for the differentiation of neoplasia versus non-neoplasia.

The conclusion is that the new pCLE classification system in the stomach correlates well with specific pathologic conditions and is reproducible by multiple investigators. Multicenter researches are warranted to further validate its value in clinical practice.

### Gastritis and gastric atrophy [^112e2vVL]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The majority of problems in interpreting gastritis remain Helicobacter-related, but their nature has changed. This review covers gastritis historically through cancer risk staging systems.

- **Recent findings**: Key points to remember are: Helicobacter is associated with several forms of gastritis; the review focuses on the spectrum of the disease, from 'Helicobacter pylori infection' that starts with antral predominant gastritis and may progress to oxyntic predominant disease with atrophy. The role of Helicobacter pylori in autoimmune gastritis with pernicious anemia remains unresolved; notable gastritis staging systems for cancer risk include the Baylor and Operative Link on Gastritis Assessment, which are currently available.

- **Summary**: Most gastric carcinomas arise on a background of atrophic gastritis, with risk increasing with the extent of atrophy. An index of atrophy location and extent could help predict patients at greatest risk for carcinoma, allowing for cancer risk staging. Despite unresolved issues in the field of gastritis, a descriptive classification or staging system is likely to be more useful.

### Features that aid identification of autoimmune gastritis in a background of active Helicobacter pylori infection [^114NN9dJ]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori-associated and autoimmune gastritis may coexist in a subset of patients who require treatment for both disorders.

- **Objective**: To delineate findings that identify autoimmune gastritis in the background of H. pylori infection.

- **Design**: We examined cases of two groups: (1) patients with H. pylori-associated gastritis who had successful eradication therapy and subsequent biopsies diagnostic of autoimmune gastritis and (2) patients with H. pylori-associated gastritis wherein pathologists noted features of autoimmune gastritis during the original interpretation. Control patients underwent H. pylori eradication but lacked evidence of autoimmune gastritis or H. pylori infection after 10 years of follow-up.

- **Results**: Eight subjects had H. pylori-associated gastritis followed by H. pylori-negative sampling that showed autoimmune gastritis. A review of original samples showed full-thickness inflammation of oxyntic mucosa in all eight cases and oxyntic gland loss in seven out of eight cases. Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia, pyloric metaplasia, and intestinal metaplasia were present in four out of eight cases (80% of five tested cases), four out of eight, and three out of eight cases, respectively. Features of autoimmune gastritis were noted at the time of their original H. pylori diagnosis in 11 study subjects. Ten of the 11 samples displayed full-thickness inflammation of oxyntic mucosa and/or partial loss of oxyntic glands. Eight of 11 showed ECL cell hyperplasia in all tested cases. Six of 11 showed pyloric metaplasia, and four of 11 harbored intestinal metaplasia. Except for full-thickness oxyntic mucosa inflammation, these features were absent in control patients.

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^11555tQQ]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals that H. pylori binds to a subpopulation of pit cells. A structured experimental approach was employed: Gastric organoids were generated from healthy gastric tissue and used to obtain two-dimensional monolayers. These monolayers were infected with GFP-expressing H. pylori at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for six hours and then subjected to scRNA-seq analysis.

- **Flow cytometry analysis**: Representative flow cytometry dot plots of naïve and infected monolayers were presented, with cells gated based on GFP signal (indicating H. pylori) and propidium iodide (PI), followed by scRNA-seq analysis.

- **Data visualization**: Single-cell transcriptomes from the different gates were integrated and projected using a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) 2D projection, with color-coding indicating the sample origin.

- **Cell identity assignment**: Using known gastric marker genes for specific gastric cell types, cell identities were assigned. Known markers specific for pit cells (MUC5AC), neck cells (MUC6), and chief cells (PGC) were color-coded and projected on the t-SNE visualization.

- **Infection analysis**: The percentage of H. pylori-infected cells per cluster was identified. Two clusters consisted of pit cell progenitors (clusters 1 and 2), and one cluster comprised progenitor cells (cluster 3). The smallest cluster, cluster 4, containing 8% of the total cells, represented the highest differentiated pit cells and also had the highest percentage of infected cells (65%). In comparison, clusters 1 and 2, representing pit cell progenitors, had infection rates of 25% and 26%, respectively.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^114eM2Dw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory condition that involves the destruction of the gastric oxyntic mucosa through the autoimmune-mediated loss of parietal cells, with replacement by atrophic and metaplastic tissue. Histologically, AIG is characterized by atrophy of the oxyntic mucosa, that is, corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis, with or without replacement by metaplastic mucosa. Classically, antral mucosa architecture is preserved, but this might not be the case in more advanced stages or if there is concomitant infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).

Histologically, AIG falls under the umbrella of "atrophic gastritis", which comprises several conditions where the downstream histologic consequence of chronic environmental (e.g. H. pylori) or nonenvironmental triggers is gastric atrophy — that is, disappearance of the native gastric glands and thinning of the mucosa. There is abundant literature on chronic H. pylori gastritis leading to progression to multifocal atrophic gastritis (MAG) and, in a small minority, neoplastic transformation and progression to adenocarcinoma. However, the literature on the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and management of AIG is sparse in comparison. Moreover, the heterogeneity across the literature with respect to criteria used to diagnose AIG further contributes to our incomplete understanding of this condition, as well as practice pattern variability. For example, pernicious anemia (PA), which is a late-stage manifestation of AIG, is characterized by megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency.

### Re.ga.in.: the real-world gastritis initiative-updating the updates [^114kLp2q]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

At the end of the last century, a far-sighted 'working party' held in Sydney, Australia addressed the clinicopathological issues related to gastric inflammatory diseases. A few years later, an international conference held in Houston, Texas, USA, critically updated the seminal Sydney classification. In line with these initiatives, the Kyoto Global Consensus Report, flanked by the Maastricht-Florence conferences, added new clinical evidence to the gastritis clinicopathological puzzle. The most relevant topics related to the gastric inflammatory diseases have been addressed by the Real-world Gastritis Initiative (RE.GA. IN.), from disease definitions to the clinical diagnosis and prognosis. This paper reports the conclusions of the RE.GA. IN. consensus process, which culminated in Venice in November 2022 after more than eight months of intense global scientific deliberations.

A forum of gastritis scholars from five continents participated in the multidisciplinary RE.GA. IN. consensus. After lively debates on the most controversial aspects of the gastritis spectrum, the RE.GA. IN. faculty amalgamated complementary knowledge to distil patient-centred, evidence-based statements to assist health professionals in their real-world clinical practice.

- **Epidemiology of gastritis**: The report focuses on the epidemiology of gastritis.
- **Helicobacter pylori**: Helicobacter pylori is discussed as the dominant aetiology of environmental gastritis and as the most important determinant of the gastric oncogenetic field.
- **Gastric autoimmunity**: The evolving knowledge on gastric autoimmunity is examined.
- **Gastric microbiota**: The clinicopathological relevance of gastric microbiota is explored.
- **Diagnostic horizons**: New diagnostic horizons of endoscopy are highlighted.

### The histological spectrum of ARB-induced gastritis [^116Gdhjh]. Histopathology (2022). Low credibility.

Active chronic gastritis is a non-specific pattern with a broad differential, but several features can guide pathologists towards diagnosing ARB-induced gastric injury. The lamina propria infiltrate in ARB-induced gastritis typically involves the full thickness of the mucosa or is midzonal, differing from the top-heavy infiltrate seen in H. pylori gastritis. Significant antral inflammation is present in most cases, differentiating ARB-induced gastritis from autoimmune gastritis, which would show antral sparing. Prominent surface epithelial damage may also indicate drug-induced gastric injury. Although not always evident, intra-epithelial lymphocytosis and/or subepithelial collagen thickening could alert pathologists to ARB-induced gastric injury.

Several histological changes in ARB-induced gastritis, such as surface epithelial damage, active inflammation, and intra-epithelial lymphocytosis, can also appear in NSAID-related gastric injury. However, the presence of a prominent lymphoplasmacytic lamina propria infiltrate is not typical in NSAID-related injury. Another indication of ARB-induced GI tract injury is histological changes in the duodenum. In our study, the findings in gastric and duodenal biopsies were closely correlated in 11 of 14 cases. Three cases with subepithelial collagen deposition in the stomach showed similar features in the duodenum, as well as active inflammation and intra-epithelial lymphocytosis.

### Helicobacter pylori eradication in patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs reduces the severity of gastritis: a randomized controlled trial [^1124xoJm]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2009). High credibility.

Maintenance use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is often complicated by gastropathy. In non-NSAID users, eradication of Helicobacter pylori is associated with decreased mucosal inflammation and may halt the progression to atrophy and intestinal metaplasia. However, the continuous use of NSAIDs may interfere with these processes.

- **Goal**: To investigate the effect of H. pylori eradication on gastric mucosal histology during long-term NSAID use, with and without gastroprotective therapy.

- **Study**: Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were on long-term NSAIDs and were H. pylori-positive on serologic testing. Patients were randomly assigned to either eradication or placebo. Gastritis was assessed according to the updated Sydney classification for activity, chronic inflammation, gastric glandular atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and H. pylori density.

- **Results**: Biopsy specimens were available for histology of 305 patients. Of these, 48% were on chronic gastroprotective medication. Significantly less active gastritis, inflammation, and H. pylori density were found in the eradication group compared with the placebo group in both corpus and antrum (P < 0.001). In the corpus, less atrophy was found in the eradication group compared with the placebo group.

- **Conclusions**: H. pylori eradication in patients on long-term NSAID therapy leads to healing of gastritis despite ongoing NSAID therapy.

### Prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors, CagA status, and the outcome of Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^111SXyH2]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

To assess whether prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in patients infected with Helicobacter pylori has adverse effects on gastritis, we studied 34 H. pylori-positive individuals with reflux esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, or nonulcer dyspepsia. Half of the participants were on maintenance treatment with PPIs (mean duration, 8 years), and half were not. The H. pylori and CagA status were tested serologically. Gastric biopsies were classified histopathologically by the updated Sydney classification.

- **Study results**: Proton pump inhibitors in H. pylori gastritis are associated with significantly less antral inflammation and lower H. pylori density, regardless of CagA status. There was a tendency toward more antral atrophy in patients with the CagA strain who were undergoing maintenance treatment with PPIs (p = 0.08), but there was an opposite tendency in CagA-negative individuals (p = 0.08). Intestinal metaplasia was observed more frequently in CagA-positive individuals receiving treatment (p = 0.028).

- **Conclusions**: These findings support the hypothesis that CagA status is important in the progression to atrophy and that maintenance treatment with PPIs accelerates this progression while reducing inflammatory infiltration.

This report contributes to the identification and management of this pathology by providing data on a large collection of cases describing gastritis in the setting of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. It offers a complete clinicopathological picture, rather than focusing on one aspect alone, for clinicians to recognize the disease pattern of ICI gastritis. The results of this study are clinically relevant, as they will allow prescribers to identify and treat patients with ICI-induced gastritis early, minimizing interruption of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^1118mUh1]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

Urea is a byproduct of amino acid catabolism. Because larger cells produce more protein, it is likely that large cells may secrete more urea than small cells. As mentioned above, flow cytometry analysis had already shown that cells in the ENR_FRTi_ condition (pit cells) are larger than cells in the ENRWFGTiNi condition (gland cells) (Supplementary Fig. 7b–e). This is also visible in the histological staining of organoids (Fig. 5e–g). Matching cells in the ENR_FRTi_ condition (pit cells) produce about three times higher concentrations of urea than cells in the ENRWFGTiNi condition (gland cells) (Fig. 5h). If urea secretion scaling with size were a major determinant of H. pylori preference, this would also be visible in all differentiated cells, regardless of whether these are pit or gland cells. Indeed, flow cytometry analysis showed that the percentages of H. pylori-infected cells correlate with the cell size, even in the absence of pit cells (ENRWFGNiTi) (Fig. 5i, j).

We conclude that urea chemotaxis leads to H. pylori preferential binding to large cells and that the binding preference to differentiated pit cells is rooted in the cell size.

H. pylori localizes in close proximity to highly differentiated pit cells in vivo. Having observed preferential binding of H. pylori to a subpopulation of highly differentiated pit cells in vitro, we examined whether this preference could be observed in vivo. For this, we used H. pylori-positive gastric biopsies from donors who underwent endoscopy diagnosis. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that H. pylori was predominantly found next to c

### Sleeve gastrectomy reveals the plasticity of the human gastric epithelium [^117AGoTA]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The human stomach is comprised of the antrum, corpus, fundus, and cardia. The pyloric glands of the gastric antrum consist of mucus-secreting pit and neck cells, a proliferative stem-cell compartment at the gland's isthmus, and endocrine cells at the base region. The oxyntic glands of the corpus contain mucus-secreting pit and neck cells, isthmus proliferating cells, different types of endocrine cells, parietal cells that secrete hydrochloric acid, and chief cells that secrete digestive enzymes.

Sustaining a low pH is an essential gastric function. Endocrine cells in the antrum sense luminal pH to stimulate secretion of the hormone gastrin into the bloodstream when pH rises. Gastrin stimulates histamine release from enterochromaffin-like cells (ECLs) in the gastric corpus, which, together with gastrin, induces hydrochloric acid secretion from parietal cells into the gastric lumen. The stomach maintains pH homeostasis despite natural variability in diet, physiological parameters such as gastric volume and saliva secretion rate, and in the face of chemical insults and mild gastritis, which may reduce the number of parietal cells.

### Diagnostic approach to H. pylori-related gastric oncogenesis [^112JeXdn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative, microaerophilic spiral bacterium with an estimated global prevalence of about 58%. Since its discovery in 1982 by the Australian Nobelists Marshall and Warren, H. pylori has attracted the attention of the biomedical community with its numerous implications, which surpass the "narrow" anatomical limits of the stomach. This bacterium is present in almost all biological samples, including gastric mucosa samples, its site of residence, as well as blood, saliva, breath, feces, and urine.

Apart from its well-established etiologic role in peptic ulcer disease and its substantiated carcinogenic effect on the stomach via both the Correa cascade and the formation of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, a plethora of extraintestinal manifestations have been associated with H. pylori infection, including metabolic syndrome with its hepatic component, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, neurodegenerative entities such as Alzheimer's disease, glaucoma (also commonly known as 'ocular' Alzheimer's disease), and hematological and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, prompt and accurate diagnosis of H. pylori infection is of great significance.

In this review, we summarize all the diagnostic modalities used for H. pylori infection detection and provide relevant information by highlighting the advantages and limitations of each method and its potential application for H. pylori-related gastric carcinogenesis.

### Insights into endoscopic imaging [^115FGeEN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Kudo et al. delved into polyp morphology and decoded the crypt pattern by introducing the first pit pattern classification. Based on this innovative concept, other investigatory groups with expertise in optical diagnosis demonstrated a different evaluation of mucosal surface analysis. To anticipate the complexity and standardize the NBI observation criteria, an international cooperative group, the Colon Tumor NBI Interest Group (CTNIG), has recently developed a simple NBI magnifying observation classification known as the NICE classification (NBI International Colorectal Endoscopic Classification), which classifies NBI into types 1–3.

Dr. Yao et al. have recently proposed a systematic but simple classification system based on microvascular (MV) pattern and microsurface (MS) pattern, termed the 'VS' classification system, using NBI with ME to visualize the morphology of gastric mucosal capillaries. The main listed indications were: 1) routine screening endoscopy for distinguishing between small early gastric cancer and focal gastritis, and 2) the preoperative assessment of the lateral extent of early gastric cancer for curative endoscopic resection. As such, ME with NBI appeared to be a reliable imaging technique for the characterization and delineation of early gastric cancer.

In another study, Dr. Hisabe and colleagues present a prospective feasibility and validity study to evaluate the usefulness of the same VS classification system in differentiating neoplastic from non-neoplastic polyps in the colon. The comparison of the VS classification system (using ME with NBI) with pit pattern analysis (using ME with NBI) demonstrates…

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^116tUQDo]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies allow researchers to resolve the cellular composition of tissues and organoids. This technology also enables the decomposition of host-pathogen interactions at an unprecedented resolution, providing a powerful tool to decipher both cellular identities and their functions in the complex and heterogeneous outcomes of infection.

Here, we combine the power of human adult stem cell-derived gastric organoids and scRNA-seq to identify the H. pylori preferential target cell. ScRNA-seq applied to 3D gastric organoids and 2D monolayers derived from organoids demonstrates that the former mostly contains cells from the gland region, while the latter contains pit cells, particularly a population of highly differentiated pit cells. This population is absent from 3D organoids under standard growth conditions. However, since adult stem cells have full differentiation capacity, 3D organoids can also be directed to generate this cell type, which is particularly large and granular, expressing PSCA, GKN1, and GKN2.

H. pylori preferentially binds to these highly differentiated pit cells, a preference that depends on the chemotaxis of the bacteria towards host urea. As a byproduct of protein metabolism, urea secretion scales with host cell size, as does the binding preference of H. pylori. Together, the data show that H. pylori urea chemotaxis leads to preferential binding to particularly large, highly differentiated pit cells.

### Clinical manifestations of Helicobacter pylori-negative gastritis [^115vYwnj]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

There are data to suggest the existence of non-Helicobacter pylori gastritis. However, the risk factors and clinical course for H. pylori-negative gastritis remain unclear. We aimed to examine the prevalence and determinants of H. pylori-negative gastritis in a large multiethnic clinical population.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional study among patients scheduled for an elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy or attending selected primary care clinics and eligible for screening colonoscopy at a single Veterans Affairs medical center. We identified cases of H. pylori-negative gastritis, H. pylori-positive gastritis, and H. pylori-negative nongastritis, where gastritis was defined by the presence of neutrophils and/or mononuclear cells. Risk factors for H. pylori-negative gastritis were analyzed in logistic regression models.

- **Results**: A total of 1240 patients had information from all biopsy sites, of whom 695 (56.0%) had gastritis. H. pylori-negative gastritis was present in 123 patients (9.9% of all study subjects and 17.7% of all patients with gastritis). Among all patients with gastritis, African Americans were statistically significantly less likely than non-Hispanic whites to have H. pylori-negative gastritis (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.14–0.43). Conversely, PPI users were more likely to have H. pylori-negative gastritis than H. pylori-positive gastritis compared with non-users (odds ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–3.49). The cumulative incidence of gastric erosions and ulcers was higher in patients with H. pylori-negative gastritis.

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^117QJkHf]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

The importance of cell size, for example in aging and stem cell capacity, is only beginning to be discussed. Here, we show that the urea sensing of H. pylori leads to a bacterial preference for larger cells. Notably, large size characterizes senescent cells. Our size measurements in organoids correspond well to measurements in human organoid-derived monolayers and mouse tissue, with heights for gland cells from 13 µm to 19 µm, and heights for pit cells of 20–45 µm, with the length of the pit cells increasing with differentiation. Notably, pit cells are the cells with the highest turnover and are replaced about every 3 days.

In addition, contrary to gland cells, pit cells are refractory to mounting an inflammatory response to infection with H. pylori. Thus, with this very sensitive chemotaxis towards urea, evolution has shaped a fine-tuned system in which bacteria target those cells that are not only mounting the lowest immune response but are also replaced most frequently in the epithelium and thus most dispensable for the tissue.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^114mFbpG]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

There has been significant technical progress in diagnostic tools for GI diseases. Advanced endoscopy with image-enhanced modalities and magnification allows for the diagnosis of gastritis with a high degree of accuracy, even before histological confirmation. Furthermore, non-invasive diagnostic tests, such as the [13 C]-urea breath test, fecal antigen test, and serological parameters, serve as surrogate markers of H. pylori gastritis and indicators of gastritis severity. Classification systems for grading gastritis, such as the Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment (OLGA) and Operative Link for Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia Assessment (OLGIM), have also been proposed, in addition to the internationally accepted Sydney System. Their utility needs to be evaluated and agreed upon.

In 2013, the Japanese government insurance policy approved eradication therapy for H. pylori-positive gastritis after endoscopic examination to exclude more serious diseases such as ulcer and cancer, in line with the Japanese guidelines for H. pylori management. However, no global consensus has been published on when to recommend eradication therapy for H. pylori gastritis and how to follow up after eradication.

Since global awareness of gastritis is still confounded by a number of controversial issues, as described above, a meeting was set up in Kyoto to achieve global consensus on H. pylori gastritis. This meeting aimed to attempt conceptual changes in gastritis classification in general and to agree on diagnosis and management strategies with special reference to FD and cancer prevention.

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^117RVFNt]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In this study, we have characterized the highly differentiated pit cell as a preferential target cell for H. pylori binding. This subset of pit cells is characterized by the expression of high levels of MUC5AC, GKN1, GKN2, CEACAM5, PSCA, and PHGR1. MUC5AC contains Lewis B antigens, which are known to be bound by H. pylori adhesins. PSCA is a membrane-anchored glycoprotein expressed in several organs, including the stomach. Its function has not been elucidated yet, but genetic variants of this gene have been associated with gastric cancer. However, in our experiments, MUC5AC or PSCA expression was dispensable for the binding. CEACAM5 is a receptor for HopQ, an H. pylori adhesin. In our sample, CEACAM5 transcript was only detected in a fraction of the target cell population, and thus it is likely that this is not the only factor important for bacterial binding in our setting.

Instead, we found that chemoattraction to the host cell metabolite urea underlies the preferential binding to differentiated pit cells. Urea attraction has been described early using capillary tube assays. Recent work has identified that H. pylori directly senses urea via the chemoreceptor TlpB. TlpB has an unusually high affinity for urea, and H. pylori can detect concentrations as low as 50 nM. Simultaneous degradation of urea by H. pylori-secreted urease prevents the receptor from being saturated. This highly sensitive urea-sensing by TlpB is important for the long-term colonization of the stomach. Interestingly, TlpB gene expression is regulated via targeting of a variable G-repeat in its sequence.

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^11443k7F]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

For *H. pylori*, bacterial adhesion is not only an important step for colonization in the human stomach but also a prerequisite for CagA translocation. In this study, we demonstrate that *H. pylori* preferentially binds to a highly differentiated subpopulation of gastric pit cells. This is mirrored by high bacterial density in the pit region in patient tissue.

Classical studies by Warren and Marshall have already reported that in human biopsy material, the majority of *H. pylori* is found close to the pit region. This preferential location was underlined by quantification: In human biopsy material, less than 1% of bacteria are found associated with MUC6-producing gland cells. Studies in mouse sections find more frequent colonization of the deep glands. A direct quantitative comparison of bacterial locations between mouse and human infections is lacking, but the data suggest possible differences between hosts.

Human organoids and their derived monolayers are emerging additions to the spectrum of model systems in infection biology, allowing the study of human-specific pathogens with primary human epithelium. Here, a comparison of ex vivo sorted gastric epithelial cells with cells from 3D organoids and organoid-derived 2D monolayers using single-cell sequencing demonstrated that the two models represent different parts of the gastric unit. Under standard growth conditions, 2D monolayers harbor mostly cells from the pit region and their progenitors, while 3D organoids rather harbor the glandular progenitors. Both models are important for the understanding of *H. pylori* colonization.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the diagnosis and management of patients at risk of gastric adenocarcinoma [^111Uu3X2]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Gastric atrophy is diagnosed histopathologically by two specific features: the presence of chronic inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes and plasma cells that expand the lamina propria, and the loss of the pre-existent gastric glands.

There is inconsistency in the histopathological diagnosis and severity of gastric atrophy (GA) between pathologists, resulting in low interobserver agreement by histopathologists when staging GA using the OLGA (Operative Link on Gastritis Assessment) staging system, based on biopsies taken using the Sydney protocol. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that accurate endoscopic staging of the severity of GA is strongly linked to gastric adenocarcinoma risk and that the interobserver and intraobserver agreement of endoscopic severity assessment, in experienced hands, is moderate to excellent.

The prevalence of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), including GA, worldwide correlates with the prevalence of H. pylori-associated gastritis, increases with age, and tends to be slightly more common in men. Prevalence is typically determined using gastroscopy and serum pepsinogen. In Western populations, the prevalence varies from 0% to 8.3%, depending on age. Studies performed in high-incidence areas such as Japan and China showed a prevalence of CAG of between 33% and 84%.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^113RBsUN]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

To present the results of the Kyoto Global Consensus Meeting, which was convened to develop global consensus on (1) the classification of chronic gastritis and duodenitis, (2) the clinical distinction of dyspepsia caused by Helicobacter pylori from functional dyspepsia, (3) the appropriate diagnostic assessment of gastritis, and (4) the determination of when, whom, and how to treat H. pylori gastritis, experts addressed twenty-three clinical questions within these domains.

A Delphi method, using an anonymous electronic system, was adopted to develop the consensus, with the level of acceptance predefined at ≥ 80%. Final modifications of clinical questions and consensus were achieved at a face-to-face meeting in Kyoto.

All 24 statements for 22 clinical questions, after extensive modifications and the omission of one clinical question, were achieved with a consensus level of > 80%. To better organize the classification of gastritis and duodenitis based on etiology, a new classification is recommended for the 11th international classification. A new category of H. pylori-associated dyspepsia, along with a diagnostic algorithm, was proposed. The adoption of grading systems for gastric cancer risk stratification and modern image-enhancing endoscopy for the diagnosis of gastritis were recommended. Treatment to eradicate H. pylori infection before preneoplastic changes develop, if feasible, was recommended to minimize the risk of more serious complications from the infection.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^116qYmn8]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Conventional endoscopy is, in most cases, an inadequate tool for diagnosing atrophy and intestinal metaplasia. Therefore, it remains mandatory to perform a biopsy, allowing histomorphological assessment of the gastric mucosa according to the Sydney classification. However, image-enhanced endoscopy has improved the accuracy and reproducibility of endoscopic diagnosis of premalignant gastric lesions. This includes chromoendoscopy, high-resolution magnification endoscopy, and image-enhanced endoscopy combined with magnification (see Figure 2). These methods are now routinely available in Japan and will be increasingly used worldwide. Adequate evaluation of the stomach mucosa with each of these methods requires appropriate training and offers the advantage of targeted biopsies.

	- **Narrow band imaging (NBI) of the gastric mucosa**: Round homogeneous-sized pits with regularly arranged collecting venules are shown on the left. This pattern, known as the regular arrangement of collecting venules (RAC) pattern in the corpus mucosa, highly indicates a Helicobacter pylori negative state. In the H. pylori-infected mucosa with inflammation, pit patterns are elongated, varied in sizes and shapes with spaces between them. Collecting venules are obscured due to inflammation (center). When intestinal metaplasia develops, the pit pattern is further elongated with light blue lines (light blue crest sign) decorating the pit margins (right).

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^111svDf2]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

The human gastric epithelium forms highly organized gland structures with different subtypes of cells. The carcinogenic bacterium Helicobacter pylori can attach to gastric cells and subsequently translocate its virulence factor CagA, but the possible host cell tropism of H. pylori is currently unknown. Here, we report that H. pylori preferentially attaches to differentiated cells in the pit region of gastric units. Single-cell RNA-seq shows that organoid-derived monolayers recapitulate the pit region, while organoids capture the gland region of the gastric units.

Using these models, we show that H. pylori preferentially attaches to highly differentiated pit cells, marked by high levels of GKN1, GKN2, and PSCA. Directed differentiation of host cells enables enrichment of the target cell population and confirms H. pylori's preferential attachment and CagA translocation into these cells. Attachment is independent of MUC5AC or PSCA expression and instead relies on bacterial TlpB-dependent chemotaxis towards host cell-released urea, which scales with host cell size.

The design of the consensus process involved drafting twenty-three clinical questions related to the aforementioned domains. Expert panels were asked to formulate relevant statements using a Delphi method through an anonymous electronic system, with a predefined consensus level of ≥ 80%. Final modifications and consensus on clinical questions were achieved at a face-to-face meeting in Kyoto.

Results showed that all twenty-four statements, corresponding to twenty-two clinical questions, reached a consensus level of over 80% after extensive modifications and the omission of one clinical question. It was recommended to organize the classification of gastritis and duodenitis based on etiology, proposing a new classification for the 11th international classification. A new category of H. pylori-associated dyspepsia, along with a diagnostic algorithm, was also proposed. Recommendations included the adoption of grading systems for gastric cancer risk stratification and the use of modern image-enhancing endoscopy for diagnosing gastritis. Eradicating H. pylori infection before preneoplastic changes develop, if feasible, was advised to minimize the risk of more serious complications from the infection.

In conclusion, the consensus established guidelines for these aspects of gastritis and duodenitis management.

### Classification of gastric pit patterns by confocal endomicroscopy [^117A6n8J]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Confocal endomicroscopy is a newly developed endoscopic imaging technology that produces 1000-fold magnification cross-sectional images of the GI surface and subsurface tissue during routine endoscopy. The gastric pit patterns identified by confocal endomicroscopy and their correlation with histopathologic examination have not yet been established.

- **Objective**: Our purpose was to explore the appearance of various kinds of gastric pits and clarify the relationship between gastric pit patterns and the histopathologic findings.

- **Design**: Descriptive study.

- **Setting**: Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.

- **Patients**: A total of 132 consecutive patients underwent confocal endomicroscopy after 7 healthy volunteers had been examined in vivo, and 10 samples resected from 10 patients with gastric cancer had been examined ex vivo by use of confocal endomicroscopy. The confocal images obtained from the 132 patients were compared with the histopathologic findings of the biopsy specimens from the corresponding confocal imaging sites in a prospective and blinded fashion.

- **Main outcome measurements**: The relationship between the pit patterns and the histopathologic findings.

- **Results**: Gastric pit patterns were classified into 7 types. Normal mucosa with fundic glands mainly showed type A (round pits), and corporal mucosa with histologic gastritis showed type B (noncontinuous short rod-like); normal mucosa with pyloric glands mainly showed type C (continuous short rod-like), and antral mucosa with histologic gastritis showed type D (elongated and tortuous branch-like). Goblet cell abnormalities were observed but not fully described, as the text appears to be truncated.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: Expert review [^1118RoQV]. Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update Expert Review is to provide clinicians with guidance on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis, a common preneoplastic condition of the stomach. There is a primary focus on atrophic gastritis due to chronic *Helicobacter pylori* infection — the most common etiology — or due to autoimmunity. At the time of writing, clinical guidance for best practices related to the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis remains very limited in the United States, which leads to poor recognition of this preneoplastic condition and suboptimal risk stratification.

In addition, there is heterogeneity in the definitions of atrophic gastritis, autoimmune gastritis, pernicious anemia, and gastric neoplasia in the literature, which has led to confusion in clinical practice and research. Accordingly, the primary objective of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide clinicians with a framework for the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis.

By focusing on atrophic gastritis, this Clinical Practice Update is intended to complement the 2020 American Gastroenterological Association Institute guidelines on the management of gastric intestinal metaplasia. These recent guidelines did not specifically discuss the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis. Providers should recognize, however, that a diagnosis of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histopathology implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis because intestinal metaplasia occurs in underlying atrophic mucosa, although this is often not distinctly noted on histopathologic reports.

### Intramural gastric abscess — preoperative diagnosis with CT [^114mifEr]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Intramural gastric abscess is a rare condition representing a localized form of suppurative gastritis, a condition historically described during the time of Galen. Cases are typically diagnosed using a combination of imaging modalities such as upper gastrointestinal series, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and endoscopic ultrasound. These imaging techniques are often used in conjunction with endoscopy and laparotomy. The authors describe a case of intramural gastric abscess in which the diagnosis was made preoperatively using axial, coronal, and sagittal reformations obtained with multidetector CT.

### Evidence that gastric pit dysplasia-like atypia is a neoplastic precursor lesion [^113gpzn3]. Human Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Most gastric cancers develop via an intestinal metaplasia (IM)-dysplasia-carcinogenic pathway. We have noted that some patients with chronic gastritis have dysplasia-like atypia (DLA) limited to the pit epithelium but without involvement of the surface epithelium. We performed this study to determine the clinical and biological characteristics and outcomes of DLA to gain insight into its role in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer.

The study consisted of 102 consecutive patients with resected gastric cancer, a separate cohort of patients (n = 166) with chronic gastritis and IM in their index gastric biopsies, and 44 controls. All specimens were evaluated for clinical and pathological features of the cancer (in the resection cohort) and background mucosa.

Of the 102 patients with gastric cancer, 50 (49%) had DLA in areas of mucosa adjacent to or near either conventional dysplasia or cancer. This value was significantly higher than in controls (DLA 6.8%; P < .0001). Gastric cancer patients with DLA showed a significantly higher age at presentation, intestinal-type adenocarcinoma, low-grade differentiation, stage 1 tumors, and a higher rate of chronic gastritis, IM, atrophy, and conventional dysplasia in the background mucosa compared to patients without DLA. DLA showed intestinal-type differentiation, a higher Ki-67 rate, and MUC6 positivity compared with IM.

Of the 166 patients with biopsies, DLA was identified in 24 (14%). Upon follow-up, 38% of positive cases showed persistent DLA, whereas 25% progressed to conventional low-grade dysplasia. Based on these results, we conclude that DLA is a significant marker in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^111TLM4t]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Antibiotic susceptibility-based approach

Unlike most infectious diseases where therapy is guided by knowledge of antibiotic sensitivity profiling of the target organism, or at least by knowledge of strains within the relevant geographical region, H. pylori treatment has remained largely empiric. For refractory cases, it may seem obvious that sensitivity testing should be considered after two failed attempts at treatment. However, in practice, the situation is complicated by the logistical challenges of obtaining resistance profiles for H. pylori, as well as the lack of convincing data demonstrating the superiority of selecting treatment based on sensitivity testing compared to empirically selecting treatment based on prior antibiotic exposure.

Standard methodology to test for antibiotic sensitivity involves promptly transporting gastric biopsies in sterile containers at room temperature to the receiving microbiology laboratory. There, they undergo a relatively labor-intensive process to grow microbial colonies in micro-aerophilic conditions over several days. Once it is confirmed that the bacteria are indeed H. pylori, for example, based on morphology, urease, catalase, and oxidase activity, the bacteria are then tested for viability in the presence of the relevant antibiotics. Because few hospitals or endoscopy centers in the US offer this service in-house, the biopsy specimens for sensitivity testing are instead usually sent in refrigerated packaging to a commercial laboratory.

### Autoimmune gastritis [^115vZGKK]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AG) is a corpus-restricted chronic atrophic gastritis associated with intrinsic factor deficiency, either with or without pernicious anemia. It is considered a microscopic disease because patients present with no or vague symptoms, and clinicians rarely find endoscopic changes. Autoimmune gastritis becomes a clinical disease when pathologists diagnose it in gastric biopsies performed for various clinical indications. Unfamiliarity with this disease can lead to misdiagnosis, resulting in inadequate patient management.

- **Objective**: To review the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnoses, sequelae, and surveillance recommendations for AG.

- **Data sources**: The study includes a review of the pertinent literature for AG.

- **Conclusions**: Autoimmune gastritis is an important disease characterized by a loss of oxyntic mucosa and the presence of metaplastic epithelium and enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia. Awareness and proper diagnosis are critical to prevent mismanagement of patients.

### Gastric wall abscess presenting as thoracic pain: Rare presentation of an old disease [^113b4dgS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Suppurative gastritis (SG) is an uncommon and often fatal condition characterized by a suppurative bacterial infection of the stomach arising from a local or disseminated hematogenous infection. SG can occur in diffuse, localized, or mixed forms. The most common type, the diffuse form, is characterized by initial involvement of the gastric submucosa with posterior extension to all layers of the gastric wall. This results in extensive gangrene of the stomach and the much rarer intramural localized gastric abscess. We report a case of acute phlegmonous gastritis and discuss the diagnosis and treatment of this rare disease.

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^115aC92o]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In terms of prevalence, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a very successful human pathogen that colonizes the stomach of approximately 50% of the global population. Although most infected individuals remain asymptomatic, the persistence of the pathogen and the resulting inflammation are associated with an increased risk of developing gastric diseases, including peptic ulcer, chronic active gastritis, and gastric adenocarcinoma.

H. pylori evades the luminal gastric acid by replicating in the mucus layer close to the epithelial cells or by colonizing the glands. Bacteria can attach to epithelial cells by binding to Lewis antigens, frequently presented by host glycoproteins including mucin 5AC (MUC5AC), CEA Cell Adhesion Molecule 5 (CEACAMs), and β1-integrin. Binding to integrins promotes the expression of a bacterial type 4 secretion system (T4SS), which then translocates a bacterial protein, the cytotoxicity-associated gene A (CagA), into the host cell, where it is phosphorylated by host proteins. CagA translocation can lead to the loss of cell polarity, which can allow H. pylori to obtain nutrients. The bacterial T4SS and its effector, CagA, are thus considered the key drivers of pathogenicity and a major risk factor for the development of gastric cancer. Bacterial peptidoglycan and ADP-heptose induce an NF-κB inflammatory response, which is thought to further drive tissue destruction and subsequent compensatory proliferation.

The gastric epithelium is organized into flask-like invaginations, the gastric units, which are further organized into the regions pit, isthmus, and gland.

### Update on the pathologic approach to the diagnosis of gastritis, gastric atrophy, and Helicobacter pylori and its sequelae [^115eMBZS]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Biopsy sampling of the gastric mucosa at diagnostic endoscopy provides information that cannot be obtained otherwise. The most common indication for gastric biopsy is the need to know whether the patient is infected with Helicobacter pylori or if the stomach is gastritic. Microscopic examination of gastric biopsy specimens, in addition to determining H. pylori status, gives information about the grade, extent, and topography of gastritis- and atrophy-related alterations in the gastric mucosa. This information provides further possibilities for the assessment of risk and likelihood of various gastric disorders.

The presence of atrophy (loss of mucosal glands) results in failures in the secretory functions of the corresponding mucosa and leads to errors in the homeostasis of normal gastric physiology. The grade of atrophy of the corpus mucosa linearly correlates with the peak and maximal output of acid. The presence of advanced (moderate or severe) corpus atrophy indicates an extremely hypochlorhydric or achlorhydric stomach, in which, for example, an ordinary peptic ulcer is unlikely or impossible despite a possible H. pylori infection.

Some well-characterized and common topographic phenotypes of H. pylori gastritis and atrophic gastritis can be delineated as follows:

- **Predominance or restriction of the H. pylori-related inflammation in antrum**: This is associated with a nonatrophic corpus mucosa, which is the most common phenotype, and comes with an increased risk of peptic ulcer disease, particularly duodenal ulcer, referred to as the "duodenal ulcer phenotype" of gastritis.

### Beyond helicobacter: Dealing with other variants of gastritis-an algorithmic approach [^117TF7Fo]. Histopathology (2021). Low credibility.

In daily practice, the presence of inflammation in gastric biopsies prompts a mental algorithm. An early question is whether the lesion present is Helicobacter-associated. If Helicobacter organisms are not found, then a further algorithm is employed, governed by the predominant type of inflammatory cells present and other features such as intraepithelial lymphocytosis, a subepithelial collagen band, granulomas, coexisting chronic inflammation, focality, and superimposed reactive changes including erosions and ulcers. Each of these generates its own differential diagnosis.

If no inflammation is present, two major changes specifically looked for are the changes associated with hypergastrinaemia, the most common cause of which is treatment with proton pump inhibitors, and reactive changes. These may be present with or without accompanying inflammation. When the epithelial changes dominate, the term "gastropathy" is preferred. In this article, we present an approach to non-Helicobacter inflammation and gastropathies.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for pit viper envenomation, specifically concerning evacuation, the WMS 2015 guidelines recommend contacting the nearest healthcare facility ahead of time. If antivenom is unavailable, consider sending it from another facility or immediately transporting the patient to a different facility. Consider directly contacting a poison control center to coordinate this process.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: Expert review [^111ky3op]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for atrophic gastritis, specifically with respect to diagnostic endoscopy, the AGA 2021 guidelines recommend that providers should recognize the typical endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis. These features include the pale appearance of the gastric mucosa, increased visibility of vasculature due to thinning of the gastric mucosa, and loss of gastric folds. If accompanied by concomitant intestinal metaplasia, there may be light blue crests and white opaque fields. Since these mucosal changes are often subtle, techniques to optimize the evaluation of the gastric mucosa should be performed.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^115TunbB]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

For decades, endoscopic 'gastritis', gastric erosions, and even histological findings of gastric inflammation have failed to attract much attention from clinicians, as the majority of patients with these findings remain asymptomatic. Although gastritis is often used to describe dyspeptic symptoms, the presence of such symptoms correlates poorly with histological or endoscopic gastritis. While the term 'gastritis' is still used as a concept to explain dyspeptic symptoms, it refers to gastric inflammation, often accompanying structural mucosal changes. This gastric inflammation (gastritis) has long been associated with peptic ulcer, gastric cancer, and pernicious anaemia, but the cause or causes of gastritis remain poorly understood. The discovery that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) was a cause of gastritis focused attention on the aetiology, natural history, and prognosis of gastritis.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^112YRPmf]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

The global consensus meeting on H. pylori gastritis has set a new landmark for gastritis, which has continued to be an ill-conceived clinical entity placed between a histological picture and upper abdominal symptoms.

In spite of the fact that gastritis had been long recognized as an important clinical entity, generations of gastroenterologists have neglected the importance of treatment for this nosological entity. Rudolf Schindler described chronic gastritis as a serious disease and a precursor of gastric cancer, considering their relationship as being of outstanding importance in the fight against gastric cancer.

The discovery of H. pylori has revolutionized the pre-existing concepts of gastritis by assigning a specific etiology to this entity underlying peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and gastric cancer. The majority of these serious conditions are manifestations developed on the background of chronic gastritis caused by a unique infectious agent, H. pylori. For PUD, guidelines unanimously recommend eradication as the primary treatment for those with positive H. pylori tests. However, there has been no consensus on how and when to manage individuals with H. pylori gastritis itself. This is crucial to the efficiency of gastric cancer prevention, as most patients with chronic gastritis may remain asymptomatic until the appearance of severe complications. Furthermore, both gastritis and duodenitis were recognized as important causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, encouraging attention to these conditions now that anti-thrombotic therapies are increasingly being used.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^116TDxwN]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Eradicating H. pylori always confers a benefit by halting the progression of gastric mucosal damage, reducing the reservoir of infected individuals, and reducing or preventing H. pylori-associated diseases. The maximum benefit of eradication for an individual is obtained if eradication is done while the H. pylori-induced mucosal damage has not progressed beyond the non-atrophic stage. This population is found in countries where gastric cancer is still prevalent and is concentrated in the younger generation. H. pylori eradication in adolescents and young adults has the additional advantage of reducing or preventing the transmission of the infection to their children.

As noted above, the risk for the development of gastric cancer correlates with the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis. It is impossible to define the risk for an individual based on age. Cancer risk in any population relates to the rate of progression of gastric mucosal damage, which is high in populations at high risk of cancer and low in H. pylori-infected populations with a low cancer risk. Thus, while it is possible to identify an average age at which the transition from non-atrophic to atrophic phenotype occurs for any population, one should expect that any age group will contain individuals with a wide range of damage, ranging from uninfected (normal) to advanced atrophy. This emphasizes the need for risk stratification based on objective parameters, including a validated histological staging system rather than on age, to identify whether one eradication treatment is needed or whether the process should continue.
