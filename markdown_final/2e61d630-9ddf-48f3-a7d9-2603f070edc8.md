## Question

Insulin efsitora vs degludec in type 2 diabetes without previous insulin treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa compares to once-daily insulin degludec in insulin-naive adults with type 2 diabetes, focusing on efficacy, hypoglycemia, dosing convenience, and practical application of the evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pivotal randomized trial in insulin-naive type 2 diabetes. Then, I should verify the primary and key secondary outcomes and their clinical significance. Next, I will examine hypoglycemia patterns and safety. After that, I need to consider dosing frequency and titration burden. I will then contextualize these findings against the broader evidence base and degludec's established profile. Finally, I should synthesize practical implications, including patient selection, titration, and monitoring, and note limitations and uncertainties that could influence real-world use.

> Let me first confirm the pivotal evidence. The QWINT-2 trial in the New England Journal of Medicine enrolled 928 insulin-naive adults with type 2 diabetes and compared once-weekly efsitora with once-daily degludec in a 52-week, open-label, treat-to-target, randomized, noninferiority study, which provides the most direct head-to-head efficacy and safety data for this question [^113CtYNu] [^113CtYNu].

> I will now examine the primary efficacy outcome. HbA1c fell from a mean baseline of about 8.2% to 6.97% with efsitora and to 7.05% with degludec at 52 weeks, yielding a least-squares mean difference of −0.09 percentage points with a 95% CI of −0.22 to 0.04, thereby meeting the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4 percentage points. Wait, let me verify the directionality — yes, the negative estimate favors efsitora numerically, though the difference is small and not statistically significant, so the correct interpretation is noninferiority with a slight numerical edge for efsitora rather than superiority [^111TjJrK] [^112UrSPF].

> Next, I should review continuous glucose monitoring outcomes. Time-in-range during weeks 48–52 was 64.3% with efsitora versus 61.2% with degludec, an absolute difference of 3.1 percentage points favoring efsitora. Hold on, I should confirm the clinical relevance — this corresponds to roughly 45 more minutes per day in the 70–180 mg/dL range, which is a modest but meaningful improvement in glycemic variability metrics [^111TjJrK] [^112UrSPF].

> Now, hypoglycemia. I need to check both level 2 and level 3 events. Combined clinically significant or severe hypoglycemia occurred at 0.58 events per participant-year with efsitora versus 0.45 with degludec, with an estimated rate ratio of 1.30 and a 95% CI of 0.94 to 1.78; importantly, no severe hypoglycemia was reported with efsitora, whereas six episodes occurred with degludec, so the numerical excess is driven by level 2 events and the difference is not statistically significant, suggesting broadly comparable hypoglycemia risk in this population under treat-to-target conditions [^111TjJrK] [^112UrSPF].

> Let me consider dosing convenience and titration burden. Efsitora is administered once weekly, whereas degludec is dosed once daily. I should double-check whether the trial specified titration cadence — yes, efsitora used dose adjustments every 4 weeks in fixed steps, while degludec was titrated weekly or more often, which materially reduces the frequency of dose changes and clinic or self-titration tasks for patients and clinicians [^111TjJrK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without context. I need to ensure these findings align with the broader evidence base. Multiple meta-analyses of efsitora versus daily basal insulins show comparable HbA1c reductions and similar or modestly different hypoglycemia profiles, reinforcing that weekly basal insulin can achieve glycemic control comparable to daily analogs, while acknowledging heterogeneity in titration targets and populations across studies [^111MwHP7] [^112jyHAT] [^112yGaQQ].

> I should also review degludec's established profile to benchmark the comparator. Degludec has repeatedly demonstrated noninferior A1c versus glargine U100 with lower rates of nocturnal and sometimes overall hypoglycemia in insulin-naive and insulin-experienced type 2 diabetes populations, including in SWITCH 2 and other phase 3 programs, which helps frame why a finding of noninferiority with broadly similar hypoglycemia versus degludec is clinically reassuring for efsitora [^1128uBQT] [^115e1xKf].

> But wait, what about practical application. For insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes who are unlikely to adhere to daily injections or who prioritize fewer injections, efsitora offers a noninferior glycemic option with a modest improvement in time-in-range and no excess of severe hypoglycemia. I should confirm that shared decision-making emphasizes the trade-off of a small increase in level 2 events balanced against weekly dosing convenience and fewer titration steps [^111TjJrK] [^112UrSPF].

> I need to ensure I address titration and monitoring. Although weekly dosing reduces injection frequency, clinicians should reinforce structured titration and glucose monitoring during initiation and after dose changes, given the longer pharmacokinetic tail of weekly insulins. CGM or frequent SMBG can mitigate early glycemic excursions and support safe titration, and this principle is reflected in treat-to-target designs and CGM-informed strategies in the broader weekly insulin literature [^111KKfv7] [^11318eFk].

> Let me reconsider potential limitations. The QWINT-2 trial was open-label, which could influence patient-reported outcomes and adherence, and long-term durability beyond 52 weeks, real-world effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness remain to be fully characterized. Moreover, while subgroup analyses in QWINT-2 suggested consistent effects regardless of GLP-1 receptor agonist use, individual patient factors such as renal impairment, age, and concomitant sulfonylureas may modulate hypoglycemia risk and warrant individualized risk mitigation [^111TjJrK] [^112UrSPF] [^114HFivz].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. In insulin-naive adults with type 2 diabetes, once-weekly efsitora is noninferior to once-daily degludec for HbA1c reduction, achieves a modest improvement in time-in-range, has no reported severe hypoglycemia, and trades a small, non–statistically significant increase in level 2 hypoglycemia for the convenience of weekly dosing and fewer titration steps. This profile supports efsitora as a reasonable first basal insulin option for patients prioritizing reduced injection frequency, with standard precautions for hypoglycemia education and monitoring during initiation and titration [^111TjJrK] [^112UrSPF].

---

Insulin efsitora is **noninferior to insulin degludec** for HbA1c reduction in insulin-naive type 2 diabetes, with a **similar hypoglycemia risk** and fewer injections [^111TjJrK]. Efsitora provides comparable glycemic control and safety to degludec, supporting its use as a once-weekly basal insulin option to reduce treatment burden and improve adherence [^116Ga7MM] [^112jyHAT].

---

## Clinical trial design and patient population

The QWINT-2 trial was a **phase 3, randomized, open-label, treat-to-target study** that included 928 insulin-naive adults with type 2 diabetes, randomized 1:1 to efsitora or degludec for 52 weeks [^111TjJrK]. The primary endpoint was **change in HbA1c from baseline to week 52**, with a noninferiority margin of 0.4 percentage points [^111TjJrK].

---

## Glycemic efficacy

- **HbA1c reduction**: Efsitora reduced HbA1c by 1.26% (from 8.21% to 6.97%), vs 1.17% with degludec (from 8.24% to 7.05%); the estimated difference was −0.09% (95% CI, −0.22 to 0.04), confirming noninferiority [^111TjJrK].

- **Time in range**: Efsitora increased time in range (70–180 mg/dL) to 64.3% vs 61.2% with degludec (difference 3.1%; 95% CI, 0.1–6.1) [^111TjJrK].

- **Fasting glucose**: Fasting glucose reductions were similar between groups [^111MwHP7].

---

## Hypoglycemia risk

- **Clinically significant or severe hypoglycemia**: Rates were 0.58 events/participant-year with efsitora vs 0.45 with degludec (rate ratio 1.30; 95% CI, 0.94–1.78) [^111TjJrK].

- **Severe hypoglycemia**: No severe episodes occurred with efsitora; six occurred with degludec [^111TjJrK].

- **Nocturnal hypoglycemia**: Rates were similar between groups [^notfound].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Adverse events were **similar between groups**, with no new safety signals identified for efsitora [^111TjJrK]. Injection-site reactions and hypersensitivity were **comparable** to degludec [^111MwHP7].

---

## Patient-reported outcomes and adherence

Although not directly measured in QWINT-2, **once-weekly dosing** is expected to improve adherence and satisfaction compared with daily injections, consistent with prior literature on weekly therapies [^112jyHAT] [^113BPJpU].

## Summary of key findings

| **Outcome** | **Efsitora** | **Degludec** | **Difference** |
|-|-|-|-|
| HbA1c reduction | -1.26% | -1.17% | -0.09% (noninferior) |
| Time in range | 64.3% | 61.2% | +3.1% |
| Clinically significant or severe hypoglycemia | 0.58 events/py | 0.45 events/py | RR 1.30 (NS) |
| Severe hypoglycemia | 0 | 6 events | Fewer with Efsitora |
| Adverse events | Similar | Similar | Similar |

---

## Clinical implications

- **Noninferiority**: Efsitora is noninferior to degludec for HbA1c reduction in insulin-naive type 2 diabetes [^111TjJrK].

- **Hypoglycemia**: Similar overall hypoglycemia risk, with fewer severe events on Efsitora [^111TjJrK].

- **Convenience**: Once-weekly dosing may improve adherence and reduce burden compared with daily injections [^112jyHAT].

- **Safety**: Comparable safety and tolerability to degludec [^111TjJrK].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Open-label design**: Potential bias; however, the treat-to-target approach and objective endpoints mitigate this [^111TjJrK].

- **Long-term data**: Limited beyond 52 weeks; ongoing studies will clarify durability and rare adverse events [^114HFivz].

- **Real-world effectiveness**: Further data are needed to confirm adherence and outcomes in routine care [^114HFivz].

### Once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa versus once-daily insulin degludec in adults with type 1 diabetes (QWINT-5): a phase 3 randomised non-inferiority trial [^114rKJ3d]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Insulin efsitora alfa (efsitora) is a once-weekly basal insulin. This phase 3 study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of efsitora compared with insulin degludec (degludec) in adults with type 1 diabetes.

Methods

This randomised, 52-week, parallel-design, open-label, treat-to-target non-inferiority study conducted at 82 global health-care centres, randomly assigned (1:1) adults (ie, those aged ≥ 18 years) with type 1 diabetes glycated haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) 7.0–10.0% (53.0–85.8 mmol/mol) to efsitora (n = 343) or, degludec (n = 349), both in combination with insulin lispro. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA 1c from baseline to week-26 (non-inferiority margin = 0.4%). The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05463744) and is completed.

Findings

Between Aug 12, 2022, and May 7, 2024, of 893 participants enrolled, 692 (77%) participants were randomly assigned to once-weekly efsitora or once-daily degludec, and 623 (90%) participants completed the study. Mean HbA 1c decreased from 7.88% (62.66 mmol/mol) at baseline to 7.41% (57.5 mmol/mol) at week 26 with efsitora and from 7.94% (63.3 mmol/mol) at baseline to 7.36% (56.9 mmol/mol) at week 26 with degludec. Mean HbA 1c change from baseline to week 26 was -0.51% with efsitora and -0.56% with degludec (estimated treatment difference 0.052%, 95% CI -0.077 to 0.181; p = 0.43), confirming a non-inferiority margin of 0.4% for efsitora compared with degludec. Rates of combined level 2 (< 54 mg/dL [3.0 mmol/L]) or level 3 severe hypoglycaemia were higher with efsitora compared with degludec (14.03 vs 11.59 events per patient year of exposure; estimated rate ratio 1.21, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.41; p = 0.016) during weeks 0–52, with the highest rates during weeks 0–12. Severe hypoglycaemia incidence was higher with efsitora (35 [10%] of 343) versus degludec (11 [3%] of 349) during weeks 0–52. Overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar across treatment groups. One death not related to the study treatment occurred in the degludec group.

Interpretation

In adults with type 1 diabetes, once-weekly efsitora showed non-inferior HbA 1c reduction compared with daily insulin degludec. Higher rates of combined level 2 or level 3 hypoglycaemia and greater incidence of severe hypoglycaemia in participants treated with efsitora compared with participants treated with degludec might suggest the need for additional evaluation of efsitora dose initiation and optimisation in people with type 1 diabetes.

### Once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa versus once-daily insulin degludec in adults with type 2 diabetes currently treated with basal insulin (QWINT-3): a phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^113YEXBU]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa (efsitora) is in development for the treatment of people with diabetes. The aim of the current study was to assess the efficacy and safety of once-weekly efsitora compared with daily insulin degludec (degludec) in adults with type 2 diabetes using basal insulin.

Methods

This randomised, 78-week, phase 3, parallel-design, open-label, treat-to-target, non-inferiority study (QWINT-3) was conducted at 127 sites across nine countries. Adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with type 2 diabetes currently treated with basal insulin, up to three non-insulin glucose-lowering medications without prandial insulin, and glycated haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) 6.5–10.0% (48–86 mmol/mol) were eligible. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive efsitora (n = 655) or degludec (n = 331). The primary endpoint was the change in least-squares mean HbA 1c concentration from baseline to week 26, assessed in all randomly allocated participants who took at least one dose of study drug (excluding those who discontinued due to inadvertent enrolment), with a non-inferiority margin of 0.4% for efsitora versus degludec. The completed trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05275400).

Findings

Between March 8, 2022, and May 15, 2024, 1229 participants were enrolled and 986 (80%) were randomly allocated: 655 to the efsitora group and 331 to the degludec group, all of whom received at least one dose of study treatment. 871 (88%) of those randomly allocated completed 78 weeks of treatment. The population comprised 431 (44%) female and 555 (56%) male patients, median age was 62.0 years (IQR 54.0–68.0), baseline BMI was 29.65 kg/m 2 (IQR 26.32–34.12), and HbA 1c concentration was 7.7% (7.1–8.4). The least-squares mean change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1c concentration was -0.81 percentage points (SE 0.03; -8.85 mmol/mol [0.33]) in the efsitora group and -0.72 percentage points (0.04; -7.88 mmol/mol [0.46]) in the degludec group (estimated treatment difference -0.09 percentage points [95% CI -0.19 to 0.01]), indicating non-inferiority of efsitora to degludec. Combined level 2 hypoglycaemia (glucose concentration < 54 mg/dL [< 3.0 mmol/L]) or level 3 (severe) hypoglycaemia events from baseline to week 78 occurred at a similar rate for efsitora (0.84 events per patient-year of exposure; 754 events in 268 [41%] participants) and degludec (0.74 per patient-year of exposure; 346 events in 123 [37%] participants; estimated rate ratio 1.14 [95% CI 0.83–1.56]; p = 0.43). Serious adverse events occurred in 103 (16%; 7 [1%] related to treatment) efsitora-treated and 37 (11%; 1 [< 1%] related to treatment) degludec-treated participants; the most frequent (at ∼1%) were primarily cardiovascular-related in both groups. Nine deaths (seven in the efsitora group and two in the degludec group) occurred during the trial, but none were related to study treatment.

Interpretation

Efsitora is a well tolerated and efficacious once-weekly alternative to daily basal insulin, with a reduced injection frequency, for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

Study Design

This was a single-site (Profil, Neuss, Germany), phase 1, exploratory, open-label, two-period, fixed-sequence, multiple-dose study (Supplemental Fig. 1). The study consisted of four study periods: a screening and run-in period, a glargine U100 treatment period, an efsitora treatment period, and a safety follow-up.

During the glargine and efsitora treatment periods, there were three hypoglycemia provocation periods: a 24-h prolonged fast, a 24-h prolonged fast and exercise, and following a double dose. The trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04957914).

The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the North Rhine Medical Association (protocol reference number: 202051). All participants provided written informed consent prior to participation.

Study Population

Eligible participants included adults (18–70 years) with T2D on a stable regimen of daily basal insulin (NPH insulin, glargine U100 or U300, insulin detemir, or degludec) with or without metformin, dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, or glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists for at least 3 months. Participants had a BMI between 18.5 and 40 kg/m 2 and HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5 and ≤ 9.5% and had not experienced any episodes of severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia unawareness in the 6 months prior to screening.

### Insulin efsitora versus degludec in type 2 diabetes without previous insulin treatment [^112UrSPF]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study QWINT-2 was published by Carol Wysham and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the QWINT-2 study, the trial question was: is insulin efsitora noninferior to insulin degludec in patients with T2DM without previous insulin treatment? In the QWINT-2 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the QWINT-2 study, the population was: 928 patients (382 female, 546 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with T2DM who had not previously received insulin. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM, latent autoimmune diabetes, or specific type of diabetes other than T2DM; history of > 1 episode of ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar state or coma requiring hospitalization in the past 6 months; severe hypoglycemia episodes in the past 6 months; hemoglobin abnormalities. In the QWINT-2 study, the interventions were: n = 466 insulin efsitora (insulin efsitora alfa SC once weekly) n = 462 insulin degludec (insulin degludec SC once daily). In the QWINT-2 study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in reduction in mean glycated hemoglobin level at week 52 (1.26% vs. 1.17%; MD 0.09, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.22). In the QWINT-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the rate of time the glucose level was within the target range in week 48 through 52 (64.3% vs. 61.2%; AD 3.1%, 95% CI 0.1 to 6.1) No significant difference in reduction in mean glycated hemoglobin level at week 52 in patients using GLP-1 receptor agonists (1.26% vs. 1.19%; MD 0.06, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.26) No significant difference in reduction in mean glycated hemoglobin level at week 52 in patients not using GLP-1 receptor agonists (1.26% vs. 1.15%; MD 0.11, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.28). In the QWINT-2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in combined clinically significant or severe hypoglycemia, adverse events. In the QWINT-2 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with T2DM who had not previously received insulin, insulin efsitora was noninferior to insulin degludec with respect to reduction in mean glycated hemoglobin level at week 52.

### Insulin degludec [^117CykdM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Study F: Insulin Degludec Administered at the Same Time Each Day in Insulin Naïve Adult Patients as an Add-on to One or More of the Following Oral Agents: Metformin, Sulfonylurea, Glinides or Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors

The efficacy of Insulin Degludec was evaluated in a 26-week randomized, open-label, multicenter trial in Asia in 435 insulin naïve patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on one or more oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) at baseline. Patients were randomized to Insulin Degludec once-daily in the evening or insulin glargine U-100 once-daily according to the approved labeling. Pre-trial oral antidiabetes agents were continued as background therapy except for DPP-4 inhibitors or thiazolidinediones in both treatment arms.

The mean age of the trial population was 59 years and mean duration of diabetes was 12 years. 54% were male. All patients were Asian. 11% of patients had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2. The mean BMI was approximately 25.0 kg/m2.

At week 26, the difference in HbA1creduction from baseline between Insulin Degludec and insulin glargine U-100 was 0.11% with a 95% confidence interval of [-0.03%; 0.24%] and met the pre-specified non-inferiority margin (0.4%). See Table 11.

### Once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa versus once daily insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114b7Prn]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

We conducted this systematic review and meta‐analysis using the guidelines established by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis (PRISMA). The study was registered in the PROSPERO database: CRD420251130055. Because only previously published, de‐identified data were used, ethical approval was not required for this study.

2.1 Data Sources and Search Strategy

An independent search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library was carried out by two independent reviewers (EZ and MA) to include studies from their inception through July 2025. The full search strategies are provided in Table S1. In order to ensure all relevant studies were included, the reference lists of pertinent articles, including previous systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, were also screened manually to identify any additional eligible studies not retrieved through the electronic search.

2.2 Study Selection and Eligibility Criteria

Following the literature search, all studies were imported to Rayyan (accessed on 31 July 2025). Duplicates were identified and removed. The remaining articles were reviewed independently by two authors (HM and TSH), based on their titles and abstracts, with further full‐text reviews. Any conflicts were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (EZ).

The studies were eligible for our systematic review and meta‐analysis if they: (1) were RCTs; (2) included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); (3) had adult male or female participants who were at least 18 years old; (4) evaluated weekly efsitora alfa; and (5) compared weekly efsitora against daily insulin (degludec or glargine).

We excluded studies if they: (1) involved patients with type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes, or secondary forms of diabetes; (2) enrolled individuals who had undergone metabolic surgery or had severe comorbid conditions; (3) had non‐randomised designs such as retrospective studies, pooled analyses, case reports, conference abstracts, or letters to the editor; and (4) preclinical studies or trials conducted in animals or healthy human participants.

### A comparative effectiveness study of degludec and insulin glargine 300 U / mL in insulin-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes [^112raGcU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The present real‐world study of insulin‐naïve patients with T2D has demonstrated that patients initiating basal insulin treatment with degludec have significantly improved HbA1c; the magnitude of reduction as compared to that with glargine U300 [−0.27%] is close to the clinically significant reduction of 0.3%. They also have larger reductions in rates of hypoglycaemia and likelihood of hypoglycaemia, and a lower risk of treatment discontinuation compared with those initiating treatment with glargine U300. These data are consistent with previous observations from a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study of degludec and glargine U300 that identified the potential of degludec to result in a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and a relatively higher dose potency compared with glargine U300. 22

Given the differences in the rates of hypoglycaemia between degludec and glargine U300 treatment, it might be anticipated that this may lead to changes in prescribing, as there was a shift previously towards the use of the longer‐acting insulins (glargine U100 and IDet) 28 that had lower rates of hypoglycaemia compared with their predecessors. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Such a prediction is further supported by our finding that patients treated with degludec were less likely to discontinue treatment than were patients treated with glargine U300 and, furthermore, were less likely to switch to the other treatment if discontinuing, suggesting a greater likelihood of clinical success with degludec vs glargine U300.

### The efficacy and safety of insulin degludec given in variable once-daily dosing intervals compared with insulin glargine and insulin degludec dosed at the same time daily: a 26-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, Treat-to-target trial in individuals with type 2 diabetes [^111EPDFU]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 366 million people have diabetes worldwide, with type 2 diabetes accounting for > 90% of all cases. Insulin therapy remains the most efficacious glucose-lowering treatment option for type 2 diabetes when lifestyle modifications and metformin fail to achieve recommended glycemic targets.

Based on their pharmacodynamic action profiles, NPH insulin and current basal insulin analogs are injected at the same time each day to ensure optimal biological action and consistent glycemic response. Strict dosing schedules required for current insulin products might be difficult to maintain, which may affect glycemic control. On average, adherence to insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes is low (∼70%). Although this is a clearly recognized issue for patients using prandial insulin coverage, it is also a relevant issue for those administering basal insulin. A recent study showed that ∼50% of patients with type 2 diabetes had intentionally missed a basal insulin injection, with 22% reporting that they had missed a dose in the previous 30 days (mean of three doses) and 24% reporting that they had mistimed an injection by > 2 h (mean of 4.2 occasions) in the last month. One reason for insulin omission/nonadherence cited frequently by patients is that injections interfere with daily activities. Accordingly, an insulin preparation that allows a more flexible dosing schedule, while maintaining consistent glycemic effects, might benefit patients requiring exogenous insulin replacement.

Mean percentage of time spent in normoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia for patients treated with insulin degludec or efsitora in the multiple-dose study. Mean percentage of time spent over a 24-h period in normoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia in the multiple-dose study. Continuous glucose monitoring was initiated at visit 6 (week 1) in the lead-in period and continued up to visit 15 (week 7) during the follow-up period

The safety analyses included all 28 patients enrolled in the study. There were no clinically significant events, serious adverse events, deaths, or withdrawals due to adverse events. No injection site reactions or hypersensitivity reactions were reported (Supplementary Material Table S1). Overall, the safety profile of efsitora was similar to that of insulin degludec. The frequency of adverse events was low; 20.0% (n = 2) of patients who received insulin degludec reported two TEAEs and 22.2% (n = 4) of patients receiving efsitora reported six TEAEs. All TEAEs were mild in severity. One TEAE of hepatic function abnormality was judged by the investigator to be related to insulin degludec, and there were no TEAEs considered related to treatment with efsitora. Overall, 20.0% (n = 2) of patients in the insulin degludec cohort and 33.3% (n = 6) in the efsitora cohort reported a hypoglycemic event, of which the majority were asymptomatic (21.4%, n = 6). There were no cases of severe hypoglycemia.

In conclusion, this comparative effectiveness study of insulin‐naïve patients with T2D has demonstrated that treatment with degludec results in significantly larger reductions in HbA1c, with a 30% lower risk of hypoglycaemia and reduced likelihood of treatment discontinuation as compared to treatment with glargine U300.

### Clinical perspectives on the frequency of hypoglycemia in Treat-to-target randomized controlled trials comparing basal insulin analogs in type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^115Byx5A]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Hypoglycemia risk is driven by a complex interplay of factors such as the use of concomitant sulfonylureas, strictness of insulin titration regimensand glucose-lowering efficacy, plus the strength of counter-regulatory responses which are impaired in many individuals with diabetes. However, in this review, sulfonylurea usage, EOT insulin dose and the glucose-lowering efficacy of the insulins did not show consistent effects on overall hypoglycemia. Given the association between sulfonylurea usage and hypoglycemia, it was surprising that a clearer trend between the two was not seen; however, differences in other variables in the trial designs/methodologies may have had a confounding effect.

Concerns regarding greater frequency of hypoglycemia with once-weekly insulin use (icodec and efsitora) may be assuaged by contextualizing emerging once-weekly insulin data from SMBG and CGM analyses with observed hypoglycemia rates with first-generation and second-generation basal insulin analogs. Findings from this narrative review suggest that level 2 and level 3 hypoglycemia rates reported for icodec were below (in ONWARDS 1, 3, 2 and 5) or within (in ONWARDS 4) the rate ranges from basal-only (in insulin-naive and basal insulin-experienced) trials and basal-bolus insulin trials for daily-administered basal insulin analogs, respectively. Based on phase 2 data, level 2 hypoglycemia rates with efsitora were also lower than that observed with daily basal insulin analogs; however, as the phase 3 program will investigate a different titration algorithm and formulation, it remains to be seen whether these results will be replicated.

### Insulin degludec versus insulin glargine in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes: a 1-year, randomized, Treat-to-target trial (BEGIN once long) [^114v7Wdj]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and its associated complications pose a significant global health care and economic burden. The landmark U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study demonstrated the benefits of improved glucose control and highlighted the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes as a result of β-cell failure. Approximately 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes may require insulin therapy in addition to oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) within 6 years of diabetes diagnosis. Clinical guidelines by the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes currently recommend initiating basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes either directly after metformin or after maximizing a combination of OADs with or without glucagonlike peptide-1 receptor agonists and then titrating insulin to meet a glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) target of 7% without significant hypoglycemia.

Several barriers to introducing insulin have been identified that may result in delayed achievement of glycemic control and progression of diabetes complications. These barriers include patients' fear of injections and misconceptions about insulin therapy, clinicians' fear of perceived complexity of insulin regimens, and both parties' fear that introducing insulin will negatively affect patient lifestyle and weight gain. Additionally, the risk, consequences, and fear of hypoglycemia remain a significant limiting factor in intensifying insulin therapy and optimizing glycemic control.

Long-acting insulin analogs have been developed to produce a more physiological basal insulin action than seen with such human insulin preparations as neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, and they are associated with lower hypoglycemia rates (particularly nocturnal) while achieving similar glycemic control. These analogs have lowered the barrier for insulin introduction in patients with type 2 diabetes and are recommended when OADs alone cannot maintain glucose control. There is still a need, however, for the development of basal insulins with improved pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with the goal of achieving glycemic targets in more patients with even less hypoglycemic risk. Insulin degludec is a novel, ultra-long-acting basal insulin. On subcutaneous injection, degludec forms a depot of soluble multihexamers that dissociates slowly and consistently, resulting in a flat, stable profile and a duration of action longer than 42 h. A previous phase 2 clinical trial comparing once daily degludec with glargine in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes and two phase 3 studies comparing once daily degludec with glargine in basal-bolus therapy in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes demonstrated that degludec provides similar glycemic control with less hypoglycemia than glargine.

### Comparison of insulin degludec with insulin glargine in insulin-naive subjects with type 2 diabetes: a 2-year randomized, Treat-to-target trial [^112twnP3]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

The BEGIN Once Long study design has been previously described. The core trial was a 52-week randomized, controlled, parallel-group, open-label, multinational, treat-to-target, non-inferiority trial in which 1030 insulin-naive patients with Type 2 diabetes, inadequately controlled with oral anti-diabetic drugs, were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to treatment with once-daily insulin degludec or once-daily insulin glargine, respectively. The insulin was administered subcutaneously in combination with metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor (use of the latter was dependent on country-specific approved labelling that allowed combining the DPP-4 inhibitor with insulin). Subjects who completed the 52-week core trial and provided informed consent entered the 52-week extension trial maintaining prior randomization. The extension trial was conducted between 9 September 2010 and 20 December 2011 in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinkiand Good Clinical Practice. Protocols were approved by independent ethics committees/institutional review boards prior to the trials.

What's new?

Insulin degludec, a basal insulin analogue, uses a novel protraction mechanism, resulting in a flat, stable profile and a duration of action greater than 42 h.
Consistent with its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile, insulin degludec in combination with oral anti-diabetic drugs provided long-term glycaemic control similar to insulin glargine with a lower risk for nocturnal hypoglycaemia in insulin-naive patients with Type 2 diabetes, in a 1-year, randomized study.
This extension study reports 2-year data, confirming that insulin degludec in combination with oral anti-diabetic drugs maintains stable glycaemic control with a sustained benefit in reducing hypoglycaemic risk in Type 2 diabetes.

Insulin degludec was administered once daily with the main evening meal and glargine was administered once daily at the same time every day, as chosen by patient and investigator, as per approved labelling. In the core trial, the starting dose for both insulins was 10 Units. Basal insulin was titrated to target pre-breakfast plasma glucose of 3.9–4.9 mmol/l based on the mean of pre-breakfast self-monitored blood glucose values of the preceding two or three consecutive days. The initial insulin dose in the extension trial was to be the same as the dose at end of treatment of the core trial, but could be adjusted at investigator discretion.

### Effects of insulin degludec vs glargine U100 on hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM… [^112LF5J3]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

confirmed hypoglycemia were 17% and 32% lower, respectively, with insulin degludec than with insulin glargine U100. 15 The SWITCH 2 trial was designed to test this hypoglycemia benefit with insulin degludec, using a double-blind, crossover trial design among basal insulin–treated patients with T2D who had at least 1 risk factor for hypoglycemia. At the end of treatment period 1, the observed mean fasting plasma glucose level decreased in the group treated with insulin degludec followed by insulin glargine U100 from 139. 2 mg/dL at baseline to
107. 3 mg/dL, with a slight increase when switched to insulin glargine U100 in treatment period 2. A decrease in the mean fasting plasma glucose level was also observed in treatment period 1 of the group treated with insulin glargine U100 followed by insulin degludec, from
134. 9 mg/dL at baseline to 107. 0 mg/dL, which was maintained when switched to insulin degludec in treatment period
2. In this double-blind, randomized, treat-to-target crossover trial, treatment with insulin degludec compared with insulin glargine U100 resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful20 reduction in the rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia and nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia during the 16-week maintenance period. The hypoglycemia findings were consistent when analyzed over the full treatment period, and they showed a statistically significantly lower rate of severe hypoglycemia with insulin degludec. Overall, the hypoglycemia results achieved in this trial confirm those from the randomized, parallel, open-label, treat-to-target trials in the phase 3a program for insulin degludec compared with insulin glargine U100.

12–15 In the current trial and the phase 3a trials, insulin degludec and insulin glargine U100 were titrated to the same fasting blood glucose target and reached an equivalent, noninferior HbA1c level.

### Insulin glargine versus insulin degludec in patients failing on oral therapy in type 2 diabetes: a retrospective real world comparative data from India [^113eVX5L]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the changes in various glycemic parameters in insulin-naïve type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients who were initiated on insulin glargine or insulin degludec in a real world setting.

Methods

Retrospective data were analyzed in consecutive type 2 DM patients in a real world setting, who failed oral therapy (at least 2 oral anti-diabetic drugs) and were initiated with either insulin glargine or insulin degludec. The parameters assessed were the changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, body weight, dose of Insulin and the total number of patient reported hypoglycemic episodes up to 6 months after initiation.

Result

At baseline, insulin glargine and insulin degludec groups were similar in terms of gender, age, weight, HbA1c and duration of diabetes. After 6 months follow up the change in HbA1c (-1.09 versus -1.45 P = 0.124), change in FPG (-72.81mg/dl [-4mmol/L] versus -75.88mg/dl [-4.2mmol/L] P = 0.755), and the change in body weight (+1.65 versus +0.85 P = 0.082) were similar in glargine and degludec groups, respectively. Patients in insulin degludec group experienced significantly lesser patient reported hypoglycemic episodes (12 versus 40) and required significantly lesser dose (25.68Units versus 18.61Units per day; P = 0.002) compared to insulin glargine. 41% of the patients reached HbA1C target of ≤ 7% with insulin glargine compared to 69% with insulin degludec within the specified time period.

Conclusion

Results from this real world analysis suggest that among type 2 DM patients who were initiated on insulin degludec as compared to insulin glargine may be associated with significantly lesser patient reported hypoglycemic episodes and lesser dose of insulin while achieving similar glycemic control. This study is however limited by the retrospective nature of the data collection.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes [^112Aai4F]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

The phase 1, multiple-dose study was open-label, active-controlled, and conducted at multiple sites and examined once-weekly individualized doses of efsitora in Japanese patients with T2D. Patients on a stable basal insulin, with or without the use of antihyperglycemic medications, were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to efsitora or insulin degludec. Patients on a stable basal insulin were selected to allow for transition to a novel basal insulin. Insulin-naïve patients require time to titrate to their individual dose and would have required a long lead-in period. The randomization was stratified by baseline HbA1c (< 8.5% or ≥ 8.5%), and assignment to treatment groups was determined via a computer-generated random sequence using an interactive web-response system. The study consisted of four periods: screening (1 week), lead-in (5 weeks), treatment (6 weeks), and safety follow-up (7 weeks). The study design is outlined in Supplementary Material Figure S1 b. During the lead-in period, patients continued using insulin degludec or transferred to insulin degludec if they had been using insulin glargine and were transitioned to once-daily morning dosing. Insulin degludec was titrated during the study lead-in period using a titration algorithm (until the target fasting glucose range of 100–139 mg/dl was reached for each patient by the end of the lead-in period). Patients were transitioned to efsitora using a one-time loading dose for the first week and a weekly dose (from weeks 2–6) based on the daily basal insulin degludec dose administered prior to randomization. The loading dose was based on the patient's HbA1c level (twice their weekly dose if HbA1c was < 8.5% or thrice their weekly dose if HbA1c was ≥ 8.5%, or an individualized fixed daily dose of insulin degludec for the 6-week treatment period). Patients received their pre-study basal insulin during the follow-up period. Included patients were Japanese and aged between 20 and 74 years who were diagnosed with T2D at least 1 year prior to study enrolment. Enrolled patients had a baseline HbA1c ≥ 6.5% and ≤ 10.0%, BMI of > 18.5 and ≤ 40.0 kg/m 2 at screening, and had received a stable daily dose of basal insulin (either insulin glargine U-100 or U-300 or insulin degludec U-100) with or without a stable dose of OAMs (metformin, sulfonylureas and glinides, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, α-glucosidase inhibitors, and/or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists) for at least 1 month prior to screening.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes [^116RFjER]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Procedures

Two trials are included in this report. The phase 1, single-dose, dose-escalation study was conducted at multiple sites and examined once-weekly efsitora administration in Japanese patients with T2D. The study included three patient cohorts. For cohorts 1 and 2, patients were randomized to a treatment by unblinded pharmacists using a randomization table to receive a single dose of efsitora (5 mg for cohort 1 and 10 mg for cohort 2) or placebo under double-blind conditions, while patients in cohort 3 received a single dose of efsitora (20 mg) under open-label conditions. The efsitora doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg are equivalent to 175, 350, and 700 units of efsitora administered weekly, and approximately equivalent to 25, 50, and 100 units of daily insulin dose. Insulin-naïve patients with T2D were selected for cohorts 1 and 2 over healthy subjects to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Patients with T2D on a stable dose of basal insulin were selected for the open-label cohort 3 by excluding patients who are relatively sensitive to insulin. Patients in cohort 3 were administered efsitora only to avoid the risk of hyperglycemia.

### Comparison of insulin degludec with insulin glargine in insulin-naive subjects with type 2 diabetes: a 2-year randomized, Treat-to-target trial [^111DCzcu]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of this study was to compare long-term safety and efficacy of the basal insulin analogue degludec with glargine in insulin-naive subjects with Type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This open-label trial included a 52-week core period followed by a 52-week extension. Participants were randomized 3:1 to once-daily degludec or glargine, administered with metformin ± dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Basal insulin was titrated to target pre-breakfast plasma glucose 3.9–4.9 mmol/l.

Results

At end of treatment (104 weeks), mean HbA1c reductions were similar for degludec and glargine; estimated treatment difference between degludec and glargine was 1 mmol/mol (95% CI -1 to 3) [0.07% (95% CI -0.07 to 0.22)], P = 0.339 in the extension trial set (degludec 551, glargine 174), comprising subjects who completed core trial and continued into the extension trial. Overall confirmed hypoglycaemia rates (1.72 vs. 2.05 episodes/patient-year), rates of adverse events possibly or probably related to trial product (0.19 events/patient-year), weight gain (2.7 vs. 2.4 kg) and mean daily insulin doses (0.63 U/kg) were similar between treatments in the safety analysis set (degludec 766, glargine 257) comprising all treated subjects. Rates of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia (0.27 vs. 0.46 episodes/patient-year; P = 0.002) and severe hypoglycaemia (0.006 vs. 0.021 episodes/patient-year, P = 0.023) were significantly lower with degludec for the safety analysis set (analysis based on intention-to-treat full analysis set comprising all randomized subjects).

Conclusions

In Type 2 diabetes, insulin degludec in combination with oral anti-diabetic drugs, safely and effectively improves long-term glycaemic control, with a significantly lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia as compared with glargine.

### Comparison of insulin degludec with insulin glargine in insulin-naive subjects with type 2 diabetes: a 2-year randomized, Treat-to-target trial [^115yHAcj]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Insulin degludec, a new basal insulin analogue with an ultra-long duration of action, was compared with glargine in a 52-week, randomized, treat-to-target study (BEGIN Once Long) in insulin-naive participants with Type 2 diabetes, inadequately controlled with oral anti-diabetic drugs. Administration of degludec or glargine once daily in combination with oral anti-diabetic drugs [with all participants using metformin and < 2% using dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors at end of treatment] provided similar improvements in glycaemic control, with a lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia with degludec. The objective of the extension study reported here was to compare the long-term safety and tolerability of degludec with glargine for 104 weeks of treatment.

### A comparative effectiveness study of degludec and insulin glargine 300 U / mL in insulin-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes [^114Lshc6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The two most recently developed basal insulins, insulin degludec (degludec) and insulin glargine 300 units/mL (glargine U300) are longer acting than first‐generation basal insulin analogues (glargine 100 units/mL [glargine U100] and insulin detemir [IDet]), and these longer acting insulins have been proven to lower the risk of hypoglycaemia further still. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Despite results from both the DELIVER D+ study 19 and the BRIGHT randomized controlled trial (RCT) 20 comparing use of degludec with glargine U300, there is presently no evidence from real‐world clinical practice with insulin‐naïve patients that indicates a clinical advantage of degludec vs glargine U300, or vice versa. This situation, insulin‐naïve patients for whom real‐world data are missing, is a gap that should be bridged. Compared with RCTs, real‐world studies allow investigation of the comparative effectiveness of these insulins that is not confounded by trial protocols that fail to mirror real‐world practices (eg, titration algorithms). Furthermore, an insulin‐naïve population permits comparison without the additional confounding of prior experience with these insulins (ie, incident user design). 21 Prior to publication of the DELIVER D+ 19 and BRIGHT 20 studies, it was anticipated that use of degludec would result in lower rates of hypoglycaemia than use of glargine U300, as is the case in comparisons of degludec with insulin glargine U100. This assumption was based on the pharmacodynamic evidence that degludec has a lower day‐to‐day and within‐day variability of glucose‐lowering effect than glargine U300, which may enable tighter glycaemic control with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. 22 However, in the DELIVER D+ 19 and BRIGHT 20 studies, no differences were found in rate of hypoglycaemia between degludec and glargine U300. Considering the methodological limitations of these studies, as outlined above, the potential to exploit the higher potency of degludec as compared to glargine U300, resulting in lower fasting plasma glucose and elevation of hypoglycemia rates, 20 and considering the lack of a real‐world study in insulin‐naïve patients, further investigations are warranted. The aim of the CONFIRM (Clinical Outcome assessmeNt of the eFfectiveness of Insulin degludec in Real‐life Medical practice) study was to investigate the comparative effectiveness, using real‐world data, of degludec vs glargine U300 in insulin‐naïve adults with T2D in routine clinical practice in the USA.

### Twice-daily insulin degludec / insulin aspart provides superior fasting plasma glucose control and a reduced rate of hypoglycaemia compared with biphasic insulin aspart 30 in insulin-naïve adults with type 2 diabetes [^1115UjGr]. Diabetic Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of twice-daily insulin degludec/insulin aspart vs. twice-daily biphasic insulin aspart 30 in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who were naïve to insulin.

Methods

In this 26-week, multinational, open-label, controlled, two-arm, parallel-group, treat-to-target trial, participants [mean (± sd) age 58.9 (± 8.9) years, duration of diabetes 9.5 (± 5.9) years, HbA1c 68 (± 8.7) mmol/mol or 8.4 (± 0.8)% and BMI 31.2 (± 4.2) kg/m(2)) were randomized (1:1) to insulin degludec/insulin aspart (n = 197) or biphasic insulin aspart 30 (n = 197), administered with breakfast and the main evening meal, titrated to a self-monitored plasma glucose target > 3.9 and ≤ 5.0 mmol/l.

Results

The mean HbA1c was reduced to 49 mmol/mol (6.6%) with insulin degludec/insulin aspart and 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) with biphasic insulin aspart 30. Insulin degludec/insulin aspart achieved the prespecified non-inferiority margin (estimated treatment difference 0.02%; 95% CI -0.12, 0.17). Insulin degludec/insulin aspart was superior in lowering fasting plasma glucose (estimated treatment difference -1.00 mmol/l; 95% CI -1.4, -0.6; P < 0.001) and reducing overall and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia at a similar overall insulin dose compared with biphasic insulin aspart 30. Similar proportions of participants in each arm experienced severe hypoglycaemia. Adverse events were equally distributed.

Conclusions

Consistent with previous findings, insulin degludec/insulin aspart twice daily effectively improved long-term glycaemic control, with superior reductions in FPG, and significantly less overall and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia compared with biphasic insulin aspart 30 in people with Type 2 diabetes who were insulin-naïve.

### Safety and efficacy of insulin degludec / liraglutide (IDegLira) added to sulphonylurea alone or to sulphonylurea and metformin in insulin-naïve people with type 2 diabetes: the DUAL IV trial [^1146Jozy]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

What's new?

IDegLira is a combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide. Basal insulins and glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists have complementary effects in a Type 2 diabetes treatment regimen, with GLP‐1 receptor agonists also being insulin‐sparing.
Treatment guidelines often advocate discontinuing sulphonylureas on basal insulin initiation, but widespread concomitant use of these drugs continues in current clinical practice. It is therefore anticipated that many sulphonylurea‐treated people will have IDegLira added to their therapy, yet this combination has not previously been studied
This randomized controlled trial shows that IDegLira can be used in people uncontrolled with sulphonylureas ± metformin to improve efficacy with a favourable benefit–risk profile.

### Novel once-weekly basal insulin Fc achieved similar glycemic control with a safety profile comparable to insulin degludec in patients with type 1 diabetes [^116jYE4w]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Basal Insulin Fc (BIF; insulin efsitora alfa; LY3209590), a fusion protein combining a novel single-chain insulin variant with a human IgG Fc domain, is designed for once-weekly basal insulin administration. This phase 2 study assessed safety and efficacy of BIF versus degludec in 265 patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using multiple daily injections.

Research Design and Methods

During this randomized, parallel, open-label study, patients with T1D were randomized (1:1) to receive BIF once weekly or degludec once daily over the 26-week treatment period. Both groups were titrated to a fasting glucose level of 80–100 mg/dL. The primary end point was HbA1c change from baseline to week 26 (noninferiority margin, 0.4%). Secondary end points included percent time in range (TIR) (70–180 mg/dL), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) fasting glucose (FG) level, and rate of hypoglycemia.

Results

After 26 weeks, patients receiving BIF had noninferior HbA1c change from baseline versus those receiving degludec, with a statistically significant treatment difference of 0.17% (90% CI 0.01, 0.32; P = 0.07) favoring the comparator. Percent TIR was similar for patients in the BIF (56.1%) and degludec (58.9%; P = 0.112) groups at week 26. FG values were significantly higher for patients receiving BIF (158.8 mg/dL) versus degludec (143.2 mg/dL; P = 0.003). Rates of CGM-derived hypoglycemia were not statistically significantly different for BIF and degludec over 24 h for level 1 (P = 0.960) or level 2 (P = 0.517) hypoglycemia during the treatment period. Occurrence of serious adverse events was similar between the BIF and degludec groups.

Conclusions

Once-weekly BIF demonstrated noninferior glycemic control to once-daily degludec (treatment difference: 0.17% favoring degludec) and no difference in hypoglycemia or other safety findings in patients with T1D.

### Insulin degludec in people with type 2 diabetes in China: a non-interventional, retrospective chart review study (CN-TREAT) [^115Pdvm3]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insulin degludec (degludec) is an ultra-long-acting basal insulin analogue with a half-life of approximately 25 h and a duration of action at steady state greater than 42 h, exceeding its once-daily dosing interval. This results in a very stable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile that more closely mimics the physiological insulin profile, translating clinically into low within-day and day-to-day variability in blood glucose-lowering effect, compared with insulin glargine 100 units/mL (glargine U100) or insulin glargine 300 units/mL (glargine U300). The stable, protracted profile of degludec also enables flexible dosing, once daily at any time of the day, but preferably at the same time, with a minimum of 8 h between doses.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) have demonstrated equivalent levels of glycemic control with degludec compared to other basal insulin analogues, particularly glargine U100, accompanied by a reduced risk of hypoglycemia. RCTs in people with T2D have been carried out in insulin-naïve participants initiating degludec and in insulin-experienced participants switching from another basal insulin to degludec. Furthermore, results from a large, randomized cardiovascular outcomes trial (DEVOTE) demonstrated that degludec was non-inferior to glargine U100 with respect to the incidence of major cardiovascular events in people with T2D at high risk for cardiovascular events.

Degludec was approved in China for the treatment of adults with T2D in 2017 following results from a multinational, randomized, open-label, treat-to-target trial in insulin-naïve people with T2D (with a majority of Chinese participants). Results demonstrated a numerically lower risk for overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia with degludec than with glargine U100, with similar levels of glycemic control.

### Safety and efficacy of once-weekly basal insulin Fc in people with type 2 diabetes previously treated with basal insulin: a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 2 study [^111YVVZG]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Background

The burden of daily basal insulins often causes hesitancy and delays in the initiation of insulin therapy. Basal insulin Fc (BIF, insulin efsitora alfa), designed for once-weekly administration, is a fusion protein combining a novel single-chain insulin variant with a human immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc domain. In this study, we explored the safety and efficacy of BIF in people with type 2 diabetes who had been previously treated with basal insulin.

Methods

For this phase 2, 44-site (clinical research centres and hospitals), randomised, open-label, comparator-controlled, 32-week study in the USA, Puerto Rico, and Mexico, we enrolled participants with type 2 diabetes. Eligible participants had to be adults (aged ≥ 18 years) and to have been treated with basal insulin and up to three oral antidiabetic medicines. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to subcutaneous administration of BIF (BIF treatment group 1 [BIF-A1] or 2 [BIF-A2]) or insulin degludec. Randomisation was stratified by country, baseline HbA 1c values (< 8.5% or ≥ 8.5%; < 69.4 or ≥ 69.4 mmol/mol), use of sulfonylureas (yes or no), and baseline BMI (< 30 or ≥ 30 kg/m 2). The randomisation scheme was performed using an interactive web-response system, which ensured balance between treatment groups. Different fasting glucose targets for the BIF-A1 (≤ 7.8 mmol/L or ≤ 140 mg/dL; titrated every 2 weeks), BIF-A2 (≤ 6.7 mmol/L or ≤ 120 mg/dL; titrated every 4 weeks), and degludec (≤ 5.6 mmol/L or ≤ 100 mg/dL) groups were selected. Patients randomly assigned to BIF received a one-time loading dose ranging from 1.5–3 times their calculated weekly dose. The first weekly dose was administered 1 week after the loading dose. We used interstitial fasting glucose measurements from the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring system to titrate the basal insulin. The primary measure of glycaemic control was change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 32 for BIF. BIF was also compared with degludec (with a non-inferiority margin of 0.40%). The efficacy analysis set consisted of data from all randomised study participants who received at least one dose of the study medication and participants were analysed according to the treatment they were assigned. The safety population was the same as the efficacy analysis set. The completed trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03736785).

Findings

Between Nov 15, 2018 and Feb 18, 2020, 399 participants were enrolled and randomised to BIF-A1 (n = 135), BIF-A2 (n = 132), or degludec (n = 132); 202 (51%) were female and 197 (49%) were male. 379 were analysed for the primary outcome (BIF-A1: n = 130; BIF-A2: n = 125; degludec: n = 124). Mean HbA1c change from baseline to week 32, the primary outcome, was -0.6% (SE 0.1%) for BIF-A1 and BIF-A2. Degludec achieved a change from baseline of -0.7% (0.1%). The pooled BIF analysis achieved non-inferiority versus degludec for the treatment difference in HbA1c (0.1% [90% CI -0.1 to 0.3]). The hypoglycaemia (≤ 3.9 mmol/L or ≤ 70 mg/dL) event rates (hypoglycaemia events per patient per year) in the BIF groups were 25% lower than those in the degludec group (treatment ratio BIF-A1 vs degludec was 0.75 [0.61–0.93]; and BIF-A2 vs degludec was 0.74 [0.58–0.94]). BIF was well tolerated; treatment-emergent adverse events were similar across groups.

Interpretation

Weekly BIF achieved a similar efficacy compared with degludec despite higher fasting glucose targets in the BIF groups. Higher fasting glucose targets and lower glucose variability might have contributed to lower hypoglycaemia rates for BIF compared with degludec. These findings support continued development of BIF as a once-weekly insulin treatment for people with diabetes.

### A comparative effectiveness study of degludec and insulin glargine 300 U / mL in insulin-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes [^111DZNEA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The recently published results of the DELIVER D+ 19 and BRIGHT 20 trials challenge this hypothesis, as both found that, with equivalent glycaemic control, rates of hypoglycaemia were similar with degludec and glargine U300. However, while the BRIGHT study found no significant differences in rates of hypoglycaemia between degludec and glargine U300 treatment during the full study period of the trial, lower rates with glargine U300 were noted during the titration phase. It is difficult, however, to compare these results from the BRIGHT study with those of the present study, as it was not possible to extract information specifically during the titration period of the basal insulins compared in the CONFIRM study. In addition, despite the use of a similar insulin‐naïve population with T2D, the inclusion criteria of the BRIGHT study 20 make the results less generalizable to real‐world clinical practice in which the protocols on insulin initiation, frequency of follow‐up, treatment adherence and self‐management differ from those in RCTs. By contrast with the BRIGHT study, 20 the DELIVER D+ study was a real‐world study; however, the cohort was not insulin naïve as patients were switched from glargine U100 or IDet to glargine U300 or degludec and, therefore, the results may be subject to confounding. 19, 21

Despite these differences with the present study, data from both the DELIVER D+ 19 and the BRIGHT 20 studies suggest certain advantages of degludec vs glargine U300. The DELIVER D+ study, as with the present study, found that rates of discontinuation were higher in patients treated with glargine U300 as compared to those treated with degludec. 19 The BRIGHT study found that equivalent glycaemic control was possible with degludec, at a 20% lower dose than that of glargine U300. 20 These results may suggest that there are potential economic benefits with the use of degludec vs glargine U300; however, this must be explored further in additional studies, with different healthcare systems and patient populations, to support the limited data currently available. 29

Efficacy studies of efsitora (phase 3 - QWINT trials)

Based on the phase 2 study results, Ely Lilly has initiated a phase 3 program, entitled QWINT (Once Weekly Insulin Treatment). QWINT 1 to 4 are treat-to-target studies in people with T2D that will assess efficacy and safety of efsitora compared to a once-daily comparator (insulin degludec or glargine U100) in combination with noninsulin glucose-lowering medications. QWINT 1 compares a fixed dosing-escalation approach for once-weekly efsitora, with once-daily insulin glargine U100 as the comparator in insulin-naive patients. QWINT 2 is also studying an insulin-naive population, whereas QWINT 3 and 4 are in insulin-treated patients, the former in patients on basal insulin alone and the latter for those on basal-bolus therapy. The main data regarding QWINT trials are shown in Table 2.

Positive topline results were observed from the QWINT-1–4 phase 3 clinical trials evaluating once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa in adults with T2D using insulin for the first time and those who require multiple daily insulin injections. Efsitora showed non-inferior HbA1c reduction compared to the most used daily basal insulins globally. In QWINT-1, efsitora reduced HbA1c by 1.31% compared to 1.27% for insulin glargine, resulting in HbA1c levels of 6.92% and 6.96%, respectively. The safety profile of efsitora was similar insulin glargine, with a 40% lower rate of severe or clinically significant (blood glucose < 54 mg/dL) hypoglycemic events. In QWINT-3, efsitora reduced HbA1c by 0.86% compared to 0.75% for insulin degludec, resulting in HbA1c levels of 6.93% and 7.03%, respectively at week 26. Participants on efsitora or insulin degludec spent approximately two more hours per day in the target glucose range (70–180 mg/dL) compared to baseline. The safety profile of efsitora was comparable to insulin degludec, with similar rates of hypoglycemic events.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes [^113BPJpU]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who are not meeting the recommended target for glycemic control, treatment with basal insulin is recommended to prevent the onset and progression of diabetes-related complications. The use of basal insulin, either alone or in combination with oral medications or other non-insulin injectables, is a well-established approach that is effective for many individuals with T2D. However, there is often a delay in initiating insulin therapy due to reasons such as fear of the discomfort of needles and the frequency of injections and fear of complications and adverse effects. Studies have revealed reluctance in the use of injectable therapies among injection-naïve Japanese patients with T2D due to both patient and physician-related factors.

Once-weekly basal insulins are anticipated to be the next important advance in insulin therapy. The convenience of a once-weekly insulin could result in earlier adoption of insulin therapy. In addition, a once-weekly regimen may improve adherence and persistence to insulin therapy, leading to better real-world patient outcomes. A once-weekly insulin receptor agonist, insulin efsitora alfa (efsitora, basal insulin Fc, LY3209590), is currently under clinical development for treating patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and T2D. Efsitora comprises a novel single-chain analog of insulin fused to a human IgG2 Fc domain using a peptide linker. The Fc domain protects the molecule from degradation and contributes to a flat pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and long half-life of efsitora. Taken together, these factors support stable glycemia over the course of 1 week. At present, phase 2 clinical studies of efsitora have been completed, and once-weekly efsitora is in phase 3 clinical testing for treating T1D and T2D. In phase 2 trials of patients with T1D previously treated with multiple daily basal insulin injections and in insulin-naïve patients with T2D or those previously treated with basal insulin, weekly efsitora administration achieved similar efficacy compared with insulin degludec. To date, clinical studies support the development of efsitora as a once-weekly treatment option for people with diabetes.

### A comparative effectiveness study of degludec and insulin glargine 300 U / mL in insulin-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes [^113AEwLH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Inclusion of several sensitivity analyses also added to the robustness of the study by demonstrating that the results and conclusions of this study were consistent and independent of the methodology. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis in the present study supports the reported bioequivalence of degludec U100 and degludec U200 23 in real‐world clinical practice by demonstrating that, following 6 months of treatment, HbA1c was comparable in patients treated with either formulation, with both degludec U100 and degludec U200 resulting in lower HbA1c compared with glargine U300.

A limitation of the study is the short period of follow‐up. However, this duration corresponds to the period when the greatest changes in HbA1c occur, the first 90─180 days, 11 and it also corresponds to the commonly used follow‐up periods of many clinical trials. Another limitation of this study is that it utilized EMR data, and this approach has its own inherent limitations, misclassification and/or measurement errors, for example, 37 as compared to the more careful and frequent collection of clinical trial data, although trial data may also limit the generalizability of the cohort of patients investigated to the wider population of patients receiving treatment with basal insulin for T2D. Because of the limited data collected from EMRs, inclusion of baseline characteristics and comorbidities typically communicated in RCTs (eg, more details concerning comorbidities and smoking status) or included in studies investigating adherence (eg, socioeconomic and educational status) have not been possible and, therefore, propensity matching criteria were identified according to the data available for matching. Lastly, although a validated coding algorithm was used to improve identification of hypoglycaemia, 38 as in other observational studies, hypoglycaemia may still have been under‐reported in the present study. Interpretation of insulin dose data is also limited by the fact that dose information was available only for a subset of patients, and that reported basal insulin doses reflect doses prescribed by the PCP and may not correspond to what was actually taken by patients. In addition, the last available dose within 180 days in the EMR data was used as the basal insulin dose during follow‐up, to be consistent with the primary endpoint of HbA1c. Therefore, despite relatively high HbA1c and BMI at baseline, only the last available dose during the follow‐up period was evaluated and compared between degludec and glargine U300.

### Superior efficacy with a fixed-ratio combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide (IDegLira) compared with insulin degludec and liraglutide in insulin-naïve Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes in a phase 3, open-label, randomized trial [^115qckDW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To investigate the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) compared with its individual components in Japanese people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) uncontrolled on an oral antidiabetic drug (OAD).

Materials and Methods

This 52-week, open-label, multicentre, treat-to-target trial randomized participants (n = 819) 1:1:1 to IDegLira, liraglutide 1.8 mg or degludec, as add-on to their pre-trial OAD. The maximum IDegLira dose was 50 dose steps (50U degludec/1.8 mg liraglutide), there was no maximum dose for degludec, and both were titrated based on individual blood glucose measurements.

Results

After 52weeks, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) decreased by 26mmol/mol with IDegLira vs 20mmol/mol with degludec and liraglutide: estimated treatment differences were -6.91mmol/mol (95% confidence interval [CI] -8.18; -5.64) and -5.30mmol/mol (95% CI -6.58; -4.03), confirming non-inferiority of IDegLira to degludec and superiority of IDegLira to liraglutide (P < .0001 for both [primary endpoint]). Mean body weight changes were 2.9 kg, 4.1 kg and -1.0 kg with IDegLira, degludec and liraglutide, respectively, showing superiority of IDegLira versus degludec (P = 0.0001), but a significant difference in favour of liraglutide (P < .0001). Rates of severe or blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycaemia for IDegLira were lower versus degludec (rate ratio 0.48 [95% CI 0.35; 0.68]; P < .0001), but higher versus liraglutide (rate ratio 37.58 [95% CI 19.80; 71.31]; P < .0001). Mean daily total insulin dose was lower with IDegLira (27.7 U) versus degludec (34.8 U; P < .0001). Overall adverse event (AE) rates were similar. In total, 34.9%, 22.9% and 41.8% of IDegLira-, degludec- and liraglutide-treated participants experienced gastrointestinal AEs.

Conclusion

IDegLira was superior to degludec and liraglutide in terms of HbA1c reduction and superior to degludec in terms of body weight change and rates of hypoglycaemia in Japanese people with T2D.

### Once-weekly insulin icodec vs once-daily insulin degludec in adults with insulin-naive type 2 diabetes: the ONWARDS 3 randomized clinical trial [^113nb3jJ]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study ONWARDS 3 was published by Ildiko Lingvay and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the ONWARDS 3 study, the trial question was: what is the role of once-weekly insulin icodec in adult patients with insulin-naïve T2DM? In the ONWARDS 3 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ONWARDS 3 study, the population was: 588 patients (219 female, 369 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with T2DM treated with any noninsulin glucose-lowering agents with HbA1c of 7–11%. The key exclusion criteria were any episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis within 90 days prior to the day of screening; uncontrolled/unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy; myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris, or TIA within 180 days prior to the day of screening. In the ONWARDS 3 study, the interventions were: n = 294 icodec (once-weekly icodec and once-daily placebo via subcutaneous injections) n = 294 degludec (once-daily degludec and once-weekly placebo via subcutaneous injections). In the ONWARDS 3 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in HbA1c level at week 26 (1.6% vs. 1.4%; AD 0.2%, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.3). In the ONWARDS 3 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in reduction in fasting plasma glucose at week 26 (54 mg/dL vs. 54 mg/dL;) No significant difference in mean insulin dose from week 24 to 26 (204 U/week vs. 187 U/week; RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.22) No significant difference in improvement in mean body weight (2.8 kg vs. 2.3 kg; AD 0.46 kg, 95% CI -0.19 to 1.1). In the ONWARDS 3 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in combined level 2 or level 3 hypoglycemic episodes at week 31. significant difference in combined level 2 or level 3 hypoglycemic episodes at week 26 (0.35 per patient-year exposure vs. 0.12 per patient-year exposure). In the ONWARDS 3 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with T2DM treated with any noninsulin glucose-lowering agents with HbA1c of 7–11%, icodec was superior to degludec with respect to reduction in HbA1c level at week 26.

### Switching to once-weekly insulin icodec versus once-daily insulin degludec in individuals with basal insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (ONWARDS 2): a phase 3a, randomised, open label, multicentre, Treat-to-target trial [^117BVxNZ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Background

Insulin icodec (icodec) is a once-weekly basal insulin currently under development. ONWARDS 2 aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of once-weekly icodec versus once-daily insulin degludec (degludec) in basal insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This 26-week, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, multicentre, treat-to-target phase 3a trial was conducted in 71 sites in nine countries. Eligible participants with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on once-daily or twice-daily basal insulin, with or without non-insulin glucose-lowering agents, were randomly assigned (1:1) to once-weekly icodec or once-daily degludec. The primary outcome was change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1c; the margin used to establish non-inferiority of icodec compared with degludec was 0.3 percentage points. Safety outcomes (hypoglycaemic episodes and adverse events) and patient-reported outcomes were also assessed. The primary outcome was evaluated in all randomly assigned participants; safety outcomes were evaluated descriptively based on all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of trial product, with statistical analyses based on all randomly assigned participants. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04770532, and is now complete.

Findings

Between March 5 and July 19, 2021, 635 participants were screened, of whom 109 were ineligible or withdrew, and 526 were randomly assigned to icodec (n = 263) or degludec (n = 263). From a mean baseline of 8.17% (icodec; 65.8 mmol/mol) and 8.10% (degludec; 65.0 mmol/mol), HbA 1c was reduced to a greater extent with icodec than degludec (7.20% vs 7.42% [55.2 vs 57.6 mmol/mol], respectively) at week 26. This translates to an estimated treatment difference (ETD) of -0.22 percentage points (95% CI -0.37 to -0.08) or -2.4 mmol/mol (95% CI -4.1 to -0.8), demonstrating non-inferiority (p < 0.0001) and superiority (p = 0.0028). The estimated mean change from baseline to week 26 in bodyweight was +1.40 kg for icodec and -0.30 kg for degludec (ETD 1.70 [95% CI 0.76 to 2.63]). Overall rates of combined level 2 or level 3 hypoglycaemia were less than one event per patient-year of exposure for both groups (0.73 [icodec] vs 0.27 [degludec]; estimated rate ratio 1.93 [95% CI 0.93 to 4.02]). Overall, 161 (61%) of 262 participants receiving icodec and 134 (51%) of 263 participants receiving degludec experienced an adverse event; 22 (8%) and 16 (6%), respectively, experienced a serious adverse event. One serious adverse event (degludec) was assessed as being possibly related to treatment. No new safety issues were identified in relation to icodec compared with degludec in this trial.

Interpretation

Among adults with basal insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, treatment with once-weekly icodec versus once-daily degludec demonstrated non-inferiority and statistical superiority in HbA 1c reduction after 26 weeks, associated with modest weight gain. Overall rates of hypoglycaemia were low, with numerically but not statistically significantly higher event rates of level 2 or level 3 hypoglycaemia with icodec versus degludec.

Study H: Insulin Degludec Administered at the Same Time Each Day in Combination with a Rapid-Acting Insulin Analog at Mealtimes in Adult Patients

The efficacy of Insulin Degludec was evaluated in a 52-week randomized, open-label, multicenter trial in 992 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on premix insulin, bolus insulin alone, basal insulin alone, oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) alone or any combination thereof. Patients were randomized to Insulin Degludec once-daily with the main evening meal or insulin glargine U-100 once-daily according to the approved labeling. Insulin aspart was administered before each meal in both treatment arms. Up to two of the following oral antidiabetes agents (metformin or pioglitazone) were used as background therapy in both treatment arms.

The mean age of the trial population was 59 years and mean duration of diabetes was 14 years. 54% were male. 83% were White, 10% Black or African American. 12% were Hispanic. 12% of patients had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2. The mean BMI was approximately 32.2 kg/m2.

At week 52, the difference in HbA1creduction from baseline between Insulin Degludec and insulin glargine U-100 was 0.08% with a 95% confidence interval of [-0.05%; 0.21%] and met the pre-specified non-inferiority margin (0.4%). See Table 13.

### Efficacy and safety of a fixed-ratio combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide (IDegLira) compared with its components given alone: results of a phase 3, open-label, randomised, 26-week, Treat-to-target trial in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes [^114cegBF]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

A fixed-ratio combination of the basal insulin analogue insulin degludec and the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue liraglutide has been developed as a once-daily injection for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to compare combined insulin degludec-liraglutide (IDegLira) with its components given alone in insulin-naive patients.

Methods

In this phase 3, 26-week, open-label, randomised trial, adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c of 7–10% (inclusive), a BMI of 40 kg/m(2) or less, and treated with metformin with or without pioglitazone were randomly assigned (2:1:1) to daily injections of IDegLira, insulin degludec, or liraglutide (1.8 mg per day). IDegLira and insulin degludec were titrated to achieve a self-measured prebreakfast plasma glucose concentration of 4–5 mmol/L. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment, and the main objective was to assess the non-inferiority of IDegLira to insulin degludec (with an upper 95% CI margin of 0.3%), and the superiority of IDegLira to liraglutide (with a lower 95% CI margin of 0%). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01336023.

Findings

1663 adults (mean age 55 years [SD 10], HbA1c 8.3% [0.9], and BMI 31.2 kg/m(2) [4.8]) were randomly assigned, 834 to IDegLira, 414 to insulin degludec, and 415 to liraglutide. After 26 weeks, mean HbA1c had decreased by 1.9% (SD 1.1) to 6.4% (1.0) with IDegLira, by 1.4% (1.0) to 6.9% (1.1) with insulin degludec, and by 1.3% (1.1) to 7.0% (1.2) with liraglutide. IDegLira was non-inferior to insulin degludec (estimated treatment difference -0.47%, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.36, p < 0.0001) and superior to liraglutide (-0.64%, -0.75 to -0.53, p < 0.0001). IDegLira was generally well tolerated; fewer participants in the IDegLira group than in the liraglutide group reported gastrointestinal adverse events (nausea 8.8 vs 19.7%), although the insulin degludec group had the fewest participants with gastrointestinal adverse events (nausea 3.6%). We noted no clinically relevant differences between treatments with respect to standard safety assessments, and the safety profile of IDegLira reflected those of its component parts. The number of confirmed hypoglycaemic events per patient year was 1.8 for IDegLira, 0.2 for liraglutide, and 2.6 for insulin degludec. Serious adverse events occurred in 19 (2%) of 825 patients in the IDegLira group, eight (2%) of 412 in the insulin degludec group, and 14 (3%) of 412 in the liraglutide group.

Interpretation

IDegLira combines the clinical advantages of basal insulin and GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment, resulting in improved glycaemic control compared with its components given alone.

### Comparable glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia in adults with type 2 diabetes after initiating insulin glargine 300 units / mL or insulin degludec: the DELIVER Naïve D real-world study [^113tUxJK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

4.2 Conclusions

Among previously insulin‐naïve adults with T2D, under real‐world circumstances, initiating Gla‐300 or IDeg improved glycaemic control to a similar extent and both second‐generation basal insulin analogues were associated with comparable levels of hypoglycaemia. These results from DELIVER Naive D complement the results from the first head‐to‐head RCT (BRIGHT trial) in insulin‐naïve adults. 10 Moreover, they are fully consistent with data from other real‐world studies in insulin‐naïve or ‐experienced adults with T2D, 8, 9, 16 which all suggest that the two longer‐acting basal insulins – Gla‐300 and IDeg – have comparable effects in terms of efficacy, effectiveness, and hypoglycaemia outcomes. Overall, the results of our study add to the growing body of evidence that suggests that second‐generation basal insulin analogues offer advantages over first‐generation basal insulin analogues, and that use of either of these second‐generation basal insulin analogues – Gla‐300 or IDeg – represents an effective option for patients with T2D starting insulin.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of gla-300 versus IDegAsp in insulin-naïve people with type 2 diabetes mellitus uncontrolled on oral anti-diabetics [^114XFLTi]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To compare the efficacy and safety of insulin glargine-300 once daily (Gla-300) with insulin degludec/aspart (IDegAsp) once daily in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled on oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs).

Materials and Methods

A systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials was followed by an indirect treatment comparison of studies involving insulin naïve adults, inadequately controlled [glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 7.0%] on OADs, who received Gla-300 or IDegAsp once daily. Outcomes of interest were change in HbA1c, blood glucose, weight and insulin dose, as well as incidence and event rate of hypoglycaemia and other adverse events.

Results

Four trials with broadly similar baseline patient characteristics were included in the meta-analyses and indirect treatment comparison. At 24–28weeks, the indirect comparison of Gla-300 to IDegAsp once daily estimated no statistically significant difference for change in HbA1c (%) from baseline [mean difference of 0.10% (95% CI: -0.20, 0.39; p = .52)]; a statistically significant mean difference of -1.31kg (95% CI: -1.97, -0.65; p < .05) for change in body weight from baseline; statistically significant odds ratios of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.93; p < .05) for incidence of any hypoglycaemia; and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.87; p < .05) for incidence of anytime confirmed hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose < 3.0–3.1mmol/L). No significant differences were observed for insulin dose and adverse events.

Conclusion

In insulin-naïve patients with T2D inadequately controlled on OADs, commencing Gla-300 shows a comparable HbA1c reduction, but with significantly less weight gain and a lower incidence of any and confirmed hypoglycaemia compared with commencing IDegAsp.

5 Limitations

This analysis has several limitations. The included trials were of relatively limited duration, which constrains evaluation of very long‐term outcomes. Most were open‐label, introducing potential performance and ascertainment bias. High heterogeneity was observed in certain outcomes, likely stemming from differences in fasting glucose targets, titration protocols, baseline regimens, and study methodologies; although random‐effects models were applied, some residual variability may persist. Furthermore, most evidence derives from manufacturer‐sponsored RCTs conducted under controlled conditions, which may not fully reflect real‐world clinical practice. Finally, data on long‐term safety, adherence, cost‐effectiveness, and diabetes‐related complications remain sparse.

2.3 Starting Dose in Insulin Naïve Patients

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus:

The recommended starting dose of Insulin Degludec in insulin naïve patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin dose. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be administered as a short-acting insulin and divided between each daily meal. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin naïve patients with type 1 diabetes.

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:

The recommended starting dose of Insulin Degludec in insulin naïve patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is 10 units once daily.

2.4 Switching to Insulin Degludec from Other Insulin Therapies

Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to Insulin Degludec from another insulin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Adults with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:

Start Insulin Degludec at the same unit dose as the total daily long or intermediate-acting insulin unit dose.

Pediatric Patients 1 Year of Age and Older with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:

Start Insulin Degludec at 80% of the total daily long or intermediate-acting insulin unit dose to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Degludec insulin versus efsitora insulin in diabetes mellitus management: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Ga7MM]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy and safety of next-generation basal insulin efsitora versus insulin degludec in managing type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL databases until October 2024. This study followed PRISMA guidelines. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.4.1. The risk of bias was assessed using the RoB2 tool, and the quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. This study was registered in PROSPERO under protocol CRD42024597806.

Results

Six randomized controlled trials involving 2590 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 1376 (53.13%) received efsitora insulin. No significant differences were observed between efsitora and degludec in glycemic efficacy outcomes, including HbA1c reduction, fasting blood glucose, weight change, and proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7%. Regarding safety outcomes, most endpoints, such as adverse events, injection site reactions, hypersensitivity, severe hypoglycemia, and mortality, were comparable between groups, with no significant subgroup effects. However, subgroup analysis revealed a lower incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia with efsitora in patients with type 2 diabetes, and a higher rate of serious adverse events in patients with type 1 diabetes, suggesting potential population-specific differences in safety profiles.

Conclusion

Efsitora and degludec insulins show similar overall efficacy and safety in the management of diabetes. However, subgroup analyses indicate that patient-specific factors, such as diabetes type, may influence the risk of certain adverse events. These findings support the importance of individualized insulin selection based on patient characteristics and risk profiles.

Studies of efsitora alfa (phase 2 studies)

Efsitora's phase 2 programme included three treat-to-target studies of which two were conducted on patients with T2D (Table 1). One study included patients with T2D previously treated with once-daily basal insulin, and one included insulin-naive patients with T2D. In these phase 2 studies, efsitora was dosed in milligram increments from a reconstituted lyophilized powder, as the soluble insulin formulation was not available at the time of the phase 2 studies.

In patients previously treated with once-daily basal insulin, efsitora alfa achieved a similar efficacy compared with degludec despite higher fasting glucose targets in the efsitora alfa groups. This study included 399 participants randomized to efsitora alfa with a fasting glucose target of ≤ 140 mg/dL (group 1), efsitora alfa with a target of ≤ 120 mg/dL (group 2) or degludec with a target of ≤ 100.8 mg/dL (group 3). Titration occurred every 2 weeks in group 1, every 4 weeks in group 2 and weekly in group 3. Oral glucose-lowering medications were continued throughout the study. Higher fasting glucose targets and lower glucose variability might have contributed to lower hypoglycemia rates (both total and nocturnal) for efsitora alfa compared with degludec. These findings support continued development of efsitora alfa as a once-weekly insulin treatment for people with diabetes.

Among insulin-naive patients, once-weekly efsitora alfa achieved excellent glycemic control similar to degludec, with no concerning hypoglycemia or other safety findings. This second phase 2 study included 278 insulin-naive participants with T2D being treated with metformin with or without a DPP4i and/ or SGLT2i, with a fasting glucose target of 80–100 mg/dL.

### Once-weekly insulin icodec vs once-daily insulin degludec in adults with insulin-naive type 2 diabetes: the ONWARDS 3 randomized clinical trial [^11318eFk]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Once-weekly insulin icodec could provide a simpler dosing alternative to daily basal insulin in people with type 2 diabetes.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-weekly icodec vs once-daily insulin degludec in people with insulin-naive type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-masked, noninferiority, treat-to-target, phase 3a trial conducted from March 2021 to June 2022 at 92 sites in 11 countries in adults with type 2 diabetes treated with any noninsulin glucose-lowering agents with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7%-11% (53–97 mmol/mol).

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either once-weekly icodec and once-daily placebo (icodec group; n = 294) or once-daily degludec and once-weekly placebo (degludec group; n = 294).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 (noninferiority margin, 0.3% percentage points). Secondary end points included change in fasting plasma glucose from baseline to week 26, mean weekly insulin dose during the last 2 weeks of treatment, body weight change from baseline to week 26, and number of level 2 (clinically significant; glucose level < 54 mg/dL) and level 3 (severe; requiring external assistance for recovery) hypoglycemic episodes.

Results

Among 588 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 58 [10] years; 219 [37%] women), 564 (96%) completed the trial. Mean HbA1c level decreased from 8.6% (observed) to 7.0% (estimated) at 26 weeks in the icodec group and from 8.5% (observed) to 7.2% (estimated) in the degludec group (estimated treatment difference [ETD], -0.2 [95% CI, -0.3 to -0.1] percentage points), confirming noninferiority (P < .001) and superiority (P = 0.002). There were no significant differences between the icodec and degludec groups for fasting plasma glucose change from baseline to week 26 (ETD, 0 [95% CI, -6 to 5] mg/dL; p = 0.90), mean weekly insulin dose during the last 2 weeks of treatment, or body weight change from baseline to week 26 (2.8 kg vs 2.3 kg; ETD, 0.46 [95% CI, -0.19 to 1.10] kg; p = 0.17). Combined level 2 or 3 hypoglycemia rates were numerically higher in the icodec group than the degludec group from week 0 to 31 (0.31 vs 0.15 events per patient-year exposure; p = 0.11) and statistically higher in the icodec group from week 0 to 26 (0.35 vs 0.12 events per patient-year exposure; p = 0.01).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among people with insulin-naive type 2 diabetes, once-weekly icodec demonstrated superior HbA1c reduction to once-daily degludec after 26 weeks of treatment, with no difference in weight change and a higher rate of combined level 2 or 3 hypoglycemic events in the context of less than 1 event per patient-year exposure in both groups.

### A comparative effectiveness study of degludec and insulin glargine 300 U / mL in insulin-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes [^115ZxLeL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To compare the real-world effectiveness of insulin degludec (degludec) and glargine 300units/mL (glargine U300) in insulin-naïve adult patients with type 2 diabetes in routine US clinical practice.

Materials and Methods

CONFIRM is a non-interventional comparative effectiveness study following US patients across the continuum of care, through electronic medical records from multiple health systems and integrated delivery networks. Propensity-score matching controlled for confounding. The primary endpoint, change in HbA1c from baseline to 180days of follow-up, was estimated using a repeated-measure of covariance analysis with subject as random effect. Change in the rate of hypoglycaemic episodes (defined using International Classification of Diseases codes 9/10) and change in proportion of patients with hypoglycaemia were estimated using negative binomial and logistic regression, respectively. Time-to-discontinuation of the initial basal insulin/initiation with another prescribed basal insulin was analysed using a Cox Proportional Hazard model.

Results

Data concerning 4056 patients were analysed. After matching, baseline characteristics were comparable (n = 2028 in each group). After 180days of follow-up, degludec was associated with a larger reduction in HbA1c (estimated treatment difference, -0.27%; P = 0.03), greater reductions in change in rate (rate ratio, 0.70; P < 0.05) and greater reductions in change in the likelihood of hypoglycaemia (odds ratio, 0.64; P < 0.01]) compared with glargine U300. In addition, patients treated with degludec were 27% less likely to discontinue treatment at follow-up compared with those treated with glargine U300 (hazard ratio, 0.73; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Significantly improved HbA1c, larger reductions in rates and likelihood of hypoglycaemia and lower risk of treatment discontinuation were demonstrated with degludec vs glargine U300.

Overall hypoglycemia rates with once-weekly insulin

The efficacy and safety of once-weekly insulin in T2D were investigated in three phase 2 icodec studies, five phase 3 icodec studies (ONWARDS 1–5)and two phase 2 efsitora alfa studies. In the icodec phase 3a studies, sulfonylureas were either discontinued or reduced by 50% at the investigator's discretion to mirror real-world conditions. In ONWARDS 1 and ONWARDS 3, overall level 2 and 3 hypoglycemia rates (events/PYE) in basal-only insulin-naive individuals ranged from 0.19 to 0.31 for icodec, compared with 0.16 for glargine U100 and 0.15 for degludec (figures 1B and 2), with overall HbA1c reductions ranging from −1.3% to −1.6% points (baseline range: 8.4–8.6%), confirming statistical non-inferiority and superiority of icodec versus respective once-daily comparators. In insulin-naive individuals, icodec plus a dosing guidance app was also compared against a pooled group of once-daily basal insulin analogs (degludec, glargine U100 or glargine U300) administered following real-world practice; overall combined level 2 or level 3 hypoglycemia rates (events/PYE) were 0.19 and 0.14, respectively, with corresponding HbA1c reductions of −1.68% and −1.31% points (baseline: 9.0% and 8.9%, respectively), confirming non-inferiority and superiority of icodec. In basal-only insulin-experienced individuals, overall combined level 2 or level 3 hypoglycemia rates (events/PYE) were 0.7 for icodec and 0.3 for degludec (figures 1B and 2), but were not statistically significant, with corresponding HbA1c reductions of −0.93% and −0.71% points, respectively (baseline: 8.2% and 8.1%, respectively), confirming non-inferiority and superiority of icodec. In individuals receiving basal-bolus therapy, the overall combined level 2 or level 3 hypoglycemia rates were similar for icodec+insulin aspart versus glargine U100+insulin aspart (5.6 events/PYE (both)) (figures 1B and 2), as were the corresponding HbA1c reductions (−1.16% and −1.18% points, respectively, both from 8.3% at baseline), confirming non-inferiority of icodec.

### Effect of insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 on hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes: the SWITCH 2 randomized clinical trial [^1128uBQT]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypoglycemia, a serious risk for insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes, negatively affects glycemic control.

Objective

To test whether treatment with basal insulin degludec is associated with a lower rate of hypoglycemia compared with insulin glargine U100 in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, treat-to-target crossover trial including two 32-week treatment periods, each with a 16-week titration period and a 16-week maintenance period. The trial was conducted at 152 US centers between January 2014 and December 2015 in 721 adults with type 2 diabetes and at least 1 hypoglycemia risk factor who were previously treated with basal insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive once-daily insulin degludec followed by insulin glargine U100 (n = 361) or to receive insulin glargine U100 followed by insulin degludec (n = 360) and randomized 1:1 to morning or evening dosing within each treatment sequence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes (severe or blood glucose confirmed [< 56 mg/dL]) during the maintenance period. Secondary end points were the rate of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes (severe or blood glucose confirmed, occurring between 12:01 am and 5:59 am) and the proportion of patients with severe hypoglycemia during the maintenance period.

Results

Of the 721 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 61.4 [10.5] years; 53.1% male), 580 (80.4%) completed the trial. During the maintenance period, the rates of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia for insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 were 185.6 vs 265.4 episodes per 100 patient-years of exposure (PYE) (rate ratio = 0.70 [95% CI, 0.61–0.80]; P < .001; difference, -23.66 episodes/100 PYE [95% CI, -33.98 to -13.33]), and the proportions of patients with hypoglycemic episodes were 22.5% vs 31.6% (difference, -9.1% [95% CI, -13.1% to -5.0%]). The rates of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia with insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 were 55.2 vs 93.6 episodes/100 PYE (rate ratio = 0.58 [95% CI, 0.46–0.74]; P < .001; difference, -7.41 episodes/100 PYE [95% CI, -11.98 to -2.85]), and the proportions of patients with hypoglycemic episodes were 9.7% vs 14.7% (difference, -5.1% [95% CI, -8.1% to -2.0%]). The proportions of patients experiencing severe hypoglycemia during the maintenance period were 1.6% (95% CI, 0.6%-2.7%) for insulin degludec vs 2.4% (95% CI, 1.1%-3.7%) for insulin glargine U100 (McNemar P = 0.35; risk difference, -0.8% [95% CI, -2.2% to 0.5%]). Statistically significant reductions in overall and nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia for insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 were also seen for the full treatment period.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin and with at least 1 hypoglycemia risk factor, 32 weeks' treatment with insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 resulted in a reduced rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia.

Aim

To compare the effect of insulin degludec and insulin glargine on health-related quality of life in patients with Type 2 diabetes starting on insulin therapy.

Methods

Patient-level data from three open-label, randomized, treat-to-target trials of 26 or 52 weeks' duration were pooled using a weighted analysis in conjunction with a fixed-effects model. Insulin-naive patients received either insulin degludec (n = 1290) or insulin glargine (n = 632) once daily, in combination with oral anti-diabetic drugs. Glycaemic control was assessed via HbA(1c) and fasting plasma glucose concentrations. Rates of hypoglycaemia, defined as plasma glucose < 3.1 mmol/l (< 56 mg/dl), were recorded. Health-related quality of life was evaluated using the 36-item Short Form (SF-36(®)) version 2 questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using a generalized linear model with treatment, trial, anti-diabetic therapy at baseline, gender, region and age as explanatory variables.

Results

Insulin degludec was confirmed as non-inferior to insulin glargine based on HbA(1c) concentrations. In each trial comprising the meta-analysis, fasting plasma glucose and confirmed overall and nocturnal (00.01–05.59 h) hypoglycaemia were all numerically or significantly lower with insulin degludec vs. insulin glargine. At endpoint, the overall physical health component score was significantly higher (better) with insulin degludec vs. insulin glargine [+0.66 (95% CI 0.04–1.28)], largely attributable to a difference [+1.10 (95% CI 0.22–1.98)] in the bodily pain domain score. In the mental domains, vitality was significantly higher with insulin degludec vs. insulin glargine [+0.81 (95% CI 0.01–1.59)].

Conclusions

Compared with insulin glargine, insulin degludec leads to improvements in both mental and physical health status for patients with Type 2 diabetes initiating insulin therapy.

### Insulin degludec versus insulin glargine in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes: a 1-year, randomized, Treat-to-target trial (BEGIN once long) [^115g9F7o]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Importantly, the findings of this large, 1-year treat-to-target study are consistent with those of a phase 2 study in which a reduction of nocturnal hypoglycemia of similar magnitude was observed in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes who received insulin degludec once daily compared with insulin glargine.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that initiating insulin therapy with either insulin degludec or insulin glargine administered once daily provides similar improvements in long-term glycemic control for patients with type 2 diabetes that is insufficiently controlled by OADs. Although nocturnal and severe hypoglycemia were infrequent in this patient population with type 2 diabetes, the rates were lower with insulin degludec than with insulin glargine. These findings illustrate the beneficial profile of this new basal insulin in the treatment arsenal for patients with type 2 diabetes.

### AUGMENTed real-world data enhances comparative efficacy between once-weekly insulin icodec with dosing guide app versus once-daily insulin glargine U300 in insulin-naive type 2 diabetes [^113Lmoz7]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the introduction of several compounds into the market for the treatment of diabetes, insulin remains a therapeutic cornerstone. Insulin icodec (icodec) is a once-weekly basal insulin that was evaluated in the ONWARDS phase 3a clinical trial program. The six ONWARDS trials (ONWARDS 1–6) assessed the efficacy and safety of icodec compared with once-daily (OD) basal insulin analogs (OD analogs: insulin degludec [degludec], insulin glargine U100 [glargine U100], or insulin glargine U300 [glargine U300]) in adults with T2D or T1D.

ONWARDS 5 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04760626) was a phase 3a clinical trial with real-world elements designed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of icodec titrated with a dosing guide app (icodec with app) compared with OD analogs dosed as per standard clinical practice in insulin-naive adults with T2D. The icodec with app group showed a noninferior (P < 0.001) and superior (P = 0.009) change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) from baseline to week 52 (− 1.68 percentage points) compared with the OD analog group (− 1.31 percentage points). Furthermore, the rates of clinically significant or severe hypoglycemia were low and similar between icodec with app and OD analogs.

### Once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa versus once daily insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112yGaQQ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The high heterogeneity observed in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) outcomes was substantially reduced in leave‐one‐out sensitivity analyses when the Frias et al. trial was excluded. This reduction is likely explained by the trial's unequal fasting glucose targets, where insulin degludec was titrated to a stricter goal (≤ 100 mg/dL) compared to efsitora (≤ 120 mg/dL), resulting in comparatively larger FPG reductions in the degludec arm. Likewise, heterogeneity in time‐above‐range (TAR) outcomes decreased markedly on exclusion of either the Frias et al. or Bue‐Valleskey et al. trials, reaching zero in the former case. Such findings underscore the role of trial design and population characteristics in driving variability. In particular, the inclusion of insulin‐naïve participants in Bue‐Valleskey et al. may have contributed, as these individuals often display different glycemic responses than the insulin‐experienced population in Frias et al. Other contributing factors may include differences in titration algorithms, baseline glycemic control, and fasting glucose targets across trials, each of which can influence glycemic variability and time spent above range.

The mean percentage of time spent in normoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia over a 24-h period is outlined in Fig. 4. The mean percentage of the day for which blood glucose levels remained in the normal glycemic range (> 70 mg/dl and ≤ 180 mg/dl) was 76.4% for insulin degludec and 76.0% for efsitora at week 1 and 51.1% and 69.2% for insulin degludec and efsitora at week 6, respectively. Regarding hyperglycemia, the mean percentage of time over a 24-h period (insulin degludec vs. efsitora) where blood glucose levels were > 180 mg/dl or > 270 mg/dl was 22.3% versus 23.8% and 1.2% versus 3.9% for week 1 and 48.0% versus 30.2% and 11.6% versus 3.2% for week 6, respectively. For hypoglycemia, the mean percentage of time over a 24-h period (insulin degludec vs. efsitora) where blood glucose levels were ≤ 70 mg/dl or < 54 mg/dl was 1.3% versus 0.2% and 0.05% versus 0.05% for week 1 and 0.9% versus 0.6% and 0.51% versus 0.02% for week 6, respectively. In both categories of hypoglycemia (≤ 70 mg/dl or < 54 mg/dl), the incidence and mean duration of individual hypoglycemic events were similar between insulin degludec and efsitora.

### Insulin efsitora versus degludec in type 2 diabetes without previous insulin treatment [^111TjJrK]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Insulin efsitora alfa (efsitora) is a new basal insulin designed for once-weekly administration. Data on safety and efficacy have been limited to small, phase 1 or phase 2 trials.

Methods

We conducted a 52-week, phase 3, parallel-design, open-label, treat-to-target trial involving adults with type 2 diabetes who had not previously received insulin. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive efsitora or degludec. The primary end point was the change in the glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to week 52; we hypothesized that efsitora would be noninferior to degludec (noninferiority margin, 0.4 percentage points). Secondary and safety end points included the change in the glycated hemoglobin level in subgroups of participants using and not using glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, the percentage of time that the glucose level was in the target range of 70 to 180 mg per deciliter in weeks 48 through 52, and hypoglycemic episodes.

Results

A total of 928 participants underwent randomization (466 to the efsitora group and 462 to the degludec group). The mean glycated hemoglobin level decreased from 8.21% at baseline to 6.97% at week 52 with efsitora (least-squares mean change, -1.26 percentage points) and from 8.24% to 7.05% with degludec (least-squares mean change, -1.17 percentage points) (estimated treatment difference, -0.09 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.22 to 0.04), findings that showed noninferiority. Efsitora was noninferior to degludec with respect to the change in the glycated hemoglobin level in participants using and not using GLP-1 receptor agonists. The percentage of time that the glucose level was within the target range was 64.3% with efsitora and 61.2% with degludec (estimated treatment difference, 3.1 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.1 to 6.1). The rate of combined clinically significant or severe hypoglycemia was 0.58 events per participant-year of exposure with efsitora and 0.45 events per participant-year of exposure with degludec (estimated rate ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.78). No severe hypoglycemia was reported with efsitora; six episodes were reported with degludec. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

In adults with type 2 diabetes who had not previously received insulin, once-weekly efsitora was noninferior to once-daily degludec in reducing glycated hemoglobin levels. (Funded by Eli Lilly; QWINT-2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05362058.).

### Efficacy and safety of insulin degludec three times a week versus insulin glargine once a day in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes: results of two phase 3, 26 week, randomised, open-label, Treat-to-target, non-inferiority trials [^115SBL6M]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Results of an exploratory phase 2 study showed that insulin degludec, a basal insulin with an action profile of longer than 42 h, provided similar glycaemic control when injected three times a week (IDeg 3TW) to once-daily insulin glargine (IGlar OD). To provide further evidence, we did two phase 3 trials to compare the efficacy and safety of IDeg 3TW with IGlar OD in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

In two 26 week, randomised, open-label, parallel group, non-inferiority trials IDeg was injected Monday, Wednesday, and Friday before breakfast (IDeg 3TW(AM)) in the AM trial (94 sites in seven countries) or with the evening meal (IDeg 3TW(PM)) in the PM trial (89 sites in seven countries), and compared with IGlar OD. Adults with type 2 diabetes (HbA(1c) 7.0–10.0%; body-mass index ≤ 45 kg/m(2)) were randomly allocated (1:1) without stratification by a central interactive response system to IDeg 3TW or IGlar OD. Both groups continued taking metformin with or without dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Insulin was titrated to achieve a prebreakfast self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) concentration of between 3.9 and less than 5.0 mmol/L. The primary outcome was non-inferiority of IDeg 3TW compared with IGlar OD, as assessed by change in HbA(1c) from baseline to 26 weeks (non-inferiority limit of 0.4%) by ANOVA in an intent-to-treat analysis (full analysis set). These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01068678 and NCT01076647.

Findings

We recruited 460 patients for the AM trial (IDeg 3TW(AM), n = 230; IGlar OD, n = 230) and 467 patients for the PM trial (IDeg 3TW(PM), n = 233; IGlar OD, n = 234). After 26 weeks, mean HbA decreased by 0.9% (IDeg 3TW(AM)) and 1.3% (IGlar OD) in the AM trial, and by 1.1% (IDeg 3TW(PM)) and 1.4% (IGlar OD) in the PM trial. Non-inferiority was not confirmed in either trial (estimated treatment difference [IDeg 3TW(AM)-IGlar OD] 0.34%, 95% CI 0.18–0.51; [IDeg 3TW(PM)-IGlar OD] 0.26%, 0.11–0.41). Across the two trials, rates of confirmed hypoglycaemia (SMBG < 3.1 mmol/L or severe [needing assistance]) ranged from 1.0 to 1.6 episodes per patient-year and were similar for IDeg 3TW(AM) and IGlar OD (estimated rate ratio [ERR] 1.04, 95% CI 0.69–1.55), but higher for IDeg 3TW(PM) than for IGlar OD (ERR 1.58, 1.03–2.43). The rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia was higher for IDeg 3TW(AM) than for IGlar OD (ERR 2.12, 1.08–4.16); we noted no significant difference between IDeg 3TW(PM) and IGlar OD (ERR 0.60, 0.21–1.69).

Interpretation

The inferior glycaemic control and increased risk of hypoglycaemia with IDeg 3TW compared with IGlar OD do not support a three-times-weekly dosing regimen.

### Clinical perspectives on the frequency of hypoglycemia in Treat-to-target randomized controlled trials comparing basal insulin analogs in type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^111LXF7A]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Once-weekly efsitora alfa was compared with once-daily degludec as basal-only regimens in insulin-naive and insulin-experienced individuals using various titration targets in two phase 2 trials. In insulin-naive individuals, the titration target for both treatments was 4.4– < 5.6 mmol/L (80–100 mg/dL), while in insulin-experienced individuals, the two titration targets for efsitora were ≤ 7.8 mmol/L (≤ 140 mg/dL) (algorithm 1) and ≤ 6.7 mmol/L (≤ 120 mg/dL) (algorithm 2), and the titration target for degludec was ≤ 5.6 mmol/L (≤ 100 mg/dL). In insulin-experienced individuals, baseline HbA1c was reduced after 32 weeks by −0.6% point for efsitora (both titration algorithms) and −0.7% point for degludec (baseline: 8.1% for both). The rate of level 1 hypoglycemia (< 3.9 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL)) was statistically significantly lower with efsitora than with degludec (23.0 vs 30.5 events/PYE; p value not reported). For level 2 hypoglycemia (< 3.0 mmol/L (< 54 mg/dL)), there was no statistically significant difference between arms (2.2 vs 3.0 events/PYE; p value not reported). The difference in level 1 hypoglycemia may be attributed to the more stringent titration target used for degludec than for efsitora, resulting in statistically significantly lower fasting blood glucose with degludec than with efsitora (change from baseline: –1.8 mmol/L (–32.7 mg/dL) vs –0.9 mmol/L (–17.0 mg/dL), respectively; p value not reported). In insulin-naive individuals, however, there was no statistically significant difference between efsitora and degludec using the same titration target in terms of level 1 (3.29 vs 2.77 events/PYE, respectively) or level 2 hypoglycemia (0.22 vs 0.15 events/PYE, respectively); reductions in HbA1c were −1.20% points and −1.26% points, respectively (baseline: ~8.0%).

### Frequency and severity of hypoglycemia under conditions of increased hypoglycemic risk with insulin efsitora alfa versus insulin glargine treatment in participants with type 2 diabetes [^1126cReV]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As T2D advances, patients often must incorporate basal insulin therapy into their treatment regimen to help improve glycemic control. However, currently available basal insulin formulations require daily injections, which places a substantial physical burden on patients and caregivers. An efficacious basal insulin therapy requiring once-weekly injections could result in earlier adoption of insulin therapy and improve adherence, potentially leading to better real-world outcomes.

Efsitora is a novel once-weekly insulin receptor agonist undergoing phase 3 development. Efsitora has a flat pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and long half-life (17 days), allowing for weekly dosing. These attributes have the potential to provide stable glucose levels and improve glycemic control. Previous phase 2 clinical trials have demonstrated similar efficacy of efsitora compared to daily insulin degludec.

A potential concern for a basal insulin with such a long half-life is the risk of hypoglycemia and the duration of hypoglycemic events. However, two phase 2 studies of efsitora in adults with T2D demonstrated similar rates of hypoglycemia compared to once-daily degludec. Data from previous basal insulin formulations indicate that basal insulins with longer half-lives may lead to less of a peak effect, thereby reducing hypoglycemia or improving glycemic control. For example, degludec, which has a half-life greater than 25 h, demonstrated a lower rate of hypoglycemia compared to insulin glargine U100, which has a half-life of 12.5 h. Nevertheless, a longer half-life will also reduce the flexibility to quickly reduce the basal insulin dose in situations that might provoke hypoglycemia.

This exploratory study aimed to characterize the glycemic responses of patients with T2D previously treated with basal insulin under experimental conditions that simulate real-life situations where hypoglycemic risk is increased, such as during a prolonged 24-h fast, a prolonged 24-h fast plus exercise, and following a double dose. The sequential design first evaluates the hypoglycemic risk with glargine U100 before converting the patient to efsitora and then re-evaluating the hypoglycemic risk under the same conditions.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the PK, PD, and safety profiles of efsitora observed in these studies are promising and are consistent with those from prior global studies in non-Japanese patients. These findings highlight the potential of efsitora as a once-weekly basal insulin for Japanese patients with T2D and support the design and completion of phase 3 studies in this patient cohort.

### Optimal use of once-weekly basal insulin efsitora alfa in type 1 and type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1116Vwfo]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

No meta-analysis has holistically analyzed and summarized the efficacy and safety of the novel once-weekly basal insulin efsitora alfa in managing type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Methods

Clinical trials involving subjects with T1D and T2D receiving once-weekly efsitora alfa in the intervention arm and once-daily basal insulins in the control arm were searched throughout the electronic databases. The primary outcome assessed was the change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).

Results

Data from 6 studies (2465 subjects) were analyzed (follow-up 26–54 weeks). Once-weekly efsitora alfa and once-daily degludec achieved comparable HbA1c reduction in study subjects with T2D (mean difference [MD] 0.02% [-0.11, 0.16]; p = 0.74) and T1D (MD 0.11% [-0.01, 0.22]; p = 0.08). Efsitora and degludec were similarly effective in reducing fasting plasma glucose and achieving HbA1c < 7% in subjects with T2D. Individuals with T2D and T1D in the 2 groups had comparable time in range, time above range, and time below range. Subjects with T2D receiving efsitora and once-daily basal insulin had comparable total adverse events, severe adverse events, injection-site reactions, hypersensitivity events, and overall and severe hypoglycemia; however, nocturnal hypoglycemia risk was lower with efsitora (risk ratio 0.85 [0.74, 0.98]; p = 0.03). However, in individuals with T1D, total adverse events, severe adverse events, and injection-site reactions were higher with efsitora, with comparable risks of hypersensitivity events and overall, severe and nocturnal hypoglycemia.

Conclusion

Once-weekly basal insulin efsitora alfa is well tolerated with glycemic efficacy similar to once-daily degludec.

### Effect of insulin degludec versus sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on oral antidiabetic agents [^116bZ7YY]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

The efficacy and safety of insulin degludec (IDeg), a new basal insulin with an ultra-long duration of action, was compared to sitagliptin (Sita) in a 26-week, open-label trial.

Methods

Insulin-naïve subjects with type 2 diabetes [n = 458, age: 56years, diabetes duration: 7.7years, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c): 8.9% (74mmol/mol)] were randomized (1:1) to once-daily IDeg or Sita (100mg orally) as add-on to stable treatment with 1 or 2 oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs).

Results

Superiority of IDeg to Sita in improving HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was confirmed [estimated treatment difference (ETD) IDeg-Sita for HbA1c: -0.43%-points [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.61; -0.24, p < 0.0001] and for FPG: -2.17 mmol/l (95% CI: -2.59; -1.74, p < 0.0001)]. HbA1c < 7% (< 53mmol/mol) was achieved by 41% (IDeg) versus 28% (Sita) of patients, estimated odds ratio IDeg/Sita: 1.60 (95% CI: 1.04; 2.47, p = 0.034). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia between IDeg and Sita [0.52 vs. 0.30 episodes/patient-year, estimated rate ratio (ERR): IDeg/Sita: 1.93 (95% CI: 0.90; 4.10, p = 0.09)]. Rates of overall confirmed hypoglycaemia were higher with IDeg than with Sita [3.1 vs. 1.3 episodes/patient-year, ERR IDeg/Sita: 3.81 (95% CI: 2.40; 6.05, p < 0.0001)]. IDeg was associated with a greater change in body weight than Sita [ETD IDeg-Sita: 2.75kg (95% CI: 1.97; 3.54, p < 0.0001)]. The overall rates of adverse events were low and similar for both groups.

Conclusions

In patients unable to achieve good glycaemic control on OAD(s), treatment intensification with IDeg offers an effective, well-tolerated alternative to the addition of a second or third OAD.

The sustained treatment benefits of degludec are important to the management of diabetes, a chronic disease, and in potentially lowering the risk of diabetic complications. As hypoglycaemia and fear of hypoglycaemia are two of the major barriers to optimizing glycaemic control, insulin degludec appears to provide a significantly improved clinical response in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

### Comparison of insulin degludec with insulin glargine in insulin-naive subjects with type 2 diabetes: a 2-year randomized, Treat-to-target trial [^114yzzaL]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The 2-year exposure to insulin degludec or glargine in previously insulin-naive patients with Type 2 diabetes provided an opportunity to compare overall safety of degludec with that of glargine, while evaluating long-term glycaemic efficacy.

The principal findings of the 52-week, core trial, namely that degludec provides improved glycaemic control similar to glargine (similar HbA 1c reduction with greater reduction in fasting plasma glucose), using similar insulin doses, with lower rates of nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia and similar weight gain, were sustained for a full 104 weeks of treatment. Although rates of diurnal confirmed hypoglycaemia (confirmed hypoglycaemia occurring between 06:00 and 00:00 h) were similar between treatments, insulin degludec showed a consistently and significantly lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia as compared with glargine, and this difference widened over the course of 2 years (P < 0.01). The lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia can be attributed to the flat pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of insulin degludec combined with the reduced variability within subjects between days and also between subjects.

The degludec phase 3 programme was a global clinical development programme, and the window of time for defining nocturnal hypoglycaemia was chosen, taking into consideration the variability of timing of meals around the world to ensure that the period chosen was truly nocturnal and not confounded by meal ingestion or use of bolus insulin (relevant for trials in the degludec development programme using basal–bolus insulin therapy). Thus, all analyses of nocturnal hypoglycaemia in the clinical development programme for insulin degludec were carried out according to the definition set a priori for nocturnal hypoglycaemia — hypoglycaemic episodes occurring between 00:01 and 05:59 h (both inclusive). The relevance of the (absolute) difference in hypoglycaemia rates between the two treatments in this study is apparent when considering the clinical impact. Only five patients with Type 2 diabetes need to be treated for a year with insulin degludec to observe the benefit of avoiding one nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episode compared with glargine as the treatment alternative — that is, treating 100 patients for a year with insulin degludec would result in 19 fewer episodes of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia compared with insulin glargine treatment.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

2.4 Endpoints

The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c after 52 weeks of treatment for assessing superiority of IDegLira versus liraglutide and non‐inferiority of IDegLira versus degludec. Secondary endpoints included: change from baseline in HbA1c after 52 weeks of treatment for assessing superiority of IDegLira versus degludec; percentages of participants reaching HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (< 7.0%) and ≤ 48 mmol/mol (≤ 6.5%) after 52 weeks of treatment; change from baseline in body weight after 52 weeks of treatment; fasting lipid profile; and changes from baseline in FPG, nine‐point SMBG profile, prandial plasma glucose increments (from before meal to 90 minutes after for breakfast, lunch and dinner) and blood pressure. Safety endpoints included number of treatment‐emergent adverse events (AEs), number of treatment‐emergent severe (defined according to the American Diabetes Association classification) or blood glucose‐confirmed (plasma glucose < 3.1 mmol/L [< 56 mg/dL]) symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes during 52 weeks of treatment, and pulse rate.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This 52-week, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, open-label, multinational, treat-to-target, noninferiority trial compared the efficacy and safety of once daily insulin degludec with those of once daily insulin glargine, both administered subcutaneously in combination with metformin, in insulin-naive participants requiring intensification of their therapy for type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with OADs. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors could be continued as adjunct therapy, but fewer than 2% of patients (distributed similarly between treatment groups) continued use of a DPP-4 inhibitor throughout the trial.

The trial took place between 1 September 2009 and 17 January 2011 and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines and approved by institutional review boards and independent ethics committees before initiation. Signed informed consent was obtained from participants before trial entry. The trial was conducted at 166 sites in 12 countries: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Serbia and Montenegro, Spain, and the U.S.

### Effectiveness and safety of insulin glargine 300 U / mL in insulin-naïve individuals according to diabetes duration: results from the REALI European pooled data analysis [^114vbd74]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The Canadian INSIGHT trialrandomly assigned insulin‐naïve participants with T2D to receive insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla‐100) in addition to their current therapy or conventional glycaemic management with the intensification of oral glucose‐lowering therapy and insulin avoidance. At 24 weeks, participants in the Gla‐100 group reached the primary endpoint of two consecutive HbA1c levels of 6.5% or less before participants on intensified oral glucose‐lowering therapy (P = 0.041), and had lower HbA1c and FPG levels. Importantly, these benefits were more probable to be achieved in participants who were not yet receiving glucose‐lowering therapies at baseline and with a diabetes duration of less than 5 years. Hence, even without prior insulin use, participants with a shorter diabetes duration are more probable to reach HbA1c targets on basal insulin therapy. In fact, insulin therapy, especially in the early stages of T2D, up to 5 years after manifestation, was shown to be linked to improvements in β‐cell function and hepatic insulin resistance as a result of the rapid improvement of glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity. Thus, insulin, in particular second‐generation basal insulins, may represent one of the most convenient ways to protect pancreatic B‐cell function early on, thereby preserving endogenous insulin biosynthesis, providing an insulin‐sparing strategy in the long run, and reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Consequently, timely insulinization may be an additional aid to prevent hyperglycaemia‐driven diabetes complications.

In terms of safety, Gla‐300 has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of weight gain and hypoglycaemia, which may be related to its smooth and even pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. In the EDITION 3 study enrolling insulin‐naïve people with T2D, Gla‐300 was associated with a significantly lower risk of hypoglycaemia over the 6‐month treatment period and less body weight gain than Gla‐100 (LS mean increase of 0.49 kg for Gla‐300 vs. 0.71 kg for Gla‐100). The BRIGHT study also showed comparable hypoglycaemia incidence and rates, which were generally low, between Gla‐300 and insulin degludec 100 U/mL over the 24‐week treatment period. Overall, the reported low incidence of hypoglycaemia associated with Gla‐300 may reassure individuals with T2D to initiate and optimize their insulin therapy and to better control their disease in the long term, regardless of the duration of their diabetes.

Results

Single-Dose, Dose-Escalation Study

Thirty-one patients participated in the single-dose, dose-escalation study. All patients completed the study. Twelve patients were randomly assigned to each of cohort 1 and cohort 2, with eight patients receiving one dose of efsitora 5 mg (cohort 1) or efsitora 10 mg (cohort 2) and four patients in each cohort receiving one dose of placebo. For cohort 3, a total of seven patients previously treated with basal insulin received one dose of efsitora 20 mg.

Demographics and baseline characteristics of included patients are outlined in Table 1. Across each cohort, all patients were male (100.0%) with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 58.3 (7.4) years, mean BMI of 25.6 (3.3) kg/m 2, and duration of diabetes of 11.0 (6.2) years.

### The efficacy of IDegLira (insulin degludec / liraglutide combination) in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with a GLP-1 receptor agonist and oral therapy: DUAL III randomized clinical trial [^111SkRsD]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

The DUAL phase 3 clinical trial program investigated the efficacy and safety of IDegLira in patients with type 2 diabetes. DUAL I and its 26-week extension showed that IDegLira provided clinical advantages and improved glycemic control compared with its monocomponents given alone in insulin-naïve patients. DUAL II investigated the contribution of liraglutide in IDegLira in insulin-experienced patients, with patients on IDegLira achieving superior glycemic control versus those on insulin degludec (which was capped at 50 U per day). DUAL IV investigated the efficacy and safety of IDegLira in insulin-naïve patients inadequately controlled with sulfonylurea with or without metformin, where it demonstrated superior glycemic control versus placebo. DUAL V compared IDegLira with the uptitration of insulin glargine 100 units/mL in patients who were inadequately controlled on 20–50 U of insulin glargine 100 units/mL, with IDegLira resulting in superior HbA 1c, a lower rate of hypoglycemia, and weight loss versus insulin glargine 100 units/mL.

The primary objective of the DUAL III clinical trial was to confirm the superiority of IDegLira compared with continuing on unchanged GLP-1RA therapy in controlling glycemia in insulin-naïve adult patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled with the maximum approved or tolerated dose of a GLP-1RA and OADs. The secondary objective of the trial was to compare the general efficacy and safety of IDegLira with unchanged GLP-1RA.

### Weekly fixed-dose insulin efsitora in type 2 diabetes without previous insulin therapy [^113CtYNu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

In previous treat-to-target trials, adjustments to the dose of basal insulin have been made at least weekly, according to fasting blood glucose levels. A fixed-dose regimen of insulin efsitora alfa (efsitora), a once-weekly basal insulin, may provide a benefit in adults with type 2 diabetes who have not received previous insulin therapy.

Methods

We conducted a 52-week, phase 3, open-label, treat-to-target trial involving adults with type 2 diabetes who had not previously received insulin therapy. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive once-weekly efsitora or once-daily insulin glargine U100 (glargine). Treatment with efsitora was initiated as a single dose of 100 U administered once weekly, with dose adjustments made every 4 weeks, as needed, at fixed doses of 150, 250, and 400 U to achieve fasting blood glucose levels of 80 to 130 mg per deciliter. Doses of glargine were adjusted weekly or more often according to a standard algorithm to reach the same glycemic goals. The primary end point, tested for noninferiority (noninferiority margin, 0.4 percentage points), was the change from baseline in the glycated hemoglobin level at 52 weeks.

Results

A total of 795 participants underwent randomization. The mean glycated hemoglobin level decreased from 8.20% at baseline to 7.05% at week 52 with efsitora (least-squares mean change, -1.19 percentage points) and from 8.28% to 7.08% with glargine (least-squares mean change, -1.16 percentage points); the estimated between-group difference of -0.03 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.18 to 0.12) confirmed the noninferiority of efsitora to glargine. Superiority was not shown (P = 0.68). The rate of combined clinically significant hypoglycemia (glucose level, < 54 mg per deciliter) or severe hypoglycemia (level 3; requiring assistance for treatment) was lower with efsitora than with glargine (0.50 events per participant-year of exposure with efsitora vs. 0.88 with glargine; estimated rate ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.84]). At week 52, the mean total weekly insulin dose was 289.1 U per week with efsitora and 332.8 U per week with glargine (estimated between-group difference, -43.7 U per week; 95% CI, -62.4 to -25.0); the median number of dose adjustments needed was 2 with efsitora and 8 with glargine.

Conclusions

In adults with type 2 diabetes who had not previously received insulin, once-weekly efsitora, administered in a fixed-dose regimen, was noninferior to once-daily glargine in reducing glycated hemoglobin levels. (Funded by Eli Lilly; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05662332.).

### Superior efficacy of insulin degludec / liraglutide versus insulin glargine U100 as add-on to sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor therapy: a randomized clinical trial in people with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes [^115DJASb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) versus insulin glargine 100units/mL (IGlar U100) as add-on to sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor therapy.

Materials and Methods

In this 26-week, phase IIIb, open-label, parallel-group, treat-to-target trial, conducted at 74 sites in 11 countries, insulin-naïve people aged ≥ 18years with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 53–97 mmol/mol (7.0–11.0%), body mass index 20–40kg/m 2 and inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D) on SGLT2 inhibitor ± oral antidiabetic drugs were randomized 1:1 to once-daily IDegLira or IGlar U100, both as add-on to existing therapy. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26.

Results

A total of 210 participants were randomized to each treatment arm. Mean HbA1c reductions were 21 mmol/mol (1.9%-points) with IDegLira and 18 mmol/mol (1.7%-points) with IGlar U100; confirming non-inferiority (P < 0.0001) and superiority of IDegLira (difference in HbA1c change -3.90 mmol/mol; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.45; -2.35 (-0.36%-points; 95% CI -0.50, -0.21)). Superiority for IDegLira over IGlar U100 was also confirmed for: body weight (difference-1.92kg; 95% CI -2.64, -1.19); severe or blood-glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia (rate ratio 0.42; 95% CI 0.23, 0.75); total daily insulin dose (difference -15.37U; 95% CI -19.60, -11.13). The overall treatment-emergent adverse event rate was higher with IDegLira as a result of higher increased lipase and nausea rates.

Conclusions

The favourable safety and efficacy profile of IDegLira in people with uncontrolled T2D on SGLT2 inhibitors, and lower weight gain and hypoglycaemia risk versus IGlar U100, suggest that clinicians should consider IDegLira initiation in this population.

### Clinical perspectives on the frequency of hypoglycemia in Treat-to-target randomized controlled trials comparing basal insulin analogs in type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^117CLpyL]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Despite these developments, hypoglycemia remains a fundamental challenge of basal insulin therapy. Fear of hypoglycemia, delays in treatment initiation partly due to the injection barrier, titration inertia and a lack of concordance are perhaps the main barriers to the effective use of insulin therapy in patients with T2D. To help overcome clinical inertia and to reduce the injection burden with daily basal insulin, two once-weekly basal insulins have been developed and are in late-stage clinical trials: insulin icodec (icodec) and basal insulin Fc efsitora alfa (efsitora). The efficacy of icodec and efsitora was demonstrated in phase 1 and phase 2 randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and further confirmed for icodec in the phase 3a ONWARDS program in insulin-naive individuals newly initiating insulin, individuals treated with basal insulin alone or individuals already established on basal-bolus insulin regimens.

Given the protracted duration of action of once-weekly insulin, physicians may have a theoretical concern regarding the risk of hypoglycemia. Contextualizing the risk of hypoglycemia observed with once-weekly insulin in RCTs requires a clear and up-to-date understanding of the risk of hypoglycemia seen with currently available once-daily or two times per day basal analogs. However, owing to heterogeneity in trial designs, hypoglycemia definitions, titration interventions and study populations, it is difficult to compare hypoglycemia outcomes between RCTs in a formal meta-analysis. Therefore, the aim of this narrative review was twofold: (1) to define the hypoglycemia risk with current one or two times per day basal insulin analogs; and (2) to use these data to help contextualize emerging once-weekly basal insulin hypoglycemia data. Here, we comprehensively summarize mean hypoglycemia rates from treat-to-target trials of daily basal insulins in T2D conducted over the past 22 years (2000–2022), with reference to the differences between studies. Importantly, given the narrative nature of this review, no comparative statistical analyses were possible.

2.3 Endpoints

2.3.1 Primary and secondary endpoints

The primary endpoint was change in baseline HbA1c from initiation of basal insulin (−90 days to +7 days) until 180 days of follow‐up, that is, the last HbA1c measurement in the +90─180 days following initiation of basal insulin (Figure 1). HbA1c values were identified using the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes system code 4548‐4. 24 Secondary endpoints included change in rates of hypoglycaemic episodes and change in proportion of patients with at least one episode of hypoglycaemia, and treatment discontinuation of degludec and glargine U300. Treatment discontinuation was measured as time‐to‐discontinuation of the first prescribed basal insulin and was defined as time from initiation of basal insulin until time of prescription of an alternative basal insulin (degludec, IDet, glargine U100, glargine U300 or NPH). Hypoglycaemia was defined according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) clinical modification (CM) codes 9/10 4 (for additional detail, see Supporting Information, Methods and Figure S2 in File S1).

2.3.2 Exploratory endpoints

Exploratory endpoints were change in body mass index (BMI) and mean end‐of‐study (EOS) basal insulin doses (units/day). Change in BMI was calculated from baseline to Day 180 of follow‐up, using weight (kg) from the EMR. Mean EOS basal insulin doses were calculated from the last available prescription within 180 days of initiation.

### Once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa versus once-daily insulin glargine U100 in adults with type 2 diabetes treated with basal and prandial insulin (QWINT-4): a phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^115LLR6e]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Insulin efsitora alfa (efsitora), a once-weekly basal insulin, has the potential to reduce the treatment burden of people with type 2 diabetes who require insulin. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of once-weekly efsitora compared with insulin glargine U100 in adults with type 2 diabetes treated with basal and prandial insulin.

Methods

This phase 3, randomised, 26-week, parallel-design, open-label, treat-to-target, non-inferiority study was done at 78 outpatient clinics and hospitals in Argentina, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Spain, and the USA (including Puerto Rico). Participants with type 2 diabetes (glycated haemoglobin [HbA 1c] 7.0–10.0%) treated with basal and prandial insulin and up to three non-insulin glucose-lowering agents were randomly assigned (1:1) to efsitora or glargine U100, both with prandial insulin lispro. Randomisation was stratified by country, baseline HbA 1c (< 8% vs ≥ 8%; < 63.9 mmol/mol vs ≥ 63.9 mmol/mol), and routine use of personal continuous glucose monitoring or flash glucose monitoring at randomisation (yes vs no). The primary endpoint was HbA 1c change from baseline to week 26 (non-inferiority margin 0.4%). The completed trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05462756).

Findings

Between Aug 11, 2022, and Feb 27, 2024, 1037 study participants were screened and 730 were randomly assigned to efsitora (n = 365) or glargine U100 (n = 365). 369 (51%) of 730 participants were female and 361 (49%) were male, the mean participant age was 58.9 years (SD 10.5), and the mean participant BMI was 31.85 kg/m 2 (SD 5.47). Using the treatment regimen estimand, the least-squares mean baseline HbA 1c was 8.18% (SE 0.04; 65.9 mmol/mol [SE 0.47]) in the efsitora group and 8.18% (0.04; 65.9 mmol/mol [0.47]) in the glargine U100 group. At week 26, the least-squares mean HbA 1c was 7.17% (SD 0.05; 54.8 mmol/mol [0.51]) in the efsitora group and 7.18 (0.05; 55.0 mmol/mol [0.51]) in the glargine U100 group. The change from baseline to week 26 using the treatment regimen estimand was -1.01 percentage points for the efsitora group and -1.00 percentage points for the glargine U100 group, indicating non-inferiority of efsitora versus glargine U100. Rates of overall and nocturnal level 2 (< 54 mg/dL; 3.0 mmol/L) or level 3 (severe) hypoglycaemia during the treatment period were similar for efsitora versus glargine U100 (6.6 vs 5.9 events per patient-year of exposure, estimated rate ratio [ERR] 1.11, 95% CI 0.85–1.44; p = 0.44; 0.67 vs 1.00 events per patient-year of exposure, ERR 0.67, 95% CI 0.44–1.01; p = 0.058), respectively. Adverse event occurrence was similar between efsitora and glargine U100. Serious adverse events were reported by 25 (7%) of 365 participants in the efsitora group and 23 (6%) of 365 participants in the glargine U100 group.

Interpretation

Efsitora showed non-inferior HbA 1c reductions and similar rates of combined clinically significant or severe hypoglycaemia versus glargine U100 in participants with type 2 diabetes treated with basal and prandial insulin. These findings show that efsitora is a well tolerated and efficacious once-weekly alternative to daily basal insulin, with a reduced injection frequency, for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes.

### Once-weekly basal insulin Fc demonstrated similar glycemic control to once-daily insulin degludec in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes: a phase 2 randomized control trial [^114d5LYM]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Basal insulin Fc (BIF) (insulin efsitora alfa; LY3209590), a fusion protein combining a novel single-chain insulin variant with a human IgG Fc domain, is designed for once-weekly basal insulin administration. This phase 2 study assessed the safety and efficacy of BIF versus degludec in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) previously treated with oral antihyperglycemic medications.

Research Design and Methods

During this randomized, parallel, open-label study, 278 insulin-naive patients with T2D were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive BIF once weekly or degludec once daily over the 26-week treatment period. Both groups were titrated to fasting glucose of 80–100 mg/dL (4.4 to < 5.6 mmol/L). The primary end point was HbA1c change from baseline to week 26 (noninferiority margin 0.4%). Secondary end points included fasting blood glucose (FBG), six-point glucose profiles, and rate of hypoglycemia.

Results

After 26 weeks of treatment, BIF demonstrated a noninferior HbA1c change from baseline versus degludec, with a treatment difference of 0.06% (90% CI -0.11, 0.24; P = 0.56). Both BIF and degludec treatment led to significant reductions in FBG from baseline. At week 26, the between-treatment difference for BIF versus degludec was 4.7 mg/dL (90% CI 0.1, 9.3; P = 0.09). The rate of level 2 hypoglycemia was low and not significantly different between treatment groups (BIF 0.22 events/patient/year, degludec 0.15 events/patient/year; P = 0.64); there was no severe hypoglycemia. The occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events was also similar between BIF and degludec.

Conclusions

Once-weekly BIF achieved excellent glycemic control similar to degludec, with no concerning hypoglycemia or other safety findings.

### The basis for weekly insulin therapy: evolving evidence with insulin icodec and insulin efsitora alfa [^1153w5cb]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

In patients with T1D, even with a tight fasting glucose target of less than 100 mg/dL, efsitora did not show a higher rate of hypoglycemia compared to IDeg. These findings were supported by TIR metrics, which did not show an increase in hypoglycemia, or its duration compared to IDeg. Retrospectively, when using all the data from the phase 2 program, the investigators indicated that efsitora was underdosed by approximately 30% in patients with T1D. This resulted in an initial period of hyperglycemia and led to a compensatory increase in the mealtime insulin to manage glycemia during the first couple of weeks. These observations highlight the importance of using a loading dose with the correct conversion factor and also suggest that there will be a learning curve for management of weekly basal dosing in patients with T1D.

Phase 3

Based on the phase 2 study results, efsitora has now initiated a phase 3 program, entitled QWINT (Once-Weekly [QW] Insulin Treatment), which consists of 5 clinical trials. All studies are currently ongoing. In the phase 3 studies, efsitora is formulated in solution and dosed in international units administered using prefilled insulin delivery devices.

Key design features of the QWINT trials are outlined in Table 2. QWINT 1 to 4 are treat-to-target studies in people with T2D that will assess efficacy and safety of efsitora compared to a once-daily comparator (IDeg or IGlar U100) in combination with noninsulin glucose-lowering medications. QWINT 1 compares a fixed dosing-escalation approach for once-weekly efsitora, with once-daily IGlar U100 as the comparator in insulin-naive patients. QWINT 2 is also studying an insulin-naive population, whereas QWINT 3 and 4 are in insulin-treated patients, the former in patients on basal insulin alone and the latter for those on basal-bolus therapy. QWINT 5 is studying people with T1D.

Clinical pharmacology

A 2-period, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the effect of efsitora compared to IGlar U100 in participants with T2D under conditions of increased hypoglycemic risk is reported inas having completed data collection for primary outcome measure (NCT identifier NCT04957914), but no results have been posted or disclosed at the time of this writing.

### Once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa: design and rationale for the QWINT phase 3 clinical development programme [^111KKfv7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Insulin efsitora alfa (efsitora) is a once-weekly basal insulin. This review describes the study design and rationale of the efsitora phase 3 Once Weekly (QW) Insulin Therapy (QWINT) clinical development programme, including the five trials, QWINT-1 through QWINT-5.

Materials and Methods

The five trials included insulin-naïve adults (QWINT-1 and -2) with type 2 diabetes (T2D), adults with T2D previously treated with basal insulin (QWINT-3 and -4), and QWINT-5 in adults with type 1 diabetes. All five trials were designed as multicentre, randomized, controlled, open-label, treat-to-target studies to investigate the efficacy and safety of efsitora versus active once-daily basal insulin comparators (insulin glargine U100 or insulin degludec U100). The primary objective of each trial is to compare the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 or 52 between efsitora and the active comparator. The key secondary objectives include change in fasting glucose, insulin dose and continuous glucose monitoring variables, and patient-reported outcome questionnaires.

Conclusions

The QWINT development programme includes a racially and geographically diverse population to provide important information regarding the efficacy and safety of efsitora and its clinical management of people with diabetes.

Icodec + Semaglutide (NN1535, IcoSema)

The ongoing COMBINE clinical development program comprises three active-controlled, open-label, phase 3 RCTs. The primary objective of the program is to evaluate change in HbA1c from baseline to the end of the treatment period in adult participants with T2DM who were previously treated with either basal insulin or GLP-1RA. These phase 3 trials are comparing once-weekly dosing of fixed-ratio combination icodec + semaglutide to once-weekly dosing of icodec (COMBINE 1), once-weekly dosing of semaglutide (COMBINE 2), and once-daily dosing of glargine (COMBINE 3).

### Once-weekly insulin icodec vs daily insulin degludec in adults with insulin-naive type 2 diabetes… [^114R2AVZ]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The primary end point was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26. The estimand was the difference between icodec and degludec for this end point including all randomized participants, irrespective of trial treatment adherence or changes to noninsulin glucose-lowering background medication. There was a statistically significant difference in combined level 2 or 3 hypoglycemia rate between treatments from baseline to week 26, with 0. 35 observed events per patient-year exposure with icodec and
0. 12 observed events per patient-year exposure with degludec. In this randomized controlled trial, once-weekly icodec was demonstrated to be both noninferior and superior to once-daily degludec in HbA1c reduction in people with type 2 diabetes who had not previously used insulin therapy, although the difference in HbA1c reduction of 0. 2 percentage points after 26 weeks of treatment may have marginal clinical significance.

First, the comparator insulin in the current trial was degludec, which has a lower risk of hypoglycemia than insulin glargine U100, the phase 2 trial comparator. 10, 11 Second, the population studied was expanded from people using metformin, with or without dipeptidyl peptidase. This trial demonstrated statistical superiority of icodec to degludec in HbA1c reduction from baseline to week 26. In contrast to the HbA1c reduction findings, fasting plasma glucose change at week 26 was similar in both treatment groups. Of note, prebreakfast SMBG values were similar between treatment groups, leading to comparable dose titration and total weekly insulin dose during the last 2 weeks of treatment. Further evaluation of continuous glucose monitoring data from other ONWARDS trials may clarify these findings.
7. In similar treat-to-target trials of current basal insulins in people with type 2 diabetes who were insulin-naive, level 2 or 3 hypoglycemia rates were higher than those observed in this trial, although the different designs of these trials should be considered. 4–6, 11–15 The difference in hypoglycemia is in line with the greater HbA1c reduction observed in the icodec group compared with the degludec group.

### Insulin degludec versus insulin glargine in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes: a 1-year, randomized, Treat-to-target trial (BEGIN once long) [^1137VmSn]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare ultra-long-acting insulin degludec with glargine for efficacy and safety in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs).

Research Design and Methods

In this 1-year, parallel-group, randomized, open-label, treat-to-target trial, adults with type 2 diabetes with A1C of 7–10% taking OADs were randomized 3:1 to receive once daily degludec or glargine, both with metformin. Insulin was titrated to achieve prebreakfast plasma glucose (PG) of 3.9–4.9 mmol/L. The primary end point was confirmation of noninferiority of degludec to glargine in A1C reduction after 52 weeks in an intent-to-treat analysis.

Results

In all, 1,030 participants (mean age 59 years; baseline A1C 8.2%) were randomized (degludec 773, glargine 257). Reduction in A1C with degludec was similar (noninferior) to that with glargine (1.06 vs. 1.19%), with an estimated treatment difference of degludec to glargine of 0.09% (95% CI -0.04 to 0.22). Overall rates of confirmed hypoglycemia (PG < 3.1 mmol/L or severe episodes requiring assistance) were similar, with degludec and glargine at 1.52 versus 1.85 episodes/patient-year of exposure (PYE). There were few episodes of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia in the overall population, and these occurred at a lower rate with degludec versus glargine (0.25 vs. 0.39 episodes/PYE; P = 0.038). Similar percentages of patients in both groups achieved A1C levels < 7% without hypoglycemia. End-of-trial mean daily insulin doses were 0.59 and 0.60 units/kg for degludec and glargine, respectively. Adverse event rates were similar.

Conclusions

Insulins degludec and glargine administered once daily in combination with OADs provided similar long-term glycemic control in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes, with lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia with degludec.

### Weekly fixed-dose insulin efsitora in type 2 diabetes without previous insulin therapy [^115JLuFT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study QWINT-1 was published by Julio Rosenstock and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the QWINT-1 study, the trial question was: is once-weekly insulin efsitora noninferior to once-daily insulin glargine in patients with T2DM who had not previously received insulin? In the QWINT-1 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the QWINT-1 study, the population was: 795 patients (397 female, 398 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with T2DM who had not previously received insulin. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM, latent autoimmune diabetes, or specific type of diabetes other than T2DM; history of > 1 episode of ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar state or coma requiring hospitalization within 6 months prior to screening; severe hypoglycemia episodes within 6 months prior to screening; hemoglobin abnormalities known to interfere with the measurement of HbA1c; acute myocardial infarction; cerebrovascular accident; coronary bypass surgery. In the QWINT-1 study, the interventions were: n = 397 insulin efsitora (single dose of 100 U administered once weekly, with dose adjustments made every 4 weeks at fixed doses of 150, 250, and 400 U to achieve fasting blood glucose levels of 80–130 mg/dL) n = 398 insulin glargine (single dose of 100 U administered once daily, with dose adjustments made weekly or more often according to standard algorithm to achieve fasting blood glucose levels of 80–130 mg/dL). In the QWINT-1 study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in least-squares mean reduction in HbA1c level at week 52 (1.19% vs. 1.16%; MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.18). In the QWINT-1 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in achievement of HbA1c target < 7.0% at week 52 (57% vs. 52%; OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.62) No significant difference in mean reduction in fasting blood glucose level at week 52 (53.7 mg/dL vs. 54.7 mg/dL; MD -1, 95% CI -5.7 to 3.7) Significant decrease in mean total weekly insulin dose at week 52 (289.1 U per week vs. 332.8 U per week; MD -43.7, 95% CI -62.4 to -25). In the QWINT-1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in hypoglycemia alert, severe hypoglycemia, nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes. significant differences in combined clinically significant or severe hypoglycemia (25.9% vs. 29.9%), non-nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes (24.4% vs. 27.9%). In the QWINT-1 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with T2DM who had not previously received insulin, insulin efsitora was noninferior to insulin glargine with respect to a least-squares mean reduction in HbA1c level at week 52.

### Superior efficacy with a fixed-ratio combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide (IDegLira) compared with insulin degludec and liraglutide in insulin-naïve Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes in a phase 3, open-label, randomized trial [^111oDVtM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

To investigate the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) compared with its individual components in Japanese people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) uncontrolled on an oral antidiabetic drug (OAD).

Materials and methods

This 52‐week, open‐label, multicentre, treat‐to‐target trial randomized participants (n = 819) 1:1:1 to IDegLira, liraglutide 1.8 mg or degludec, as add‐on to their pre‐trial OAD. The maximum IDegLira dose was 50 dose steps (50 U degludec/1.8 mg liraglutide), there was no maximum dose for degludec, and both were titrated based on individual blood glucose measurements.

Results

After 52 weeks, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) decreased by 26 mmol/mol with IDegLira vs 20 mmol/mol with degludec and liraglutide: estimated treatment differences were −6.91 mmol/mol (95% confidence interval [CI] –8.18; −5.64) and −5.30 mmol/mol (95% CI −6.58; −4.03), confirming non‐inferiority of IDegLira to degludec and superiority of IDegLira to liraglutide (P < .0001 for both [primary endpoint]). Mean body weight changes were 2.9 kg, 4.1 kg and −1.0 kg with IDegLira, degludec and liraglutide, respectively, showing superiority of IDegLira versus degludec (P = 0.0001), but a significant difference in favour of liraglutide (P < .0001). Rates of severe or blood glucose‐confirmed hypoglycaemia for IDegLira were lower versus degludec (rate ratio 0.48 [95% CI 0.35; 0.68]; P < .0001), but higher versus liraglutide (rate ratio 37.58 [95% CI 19.80; 71.31]; P < .0001). Mean daily total insulin dose was lower with IDegLira (27.7 U) versus degludec (34.8 U; P < .0001). Overall adverse event (AE) rates were similar. In total, 34.9%, 22.9% and 41.8% of IDegLira‐, degludec‐ and liraglutide‐treated participants experienced gastrointestinal AEs.

Conclusion

IDegLira was superior to degludec and liraglutide in terms of HbA1c reduction and superior to degludec in terms of body weight change and rates of hypoglycaemia in Japanese people with T2D.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes [^117UUiBw]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Once-weekly doses of efsitora were well tolerated in Japanese patients with T2D. All TEAEs were mild, and no TEAEs were considered related to treatment with efsitora. Despite the extended half-life of efsitora, prolonged hypoglycemia was not observed. No hypoglycemic events were categorized as severe, and each hypoglycemic event resolved with prompt recovery in the patient. Overall, the safety profile of efsitora, including the incidence of hypoglycemia, was similar to that of insulin degludec, and comparable to the safety profile of efsitora reported in global studies.

While these phase 1 studies of efsitora in Japanese patients with T2D are encouraging, there are several limitations, most of which are inherent to phase 1 studies such as low patient numbers, fixed dosing schedules, and shorter treatment periods. For the multiple-dose study, the dose of efsitora was not adjusted due to the short timeframe of the treatment period. Instead, each patient's fasting glucose level was targeted to the range of 100–139 mg/dl during the lead-in period of the study. Based on the results in phase 2 trials, a simplified efsitora dosing guidance is being assessed in phase 3 trials (including Japanese patients). While the exploratory safety profile observed was adequate, long-term safety studies are required to confirm the current findings, particularly in regard to hypoglycemia where the rates in the current study were too low to observe clinically meaningful differences between treatment groups. Efsitora is currently being evaluated in the QWINT development programs, which aim to analyze the efficacy and safety of once-weekly efsitora and its clinical management in a racially and geographically diverse population with T1D and T2D (including Japanese patients). Overall, our findings may be broadly applicable to insulin-naïve adults with T2D, adults with T2D previously treated with basal insulin, and adults with T1D.

### Once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa versus once daily insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111MwHP7]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Once-daily basal insulin is widely used in the management of type 2 diabetes, but poor adherence to daily injections often impairs glycaemic control. Once-weekly efsitora alfa may overcome these limitations, but pooled data assessing its comparative efficacy and safety remain limited.

Methods

PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library were searched up to July 2025 for RCTs comparing once-weekly efsitora with once daily insulin in adults with T2D. Weighted mean differences (MDs), odds ratios (ORs), and risk ratios (RRs) were pooled using a random-effects model, and results were reported with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Six RCTs comprising 3967 participants were included. There were no significant differences between once-weekly efsitora and daily insulin in change in HbA1c (MD -0.04; 95% CI -0.10 to 0.02; p = 0.15), change in fasting plasma glucose (MD 1.94mg/dL; 95% CI -2.98 to 6.86; p = 0.44), proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7%, change in body weight, or time below range. Efsitora was associated with an increase in time in range (MD 0.80 percentage points; 95% CI 0.09 to 1.52; p = 0.03) and a reduction in time above range (MD -1.45 percentage points; 95% CI -2.87 to -0.02; p = 0.05). The risk of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was higher with efsitora (RR 1.13; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.20; p = 0.0004), whereas serious adverse events, hypersensitivity reactions, injection-site reactions, and hypoglycaemia events were comparable between the two groups.

Conclusion

Once-weekly efsitora provides comparable glycaemic control and improved time-in-range compared to daily insulin, although with a higher rate of TEAEs.

### Insulin degludec versus insulin glargine in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes: a 1-year, randomized, Treat-to-target trial (BEGIN once long) [^113UwCo6]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To compare ultra-long-acting insulin degludec with glargine for efficacy and safety in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

In this 1-year, parallel-group, randomized, open-label, treat-to-target trial, adults with type 2 diabetes with A1C of 7−10% taking OADs were randomized 3:1 to receive once daily degludec or glargine, both with metformin. Insulin was titrated to achieve prebreakfast plasma glucose (PG) of 3.9−4.9 mmol/L. The primary end point was confirmation of noninferiority of degludec to glargine in A1C reduction after 52 weeks in an intent-to-treat analysis.

RESULTS

In all, 1,030 participants (mean age 59 years; baseline A1C 8.2%) were randomized (degludec 773, glargine 257). Reduction in A1C with degludec was similar (noninferior) to that with glargine (1.06 vs. 1.19%), with an estimated treatment difference of degludec to glargine of 0.09% (95% CI −0.04 to 0.22). Overall rates of confirmed hypoglycemia (PG < 3.1 mmol/L or severe episodes requiring assistance) were similar, with degludec and glargine at 1.52 versus 1.85 episodes/patient-year of exposure (PYE). There were few episodes of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia in the overall population, and these occurred at a lower rate with degludec versus glargine (0.25 vs. 0.39 episodes/PYE; P = 0.038). Similar percentages of patients in both groups achieved A1C levels < 7% without hypoglycemia. End-of-trial mean daily insulin doses were 0.59 and 0.60 units/kg for degludec and glargine, respectively. Adverse event rates were similar.

CONCLUSIONS

Insulins degludec and glargine administered once daily in combination with OADs provided similar long-term glycemic control in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes, with lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia with degludec.

The Clinical Profile of Degludec: What Did We Learn from the Phase 3 Trial Program?

The phase 3 trial program compared degludec almost exclusively with glargine U100 in a variety of cohorts: T1D, insulin-naïve T2D, and insulin-experienced T2D. The studies had TTT designs and used more aggressive titration algorithms (mostly targeting fasting glucose of 3.9 to < 5.0 mmol/L) compared with previous TTT trials (typically targeting ≤ 5.5 mmol/L) and the EDITION studies (4.4–5.6 mmol/L). At equivalent A1C levels, degludec was generally associated with lower risks for hypoglycemia — particularly for nocturnal events, which are more influenced by the basal component of a basal–bolus regimen. Pooled patient-level data for self-reported hypoglycemia from seven phase 3 trials have been analyzed by Ratner. Among insulin-naïve patients with T2D, those using degludec had statistically significantly lower rates of overall confirmed, nocturnal confirmed, and severe hypoglycemic episodes than those using glargine U100, with estimated rate ratios (RRs) of 0.83, 0.64, and 0.14, respectively. In the overall T2D population, patients using degludec also had significantly lower rates of overall confirmed and nocturnal confirmed episodes compared with those using glargine U100, with respective RR values of 0.83 and 0.68. For patients with T1D, the rate of nocturnal confirmed episodes was significantly lower with degludec compared with glargine U100 during maintenance treatment (RR 0.75).

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes [^112vPKzc]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This analysis aimed to assess the safety and tolerability of insulin efsitora alfa (efsitora, basal insulin Fc, LY3209590) and characterize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of efsitora in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

The single-dose escalation study assessed once-weekly efsitora administration in three patient cohorts: 5 mg for cohort 1; 10 mg for cohort 2 or placebo under double-blind conditions; and 20 mg for cohort 3 under open-label conditions. In the 6-week, multiple-dose study, patients started or continued using insulin degludec during the lead-in period, followed by randomization to efsitora (individualized fixed weekly dose) or insulin degludec (individualized fixed daily dose). Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety were examined.

Results

The mean age was 58.3 and 58.4 years, and mean body mass index was 25.6 and 26.8 kg/m 2 in the single-dose escalation (n = 31) and multiple-dose studies (n = 28), respectively. The pharmacokinetic profile showed a prolonged half-life of 15 to 16 days, with a low peak-to-trough ratio of 1.13 after the last dose with little fluctuation. All doses of efsitora (5, 10, and 20 mg) decreased mean fasting glucose levels from baseline to day 15 (single-dose study), with no notable changes observed after switching from insulin degludec (multiple-dose study). All treatment-emergent adverse events were mild and unrelated to the study drug. No severe hypoglycemic events were reported.

Conclusions

Efsitora was well tolerated, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were consistent with findings in prior global studies, supporting the participation of Japanese patients in phase 3 studies.

### One-year efficacy and safety of a fixed combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: results of a 26-week extension to a 26-week main trial [^114GFnjF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

We describe the 26‐week extension of DUAL I, a phase III, randomized, open‐label, three‐arm, parallel‐group, 26‐week trial in insulin‐naïve adults (≥ 18 years) with T2D conducted at 271 sites (19 countries). The original study has been described previously 5 and further detail on study methods is also provided in Table S1 of File S1. Briefly, patients were randomized (2: 1: 1) to once‐daily injections of IDegLira, insulin degludec or liraglutide (open‐label), with patients stratified for the following factors: baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration [HbA1c ≤ 8.3 or > 8.3% (≤ 67 or > 67 mmol/mol)]; concomitant oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) treatment (metformin background or metformin + pioglitazone background); and participation in a substudy involving a standardized meal test and continuous glucose monitoring 6, 7.

### Insulin degludec improves long-term glycaemic control similarly to insulin glargine but with fewer hypoglycaemic episodes in patients with advanced type 2 diabetes on basal-bolus insulin therapy [^115qwne1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to compare the long-term safety and efficacy of insulin degludec with those of insulin glargine in patients with advanced type 2 diabetes (T2D) over 78weeks (the 52-week main trial and a 26-week extension). Patients were randomized to once-daily insulin degludec or insulin glargine, with mealtime insulin aspart ± metformin ± pioglitazone, and titrated to pre-breakfast plasma glucose values of 3.9–4.9mmol/l (70–88mg/dl). After 78weeks, the overall rate of hypoglycaemia was 24% lower (p = 0.011) and the rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia was 31% lower (p = 0.016) with insulin degludec in the extension trial set, while both groups of patients achieved similar glycaemic control. Rates of adverse events and total insulin doses were similar for both groups in the safety analysis set. During 18months of treatment, insulin degludec+mealtime insulin aspart ± oral antidiabetic drugs in patients with T2D improves glycaemic control similarly, but confers lower risks of overall and nocturnal hypoglycaemia than with insulin glargine treatment.

Aim To compare the effect of insulin degludec and insulin glargine on health-related quality of life in patients with Type 2 diabetes starting on insulin therapy.

Methods Patient-level data from three open-label, randomized, treat-to-target trials of 26 or 52 weeks' duration were pooled using a weighted analysis in conjunction with a fixed-effects model. Insulin-naive patients received either insulin degludec (n = 1290) or insulin glargine (n = 632) once daily, in combination with oral anti-diabetic drugs. Glycaemic control was assessed via HbA 1c and fasting plasma glucose concentrations. Rates of hypoglycaemia, defined as plasma glucose < 3.1 mmol/l (< 56 mg/dl), were recorded. Health-related quality of life was evaluated using the 36-item Short Form (SF-36®) version 2 questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using a generalized linear model with treatment, trial, anti-diabetic therapy at baseline, gender, region and age as explanatory variables.

Results Insulin degludec was confirmed as non-inferior to insulin glargine based on HbA 1c concentrations. In each trial comprising the meta-analysis, fasting plasma glucose and confirmed overall and nocturnal (00.01–05.59 h) hypoglycaemia were all numerically or significantly lower with insulin degludec vs. insulin glargine. At endpoint, the overall physical health component score was significantly higher (better) with insulin degludec vs. insulin glargine [+0.66 (95% CI 0.04–1.28)], largely attributable to a difference [+1.10 (95% CI 0.22–1.98)] in the bodily pain domain score. In the mental domains, vitality was significantly higher with insulin degludec vs. insulin glargine [+0.81 (95% CI 0.01–1.59)].

Conclusions Compared with insulin glargine, insulin degludec leads to improvements in both mental and physical health status for patients with Type 2 diabetes initiating insulin therapy.

### Insulin degludec, an ultra-longacting basal insulin, versus insulin glargine in basal-bolus treatment with mealtime insulin aspart in type 2 diabetes (BEGIN basal-bolus type 2): a phase 3, randomised, open-label, Treat-to-target non-inferiority trial [^115e1xKf]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Basal insulin therapy does not stop loss of β-cell function, which is the hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and thus diabetes control inevitably deteriorates. Insulin degludec is a new, ultra-longacting basal insulin. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of insulin degludec compared with insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Methods

In this 52 week, phase 3, open-label, treat-to-target, non-inferiority trial, undertaken at 123 sites in 12 countries, we enrolled adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) of 7.0–10.0% after 3 months or more of any insulin regimen (with or without oral antidiabetic drugs). We randomly allocated eligible participants in a 3:1 ratio to receive once-daily subcutaneous insulin degludec or glargine, stratified by previous insulin regimen, via a central interactive response system. Basal insulin was titrated to a target plasma glucose concentration of 3.9- < 5.0 mmol/L self-measured before breakfast. The primary outcome was non-inferiority of degludec to glargine measured by change in HbA(1c) from baseline to week 52 (non-inferiority limit of 0.4%) by ANOVA in the full analysis set. We assessed rates of hypoglycaemia in all treated patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00972283.

Findings

744 (99%) of 755 participants randomly allocated degludec and 248 (99%) of 251 allocated glargine were included in the full analysis set (mean age 58.9 years [SD 9.3], diabetes duration 13.5 years [7.3], HbA(1c) 8.3% [0.8], and fasting plasma glucose 9.2 mmol/L [3.1]); 618 (82%) and 211 (84%) participants completed the trial. After 1 year, HbA(1c) decreased by 1.1% in the degludec group and 1.2% in the glargine group (estimated treatment difference [degludec-glargine] 0.08%, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.21), confirming non-inferiority. Rates of overall confirmed hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose < 3.1 mmol/L or severe episodes requiring assistance) were lower with degludec than glargine (11.1 vs 13.6 episodes per patient-year of exposure; estimated rate ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99; p = 0.0359), as were rates of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia (1.4 vs 1.8 episodes per patient-year of exposure; 0.75, 0.58 to 0.99; p = 0.0399). Rates of severe hypoglycaemia seemed similar (0.06 vs 0.05 episodes per patient-year of exposure for degludec and glargine) but were too low for assessment of differences. Rates of other adverse events did not differ between groups.

Interpretation

A policy of suboptimum diabetes control to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia and its consequences in advanced type 2 diabetes mellitus might be unwarranted with newer basal insulins such as degludec, which are associated with lower risks of hypoglycaemia than insulin glargine.

### Insulin degludec improves health-related quality of life (SF-36 ®) compared with insulin glargine in people with type 2 diabetes starting on basal insulin: a meta-analysis of phase 3a trials [^112kEtiC]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The strengths of this meta-analysis include the prospective nature of the study; the use of high-quality, patient-level data from regulatory trials; the randomized, controlled trial context; and the selection of an insulin-naive population with reduced expectations of starting insulin therapy. The randomized allocation of subjects means that the distribution of known and unknown confounders should, by chance, be approximately equally distributed between treatment groups. Another major strength of the present analysis is that a widely used and thoroughly validated health-related quality of life instrument (SF-36 version 2) was applied across several trials, enabling a consistent evaluation of health-related quality of life. Further analysis should be conducted to establish whether the observed advantage of insulin degludec, in terms of health status, translates into an improvement in health utility. This is a step beyond the SF-36 design, but would aid healthcare providers in assessing the economic effectiveness of insulin degludec compared with currently available diabetes treatments.

In conclusion, it is acknowledged by healthcare professionals that diabetes has a serious, negative impact on health-related quality of life. The results of this pre-planned meta-analysis, utilizing patient-level data, demonstrate that insulin degludec significantly improves health-related quality of life compared with insulin glargine, in patients with Type 2 diabetes starting insulin therapy.

### Once-weekly insulin efsitora alfa versus once daily insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jyHAT]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

By reducing injection frequency, a weekly insulin has the potential to improve adherence and patient satisfaction. Supporting this, a survey‐based study in the US found that over 90% of patients with type 2 diabetes and their physicians preferred a once‐weekly insulin regimen compared with daily injections. Multiple RCTs have evaluated once‐weekly efsitora against once‐daily insulin glargine or degludec, consistently demonstrating non‐inferior glycemic control in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The transition to a weekly insulin regimen may reflect outcomes already observed with once‐weekly GLP‐1 receptor agonists, which have demonstrated improved adherence and greater treatment satisfaction in both treatment‐naïve patients and those switching from daily therapy.

In the present meta‐analysis, once‐weekly efsitora achieved glycemic outcomes that were essentially equivalent to those observed with daily insulin. Both regimens produced comparable reductions in mean HbA1c, and the likelihood of attaining the recommended glycemic target (HbA1c < 7.0%) did not differ significantly. These findings are in line with prior evidence supporting the clinical equivalence of weekly and daily basal insulins. For example, Karakasis et al. reported no meaningful difference in HbA1c reduction between weekly and daily formulations, and Wang et al. found the estimated mean difference in HbA1c reduction to be negligible. An updated synthesis by Xue et al. similarly noted only a modest advantage for weekly analogues with a slightly higher odds of achieving HbA1c < 7% in patients treated with once‐weekly efsitora or icodec. Additional meta‐analyses focusing specifically on efsitora, including those by Raja et al. and Dutta et al. have also demonstrated non‐inferiority of weekly formulations compared to daily insulin in terms of HbA1c reduction and target attainment. These consistent findings across multiple independent syntheses reinforce the conclusion that the less frequent dosing schedule of efsitora does not compromise glycemic efficacy and may therefore represent a viable alternative to conventional daily insulin.
