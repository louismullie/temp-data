## Question

The patient is a 60-year-old male, presenting to the hospital unconscious, after successful resuscitation for an out of Hospital cardiac arrest. At the time of admission to the hospital, the patient's lab results show a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. But the patient also had normal to low levels of several electrolytes, including:
magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, CO2, calcium, BUN, total bilirubin, alkaline, albumin, with normal total protein. This combination of findings can seems unusual. What might this indicate?
* Renal tubular acidosis? (RTA): RTA is a group of disorders that cause the kidneys to fail to excrete acids properly. This can lead to a high anion gap metabolic acidosis?
* Drug-induced metabolic acidosis? the drugs we have already ruled out as possible causes for this patient's condition include: aspirin, salicylates and acetaminophen
* no signs of the following conditions until after he was admitted to the hospital following resuscitation for an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: such as liver disease, kidney disease. He was also evaluated by a doctor only 3 days before the cardiac arrest and was doing great and everything seemed normal at that time including his liver and kidney function.

Ruled out: diabetes, or Keto-acidocis
Slight, transient, elevations with high-sensitivity TROPONIN assays, and lactic acid. Both are trending down since his second day of admission to the hospital for the cardiac arrest and lactic acidosis was resolved by the end of the second day. GFR was initially low upon admission, it was never abnormal before his cardiac arrest, but that did seem to be gradually improving as well.

All labs looking for signs of infection or some possible source of SEPSIS were all negative past the 48hr and 72hr checks for growth. Multiple hepatitis panels were run and all of them came back negative although there does seem to be some signs of newly acquired, acute, liver and kidney injury.

List the possible explanations for the patient's lab results. What further testing and evaluation may be needed to determine the underlying cause?
It is also important to mention that the patient's blood gas analysis showed acidosis on admission but currently shows a normal pH, which would no longer be consistent with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis.
Though the patient still has an extremely high anion Gap at 29
Patient is oxygenating well.
No physical abnormalities found on any of the imaging studies, although he does have a tricuspic valve, we've also ruled out: pulmonary thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, heart attack, stroke, no signs of hemorrhage

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what might explain a persistently high anion gap metabolic acidosis after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, with normal pH and improving lactate, and how to evaluate and manage it step-by-step. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the acid–base framework and whether the current normal pH is compatible with a persistent high anion gap. Then, I should verify the anion gap calculation and correct for albumin. Next, I will review the time course of lactate clearance and whether the gap should have normalized with it. After that, I need to consider mixed acid–base disorders and the delta gap/delta bicarbonate ratio. Then, I will systematically exclude toxins, including toxic alcohols and acetaminophen-related pyroglutamic acidosis. I should also examine renal and hepatic contributions, including uremic acids and acute liver failure. Finally, I will outline targeted diagnostics and immediate management priorities, including when to consider renal replacement therapy and how to monitor for dynamic changes.

> Let me first confirm the acid–base framework so I don't jump to conclusions. A high anion gap metabolic acidosis reflects accumulation of unmeasured organic anions, but pH is determined by the net balance of all acid–base processes; therefore, a normal pH can coexist with a high anion gap if there is concurrent metabolic alkalosis or respiratory compensation, which is common in critically ill patients with mixed disorders [^113uTM3c] [^113XiPyq].

> Wait, let me verify the anion gap calculation and the need for albumin correction. The anion gap is Na+ − (Cl− + HCO3−), and with an AG of 29, that is clearly elevated; however, hypoalbuminemia lowers the apparent AG, so I should correct for albumin using a correction factor of roughly 2.5 mEq/L per 1 g/dL decrease from 4.0 g/dL, which can unmask a larger true gap than the raw number suggests [^1139Y3Re] [^113JDFth].

> I will now examine the lactate trajectory and whether the gap should have normalized with falling lactate. Lactate commonly surges in cardiac arrest and typically declines over 24–48 hours with resuscitation; however, the anion gap may remain high if other unmeasured anions are present or if there is a mixed process, so a persistent AG of 29 despite improving lactate and normal pH is not contradictory and warrants a search for additional anions or a superimposed process [^115wqnHb].

> Hold on, I should verify the possibility of a mixed disorder using the delta gap/delta bicarbonate ratio. A delta AG/delta HCO3− near 1.0 suggests a simple high anion gap acidosis, whereas a ratio less than 1.0 suggests a concurrent non–anion gap acidosis and a ratio greater than 1.0 suggests a concurrent metabolic alkalosis; given a markedly elevated AG with near-normal pH, a ratio above 1.0 is plausible and would fit a mixed high anion gap acidosis plus metabolic alkalosis, though I need to calculate it precisely and interpret cautiously because of variability in this index [^112ddQVR] [^115oS1GG].

> Next, I should review toxic alcohols and other ingestions, even though the history is limited. I need to check a serum osmolal gap and obtain methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropanol levels if the gap is elevated or suspicion remains; an osmolal gap greater than 10 mOsm/kg supports a volatile alcohol, but a normal gap does not exclude late presentations after metabolism to acids, so timing and clinical context matter [^111QBddX] [^1139Y3Re].

> But wait, what if this is acetaminophen-related pyroglutamic acidosis rather than a classic toxic alcohol. I should confirm acetaminophen exposure and consider checking a 5-oxoproline level, because chronic or high-dose acetaminophen, especially with malnutrition, critical illness, or concomitant flucloxacillin, can cause a persistent high anion gap acidosis that is not explained by lactate or ketones and resolves with drug cessation and supportive care [^117MaqNF] [^116ruKFW] [^117ANCCx].

> I need to ensure I am not missing renal and hepatic contributors. Acute kidney injury after cardiac arrest can increase phosphate, sulfate, and other uremic acids, contributing to a high anion gap; similarly, acute liver failure impairs lactate clearance and can add unmeasured anions, so serial creatinine, liver enzymes, bilirubin, and coagulation parameters should be tracked, and early nephrology involvement is reasonable if AKI and acidosis persist [^117E4SRg] [^116QtxgJ].

> Let me consider rhabdomyolysis and other sources of unmeasured anions. Cardiac arrest and chest compressions can cause muscle injury; released organic acids and phosphate can widen the gap, so I should check CK and trend it, recognizing that rhabdomyolysis is a recognized, albeit less common, contributor to high anion gap acidosis in the right clinical setting [^1164Bq47].

> I should double-check for less common entities if the gap remains unexplained. D-lactic acidosis, though rare, can contribute and may be missed on standard lactate assays; additionally, critically ill patients can accumulate Krebs cycle intermediates and other low–molecular-weight anions that are not routinely measured, which can account for a portion of the "missing" gap when lactate and ketones are not dominant [^114yzvp4] [^115MCZ8H].

> Next, I should review the immediate diagnostic workup to avoid delays. I will obtain a serum osmolal gap, repeat lactate, acetaminophen level, liver panel, phosphorus, and consider quantitative 5-oxoproline if exposure is plausible; if the osmolal gap is elevated or suspicion for toxic alcohols is high, I will send methanol and ethylene glycol levels and start fomepizole while awaiting results, and if pyroglutamic acidosis is suspected, I will stop offending agents and arrange for organic acid testing if available [^111QBddX] [^117MaqNF].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate to renal replacement therapy. Persistent high anion gap acidosis with organ dysfunction, refractory acidemia, or suspected toxin removal are accepted indications for early CRRT in acute liver failure and toxicologic scenarios; given the severity of the gap and the post–cardiac arrest milieu, early nephrology consultation for CRRT is reasonable if the gap does not improve with supportive care and removal of causative agents [^116QtxgJ] [^117E4SRg].

> I need to ensure supportive management aligns with evidence. Routine bicarbonate boluses are not beneficial in lactic acidosis or high anion gap acidosis unless there is a specific indication such as hyperkalemia or sodium channel blockade; instead, I should prioritize treating the underlying cause, optimizing perfusion, correcting electrolytes, and avoiding harm from overcorrection, while monitoring for refeeding-related acidosis if nutrition is initiated after prolonged starvation [^11645sjW] [^117RtCV8] [^117TvLMk].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaway so I don't miss anything. The combination of a persistent AG of 29 with normal pH and improving lactate is best explained by a mixed high anion gap metabolic acidosis superimposed with metabolic alkalosis or robust respiratory compensation; the next steps are to correct the AG for albumin, calculate the delta ratio, exclude toxic alcohols and acetaminophen-related pyroglutamic acidosis, assess renal and hepatic function, and consider early CRRT if the gap fails to improve, while avoiding routine bicarbonate outside of specific indications [^113uTM3c] [^115oS1GG] [^111QBddX] [^117MaqNF] [^116QtxgJ] [^11645sjW].

---

The most likely explanation for a high anion gap metabolic acidosis with normal/low electrolytes in a post-arrest patient is **lactic acidosis from global hypoperfusion** [^113uTM3c], with transient renal and hepatic dysfunction contributing to the gap and electrolyte shifts [^1164Bq47] [^117E4SRg]. Other considerations include **toxic ingestions** (ethylene glycol, methanol, metformin) [^111QBddX] [^115Dy7UF] and **starvation or alcoholic ketoacidosis** [^1152Ag4y] [^117Uu6UC], but these are less likely given the clinical context. RTA is not a cause of high anion gap acidosis [^111Prjk7]. Evaluate with serial lactate, ABG, renal and hepatic panels, toxicology screen, and osmolal gap [^111QBddX]; correct electrolytes and treat the underlying cause [^117E4SRg] [^117RtCV8].

---

## Pathophysiology of high anion gap metabolic acidosis

High anion gap metabolic acidosis arises when unmeasured anions accumulate, lowering bicarbonate and increasing the gap [^113JDFth]. Common causes include:

- **Lactic acidosis**: Tissue hypoperfusion from cardiac arrest drives anaerobic glycolysis and lactate accumulation [^117RtCV8].

- **Renal failure**: Reduced acid excretion and impaired bicarbonate reabsorption increase the gap [^113JDFth].

- **Toxic ingestions**: Methanol, ethylene glycol, and metformin produce acidic metabolites that raise the gap [^112agy4M] [^115Dy7UF].

- **Ketoacidosis**: Starvation or alcoholic ketoacidosis can contribute [^1164Bq47] [^117Uu6UC].

---

## Clinical significance of normal or low electrolytes

Normal or low electrolytes in this setting reflect **dilutional effects from resuscitation**, shifts from acidosis, and transient end-organ dysfunction:

- **Sodium**: Dilution from IV fluids or shifts from acidosis can lower sodium.

- **Potassium**: Acidosis shifts K+ intracellularly, causing low serum potassium despite total body deficits.

- **Chloride**: Dilution or bicarbonate shifts can lower chloride.

- **Calcium and magnesium**: Binding to lactate or citrate and shifts from acidosis can lower ionized levels.

## Differential diagnosis for high anion gap metabolic acidosis

| **Category** | **Specific causes** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Lactic acidosis | - Global hypoperfusion from cardiac arrest <br/> - Sepsis <br/> - Tissue ischemia | - Elevated lactate <br/> - Low pH <br/> - Low bicarbonate [^112JrXzC] [^113arnxS] |
| Renal failure | - Acute kidney injury <br/> - Chronic kidney disease | - Elevated creatinine <br/> - Uremia <br/> - Reduced acid excretion [^115VvaKe] |
| Toxic ingestions | - Methanol <br/> - Ethylene glycol <br/> - Metformin <br/> - Salicylates | - Osmolal gap <br/> - Specific toxicology <br/> - Clinical history [^111QBddX] [^115oS1GG] |
| Ketoacidosis | - Starvation <br/> - Alcoholic <br/> - Diabetic (unlikely here) | - Ketones <br/> - Low glucose or normal glucose <br/> - History of diabetes or alcohol use [^1152Ag4y] [^117Uu6UC] |
| Pyroglutamic acidosis | - Chronic acetaminophen use <br/> - Glutathione deficiency | - Persistent high anion gap <br/> - Low bicarbonate <br/> - History of acetaminophen use [^117MaqNF] [^117ANCCx] |

---

Given the post-arrest context, **lactic acidosis from global hypoperfusion is most likely**, with transient renal and hepatic dysfunction as contributors [^115wqnHb] [^117RtCV8] [^113JDFth] [^112JrXzC].

---

## Role of renal tubular acidosis (RTA)

RTA causes a **normal anion gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis**, not a high gap, and is therefore not the cause here [^111Prjk7].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Persistent high anion gap acidosis after cardiac arrest signals ongoing tissue hypoperfusion or organ dysfunction and is associated with higher mortality and complications [^115wqnHb]. Management centers on:

- **Identify and treat the cause**: Optimize perfusion, correct hypoxia, and address reversible contributors [^113uTM3c].

- **Correct electrolyte abnormalities**: Replace potassium, calcium, and magnesium as indicated [^1115QvWu].

- **Monitor renal and hepatic function**: Serial labs guide ongoing care and dialysis decisions [^117E4SRg].

- **Consider renal replacement therapy**: If acidosis persists with renal failure or toxin accumulation [^116QtxgJ].

---

## Recommended diagnostic tests and evaluations

- **Serial lactate measurements**: Track resolution or persistence of lactic acidosis [^111B9Fva].

- **Arterial blood gas analysis**: Assess acid–base status and compensation [^113XiPyq].

- **Renal function tests**: Creatinine, BUN, eGFR to assess AKI [^notfound].

- **Liver function tests**: AST, ALT, bilirubin for hepatic injury [^notfound].

- **Toxicology screen**: Acetaminophen, salicylates, metformin, toxic alcohols [^notfound].

- **Osmolal gap**: Screen for toxic alcohols [^111QBddX].

- **Urine ketones**: Evaluate for ketoacidosis [^117KgwXK].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely explanation for a high anion gap metabolic acidosis with normal/low electrolytes in a post-arrest patient is **lactic acidosis from global hypoperfusion**, with transient renal and hepatic dysfunction contributing to the gap and electrolyte shifts. RTA is not a cause of high gap acidosis. Evaluate with serial lactate, ABG, renal and hepatic panels, toxicology screen, and osmolal gap; correct electrolytes and treat the underlying cause [^115wqnHb].

### Differential diagnosis of metabolic acidosis [^114wBZVk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is defined as an acidemia created by one of three mechanisms: increased production of acids, decreased excretion of acids, or loss of alkali. This article addresses the identification and correct diagnosis of metabolic acidosis by reviewing important historical factors, pathophysiological principles, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings accompanying common high and normal anion gap metabolic acidoses in emergency department patients.

### Metabolic acidosis [^115VvaKe]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common disorder that occurs in a variety of clinical settings. The kidney maintains acid-base homeostasis through the elimination of protons and reabsorption/generation of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis develops when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or impaired, in situations such as rapid production of nonvolatile acids, abnormally high bicarbonate losses, and impaired acid excretion by the kidney. Determining the presence or absence of an anion gap is the first step in ascertaining the etiology of metabolic acidosis. The presence or absence of an osmolal gap, urine pH, and serum potassium levels may be useful in certain settings. We discuss a comprehensive approach to metabolic acidosis and present important clinical scenarios.

### Use of anion gap in the evaluation of a patient with metabolic acidosis [^113JDFth]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

High anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis, a common laboratory abnormality encountered in clinical practice, frequently is due to accumulation of organic acids such as lactic acid, keto acids, alcohol metabolites, and reduced kidney function. The cause of high AG metabolic acidosis often is established easily using historical and simple laboratory data. Despite this, several challenges in the diagnosis and management of high AG metabolic acidosis remain, including quantifying the increase in AG, understanding the relationship between changes in AG and serum bicarbonate level, and identifying the cause of high AG metabolic acidosis when common causes are ruled out. The present case was selected to highlight the importance of the correction of AG for serum albumin level, the use of actual baseline AG rather than mean normal AG, the relationship between changes in serum bicarbonate level and AG, and a systematic diagnostic approach to uncommon causes of high AG metabolic acidosis, such as 5-oxoproline acidosis (pyroglutamic acidosis).

Conclusions

The use of sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of metabolic acidosis remains controversial in the medical community. Review of the literature overall does not support routine use of bicarbonate, particularly in anion gap metabolic acidosis. The processes underlying pH balance in human physiology are multifaceted, and an understanding of the mechanisms at play, as well as the methods of providing sodium bicarbonate supplementation, will serve an emergency physician well. There are few data demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with sodium bicarbonate use in patients with shock states, DKA, rhabdomyolysis, or cardiac arrest (except in the presence of sodium channel blockade toxicity or hyperkalemia), as shown in Table 2. However, it may benefit patients with NAGMA and, despite physiologic rationale, there are minimal data from RCTs to justify this.

### Approach to the evaluation of a patient with an increased serum osmolal gap and high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis [^111QBddX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

An increase in serum osmolality and serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis is an important clue to exposure to one of the toxic alcohols, which include methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or isopropanol. However, the increase in serum osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis can occur either together or alone depending on several factors, including baseline serum osmolal gap, molecular weight of the alcohol, and stage of metabolism of the alcohol. In addition, other disorders, including diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and lactic acidosis, can cause high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis associated with an increased serum osmolal gap and therefore should be explored in the differential diagnosis. It is essential for clinicians to understand the value and limitations of osmolal gap to assist in reaching the correct diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment. In this teaching case, we present a systematic approach to diagnosing high serum osmolality and increased serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

### Acid-base disorders in the critically ill patient [^113uTM3c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are common in the intensive care unit. By utilizing a systematic approach to their diagnosis, it is easy to identify both simple and mixed disturbances. These disorders are divided into four major categories: metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided into anion gap and non-gap acidosis. Distinguishing between these is helpful in establishing the cause of the acidosis. Anion gap acidosis, caused by the accumulation of organic anions from sepsis, diabetes, alcohol use, and numerous drugs and toxins, is usually present on admission to the intensive care unit. Lactic acidosis from decreased delivery or utilization of oxygen is associated with increased mortality. This is likely secondary to the disease process, as opposed to the degree of acidemia. Treatment of an anion gap acidosis is aimed at the underlying disease or removal of the toxin. The use of therapy to normalize the pH is controversial. Non-gap acidoses result from disorders of renal tubular H + transport, decreased renal ammonia secretion, gastrointestinal and kidney losses of bicarbonate, dilution of serum bicarbonate from excessive intravenous fluid administration, or addition of hydrochloric acid. Metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder found in patients who are critically ill, and most often occurs after admission to the intensive care unit. Its etiology is most often secondary to the aggressive therapeutic interventions used to treat shock, acidemia, volume overload, severe coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and AKI. Treatment consists of volume resuscitation and repletion of potassium deficits. Aggressive lowering of the pH is usually not necessary. Respiratory disorders are caused by either decreased or increased minute ventilation. The use of permissive hypercapnia to prevent barotrauma has become the standard of care. The use of bicarbonate to correct the acidemia is not recommended. In patients at the extreme, the use of extracorporeal therapies to remove CO 2 can be considered.

---

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^117RtCV8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In summary, there is no mortality benefit or demonstrated improvement in hemodynamics with use of sodium bicarbonate in lactic acidosis, although emerging data suggest patients with persistent metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury may benefit from an infusion of bicarbonate after initial resuscitation. Emphasis should be placed on treatment of the underlying cause of the acidosis.

Recommendation

The routine use of bicarbonate supplementation for lactic acidosis and shock states is not recommended. There may be a role for an infusion of sodium bicarbonate after initial resuscitation in patients with acute kidney injury and pH < 7.2, although data are limited, and ongoing trials are evaluating benefit (Level of evidence: B).

Cardiac Arrest

The benefit of rapid pushes of ampules of sodium bicarbonate therapy in cardiac arrest is controversial. Decreased perfusion leads to hypoxia, anaerobic glycolysis, and generation of lactate. In addition, cessation of spontaneous ventilation causes buildup of carbon dioxide, decreases coronary perfusion pressure, and contributes to a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Acidemia has detrimental effects on hemodynamics, increases myocardial irritability, and lowers the threshold for dysrhythmias. Indeed, the use of sodium bicarbonate was initially part of Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines dating back to 1976. However, over the years, data emerged that did not show improvement in resuscitation outcomes with bicarbonate supplementation, thus calling into question the routine use of sodium bicarbonate during resuscitation. Subsequently, incorporation of sodium bicarbonate during cardiac arrest began to fall out of favor, instead emphasis has shifted to early defibrillation and high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation to augment coronary perfusion with improved patient centered outcomes.

### Early anion gap metabolic acidosis in acetaminophen overdose [^112Dze4N]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The study aimed to determine the incidence and clinical significance of early high (> 15 mEq/L) anion gap metabolic acidosis in acetaminophen (APAP) overdose.

Methods

A retrospective review of a cohort of 74 patients presenting within 24 hours of APAP overdose was conducted.

Results

Early high anion gap metabolic acidosis was present in 41% of patients on admission and persisted for 1.5 ± 0.1 days. The anion gap was associated with an elevated lactate level (4.5 ± 1 mmol/L) (r(2) = 0.66, P < .05), which persisted for 1 day. The lactate level increased in proportion to the APAP concentration (r(2) = 0.75, P < .05). Patients with increased anion gap had a higher incidence of confusion (48% vs 3%; P < .001) and lethargy (39% vs 6%; p = 0.003). Early high anion gap metabolic acidosis was found in the absence of shock or liver failure. All patients were treated with N-acetylcysteine and, despite the early high anion gap metabolic acidosis, none developed hepatic failure or hypoglycemia.

Conclusion

Early high anion gap metabolic acidosis in patients with APAP overdose is self-limited and does not predict clinical or laboratory outcomes. Persistent or late metabolic acidosis in the absence of liver failure is not likely due to APAP and should prompt a search for other causes of metabolic acidosis. Finally, APAP overdose should be considered in patients presenting to the emergency department with altered mental status, as this is a treatable condition when detected early.

### Heart failure related cardiogenic shock: an ISHLT consensus conference content summary [^111B9Fva]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) initial fundamental testing includes markers of hypoperfusion and organ injury, with lactate emphasized for severity assessment and resuscitation tracking. Lactate levels (venous or arterial) are considered integral, and a high lactate with other CS signs should provoke rapid investigation. Serial lactate clearance is increasingly validated as an optimal prognostic marker with greater (6–8 hours) and later (24 hours) clearance associated with outcomes including mortality. Beyond lactate, the severity of acidosis (anion gap, pH, bicarbonate, base excess) is associated with shock severity, non-cardiovascular organ failures and in-hospital mortality, and differentiating CS from other shock can be aided by evaluating mixed venous saturation, systemic vascular resistance, and infections (cultures, imaging, procalcitonin).

### An unusual case of hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, and increased anion gap acidosis [^117KgwXK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In this case report we try to illustrate the importance of correct diagnostic reasoning and the misleading features of point-of-care testing. This case illustrates that even though hyperglycemia, ketonuria, a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis, and acute abdominal pain almost inevitably warrant a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis, other possibilities still exist and need to be excluded. In that light, we emphasize the clinical and therapeutic importance of determining serum lactate and urinary ketones in the differential diagnosis of a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: metformin toxicities [^115Dy7UF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metformin toxicity is a rare but serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of metformin toxicity, including diagnosis, initial resuscitation, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Metformin is a common medication used for treatment of diabetes mellitus. Metformin toxicity is a spectrum of conditions that may be differentiated into three subgroups: metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA), metformin-induced lactic acidosis (MILA), and metformin-unrelated lactic acidosis (MULA). MILA is a condition found predominantly in patients chronically taking metformin or those with large acute overdoses. Conversely, MULA occurs in patients on metformin but with a critical illness stemming from a separate cause. MALA is rare but the most severe form, with mortality rates that reach 50%. Differentiating these entities is difficult in the ED setting without obtaining metformin levels. Patients with metformin toxicity present with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms and vital sign abnormalities. Laboratory analysis will reveal a high lactate with anion gap metabolic acidosis. Patients presenting with elevated lactate levels in the setting of metformin use should be considered at risk for the most severe form, MALA. Patients with MALA require aggressive treatment with intravenous fluids, treatment of any concomitant condition, and early consideration of hemodialysis, along with specialist consultation such as nephrology and toxicology.

Conclusions

An understanding of metformin toxicity can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114omyyE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

A rise in the AG in critically ill patients was long thought to be predominantly due to lactic acidosis, yet several studies reported poor sensitivity of the AG in detecting hyperlactataemia defined by a lactate threshold of 2.5 mmol/l. The AG was an excellent predictor of severe hyperlactataemia defined as lactate above 4 mmol/l or 5 mmol/l; however, Nichol and colleagues found that a higher lactate concentration even within a normal reference range of 2 mmol/l independently predicts mortality. The AG may thus miss patients at risk of mortality, as a considerable degree of hyperlactataemia is required to push the AG outside its normal reference range if the baseline AG is low. This is in keeping with the extreme difference in lactate levels between survivors and non-survivors observed in the study reporting the highest predictive value of AG. Other studies reported smaller, albeit mostly statistically significant, differences in lactate levels between survivors and non-survivors.

### Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: a clinical approach to Evaluation [^114PbRS8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Acid-base disturbances can result from kidney or nonkidney disorders. We present a case of high-volume ileostomy output causing large bicarbonate losses and resulting in a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis can present as a form of either acute or chronic metabolic acidosis. A complete clinical history and physical examination are critical initial steps to begin the evaluation process, followed by measuring serum electrolytes with a focus on potassium level, blood gas, urine pH, and either direct or indirect urine ammonium concentration. The present case was selected to highlight the differential diagnosis of a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and illustrate a systematic approach to this problem.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1145sbzR]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Much research has focussed on the prognostic value of serum lactate estimation in critically ill patients; however, in the context of work in low resource settings we have noted that facilities for lactate and blood gas analysis are frequently not available, prompting a search for alternative risk stratification tools. The anion gap (AG) is an easily calculated marker of metabolic acidosis based on analytes typically available from routine chemistry analysis. It may have potential as a risk stratification tool to identify sick patients at risk of deterioration, who would benefit from further management whilst pathophysiological processes are still reversible. The AG reflects the concentration of unmeasured anions as calculated by the formula Na + - (Cl − + HCO 3 −). Inclusion of potassium in the formula is recommended where its concentration is abnormally high or low. In healthy subjects, the unmeasured anions or "gap" is mostly made up of albumin; however, hypoalbuminaemia, commonly observed in critically ill patients, can lower the AG and mask an acidosis. Feldman and colleagues therefore recommended that the AG should be corrected for albumin.

### Improved pediatric ICU mortality prediction for respiratory diseases: machine learning and data subdivision insights [^115g2Xr5]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Monitoring ICU patients' parameters (lactate, pCO2, LDH, anion gap, electrolytes, INR, potassium, creatinine, bicarbonate and WBC) provide valuable insights into their pathophysiology i.e. medical progress and severity of critical illness, which help in guiding treatment or decision-making. The following explains the significance of the top parameters: elevated lactate levels indicate tissue hypoxia and anaerobic metabolism, often seen in shock or hypo perfusion states of ICU patients. Monitoring lactate helps assess tissue perfusion and response to treatment. Carbon dioxide (pCO2) is a byproduct of metabolism and is eliminated through respiration. Changes in pCO2 can indicate respiratory status and acid–base balance, especially in patients with respiratory failure or ventilation issues. Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme found in various tissues, including the heart, liver, and muscles. Elevated LDH levels can indicate tissue damage or breakdown, as seen in conditions like myocardial infarction, liver disease, or muscle injury. The elevated levels of LDH reflect the severity of critical illness. Whereas the anion gap is a calculated parameter that helps assess metabolic acidosis. An increased anion gap may indicate the presence of unmeasured anions, such as lactate, ketones, or toxins, which can be seen in conditions like diabetic ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis conditions that require extensive monitoring in ICU. Therefore, monitoring electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and chloride helps assess fluid and electrolyte balance, which is crucial in critically ill patients to prevent complications like arrhythmias or neurologic abnormalities. Potassium in particular is essential for proper cardiac and neuromuscular function. Abnormal potassium levels can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias and are often seen in conditions like renal failure or metabolic disorders. Bicarbonate is a buffer that helps maintain acid–base balance in the body. Changes in bicarbonate levels can indicate metabolic acidosis or alkalosis, which can occur in various critical illnesses. Creatinine is a waste product of muscle metabolism and is excreted by the kidneys. Elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function, which is common in critically ill patients and can impact drug dosing and fluid management. Monitoring WBC (White Blood Cell Count helps assess the inflammatory response and immune function in critically ill patients. Elevated WBC counts may indicate infection or inflammatory processes. Similarly, monitoring PCT (procalcitonin) as biomarker of bacterial infections. Additionally, INR (International Normalized Ratio) is a measure of blood coagulation and is used to monitor patients on anticoagulant therapy. Changes in INR can indicate alterations in the coagulation cascade and may require adjustments in medication.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis [^111BFXkQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 58-year-old female with known type 2 diabetes mellitus continued to take her usual medications, including metformin, an ACE inhibitor and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, while suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting. On presentation to the emergency department, she was found to have a profound lactic acidosis, cardiovascular instability and acute kidney injury. Despite a pH of 6.6, lactate of 14mmol/L and a brief asystolic cardiac arrest, supportive treatment and the use of renal replacement therapy resulted in rapid improvement in her acid-base abnormalities and haemodynamic parameters. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is a rare but life-threatening complication of diabetes management. Patient education and awareness amongst clinicians are paramount in the prevention and treatment of this condition.

### Association between delta anion gap / delta bicarbonate and outcome of surgical patients admitted to intensive care unit [^117HiFpC]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The presence of metabolic acidosis, whether characterized by elevated levels of chloride (hyperchloremia) or indicated by an increased AG, has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality among surgical and critically ill patients. The simple differentiation between these two types of acidosis has demonstrated prognostic significance and serves as a risk indicator for the development of organ dysfunctions, such as acute kidney injury, across multiple studies. Additionally, the initial computation of serum AG within ICU patients is proposed as a sensitive and specific tool for predicting outcomes. Evidence indicates that patients presenting with elevated AG values exhibit a greater frequency of hospital admissions, heightened rates of ICU admission, and augmented severity of illness, independent of concurrent electrolyte abnormalities. However, the simple assessment of acidosis by AG calculation has its limitations. To sustain anionic equilibrium, diverse compensatory mechanisms take place, encompassing the exchange, movement, or transformation of anions, often in response to changes in external conditions or internal factors. Therefore, most of the time metabolic acidosis is accompanied by mixed disorders. In patients with type two diabetes mellitus presenting with metabolic acidosis, the calculation of delta-AG/delta-Bic proved useful in discriminating associated disorders and their associations with clinical outcome, however, it is crucial to note that this diagnostic tool actually is subject to the influence of many factors and should be used only very cautiously and then only as one piece of information among many. The delta-AG/delta-Bic proved to be a feasible tool to discriminated mixed acidosis disturbance in trauma patients. To our knowledge, our study represents the first use of this clinical tool in a patient with high surgical risk.

### Falsely normal anion gap in severe salicylate poisoning caused by laboratory interference [^112V6Cur]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Severe salicylate poisoning is classically associated with an anion gap metabolic acidosis. However, high serum salicylate levels can cause false increase of laboratory chloride results on some analyzers. We present 2 cases of life-threatening salicylate poisoning with an apparently normal anion gap caused by an important laboratory interference. These cases highlight that the diagnosis of severe salicylism must be considered in all patients presenting with metabolic acidosis, even in the absence of an increased anion gap.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^113XiPyq]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis: etiologies, evaluation, and management [^1152Ag4y]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis is an endocrine emergency. A subset of diabetic patients may present with relative euglycemia with acidosis, known as euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA), which is often misdiagnosed due to a serum glucose < 250 mg/dL.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of EDKA for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

EDKA is comprised of serum glucose < 250 mg/dL with an anion gap metabolic acidosis and ketosis. It most commonly occurs in patients with a history of low glucose states such as starvation, chronic liver disease, pregnancy, infection, and alcohol use. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which result in increased urinary glucose excretion, are also associated with EDKA. The underlying pathophysiology involves insulin deficiency or resistance with glucagon release, poor glucose availability, ketone body production, and urinary glucose excretion. Patients typically present with nausea, vomiting, malaise, or fatigue. The physician must determine and treat the underlying etiology of EDKA. Laboratory assessment includes venous blood gas for serum pH, bicarbonate, and ketones. Management includes resuscitation with intravenous fluids, insulin, and glucose, with treatment of the underlying etiology.

Conclusions

Clinician knowledge of this condition can improve the evaluation and management of patients with EDKA.

### The anion gap [^112mhVzE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1977). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Serum Anion Gap" for lithium toxicity, ethylene glycol poisoning, sepsis and septic shock, chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis.

The Anion Gap Calculator measures the difference between cations (Na⁺) and anions (Cl⁻ + HCO₃⁻) in blood to evaluate metabolic acidosis. It identifies normal, elevated, or low anion gaps, aiding in diagnosing acid-base disorders.

The Anion Gap calculator provides a way to assess metabolic acidosis by analyzing the concentrations of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate in the blood. Here's how it works:

You start with three key inputs, measured in mmol/L:
- Sodium: Typically falls within a range of 120 to 160.
- Chloride: Ranges from 70 to 130.
- Bicarbonate: Generally between 10 and 40.

With these values, the anion gap is determined using the formula:
Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate)

This simple calculation yields an output, the anion gap, which is measured in mmol/L and usually falls within a physiological range, though theoretically it can extend from 0 to 10,000.

Interpreting the anion gap provides valuable clinical insights:

- A normal anion gap is typically between 8 and 12 mmol/L. This range suggests there are no significant unmeasured anions affecting the blood plasma.
- A high anion gap, generally above 12 mmol/L, may signal conditions such as ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, renal failure, or the ingestion of particular toxins like methanol or ethylene glycol.
- A low anion gap is less frequent and could be linked to hypoalbuminemia, hypercalcemia, or other more rare conditions.

By entering the values for sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate into the calculator, you can compute the anion gap and interpret the results to identify possible metabolic disturbances based on these guidelines.

Among other possible causes, high anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by metformin-induced lactic acidosis, toluene poisoning, acetaminophen overdose, alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, aspirin overdose, propylene glycol poisoning, ethylene glycol poisoning, starvation ketosis, multiple myeloma, maple syrup urine disease, lactic acidosis, methanol poisoning, sepsis, uremia, rhabdomyolysis, cyanide poisoning, isopropyl alcohol poisoning and pyroglutamic acidosis. In addition, high anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by medications such as aspirin.

### Acute kidney injury: a guide to diagnosis and management [^117E4SRg]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. The diagnostic evaluation can be used to classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. Physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction. Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia; volume overload; intractable acidosis; uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, or pleuritis; and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors (e.g., older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, liver failure) is important. Team-based approaches for prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive management are critical for improving outcomes.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^114yzvp4]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute metabolic acidosis of non-renal origin is usually a result of either lactic or ketoacidosis, both of which are associated with a high anion gap. There is increasing recognition, however, of a group of acidotic patients who have a large anion gap that is not explained by either keto- or lactic acidosis nor, in most cases, is inappropriate fluid resuscitation or ingestion of exogenous agents the cause.

Methods

Plasma ultrafiltrate from patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, acidosis of unknown cause, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, or acidosis as a result of base loss were examined enzymatically for the presence of low molecular weight anions including citrate, isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate and d-lactate. The results obtained from the study groups were compared with those obtained from control plasma from normal volunteers.

Results

In five patients with lactic acidosis, a significant increase in isocitrate (0.71 ± 0.35 mEq l -1), α-ketoglutarate (0.55 ± 0.35 mEq l -1), malate (0.59 ± 0.27 mEq l -1), and d-lactate (0.40 ± 0.51 mEq l -1) was observed. In 13 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, significant increases in isocitrate (0.42 ± 0.35 mEq l -1), α-ketoglutarate (0.41 ± 0.16 mEq l -1), malate (0.23 ± 0.18 mEq l -1) and d-lactate (0.16 ± 0.07 mEq l -1) were seen. Neither citrate nor succinate levels were increased. Similar findings were also observed in a further five patients with high anion gap acidosis of unknown origin with increases in isocitrate (0.95 ± 0.88 mEq l -1), α-ketoglutarate (0.65 ± 0.20 mEq l -1), succinate (0.34 ± 0.13 mEq l -1), malate (0.49 ± 0.19 mEq l -1) and d-lactate (0.18 ± 0.14 mEq l -1) being observed but not in citrate concentration. In five patients with a normal anion gap acidosis, no increases were observed except a modest rise in d-lactate (0.17 ± 0.14 mEq l -1).

Conclusion

The levels of certain low molecular weight anions usually associated with intermediary metabolism were found to be significantly elevated in the plasma ultrafiltrate obtained from patients with metabolic acidosis. Our results suggest that these hitherto unmeasured anions may significantly contribute to the generation of the anion gap in patients with lactic acidosis and acidosis of unknown aetiology and may be underestimated in diabetic ketoacidosis. These anions are not significantly elevated in patients with normal anion gap acidosis.

### Euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis in a 43-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus on SGLT-2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) [^111YPb27]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We report a case of euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) in a 43-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented to the emergency department with problems of vomiting, cough, shortness of breath and generalised weakness after following a ketogenic diet for 2 weeks. Therapy with sodium glucose transport protein-2 empagliflozin had been started 2 months prior. Initial evaluation revealed high anion gap metabolic acidosis with blood glucose level of 169mg/dL. Treatment for EDKA with fluid resuscitation, intravenous insulin and dextrose resolved her acidosis and symptoms in less than 24hours. Empaglifozin was discontinued on discharge. This entity represents a diagnostic challenge since the differential diagnosis is broad with a potentially misleading clinical presentation that can result in delayed diagnosis and adverse outcomes including acute kidney injury, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, cerebral oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock and death.

### Severe acidosis caused by starvation and stress [^117TvLMk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

A 1-year-old boy had severe anoxic brain injury owing to a cardiorespiratory arrest. He had an initial metabolic acidosis, but this largely resolved by hospital day 2. He then had a persistent, profound metabolic acidosis. Evaluation on hospital day 6 found that the patient had ketonemia, ketonuria, and a normal serum glucose level; he had received no intravenous dextrose during his hospitalization. The dextrose-free fluids were given initially to protect his brain from the deleterious effects of hyperglycemia after brain injury. Continuation beyond 24 hours was inadvertent. The initiation of dextrose-containing intravenous fluids produced a rapid resolution of his metabolic acidosis. Starvation usually produces a mild metabolic acidosis, but when combined with physiologic stress, starvation may cause a severe metabolic acidosis. Among the few reports of severe starvation ketoacidosis, our case is unique because the patient was monitored closely in an intensive care unit, allowing us to describe the time course of the acidosis in detail.

### Acquired pyloric stenosis resulting in hypokalaemic, hyperchloraemic normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. persistent vomiting in an adult: cause and effect [^116uUutn]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 24-year-old woman presented with a history of persistent vomiting for at least 3 months. This resulted in severe dehydration with risk of acute kidney injury. In addition to volume depletion, loss of gastric fluid resulted in a specific metabolic derangement-hypokalaemic, hypochloraemic normal anion gap metabolic alkalosis with a reduced ionised calcium concentration and paradoxical aciduria. These metabolic changes were reflected in her ECG. Investigation demonstrated acquired gastric outflow tract obstruction secondary to a pyloric peptic ulcer. The patient was resuscitated with intravenous crystalloid and electrolyte supplements. The acquired pyloric stenosis was treated medically with a proton pump inhibitor and Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy with excellent recovery.

### Severe euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis of multifactorial etiology in a type 2 diabetic patient treated with empagliflozin: case report and literature review [^113ErRxx]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiologic mechanism that leads to this serious metabolic disorder has been previously described. Accumulation of ketoacids in DKA, typically results in high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis complicating diabetic ketoacidosis during the recovery phase has been well documented; however, its contribution at presentation of euglycemic DKA has been only recently recognized. Furthermore, typical DKA commonly occurs in the presence of additional conditions (i.e. trauma, surgery or infection) that per se may lead to other coexisting types of metabolic acidosis (e.g. lactic, hyperchloremic). Herein, we describe a patient with T2DM under SGLT-2 treatment who 5 days post-surgery presented with severe acidosis and only mildly elevated anion gap, mild hyperglycemia and ketonuria. A traditional diagnostic approach based on serum glucose levels and the anion gap in this patient could have seriously misled us from the correct diagnosis.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^114qeCd4]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

The consequences of metabolic acidosis can be catastrophic and a considerable body of literature highlights the poor outlook in patients where lactic acid is the principal component of the acidaemia. This increase in blood lactate concentration reflects either increased lactate production, reduced lactate metabolism or, more commonly, a combination of the two. In patients with DKA, 3-hydroxybutyric acid and, to a lesser extent, acetoacetic acid play the major role in the generation of the anion gap. As outlined, however, in a third patient group, neither lactate nor 3-hydroxybutyrate is responsible for the elevated anion gap and the relevant anions responsible remain unknown. In the fourth patient group, acidosis is generated as a result of uncontrolled electrolyte loss either from the kidney (renal tubular acidosis) or the gut.

We have shown that the plasma concentrations of acids usually associated with the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle are significantly increased in patients with lactic acidosis as well as those with 'unexplained acidosis' with normal or near normal blood lactate concentrations. In DKA, although the concentrations of these acids are less strikingly elevated, they are still abnormal in the majority of patients when compared to controls. They are not, however, significantly elevated in patients with normal anion gap acidosis secondary to excess base loss. The accumulation of such acids may contribute significantly to the production of the anion gap and account, in part, for the 'missing' anions in patients with certain forms of acidosis. Recent studies, in keeping with previous work, have demonstrated the predictive value of acid-base variables on outcome in the critically ill. Furthermore, the calculation of unmeasured anions appears to be a better discriminator of outcome than lactate or base deficit.

### Severe metabolic alkalosis due to the combination of unmeasured cations and hypochloraemia in a patient with gastroparesia and frequent emesis [^1162Fyh9]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

This report describes a patient with gastroparesia and frequent emesis admitted with severe metabolic alkalaemia, hyperlactataemia and acute renal failure. Metabolic alkalaemia was not only due to hypochloraemia but also due to unmeasured cations. These cations were found to be present by calculating anion gap and strong ion gap (both were negative, which is rare). After massive gastric bleeding the patient had a cardiac arrest; following cardiopulmonary resuscitation and infusion of a large volume of normal saline, new blood tests revealed improvement in chloraemia but also a significant increase in the anion gap, suggesting that unmeasured anions rapidly overcame unmeasured cations. The patient died after sequential episodes of cardiac arrest. Anion gap and strong ion gap were useful in the diagnosis of this "hidden" unusual cause of metabolic alkalosis and also in the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis after cardiac arrest, even with normal/high values of base excess and bicarbonate.

### Approach to patients with high anion gap metabolic acidosis: core curriculum 2021 [^115oS1GG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The anion gap (AG) is a mathematical construct that compares the blood sodium concentration with the sum of the chloride and bicarbonate concentrations. It is a helpful calculation that divides the metabolic acidoses into 2 categories: high AG metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis-and thereby delimits the potential etiologies of the disorder. When the [AG] is compared with changes in the bicarbonate concentration, other occult acid-base disorders can be identified. Furthermore, finding that the AG is very small or negative can suggest several occult clinical disorders or raise the possibility of electrolyte measurement artifacts. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we discuss cases that represent several very common and several rare causes of HAGMA. These case scenarios highlight how the AG can provide vital clues that direct the clinician toward the correct diagnosis. We also show how to calculate and, if necessary, correct the AG for hypoalbuminemia and severe hyperglycemia. Plasma osmolality and osmolal gap calculations are described and when used together with the AG guide appropriate clinical decision making.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^114zLWYZ]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is a common presentation in acute medicine and in only a minority of cases can renal failure alone be considered the sole cause of the acidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and 'classic' lactic acidosis (taken as a blood lactate in excess of 5 mmol l -1) account for most of the remaining cases. Amongst clinicians there is an increasing awareness that there is often an important discrepancy between the measured acidosis and the associated base deficit, suggesting that other anions must contribute to the generation of the anion gap. Further evidence to support the hypothesis of additional 'missing anions' is supplied by observations on patients receiving bicarbonate-buffered haemofiltration for treatment of lactic acidosis where it is possible to calculate the net rates of lactate removal and bicarbonate donation by the haemofilter. In patients whose blood pH is slowly falling (thereby excluding any possible confounding effect of other blood buffers), it is not uncommon for the rate of bicarbonate donation to exceed the rate of lactate removal by as much as twofold (PJ Hilton, unpublished observations). This implies that not only lactic acid, but other 'unknown' acids are being neutralised by the bicarbonate in the haemofiltration replacement fluid.

Preliminary experiments performed in this laboratory with high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry on plasma ultrafiltrate obtained from patients with metabolic acidosis had suggested that anions principally associated with the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle were significantly elevated in patients with unexplained metabolic acidosis. We undertook an enzymatic study of anions of the Krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis whose standard base deficit was 8 mmol l -1 or greater. The samples were obtained from consecutive patients who fulfilled these requirements except those with a normal anion gap, which were collected subsequently. The results obtained from the patient samples were compared to control values obtained from healthy volunteers.

### Metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis? Evaluation of a low plasma bicarbonate using the urine anion gap [^1116ZUbJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hypobicarbonatemia, or a reduced bicarbonate concentration in plasma, is a finding seen in 3 acid-base disorders: metabolic acidosis, chronic respiratory alkalosis and mixed metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. Hypobicarbonatemia due to chronic respiratory alkalosis is often misdiagnosed as a metabolic acidosis and mistreated with the administration of alkali therapy. Proper diagnosis of the cause of hypobicarbonatemia requires integration of the laboratory values, arterial blood gas, and clinical history. The information derived from the urinary response to the prevailing acid-base disorder is useful to arrive at the correct diagnosis. We discuss the use of urine anion gap, as a surrogate marker of urine ammonium excretion, in the evaluation of a patient with low plasma bicarbonate concentration to differentiate between metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. The interpretation and limitations of urine acid-base indexes at bedside (urine pH, urine bicarbonate, and urine anion gap) to evaluate urine acidification are discussed.

### Severe hyperkalemia requiring hospitalization: predictors of mortality [^111QD9QU]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study was designed to identify the principal factors predisposing to severe hyperkalemia and to analyze the relationship between the serum K + level and clinical outcomes, including in-hospital mortality. We also investigated the association between in-hospital mortality and multiple clinical factors in patients with severe hyperkalemia.

Severe hyperkalemia was shown to result from various medical conditions, predisposing factors, and medications. Despite appropriate and aggressive management, the in-hospital mortality was very high (30.7%). The meaningful risk factors for in-hospital mortality were greater differences in serum K + levels at admission and its highest levels, underlying malignancy, precipitating factors such as infection and bleeding, emergent admission, the presence of MOF at hyperkalemia diagnosis, the occurrence of cardiac arrest as a symptom of hyperkalemia, and ICU treatment. Also notable is the fact that patients with normal baseline renal function had a much higher mortality rate. In contrast, the mortality rate decreased in patients with drug-induced hyperkalemia. Aggressive initial treatment for severe hyperkalemia resulted in improvement of K + values and consequently lowered the in-hospital mortality rate.

The results of the present study correspond well with those of earlier studies which reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, K + -sparing diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and K + supplements are associated with an increased incidence of hyperkalemia. In addition, our results agree with several published studies that factors such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and metabolic acidosis may contribute to the development of hyperkalemia. The association between renal impairment and hyperkalemia is well documented. Our findings are consistent with those of prior studies indicating that the mortality rate in patients with hyperkalemia increases as the serum K + level increases. Additionally, the finding that most cases resulting in death are complicated by other medical conditions such as renal failure and metabolic acidosis is supported by the present study. The results of our study coincide well with those of Evans and colleagues, showing that ECG changes that are more severe, such as cardiac arrest, are associated with greater degrees of hyperkalemia and with a higher mortality rate.

### Differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis: value of a systematic approach [^113qrZvM]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Nongap metabolic acidosis is a common form of both acute and chronic metabolic acidosis. Because derangements in renal acid-base regulation are a common cause of nongap metabolic acidosis, studies to evaluate renal acidification often serve as the mainstay of differential diagnosis. However, in many cases, information obtained from the history and physical examination, evaluation of the electrolyte pattern (to determine if a nongap acidosis alone or a combined nongap and high anion gap metabolic acidosis is present), and examination of the serum potassium concentration (to characterize the disorder as hyperkalemic or hypokalemic in nature) is sufficient to make a presumptive diagnosis without more sophisticated studies. If this information proves insufficient, indirect estimates or direct measurement of urinary NH(4)(+) concentration, measurement of urine pH, and assessment of urinary HCO(3)(-) excretion can help in establishing the diagnosis. This review summarizes current information concerning the pathophysiology of this electrolyte pattern and the value and limitations of all of the diagnostic studies available. It also provides a systematic and cost-effective approach to the differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^115W2W1J]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

This study thus raises the question about what is hoped to be achieved when initially investigating possible DKA in an acute setting. Is it to establish if there is hyperglycemia present (or another cause) which is sufficient to lead to hyperketonemia and then to determine whether this has resulted in a significant metabolic acidosis (a 'D-K-A' strategy)? Or is it to establish the reverse, namely, if there is a metabolic acidosis present, whether ketonemia is its major (or only) source and then to determine if hyperglycemia also exists (an 'A-K-D' strategy)? It could be argued that any life-threatening situation is likely to be a consequence of acidosis rather than ketonemia, irrespective of whether hyperglycemia exists, although acid-base compensatory mechanisms mean pH or bicarbonate measurements alone are unlikely to be perfect triage tests either. Certainly, guidelines cannot cover every clinical presentation and, as previously pointed out, some, such as the ADA position statement, make clear that the criteria may be inaccurate in roughly 10% of cases. In our study, 22 of 133 episodes of potential DKA (~ 17%) with a bicarbonate concentration ≤ 18mmol/L were either not diagnostically hyperglycemic (> 13.9mmol/L, n = 8) or ketonemic (≤ 3mmol/L, n = 9) or both (n = 5).

### Severe acidosis in patients taking metformin – rapid reversal and survival despite high APACHE score [^114mpR6s]. Diabetic Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Metformin has been shown to reduce complications and mortality from Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is increasingly used to treat this condition. This agent is, however, associated with a rare but serious risk of lactic acidosis.

Case Report

We present cases of 10 patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who developed acute renal failure and severe lactic acidosis. Despite the severity of their illness, all patients but one survived.

Conclusions

The increasing prevalence of Type 2 diabetes and its treatment with metformin might result in more cases of lactic acidosis. However our case report demonstrates that early and aggressive treatment with haemofiltration can improve outcomes even in the presence of severe acidosis.

### A quantitative analysis of the acidosis of cardiac arrest: a prospective observational study [^115wqnHb]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Results

One hundred and five patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were included in this study. The demographics of these patients are presented in Table 1. They had a mean age of 62.2 years and included 75 (71%) males and 30 (29%) females. Most of the patients had an initial rhythm of asystole (54%) or pulseless electrical activity (38%), and the number of witnessed arrests was 10 (10%). The main cause of collapse was cardiogenic (57%), followed by trauma (12%) and hanging (9%); 19% of the patients had a return of spontaneous circulation.

These 105 patients were compared with 28 patients with minor injuries as a comparison group (mean age 40.2 years; 19 males and 8 females). The mean interval from arrival at the emergency room to blood sampling was similar between the two groups (cardiac arrest, 12.9 ± 10.3 min; minor injury, 12.3 ± 5.5 min; P = 0.78).

The acid–base variables in cardiac arrest and minor injuries are shown in Table 2. Except for sodium and SID a, all variables were significantly different between the two groups. In brief, patients with cardiac arrest were acidemic (pH 6.90 versus 7.39; P < 0.0001), secondary to metabolic acidosis (standard base excess -19.1 versus -1.5 meq/l; P < 0.0001) compared with the comparison group. Patients with cardiac arrest were also hyperkalemic, hypochloremic, hyperlactatemic and hyperphosphatemic. The anion gap and SIG were also higher in patients with cardiac arrest.

Figure 1 shows the acid–base impact of each variable in patients with cardiac arrest compared with the comparison group. Lactate was the strongest determinant of acidemia, accounting for -11.8 meq/l of acidifying effect. However, SIG contributed -7.3 meq/l of acidifying effect and phosphate -2.9 meq/l. This acidemia was attenuated by the alkalinizing effect of several variables. A decrease in chloride had the strongest alkalinizing effect (+4.6 meq/l), followed by an increase in potassium (+3.6 meq/l) and a decrease in albumin (+3.5 meq/l).

Laboratory monitoring

During hospitalization, patients with T2D underwent daily monitoring of acid–base balance (bicarbonate, anion gap), kidney function (creatinine, eGFR, electrolytes), and hemoglobin. If an abnormal increase in the anion gap or a reduction in bicarbonate levels was detected, treatment was paused, and serum ketones and lactate levels were measured. For patients without T2D, laboratory monitoring included assessments on days 1, 3, 15, and at discharge, focusing on renal function (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, electrolytes, and bicarbonate). Glucose levels of participants were monitored as per standard practice to maintain blood glucose levels ≤ 180 mg/dL as recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign.

### Acquired pyroglutamic acidosis due to long-term dicloxacillin and paracetamol use [^117MaqNF]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

An 85-year-old man with a background of transfusion-dependent chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and chronic kidney disease stage III presented with symptomatic anaemia, acute kidney injury, sepsis and high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA). Initial treatment with intravenous antibiotics and blood transfusion was complicated by transfusion-associated circulatory overload, necessitating diuresis and non-invasive ventilation. Despite gradual clinical improvement, the patient's HAGMA persisted, and no cause was identified on urine testing or renal ultrasound. As the patient was on long-term dicloxacillin for infective endocarditis prophylaxis and regular paracetamol, pyroglutamic acidosis (PGA) (5-oxoproline acidosis) was considered. This was later confirmed with elevated serum levels, and the HAGMA resolved following cessation of these medications. Although considered an uncommon cause of HAGMA, PGA is likely also under-recognised, and to our knowledge, this may be the second reported case in the context of dicloxacillin.

### Challenging management dogma where evidence is non-existent, weak, or outdated: part II [^115N1o6N]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Many dogmas influence daily clinical practice, and critical care medicine is no exception. We previously highlighted the weak, questionable, and often contrary evidence base underpinning four established medical managements-loop diuretics for acute heart failure, routine use of heparin thromboprophylaxis, rate of sodium correction for hyponatremia, and 'every hour counts' for treating bacterial meningitis. We now provide four further examples in this "Dogma II" piece (a week's course of antibiotics, diabetic ketoacidosis algorithms, sodium bicarbonate to improve ventricular contractility during severe metabolic acidosis, and phosphate replacement for hypophosphatemia) where routine practice warrants re-appraisal.

### Evaluation and management of the critically ill adult with diabetic ketoacidosis [^113gT6Kk]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a hyperglycemic emergency that presents commonly to the emergency department. Severe DKA has the potential for significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized early and treated appropriately. It is incumbent on the emergency clinician to be vigilant in the management of these critically ill patients.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the emergency medicine management of the adult patient with severe DKA.

Discussion

DKA is a condition found most commonly in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, often due to nonadherence with diabetic medications or an inciting event, such as infection or ischemia. The severity of DKA is classified based on the level of acidosis present rather than absolute glucose level. The management of severe DKA involves assessing and treating the inciting event, fluid hydration, insulin, and potassium repletion. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent the complications that can occur.

Conclusions

DKA is a medical condition that has the potential for significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized and managed appropriately.

Among other possible causes, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by toluene poisoning, acute diarrhea, posthypocapnic acidosis, chronic kidney disease, hyperkalemic distal renal tubular acidosis, proximal renal tubular acidosis, hypokalemic distal renal tubular acidosis, pancreatic fistula, Addison's disease, ileostomy and complications of ureterosigmoidostomy. In addition, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by medications such as acetazolamide and cholestyramine.

### Acute cyanide poisoning [^113wkv77]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Cyanide intoxication is an extremely rare event. We report a case of a teenager presenting with unresponsiveness, hemodynamic instability, and profound anion gap metabolic acidosis secondary to elevated lactate levels. It was later confirmed that he was a victim of cyanide poisoning.

Design

Individual case report.

Setting

Pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital.

Patient

A 17-yr-old male presented with seizures, apnea, and cardiovascular collapse. His laboratory evaluation revealed extreme anion gap metabolic acidosis, elevated lactate levels, and absent arteriovenous saturation difference.

Interventions

The patient required inotropic support and external cardiac pacing for hemodynamic instability. Serial measurements of electrolytes and arterial and central venous blood gases were performed. When cyanide poisoning was suspected he received antidote therapy, administered initially with interval dosing and then as a continuous infusion. The antidote infusions were stopped because of a high level of resultant methemoglobinemia and the belief that all ingested cyanide had been cleared, given the time from exposure. The patient never recovered neurologic function, was declared brain dead, and became a tissue and organ donor.

Conclusion

Cyanide poisoning is a rare and potentially fatal event. Prompt recognition of its possibility in a critically ill patient can lead to early intervention with antidote therapy and decrease the extent of morbidity and mortality.

### Anion-gap metabolic acidemia: case-based analyses [^112agy4M]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Not all metabolic acidosis is associated with an elevated chloride replacing the low bicarbonate concentration. When other acids, usually non-Cl organic acids are introduced into the blood an "Anion Gap" metabolic acidosis exists. The serum anion gap is calculated as [Na+]-([Cl -]+[HCO 3 -]) = Unmeasured anions-Unmeasured cations. The normal gap is mostly due to negatively charged albumin: (Normal range: 8–12meq/l) as the unmeasured anions, since albumin is usually reported in grams per liter (not meq/l). For diagnostic purposes, calculating the serum anion gap allows determination of coexisting acid-base processes in a patient. Assuming a 1:1 fall in bicarbonate compared with rise in anion gap in a usual gap acidosis, one can compare the Δ anion Gap/ΔHCO 3 -: Δ gap = observed anion gap-normal anion gap and the Δ HCO 3 - = normal HCO 3 - -observed HCO 3 -. A ratio of 1 suggests a simple anion gap acidosis; if < 1 a superimposed non-gap acidosis is lowering HCO 3 - and if > 1 a superimposed metabolic alkalosis is raising HCO 3 -. Comparing the anion gap and osmolar gap can narrow the differential diagnosis to include toxic alcohol ingestions with acidic metabolites such as ethylene glycol and methanol. Not all metabolic acidosis is associated with an elevated chloride replacing the low bicarbonate concentration. When other acids, usually non-Cl organic acids are introduced into the blood an "Anion Gap" metabolic acidosis exists. This review will consider the generation of anion-gap acidoses through case discussions.

### Use of the deltaAG / deltaHCO3-ratio in the diagnosis of mixed acid-base disorders [^112ddQVR]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

When a strong acid is added to plasma, one expects a quantitative relationship between excess anion gap (DeltaAG) and bicarbonate deficit (DeltaHCO(3)(-)) with the DeltaAG/DeltaHCO(3)(-) ratio close to unity. If true, then this ratio could be used to diagnose mixed acid-base disorders in patients with metabolic acidosis. Although the mean ratio in selected patients is close to unity, this ratio also has a wide range, making its use in individual patients problematic. The ratio should therefore be used cautiously in making a diagnosis of mixed acid-base disorders.

### Glyburide and metformin [^112JrXzC]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Lactic Acidosis

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with glyburide and metformin; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Glyburide and metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, glyburide and metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, glyburide and metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking glyburide and metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).

### Flucloxacillin and paracetamol induced pyroglutamic acidosis [^116ruKFW]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Treatment

The HAGMA was initially of an unknown cause, so the patient was commenced on sodium bicarbonate 840 mg daily. The venous blood gas showed acidaemia (pH 7.26; pCO 2 20 mm Hg; pO 2 37 mm Hg; bicarbonate 9 mmol/L) indicating significant high anion gap metabolic acidosis (table 1). Usual causes for AKI and HAGMA were considered and excluded. Eventually, PGA was suspected to be caused by flucloxacillin and paracetamol with the risk factors being chronic kidney disease and advanced age.

The flucloxacillin was ceased and the patient was instead treated with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. This was sufficient to resolve the HAGMA without the cessation of paracetamol or the institution of a NAC infusion (table 2). In retrospect, at the time, paracetamol could also have been ceased to help resolve the HAGMA.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1173k2bp]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes is a frequent comorbidity in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2], with a reported prevalence ranging from 9 to 20%. Diabetes is also associated with more than twofold higher risk of having severe or critical corona virus disease 2019 [COVID-19] illness and about threefold increased risk of in-hospital mortality compared to SARS-CoV-2 patients without diabetes. A possible reason for increased mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with diabetes is from the complication of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), one of the most serious acute complications of diabetes. DKA is characterized by the presence of hyperglycaemia [usually < 800 mg/dl and generally between 350 to 500 mg/dl], arterial pH [≤ 7.30], anion gap [> 12 mEq/l], and serum bicarbonate [≤ 15 mmol/l].

In light of newer case reports, case-series and cohort studies that were done to re-evaluate the association of SARS-CoV-2 and development of DKA, we aimed to analyse the demographic and biochemical parameters and the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with DKA with larger and better-quality data.

### Occult metformin toxicity in three patients with profound lactic acidosis [^116TT8RU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There are 20.8 million Americans with diabetes, and metformin is the most commonly prescribed oral diabetes agent. A review of our metformin experience highlights common pitfalls that lead to life-threatening or fatal poisonings. We describe 3 patients with metformin toxicity; 2 of 3 patients were prescribed metformin despite end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Case 1: a 40-year-old woman presented after a polysubstance overdose. Within 8 h, vomiting and lethargy developed; a profound acidosis, pH 6.95, pCO(2) 26, pO(2) 195, and elevated serum lactate 21 mmol/L (ref 0.5–1.6 mmol/L) were noted. Further inquiry revealed that the patient had ingested metformin. She was intubated; bicarbonate therapy and hemodialysis were initiated; however, she became hypotensive and died. A metformin level was 150 μg/mL (therapeutic 1–2 μg/mL). Case 2: a 69-year-old woman with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and ESRD presented to the Emergency Department (ED), having missed dialysis. She was sluggish and complained of abdominal pain; an acidosis, pH 7.37, pCO(2) 20, pO(2) 171; anion gap 38, and elevated serum lactate 18.9 mmol/L were noted. Hemodialysis was initiated when it was revealed that she took metformin daily. She improved rapidly and a metformin level was 27.4 μg/mL. Case 3: a 57-year-old woman with a history of NIDDM and ESRD presented with dyspnea. Laboratory studies showed pH 7.03, pCO(2) 21, pO(2) 99; anion gap 36, and lactate 16 mmol/L. Bicarbonate therapy and hemodialysis were initiated after discovering that she had recently been prescribed metformin. She had a fatal cardiac arrest after dialysis was completed. We describe 3 ED patients with occult metformin toxicity diagnosed after laboratory results showed an anion gap metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate levels. All patients had lethargy, vomiting, or abdominal pain, also suggesting sepsis or mesenteric infarction. Despite sodium bicarbonate therapy and hemodialysis, metformin-associated lactic acidosis was fatal in 2 of 3 patients. Emergency Physicians must be vigilant to recognize metformin toxicity in patients at high risk for metformin-associated lactic acidosis.

### Estimating unmeasured anions in critically ill patients: anion-gap, base-deficit, and strong-ion-gap [^115eyV8N]. Anaesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

We used 100 routine blood samples from critically ill patients to establish whether correcting the anion-gap and base-deficit for decreased plasma albumin improves agreement with the strong-ion-gap for estimating unmeasured anions and whether the modifications increase the proportion of samples with levels of anion-gap or base-deficit above the reference ranges. We used Bland-Altman analyses to compare the methods of estimating unmeasured ions. Compared with the strong-ion-gap, modification reduced the limits of agreement for both the anion-gap and the base-deficit. The bias for the base-deficit was also reduced but the bias for the anion-gap was increased. The proportion of samples with an anion-gap > 22 meq.l(-1) increased from 4 to 29% (p < 0.001), and the proportion with a base-deficit > 5 meq.l(-1) increased from 8 to 42% (p < 0.001). Consequently, metabolic acidosis from unmeasured ions in critically ill patients maybe more frequent than often recognised.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis: a serious complication of a common drug [^113RhPGz]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a rare and potentially life-threatening complication of metformin use. It typically occurs in patients who are diabetic and also have other risk factors for lactic acidosis, including kidney and liver conditions, malignancy, or use of certain medications. We report a case of MALA in a man in his 70s with diabetes who presented with gradually worsening gastrointestinal symptoms, including severe abdominal pain and nausea. He reported these symptoms in the setting of metformin use with an acute kidney injury (AKI), likely brought on by poor oral intake and excessive antibiotic use for a urinary tract infection. He was promptly started on intravenous fluids with a bicarbonate drip to concurrently treat his prerenal AKI and lactic acidosis, which resulted in rapid resolution of his symptoms. Renal function normalised within 12 days of admission. Since diabetic patients commonly use metformin and are also at higher risk of renal dysfunction, this case highlights the vulnerability of this group of patients and the need for increased knowledge and awareness of MALA.

### A simple estimate of the effect of the serum albumin level on the anion gap [^1172rQYh]. American Journal of Nephrology (2000). Low credibility.

Background

The serum anion gap (serum [Na(+)]-Cl(-)]-[CO(2)]) is still the first-line approach to metabolic acidosis. However, while it is generally acknowledged that hypoalbuminemia mandates a downward adjustment of the expected anion gap, a specific correction factor for the anion gap in the face of low serum albumin has never been demonstrated.

Methods

We reviewed initial laboratory data from 432 consecutive patients admitted or transferred to the medical intensive care unit at Nassau County Medical Center over a 6-month period and correlated the serum albumin with the anion gap and the serum [tCO(2)] using multivariate analysis. We looked at the anion gap as a function of delta (albumin), the difference between normal and actual serum albumin, defined as 4.0 - measured serum albumin g/dl. We also assessed [tCO(2)] as an independent variable.

Results

For patients with normal or high serum tCO(2), the ratio of change in anion gap (delta anion gap) to delta (albumin) was 1.46 and 1.45, respectively. For patients with serum tCO(2) < 22 mEq/l this ratio was 1.89. In the latter group, anion gap was best predicted taking both delta (albumin) and serum tCO(2) into account: anion gap = 36.2 - serum tCO(2) - 2.3 x delta (albumin) (r = 0.71, p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

For intensive care patients with normal or high serum tCO(2) (> 21 mEq/l) a simple bedside adjustment of the anion gap by subtracting 1.5 times the difference between measured serum albumin and the 'normal' level of 4.0 g/dl gives a close estimate of the actual anion gap. For intensive care patients with serum tCO(2) < 22 mEq/l, correction of the anion gap is well predicted by adding about twice the Delta (albumin) to the calculated gap.

### Sodium bicarbonate [^114aKtKH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection is administered by the intravenous route.

In cardiac arrest, a rapid intravenous dose of one to two 50 mL vials (44.6 to 100 mEq) may be given initially and continued at a rate of 50 mL (44.6 to 50 mEq) every 5 to 10 minutes if necessary (as indicated by arterial pH and blood gas monitoring) to reverse the acidosis. Caution should be observed in emergencies where very rapid infusion of large quantities of bicarbonate is indicated. Bicarbonate solutions are hypertonic and may produce an undesirable rise in plasma sodium concentration in the process of correcting the metabolic acidosis. In cardiac arrest, however, the risks from acidosis exceed those of hypernatremia.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection may be added to other intravenous fluids. The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight-hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight – depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

### Metformin hydrochloride (Fortamet) [^114k4a96]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Lactic Acidosis:

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic
complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with
FORTAMET (metformin hydrochloride) Extended-Release
Tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic
acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic
conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant
tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated
blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/ L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte
disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate
ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin
plasma levels > 5 μg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients
receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000
patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years).
Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant
renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal
hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/ surgical
problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart
failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or
acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia,
are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases
with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic
acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of
renal function in patients taking FORTAMET (metformin
hydrochloride) Extended-Release Tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose
of FORTAMET. In particular, treatment of the elderly
should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. FORTAMET treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of
age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function
is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic
acidosis. In addition, FORTAMET should be promptly
withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia,
dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly
limit the ability to clear lactate, FORTAMET should
generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic
disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either
acute or chronic, when taking FORTAMET, since alcohol
potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In
addition, FORTAMET should be temporarily discontinued
prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure
(see also PRECAUTIONS).

The clinical calculator "Urine Anion Gap" for lithium toxicity, ethylene glycol poisoning, sepsis and septic shock, chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis.

The Urine Anion Gap (UAG) is a clinical calculator primarily used in the evaluation of patients with metabolic acidosis, specifically to differentiate between renal and extrarenal causes. It is calculated using the formula: UAG = (urine sodium + urine potassium) - urine chloride. A positive UAG suggests a renal cause of metabolic acidosis, such as renal tubular acidosis, while a negative UAG is indicative of an extrarenal cause, such as diarrhea. It is important to note that the UAG is not applicable in patients with mixed acid-base disorders or those with significant proteinuria or ketoacidosis, as these conditions can interfere with the accuracy of the calculation.

### Assessing the role of initial serum calcium concentration in patients with ethylene glycol poisoning [^114gWdSD]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Assays for ethylene glycol (EG) with a rapid turn-around time are not routinely available. Clinicians must rely on historical features and readily available clinical tests, combined with clinical acumen, to guide the initial management of suspected EG poisoning. Hypocalcemia has been suggested as a clue supporting the diagnosis of EG poisoning in patients presenting with an unexplained high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA). A previous small study challenged this assumption.

Methods

This was a retrospective case series of one state's poison control system of confirmed EG-poisoned patients between September 2017 and April 2021. The definition of EG poisoning was based on suspected EG ingestion and a serum EG concentration > 5 mg/dL. Patients who were suspected to have EG toxicity but did not have a confirmed EG concentration or the EG concentration was less than 5 mg/dL were excluded. Routine laboratory studies were recorded for all patients. Comparisons between serum calcium on presentation to presenting blood pH, bicarbonate, anion gap, and creatinine were assessed for correlation.

Results

There was no correlation between the presenting calcium and either pH or creatinine. There was a weak positive correlation between the initial serum calcium and anion gap, a weak negative correlation between the initial serum calcium and bicarbonate.

Conclusion

On hospital presentation, hypocalcemia was not associated with EG poisoning, even in patients with a HAGMA. A normal serum calcium on presentation does not exclude the diagnosis of EG poisoning.

In the current investigation, upon stratifying subjects according to the delta-AG/delta-Bic ratio, it became apparent that ratios below 1.0 (indicative of associated hyperchloremia) were associated with the least pronounced deviations from baseline values. This observation could potentially be linked to increased volume replacement and a decreased occurrence of inadequate tissue perfusion. Importantly, mortality within this study displayed a noteworthy correlation with the Delta-AG/delta-Bic ratio. It is of significance that patients presenting MA alongside an elevated anion gap, yet without concurrent associated disorders, exhibited a heightened frequency of mortality within the ICU setting when compared to patients with accompanying disorders. One plausible explanation for this observation is the existence of a subgroup of patients with sluggish compensatory mechanisms that may not become apparent within the initial 24 h following surgery. However, further preclinical investigations are required to delve into this potential pathophysiological link and clinical investigations to better characterization of a subtype of patients with slow compensatory mechanism. Additionally, another contributing factor is the variation in treatment administered to the collective. This discrepancy could be attributed to the notion that associated disorders (hyperchloremia or metabolic alkalosis) might be instigated by unintentional intraoperative interventions, such as excessive saline solution administration [12] or blood transfusion. As a result, the correction of these imbalances during the hospitalization period occurs more swiftly and effectively, thereby yielding improved outcomes for these patients.

### What is the clinical significance of 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid) in high anion gap metabolic acidosis following paracetamol (acetaminophen) exposure? [^117ANCCx]. Clinical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Paracetamol (acetaminophen) ingestion is the most frequent pharmaceutical overdose in the developed world. Metabolic acidosis sometimes occurs, but the acidosis is infrequently persistent or severe. A growing number of case reports and case series describe high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) following paracetamol exposure with subsequent detection or measurement of 5-oxoproline (also called pyroglutamic acid) in blood, urine, or both. Typically 5-oxoprolinuria or 5-oxoprolinemia occurs in the setting of inborn genetic errors in glutathione metabolism. It is unknown whether 5-oxoprolinemia in the setting of paracetamol exposure reflects an acquired or transient derangement of glutathione metabolism or previously unrecognized genetic defects.

Objective

We reviewed the published cases of 5-oxoprolinemia or 5-oxoprolinuria among patients with HAGMA in the setting of paracetamol exposure. Our goal was to identify any consistent features that might increase our understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of similar cases.

Methods

We searched the medical literature using PUBMED and EMBASE from inception to 28 August 2013 applying search terms ("oxoproline" OR "pyroglutamic acid" AND "paracetamol" OR "acetaminophen"). The intersection of these two searches returned 77 articles, of which 64 involved human subjects and were in English. Two articles, one each in Spanish and Dutch, were reviewed. An additional Google Scholar search was done with the same terms. We manually searched the reference lists of retrieved articles to identify additional four relevant articles. We focused on articles including measured 5-oxoproline concentrations in urine or blood.

Results

Twenty-two articles included quantified 5-oxoproline concentrations. Several additional articles mentioned only qualitative detection of 5-oxoproline in urine or blood without concentrations being reported. Our manual reference search yielded four additional articles for a total of 24 articles describing 43 patients with quantified 5-oxoproline concentrations. The cases varied widely in paracetamol dose, duration and circumstances of paracetamol exposure, presence, and degree of elevation in transaminase activities, and when reported observed blood, serum, or urine 5-oxoproline concentrations. Concomitant use of flucloxacillin, another medication associated with oxoprolinemia or oxoprolinuria, confounded several of the cases. No clear dose-response relationship existed between the quantity of paracetamol ingested and the observed concentrations of 5-oxoproline. Clinical outcomes, including mortality, varied with no clear relationship to 5-oxoproline concentrations.

Conclusions

In rare cases, HAGMA in the setting of paracetamol exposure is attributable to 5-oxoprolinemia. Clinicians should first exclude commoner and treatable causes of HAGMA, such as lactic acidosis, co-ingested drug administration, and ketoacidosis. It is likely that the propensity for HAGMA following paracetamol exposure may be genetically determined. The effects of acetylcysteine on 5-oxoproline concentrations or clinical outcome are unknown. When HAGMA is diagnosed, the 5-oxoproline concentration and the glutathione synthetase activity should be measured.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^1128sBHk]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

However, this does not account for the role of weak acids in the balance of electrical charges in plasma water. This is can be expressed through the calculation of the effective SID (SID e). The formula for SID e as determined by Figge and colleagues. is as follows:

SID e = 2.46 × 10–8 × pCO 2 (mmHg)/10 -pH + (albumin (g/l)) × (0.123 × pH - 0.631) + (phosphate (mg/dl)) × (0.309 × pH - 0.469)

This formula accounts quantitatively for the contribution of weak acids to the electrical charge equilibrium in plasma. The difference between SID a and SID e should range from 0 to 2 mEq/l in healthy patients, by following the law of electroneutrality. If there are unexplained charges present, they will be represented by a 'gap' between the SID a and SID e; this is known as the strong ion gap (SIG) and is represented by the following formula:

SIG = SID a - SID e

The traditional anion gap, (Na + + K +) - (Cl - + HCO 3 -), does not account for the effect of weak acids, mostly albumin, which is commonly abnormal in critical illness.

We then classified patients into four groups depending on the anion contributing to most acidosis: no metabolic acidosis defined by SBE ≥ -2 mEq/l; lactic acidosis in which lactate accounted for more than 50% of SBE; SIG acidosis in which the SIG (unmeasured ions) accounted for more than 50% of SBE (and not lactic acidosis); and hyperchloremic acidosis defined as SBE < -2 mEq/l not explained by lactate or SIG. An absolute level of chloride was not used for this definition, because it is the relative relationship between the sodium and chloride concentrations that contribute to SID a and thus one of the independent variables comprising acid–base equilibria. Thus, if there is a metabolic acidosis present and the SIG or lactate does not make up most of the acid load, the only strong ion left is chloride.

### Recurrent high anion gap metabolic acidosis secondary to 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid) [^115BLoPR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

High anion gap metabolic acidosis in adults is a severe metabolic disorder for which the primary organic acid usually is apparent by clinical history and standard laboratory testing. We report a case of recurrent high anion gap metabolic acidosis in a 48-year-old man who initially presented with anorexia and malaise. Physical examination was unrevealing. Arterial pH was 6.98, P co 2 was 5 mm Hg, and chemistry tests showed a bicarbonate level of 3 mEq/L (3 mmol/L), anion gap of 32 mEq/L (32 mmol/L), and a negative toxicology screen result, except for an acetaminophen (paracetamol) level of 7.5 mug/mL. Metabolic acidosis resolved with administration of intravenous fluids. Subsequently, he experienced 5 more episodes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis during an 8-month span. Methanol, ethylene glycol, acetone, ethanol, d -lactate, and hippuric acid screens were negative. Lactate levels were modestly elevated, and acetaminophen levels were elevated for 5 of 6 admissions. These episodes defied explanation until 3 urinary organic acid screens, obtained on separate admissions, showed striking elevations of 5-oxoproline levels. Inborn errors of metabolism in the gamma-glutamyl cycle causing recurrent 5-oxoprolinuria and high anion gap metabolic acidosis are rare, but well described in children. Recently, there have been several reports of apparent acquired 5-oxoprolinuria and high anion gap metabolic acidosis in adults in association with acetaminophen use. Acetaminophen may, in susceptible individuals, disrupt regulation of the gamma-glutamyl cycle and result in excessive 5-oxoproline production. Suspicion for 5-oxoproline-associated high anion gap metabolic acidosis should be entertained when the cause of high anion gap metabolic acidosis remains poorly defined, the anion gap cannot be explained reasonably by measured organic acids, and there is concomitant acetaminophen use.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome [^113ts8a4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — supportive care and fluids during acute episodes include early intervention and targeted metabolic management. Expert opinion supports the efficacy of early intervention within the first several hours of onset of CVS. Supportive care during acute episodes includes providing a less stimulating environment; replacement of fluids, electrolytes, and energy; use of antiemetics with or without sedation; and provision of analgesia for pain. Some experts recommend higher amounts of intravenous dextrose-containing fluids (D10 0.45 normal saline); the intent of 10% dextrose concentration is to attenuate the incipient metabolic crisis. If late-phase evaluation reveals substantial fluid and/or electrolyte deficits, the task force recommends infusing 0.9% NaCl replacement fluid through a "Y" connecter parallel to the D10. An increased anion gap (> 18–20 mEq/L) may reflect severe dehydration or signal metabolic decompensation and the need for hospital admission. After 2 to 3 days of minimal energy and/or protein intake, illness may be prolonged and can be reversed with nutrition to provide an adequate energy intake and 1.5 g of protein per kilogram per day. In seriously ill patients, administering higher amounts of glucose (eg, 8–12 mg glucose/kg/min) with or without concomitant insulin, close acidosis monitoring, and metabolic consultation are described as critical to management.

Warnings Section

Lactic Acidosis:

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).

### Severe metabolic ketoacidosis as a primary manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-diabetic pregnancy [^113ZDyM5]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We present a case of a metabolic acidosis in a term-pregnant woman with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our patient presented with dyspnoea, tachypnoea, thoracic pain and a 2-day history of vomiting, initially attributed to COVID-19 pneumonia. Differential diagnosis was expanded when arterial blood gas showed a high anion gap metabolic non-lactate acidosis without hypoxaemia. Most likely, the hypermetabolic state of pregnancy, in combination with maternal starvation and increased metabolic demand due to infection, had resulted in metabolic ketoacidosis. Despite supportive treatment and rapid induction of labour, maternal deterioration and fetal distress during labour necessitated an emergency caesarean section. The patient delivered a healthy neonate. Postpartum, after initial improvement in metabolic acidosis, viral and bacterial pneumonia with subsequent significant respiratory compromise were successfully managed with oxygen supplementation and corticosteroids. This case illustrates how the metabolic demands of pregnancy can result in an uncommon presentation of COVID-19.

### A case report of paracetamol related pyroglutamic acidosis: mind the gap in a malnourished patient [^113YJCvu]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pyroglutamic acidosis is a rare cause of high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Most cases of paracetamol related pyroglutamic acidosis are described in malnourished women and patients with kidney/liver failure, alcohol use or severe sepsis. In this report, we describe how pyroglutamic acidosis could be related to the use of chronic therapeutic paracetamol with only malnutrition as an associated risk factor.

Case Presentation

We report a case of a 67-year-old male patient developing a pyroglutamic acidosis. The patient was initially admitted to hospital for infectious osteoarthritis and developed a metabolic acidosis during his hospital stay. Analgesics included daily therapeutic doses of paracetamol. What makes our case unusual is that our malnourished male patient did not have renal or hepatic failure. The diagnosis of paracetamol related pyroglutamic acidosis was made after ruling out the main causes of metabolic acidosis. It was further confirmed by urine organic acids measurement showing a markedly elevated level of pyroglutamic aciduria. Paracetamol was discontinued allowing a prompt correction of the anion gap.

Conclusion

This case is a representative of pyroglutamic acidosis related to chronic therapeutic paracetamol with only malnutrition as an associated risk factor. Physicians should be aware of such unusual cause of metabolic acidosis, which may be more common than expected in hospitalized patients. A high clinical suspicion is needed when urine organic acids analysis is not available.

Medical evaluation of hypoglycemia

Nine patients had laboratory testing and hospital records available for review. Patients were evaluated for hypoglycemia in the emergency department or during an inpatient hospital admission an average of 4 times (ranging from 1 to 7) per patient. Blood glucose levels ranged from 16 to 60 mg/dl (average of 45 mg/dL)), and hypoglycemia was accompanied by increased anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis (defined as pH < 7.3, bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L, and AG > 14 mmol/L) in all cases (Fig. 2). Urine samples were collected during eight encounters and demonstrated ketonuria in 87% of samples. Patients were initially treated with normal saline (NS) (45.5%), D5 ½NS (22.7%) or D10 ½NS (31.8%), suggesting delayed recognition of hypoglycemia by medical providers. Indeed, medical records indicated that on at least three separate occasions, the diagnosis of hypoglycemia was not initially considered despite the presence of vomiting, decreased oral intake, and/or lethargy.

### 7.5% sodium bicarbonate [^111jRp6m]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In general, it is unwise to attempt full correction of a low total CO2 content during the first 24 hours of therapy, since this may be accompanied by an unrecognized alkalosis because of a delay in the readjustment of ventilation to normal. Owing to this lag, the achievement of total CO2 content of about 20 mEq/liter at the end of the first day of therapy will usually be associated with a normal blood pH. Further modification of the acidosis to completely normal values usually occurs in the presence of normal kidney function when and if the cause of the acidosis can be controlled. Values for total CO2 which are brought to normal or above normal within the first day of therapy are very likely to be associated with grossly alkaline values for blood pH, with ensuing undesired side effects.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. See PRECAUTIONS.

Table 1
Laboratory data at diagnosis

The patient displayed a high-anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA): serum anion gap (AG), corrected for hypoalbuminemia equalled 25.3, c AG = AG + 2.5 (4-albumine in g/dL). This HAGMA has an appropriate respiratory response. We compared the increase in serum anion gap and the bicarbonate deficit using the delta ratio that indicated an absence of concurrent metabolic acidosis due to the loss of bicarbonate. The most common causes of HAGMA are listed in the mnemonic "GOLDMARK": Glycol, Oxoproline, L lactate, D lactate, Methanol, Aspirin, Renal failure and Ketoacidosis. Our patient had a controlled infection and no evidence of hypovolemia or hemodynamic instability along with a normal serum lactate level. Alternative causes of HAGMA due to ketoacidosis or salicylate abuse were ruled out. HAGMA in our case does not generate an osmolal gap: the measured osmolality was only 10 mOsmol/Kg greater than his calculated osmolality (normal value ≤ 10) making the ingestion of alcohol or glycol unlikely. The possibility of pyroglutamic acidosis due to the chronic use of paracetamol was suspected (1–2 g daily for 6 months). Paracetamol was withheld and alternative medications for pain management were prescribed. Serum amino acid levels were checked and showed a generalized hypoaminoacidemia consistent with the malnourished status of our patient. (Table 1)

The diagnosis was further confirmed by urine organic acids measurement, showing a markedly elevated level of pyroglutamic aciduria (932 µmol per mmol of creatininuria, normal < 18 µmol/mmol).

She had had multiple admissions to hospital with similar presentations in the past. On examination, the only significant clinical finding was that of a reduced level of consciousness. Laboratory investigations revealed a hyperchloremic normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with a positive urine anion gap and a urine pH of 6.5 combined with a severely low hypokalaemia. She was subsequently diagnosed with renal tubular acidosis type 1, secondary to toluene exposure from glue sniffing and was treated with intravenous fluids and potassium replacement and discharged home with oral potassium citrate and advised to stop her inhalant use.

Twenty-four hours later, the patient's glomerular filtration rate decreased significantly, serum osmolality was 807, the osmolar gap was 407, complete metabolic panel showed pH of 6.8, sodium of 156 mmol/l, potassium of 7.3 mmol/l, chloride of 116, CO(2) of 3.9 and anion gap of 30.7. Blood lactic acid was > 56 mmol/l. The patient received emergency haemodialysis. Four days after presentation, the patient began to respond to voice commands and was extubated.

### Prediabetes directly deteriorates into diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome triggered by acute pancreatitis: a case report illustrating a "Chicken and egg" paradigm in ketosis-prone diabetes [^116jvjoy]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Taken together, this patient was diagnosed with DKA and HHS on admission and was triaged into the ICU and started on IV fluids, IV bicarbonate, and IV insulin drip, in accordance with diabetes crisis management guidelines. Of note, the patient also presented with severe hyperkalemia with ECG changes. Hyperkalemia is a common finding in DKA, and is secondary to hypoinsulinemia and renal dysfunction (e.g. acute kidney injury in this case); the hyperkalemia is not due to the previously held opinion that metabolic acidosis causes the exchange of hydrogen ions for potassium ions across cell membranes. The severe anion gap acidosis was corrected by the second day of admission with repeat ABG showing pH 7.42, pCO 2 31 mmHg, pO 2 116%, HCO 3 − 20.1 mmol/L, SaO 2 99%, BMP: sodium 145 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, bicarbonate 16 mmol/L, anion gap 19 mmol/L, BUN 24 mg/dL, creatinine 0.77 mg/dL, glucose 366 mg/dL, repeat ECG showed normalized T waves.

The patient also presented with abdominal pain on admission. Initially, this pain was diagnosed as DKA-associated abdominal pain. However, she had persistent abdominal pain despite the closure of the anion gap and correction of DKA and HHS. Additional laboratory tests revealed lipase 720 U/L and amylase 225 U/L, suggesting acute pancreatitis. CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast found mild–moderate right-sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter down to the level of a 6-mm stone in the proximal-mid right ureter without significant pancreatic changes. MRCP showed no biliary or pancreatic duct dilation. Current diagnostic criteria of acute pancreatitis require two out of three of the following criteria: (1) acute abdominal pain and tenderness in the upper abdomen; (2) elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes in the blood or urine; (3) abnormal finding of acute pancreatitis detected by ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Of note, imaging studies are not 100% sensitive and in mild episodes of acute pancreatitis, CT features can range from normal-appearing pancreas to diffuse enlargement and heterogeneous attenuation of the gland. Taken together, this patient was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, although the etiology was initially unknown.

### Severe hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis following ingestion of gaviscon [^114qFgkD]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Uncommon metabolic abnormalities in the emergency department could be a result of drug overdose due to uncommon agents.

Case Report

A 35-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3/15 and a normal pulse rate and blood pressure. Subsequent questioning after recovery revealed he had ingested 2 L of Gaviscon over the preceding 48 hours. He had normal haematology, liver, and renal function during admission. The electrocardiogram showed T wave inversion in the inferior leads on admission. Arterial blood gas on air was: pH 7.54, HCO3 50 mmol/L (50 meq/L), Chloride 66 mmol/L, anion gap was 19, pO2 11 kPa (82.5 mmHg), and pCO2 8 kPa (60 mmHg). Serum sodium was 127 mmol/L and serum potassium was 1.6 mmol/L. His GCS improved within one hour of admission with supportive care, and his serum potassium and bicarbonate improved within 24 hours. He subsequently made a full recovery. Discussion. Bicarbonate ingestion in the form of Gaviscon(R) and vomiting made this patient alkalotic, and simple supportive care provided effective management with a complete recovery.

Conclusion

This case illustrates how a severe metabolic alkalosis can result from a significant ingestion of Gaviscon, and that such presentations can give rise to diagnostic dilemma.

### High anion gap metabolic acidosis [^111wouAN]. Wikipedia (2008). Low credibility.

High anion gap metabolic acidosis is a form of metabolic acidosis characterized by a high anion gap. Metabolic acidosis occurs when the body produces too much acid, or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body. Several types of metabolic acidosis occur, grouped by their influence on the anion gap. The anion gap can be increased due to relatively low levels of cations other than sodium and potassium. An anion gap is usually considered to be high if it is over 12 mEq/L. High anion gap metabolic acidosis is typically caused by acid produced by the body. More rarely, it may be caused by ingesting methanol or overdosing on aspirin. The delta ratio is a formula that can be used to assess elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis and to evaluate whether mixed acid base disorder is present.

The list of agents that cause high anion gap metabolic acidosis is similar to but broader than the list of agents that cause a serum osmolal gap. Causes The most common causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis are: ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, kidney failure, and toxic ingestions. Ketoacidosis can occur as a complication of diabetes mellitus, but can occur due to other disorders, such as chronic alcoholism and malnutrition. In these conditions, excessive free fatty acid metabolism results in the production of ketoacids, acetoacetic acid, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Lactic acidosis results from excess formation and decreased metabolism of lactate, which occurs during states of anaerobic metabolism. It is the most common cause of metabolic acidosis in hospitalized patients. The most serious form occurs during various states of shock, due to episodes of decreased liver perfusion.

Kidney failure results in decreased acid excretion and increased bicarbonate excretion. Toxins that result in acidic metabolites may trigger lactic acidosis. Rhabdomyolysis, a muscle-wasting disease, is a rare cause of metabolic acidosis. Mnemonics Various mnemonics are used to assist clinicians in the detection and diagnosis of conditions that may result in high anion gap metabolic acidosis: The newer 2008 mnemonic "GOLD MARK" was proposed in The Lancet reflecting current causes of anion gap metabolic acidosis:

- G — glycols
- O — oxoproline, a metabolite of paracetamol
- L — L-lactate, the chemical responsible for lactic acidosis
- D — D-lactate
- M — methanol
- A — aspirin.
- R — renal failure
- K — ketoacidosis, ketones generated from starvation, alcohol, and diabetic ketoacidosis The mnemonic MUDPILES is commonly used to remember the causes of increased anion gap metabolic acidosis.
- M — Methanol
- U — Uremia
- D — Diabetic ketoacidosis
- P — Paracetamol, Propylene glycol.
- I — Infection, Iron, Isoniazid, Inborn errors of metabolism
- L — Lactic acidosis
- E — Ethylene glycol.
- S — Salicylates Another frequently used mnemonic is KARMEL.
- K — Ketoacidosis
- A — aspirin
- R — Renal failure
- M — Methanol
- E — Ethylene glycol
- L — Lactic acidosis Yet another frequently used mnemonic is KULT.

### Anion gap [^116vzdA9]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

For example, if the blood sample is not processed immediately after it is collected, continued cellular metabolism by leukocytes may result in an increase in the HCO^−^~3~ concentration, and result in a corresponding mild reduction in the anion gap. In many situations, alterations in renal function may modify the anion gap that may be expected to arise in a particular pathological condition. A high anion gap indicates increased concentrations of unmeasured anions by proxy. Elevated concentrations of unmeasured anions like lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, PO^3−^~4~, and SO^2−^~4~, which rise with disease or intoxication, cause loss of HCO^−^~3~ due to bicarbonate's activity as a buffer. Thus, finding a high anion gap should result in a search for conditions that lead to excesses of the unmeasured anions listed above.

High anion gap The anion gap is affected by changes in unmeasured ions. In uncontrolled diabetes, there is an increase in ketoacids due to metabolism of ketones. Raised levels of acid bind to bicarbonate to form carbon dioxide through the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation resulting in metabolic acidosis. In these conditions, bicarbonate concentrations decrease by acting as a buffer against the increased presence of acids. The bicarbonate is consumed by the unmeasured cation resulting in a high anion gap. Causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis:

- Lactic acidosis
- Ketoacidosis
- Diabetic ketoacidosis
- Hazardous alcohol use
- Toxicants:

- Methanol
- Ethylene glycol
- Propylene glycol
- Lactic acid
- Uremia
- Aspirin
- Phenformin
- Iron
- Isoniazid
- Cyanide, coupled with elevated venous oxygenation.
- Kidney failure, causes high anion gap acidosis by decreased acid excretion and decreased HCO^−^~3~ reabsorption. Accumulation of sulfates, phosphates, urate, and hippurate accounts for the high anion gap. Note: a useful mnemonic to remember this is MUDPILES – Methanol, Uremia, Diabetic Ketoacidosis, Paraldehyde, Infection, Lactic Acidosis, Ethylene Glycol and Salicylates. Normal anion gap In patients with a normal anion gap, the drop in HCO^−^~3~ is the primary pathology. Since there is only one other major buffering anion, it must be compensated for almost completely by an increase in Cl^−^. This is therefore also known as hyperchloremic acidosis.
- Gastrointestinal loss of HCO^−^~3~
- Kidney loss of HCO^−^~3~ also known as type 2 RTA).
- Ingestions
- Ammonium chloride and acetazolamide, ifosfamide.
- Hyperalimentation fluids
- Some cases of ketoacidosis, particularly during rehydration with sodium-containing solutions.
- Alcohols can cause a high anion gap acidosis in some patients, but a mixed picture in others due to concurrent metabolic alkalosis.
- Mineralocorticoid deficiency Note: a useful mnemonic to remember this is FUSEDCARS – fistula, uretero-enterostomy, saline administration, endocrine, diarrhea, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, ammonium chloride, renal tubular acidosis, spironolactone. Low anion gap A low anion gap is often due to hypoalbuminemia. Albumin is an anionic protein and its loss results in the retention of other negatively charged ions such as chloride and bicarbonate.

### Metabolic acidosis… [^113arnxS]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a serious electrolyte disorder characterized by an imbalance in the body's acid-base balance. Metabolic acidosis has three main root causes: increased acid production, loss of bicarbonate, and a reduced ability of the kidneys to excrete excess acids. Metabolic acidosis can lead to acidemia, which is defined as arterial blood pH that is lower than 7.
35. Acidemia and acidosis are not mutually exclusive – pH and hydrogen ion concentrations also depend on the coexistence of other acid-base disorders; therefore, pH levels in people with metabolic acidosis can range from low to high. Acute metabolic acidosis, lasting from minutes to several days, often occurs during serious illnesses or hospitalizations, and is generally caused when the body produces an excess amount of organic acids.

A state of chronic metabolic acidosis, lasting several weeks to years, can be the result of impaired kidney function and/or bicarbonate wasting. The adverse effects of acute versus chronic metabolic acidosis also differ, with acute metabolic acidosis impacting the cardiovascular system in hospital settings, and chronic metabolic acidosis affecting muscles, bones, kidney and cardiovascular health. Signs and symptoms Symptoms are not specific, and diagnosis can be difficult unless patients present with clear indications for blood gas sampling. Symptoms may include palpitations, headache, altered mental status such as severe anxiety due to hypoxia, decreased visual acuity, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, altered appetite and weight gain, muscle weakness, bone pain, and joint pain. Extreme acidemia can also lead to neurological and cardiac complications:

- Neurological: lethargy, stupor, coma, seizures
- Cardiac: Abnormal heart rhythms and decreased response to epinephrine, both leading to low blood pressure Physical examination can occasionally reveal signs of the disease, but is often otherwise normal. Cranial nerve abnormalities are reported in ethylene glycol poisoning, and retinal edema can be a sign of methanol intoxication. Diagnostic approach and causes Metabolic acidosis results in a reduced serum pH that is due to metabolic and not respiratory dysfunction. Typically the serum bicarbonate concentration will be < 22 mEq/L, below the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, the standard base will be more negative than -2 and the pCO~2~ will be reduced as a result of hyperventilation in an attempt to restore the pH closer to normal. Occasionally in a mixed acid-base disorder where metabolic acidosis is not the primary disorder present, the pH may be normal or high.

In the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis can be clinically diagnosed by analysis of the calculated serum bicarbonate level. There are many causes of acute metabolic acidosis, and thus it is helpful to group them by the presence or absence of a normal anion gap. Increased anion gap Causes of increased anion gap include:

- Massive rhabdomyolysis
- Isoniazid, iron, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, valproic acid, verapamil
- Topiramate
- Sulfates Normal anion gap Causes of normal anion gap include:

- Hyperalimentation
- Addison disease
- Acetazolamide
- Spironolactone
- Saline infusion To distinguish between the main types of metabolic acidosis, a clinical tool called the anion gap is very useful. The anion gap is calculated by subtracting the sum of the serum concentrations of major anions, chloride and bicarbonate, from the serum concentration of the major cation, sodium.

### Cardiac arrest [^111LehRE]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest and resultant hemodynamic collapse often occur due to arrhythmias. Ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia are most commonly recorded. However, as many incidents of cardiac arrest occur out-of-hospital or when a person is not having their cardiac activity monitored, it is difficult to identify the specific mechanism in each case. Structural heart disease, such as coronary artery disease, is a common underlying condition in people who experience cardiac arrest. The most common risk factors include age and cardiovascular disease. Additional underlying cardiac conditions include heart failure and inherited arrhythmias. Additional factors that may contribute to cardiac arrest include major blood loss, lack of oxygen, electrolyte disturbance, electrical injury, and intense physical exercise. If return of spontaneous circulation is achieved with these interventions, then sudden cardiac arrest has occurred.

By contrast, if the person does not survive the event, this is referred to as sudden cardiac death. Among those whose pulses are re-established, the care team may initiate measures to protect the person from brain injury and preserve neurological function. Some methods may include airway management and mechanical ventilation, maintenance of blood pressure and end-organ perfusion via fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support, correction of electrolyte imbalance, EKG monitoring and management of reversible causes, and temperature management. Targeted temperature management may improve outcomes. In post-resuscitation care, an implantable cardiac defibrillator may be considered to reduce the chance of death from recurrence. Causes and mechanisms The underlying causes of sudden cardiac arrest can result from cardiac and non-cardiac causes. The most common underlying causes are different, depending on the patient's age.

Common cardiac causes include coronary artery disease, non-atherosclerotic coronary artery abnormalities, structural heart damage, and inherited arrhythmias. Common non-cardiac causes include respiratory arrest, diabetes, medications, and trauma. The most common mechanism underlying sudden cardiac arrest is an arrhythmia. Without organized electrical activity in the heart muscle, there is inconsistent contraction of the ventricles, which prevents the heart from generating adequate cardiac output. This hemodynamic collapse results in poor blood flow to the brain and other organs, which if prolonged causes persistent damage.

Non-atherosclerotic coronary artery abnormalities Abnormalities of the coronary arteries not related to atherosclerosis include inflammation, embolism, vasospasm, mechanical abnormalities related to connective tissue diseases or trauma, and congenital coronary artery anomalies. These conditions account for 10–15% of cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. If the heart does this for a prolonged period of time, the left ventricle can experience hypertrophy in a way that decreases the heart's effectiveness. Left ventricular hypertrophy can be demonstrated on an echocardiogram and electrocardiogram. Abnormalities of the cardiac conduction system may predispose an individual to arrhythmias with a risk of progressing to sudden cardiac arrest, albeit this risk remains low.

### Normal anion gap acidosis… [^111EDaLg]. Wikipedia (2007). Low credibility.

Normal anion gap acidosis is an acidosis that is not accompanied by an abnormally increased anion gap. The most common cause of normal anion gap acidosis is diarrhea with a renal tubular acidosis being a distant second. Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of normal anion gap acidosis is relatively short:

- Hyperalimentation
- Chloride administration, often from normal saline
- Acetazolamide and other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
- Renal tubular acidosis.
- Diarrhea: due to a loss of bicarbonate. This is compensated by an increase in chloride concentration, thus leading to a normal anion gap, or hyperchloremic, metabolic acidosis.

The pathophysiology of increased chloride concentration is the following: fluid secreted into the gut lumen contains higher amounts of Na^+^ than Cl^−^; large losses of these fluids, particularly if volume is replaced with fluids containing equal amounts of Na^+^ and Cl^−^, results in a decrease in the plasma Na^+^ concentration relative to the Cl^−^concentration. This scenario can be avoided if formulations such as lactated Ringer's solution are used instead of normal saline to replace GI losses.
- Ureteroenteric fistula – an abnormal connection between a ureter and the gastrointestinal tract
- Pancreaticoduodenal fistula – an abnormal connection between the pancreas and duodenum.
- Spironolactone
- High ostomy output
- Hyperparathyroidism – can cause hyperchloremia and increase renal bicarbonate loss, which may result in a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Patients with hyperparathyroidism may have a lower than normal pH, slightly decreased PaCO2 due to respiratory compensation, a decreased bicarbonate level, and a normal anion gap. As opposed to high anion gap acidosis, normal anion gap acidosis involves either increased production/administration of chloride or increased excretion of bicarbonate. See also

### Electrocardiography… [^114h77px]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

- Cardiac rhythm disturbances, such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia;
- Inadequate coronary artery blood flow, such as myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction;
- and electrolyte disturbances, such as hypokalemia. Traditionally, "ECG" usually means a 12-lead ECG taken while lying down as discussed below. However, other devices can record the electrical activity of the heart such as a Holter monitor but also some models of smartwatch are capable of recording an ECG. ECG signals can be recorded in other contexts with other devices.
- Chest pain or suspected myocardial infarction, such as ST elevated myocardial infarction or non-ST elevated myocardial infarction
- Symptoms such as shortness of breath, murmurs, fainting, seizures, funny turns, or arrhythmias including new onset palpitations or monitoring of known cardiac arrhythmias.
- Medication monitoring and management of overdose
- Electrolyte abnormalities, such as hyperkalemia
- Perioperative monitoring in which any form of anesthesia is involved. This includes preoperative assessment and intraoperative and postoperative monitoring. ECGs can be recorded as short intermittent tracings or continuous ECG monitoring. Continuous monitoring is used for critically ill patients, patients undergoing general anesthesia, and patients who have an infrequently occurring cardiac arrhythmia that would unlikely be seen on a conventional ten-second ECG. Continuous monitoring can be conducted by using Holter monitors, internal and external defibrillators and pacemakers, and/or biotelemetry. Screening For adults, evidence does not support the use of ECGs among those without symptoms or at low risk of cardiovascular disease as an effort for prevention.

This is because an ECG may falsely indicate the existence of a problem, leading to misdiagnosis, the recommendation of invasive procedures, and overtreatment. However, persons employed in certain critical occupations, such as aircraft pilots, may be required to have an ECG as part of their routine health evaluations. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy screening may also be considered in adolescents as part of a sports physical out of concern for sudden cardiac death. This averaging for the common lead and the abstract unipolar lead concept makes for a more challenging understanding and is complicated by sloppy usage of "lead" and "electrode". In fact, instead of being a constant reference, V~W~ has a value that fluctuates throughout the heart cycle. It also does not truly represent the center-of-heart potential due to the body parts the signals travel through.

The Lewis lead or S5-lead can be used to better detect atrial activity in relation to that of the ventricles. An esophageal lead can be inserted to a part of the esophagus where the distance to the posterior wall of the left atrium is only approximately 5–6 mm. An esophageal lead avails for a more accurate differentiation between certain cardiac arrhythmias, particularly atrial flutter, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia and orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. It can also evaluate the risk in people with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, as well as terminate supraventricular tachycardia caused by re-entry. Interpretation Interpretation of the ECG is fundamentally about understanding the electrical conduction system of the heart.

### Electrolyte imbalance [^1115QvWu]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Causes Chronic laxative abuse or severe diarrhea or vomiting can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Malnutrition People with malnutrition are at especially high risk for an electrolyte imbalance. Severe electrolyte imbalances must be treated carefully as there are risks with overcorrecting too quickly, which can result in arrhythmias, brain herniation, or refeeding syndrome depending on the cause of imbalance. Restrictive eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa are also associated with electrolyte imbalance. Hyperchloremia Causes Hyperchloremia, or high chloride levels, is usually associated with excess chloride intake, fluid loss, and metabolic acidosis. Symptoms Patients are usually asymptomatic with mild hyperchloremia. Symptoms associated with hyperchloremia are usually caused by the underlying cause of this electrolyte imbalance.

Treatment Treat the underlying cause, which commonly includes increasing fluid intake. Hypermagnesemia Hypermagnesemia, or abnormally high levels of magnesium in the blood, is relatively rare in individuals with normal kidney function. This is defined by a magnesium concentration > 2. 5 mg/dL. Causes Hypermagnesemia typically occurs in individuals with abnormal kidney function. This imbalance can also occur with use of antacids or laxatives that contain magnesium. Iatrogenic cases of hypermagnesemia can be prevented by avoiding magnesium-containing medications. Symptoms Mild symptoms include nausea, flushing, tiredness. Neurologic symptoms are seen most commonly including decreased deep tendon reflexes. Severe symptoms include paralysis, respiratory failure, and bradycardia progressing to cardiac arrest. Treatment If kidney function is normal, stopping the source of magnesium intake is sufficient. Diuretics can help increase magnesium excretion in the urine.

Severe symptoms may be treated with dialysis to directly remove magnesium from the blood. Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, or low magnesium levels in the blood, can occur in up to 12% of hospitalized patients. Symptoms or effects of hypomagnesemia can occur after relatively small deficits. Causes Major causes of hypomagnesemia are from gastrointestinal losses such as vomiting and diarrhea. Another major cause is from kidney losses from diuretics, alcohol use, hypercalcemia, and genetic disorders. Low dietary intake can also contribute to magnesium deficiency. Treatment The first step in treatment is determining whether the deficiency is caused by a gastrointestinal or kidney problem. People with no or minimal symptoms are given oral magnesium; however, many people experience diarrhea and other gastrointestinal discomfort. Those who cannot tolerate or receive magnesium, or those with severe symptoms can receive intravenous magnesium.

Hypomagnesemia may prevent the normalization of other electrolyte deficiencies. If other electrolyte deficiencies are associated, normalizing magnesium levels may be necessary to treat the other deficiencies. Hyperkalemia Hyperkalemia means the concentration of potassium in the blood is too high. This occurs when the concentration of potassium is > 5 mEq/L. It can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and even death. As such it is considered to be the most dangerous electrolyte disturbance. Causes Hyperkalemia is typically caused by decreased excretion by the kidneys, shift of potassium to the extracellular space, or increased consumption of potassium rich foods in patients with kidney failure. The most common cause of hyperkalemia is lab error due to potassium released as blood cells from the sample break down. Other common causes are kidney disease, cell death, acidosis, and drugs that affect kidney function.
