## Question

How long are the therapeutic windows for thrombolysis and thrombectomy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the therapeutic time windows for intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational, guideline-endorsed time windows and how they differ from regulatory labeling. Then, I should verify the validated extended windows and their imaging criteria. Next, I will examine special situations such as wake-up stroke and basilar artery occlusion. After that, I need to distinguish between regulatory guidance, professional guidelines, and real-world practice. Finally, I will synthesize a practical framework and caveats for clinical application, ensuring I anchor each step with appropriate sources and double-check for any inconsistencies as I go [^115o772p] [^1173Hge3].

> Let me first confirm the foundational windows for intravenous thrombolysis. The U.S. FDA label for alteplase specifies treatment within 0–3 hours from onset with standard dosing, which is the most conservative, universally applicable regulatory anchor, and I should state that clearly before expanding to guideline-based practice windows [^111VJwqG] [^1126yHGN]. Hold on, I should verify the broader guideline position: AHA/ASA and ESO endorse treatment up to 4.5 hours in eligible patients based on accumulated randomized evidence and meta-analyses, which is the common clinical standard beyond the FDA label, and I need to keep that regulatory-versus-guideline nuance explicit [^115o772p] [^1173Hge3].

> Now, I should review the foundational window for mechanical thrombectomy in the early period. The standard, trial-anchored window is 0–6 hours for anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion when classic eligibility criteria are met, including pre-stroke mRS 0–1, NIHSS ≥ 6, ASPECTS ≥ 6, and ICA or M1 occlusion, and I will double-check those criteria before proceeding further [^113jKNK7]. Wait, let me verify whether medium vessel occlusions are contemplated in the early window: AHA/ASA allows consideration for select M2/M3 occlusions within 6 hours in carefully chosen patients, which I should note as an expansion beyond the core ICA/M1 signal, albeit with lower-quality evidence compared with proximal occlusions [^1136FyHC]. I also need to remind myself that every minute matters given the robust time-to-treatment relationship for EVT efficacy across trials and meta-analyses, reinforcing the operational priority of speed in this window [^115anX1A].

> Next, I will examine the validated extended windows for thrombectomy, and I need to be precise about the imaging and clinical-mismatch frameworks. The AHA/ASA guideline endorses EVT 6–16 hours for select patients meeting DEFUSE 3 perfusion–core mismatch criteria and up to 24 hours for those meeting DAWN clinical–core mismatch criteria, and I should emphasize that these extensions are contingent on strict imaging or clinical–imaging selection thresholds rather than time alone [^111VYwNY] [^115o772p]. I should double-check that these recommendations primarily apply to anterior circulation LVO, and that outside these criteria, practice must be individualized with great caution [^111VYwNY] [^115o772p].

> I will now examine extensions for intravenous thrombolysis beyond the conventional 4.5-hour window, and I need to be careful about which scenarios have guideline support versus investigational signals. For wake-up or unknown-onset strokes, MRI DWI–FLAIR mismatch supports IV alteplase within 4.5 hours of symptom recognition in carefully selected patients, and I should explicitly anchor this to AHA/ASA and ESO guidance before moving on [^111yz6NX] [^1173Hge3]. But wait, what about posterior circulation and basilar artery occlusion? The 2024 ESMINT/ESO guidance supports consideration of IV thrombolysis up to 24 hours from last known well in basilar artery occlusion provided there are no extensive posterior circulation ischemic changes, which is a notable and more permissive exception that I need to flag clearly [^111RbQAR]. Let me also note emerging late-window thrombolysis evidence, particularly with tenecteplase in perfusion-selected patients between 4.5 and 24 hours; current data are promising for reperfusion and functional shift but remain investigational for broad adoption, so I should present these as evolving signals rather than standard-of-care mandates [^117EYde2] [^116gKHWm] [^113zADsZ].

> Hold on, I should distinguish regulatory labeling from guidelines and from real-world practice to avoid conflating them. Regulators maintain the 0–3 hour alteplase label, whereas guidelines endorse 0–4.5 hours in eligible patients and specify imaging-based late-window scenarios like DWI–FLAIR mismatch for wake-up stroke, which clinicians commonly follow despite the narrower label, and I must keep this distinction transparent for medico-legal clarity [^111VJwqG] [^115o772p] [^1173Hge3]. Hmm, wait a minute, regarding devices for thrombectomy I initially thought there was no labeling beyond 6 hours; let me reconsider and state this carefully: while guideline-based practice endorses 6–16 and 6–24 hour EVT under DAWN and DEFUSE 3 frameworks, device labeling nuances vary and practice is fundamentally governed by trial-based selection and guideline endorsement, so I should avoid overgeneralizing device labels and bring the focus back to the evidence-based criteria clinicians actually use [^111VYwNY] [^115o772p]. In real-world practice, many centers adopt a tissue-based paradigm using CT/MR perfusion or equivalent selection, with observational analyses suggesting improved functional outcomes when perfusion imaging informs selection, particularly in the late window, although prospective confirmation is still being refined [^1153AutD] [^1157fTgF].

> Next, I should review key modifiers that affect window applicability so we do not overgeneralize. Imaging is the gatekeeper in extended windows: CT or MR perfusion demonstrating a favorable mismatch profile, or DWI–FLAIR mismatch in wake-up stroke, determines eligibility more than the clock alone, and I need to stress that absence of salvageable tissue or a large established core closes the window regardless of time [^111VYwNY] [^111yz6NX]. Let me also confirm stroke severity and territory considerations: standard early-window EVT criteria emphasize NIHSS ≥ 6, ASPECTS ≥ 6, and proximal ICA/M1 occlusions, while M2/M3 occlusions may be considered within 6 hours with more individualized judgment, and posterior circulation strokes follow somewhat different time tolerances and imaging thresholds in both EVT and IVT recommendations, especially basilar artery occlusion with up to 24-hour thrombolysis consideration when extensive injury is absent [^113jKNK7] [^1136FyHC] [^111RbQAR]. I should also note that core location matters in late windows, where subcortical core involvement portends worse outcomes even with excellent reperfusion, which tempers enthusiasm for late-window intervention in certain anatomical patterns despite favorable clocks or perfusion maps [^115Qov8a].

> Let me synthesize this into a practical, bedside framework while double-checking the balance of safety and benefit. For IV thrombolysis, treat as fast as possible within 0–3 hours per FDA label and extend to 4.5 hours per guidelines when eligible; in wake-up or unknown-onset stroke, consider IV alteplase when there is MRI DWI–FLAIR mismatch and no plan for immediate thrombectomy; in basilar artery occlusion, consider IV thrombolysis up to 24 hours if imaging excludes extensive ischemia, recognizing this as a posterior circulation–specific pathway [^111VJwqG] [^1173Hge3] [^111yz6NX] [^111RbQAR]. For EVT, proceed within 0–6 hours in guideline-qualified anterior circulation LVO cases; consider 6–16 hours using DEFUSE 3 perfusion–core mismatch and up to 24 hours using DAWN clinical–core mismatch in appropriately selected patients, making sure not to extrapolate beyond the validated criteria; and for posterior circulation, individualize based on emerging guidance and imaging, recognizing differences from anterior circulation paradigms [^113jKNK7] [^111VYwNY] [^115o772p]. Time still matters profoundly across all windows, and I need to emphasize systems that minimize onset-to-needle and onset-to-groin times because outcomes diminish with delay even when imaging looks favorable [^115anX1A].

> I should confirm operational and systems-of-care implications because window utilization depends on logistics as much as biology. Off-hours presentation and interfacility transfer are consistently associated with extra delays to puncture, and I need to highlight process improvements such as standardized door-to-puncture pathways, mobile stroke units where feasible, and streamlined transfer protocols to preserve eligibility within both early and extended windows [^114KDmtE] [^115wL3ED] [^112Q3d6W]. Let me verify one more point about imaging strategy: although perfusion imaging is not universally available, real-world data suggest that its use can optimize selection and procedural efficiency in the late window without delaying treatment, but I should caution that randomized confirmation is evolving and centers may reasonably use ASPECTS and CTA-based triage when perfusion is unavailable, especially in earlier windows [^1153AutD] [^113xRJYu].

> Before closing, I should recheck pharmacologic nuances. Tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg is increasingly favored over alteplase for eligible patients within 4.5 hours, particularly in LVO when it does not delay thrombectomy, and pre-transfer use may expedite reperfusion; however, for very late windows beyond 4.5 hours, tenecteplase remains investigational outside specific imaging-selected protocols, so I must present those late-window signals as promising but not practice-standard [^111iPm2Z] [^112XXFrs] [^117EYde2]. I need to ensure I have clearly separated standard-of-care from investigational fronts to avoid overreach in recommendations [^116gKHWm].

> In conclusion, I should reaffirm that modern reperfusion care blends a mandatory early window with a conditional, imaging-selected extended window. Intravenous thrombolysis is standard within 4.5 hours per guidelines and 0–3 hours per FDA labeling, with MRI-selected wake-up stroke and basilar artery occlusion representing key extensions, while mechanical thrombectomy is unequivocally indicated 0–6 hours for eligible anterior circulation LVO and extends to 6–16 and 6–24 hours under DEFUSE 3 and DAWN criteria, respectively; across all scenarios, rapid workflow and judicious imaging selection govern benefit, underscoring the enduring truths that time is brain and tissue is the issue [^111VJwqG] [^1173Hge3] [^111VYwNY] [^115anX1A].

---

For the thrombolysis window, IV alteplase is indicated within **4.5 hours** of symptom onset [^1173Hge3], with the greatest benefit when given as early as possible [^11746uZB]. For the thrombectomy window, mechanical thrombectomy is indicated within **6 hours** [^113jKNK7] for anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion and can be performed up to **24 hours** in selected patients with favorable imaging profiles [^115o772p]. For wake-up or unknown-onset strokes [^1173Hge3], IV thrombolysis is considered if MRI shows DWI-FLAIR mismatch [^111yz6NX]; thrombectomy is guided by advanced imaging [^111VYwNY].

| **Attribute** | **IV thrombolysis** | **Mechanical thrombectomy** |
|-|-|-|
| Standard window | ≤ 4.5 hours [^1173Hge3] | ≤ 6 hours [^113jKNK7] |
| Extended window | DWI-FLAIR mismatch [^111yz6NX] | 6–24 hours |
| Imaging criteria | MRI DWI-FLAIR mismatch [^111yz6NX] | Perfusion mismatch [^111VYwNY], small core [^115o772p] |

---

The key point is that **Early treatment improves outcomes** [^115anX1A], and advanced imaging enables safe extension of windows in selected patients [^112Q3d6W].

### Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale-adjusted time window for intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator in acute ischemic stroke [^11746uZB]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

The effect of tissue-type plasminogen activator on functional outcomes decreases progressively over time. However, given the differential pattern of arterial occlusion, stroke severity, and speed of ischemic lesion growth among candidates for reperfusion, the time window should be adjusted accordingly. We aimed to identify the impact of time-to-treatment according to stroke severity on functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

- **Methods**: We included 581 consecutive patients treated with alteplase according to the European Summary of Product Characteristics criteria. Patients were categorized according to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) severity: mild NIHSS (≤ 8), moderate NIHSS (9–15), and severe stroke NIHSS (≥ 16). We sequentially analyzed time-to-treatment to achieve a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤ 2 at 3 months).

- **Results**: Overall, 19.8% had mild, 30.3% had moderate, and 49.9% had severe stroke. Favorable outcomes occurred in 79.1%, 60.8%, and 26.2%, respectively. In patients with mild stroke, younger age (odds ratio [OR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.8–0.95), no previous history of stroke (OR, 0.16; 95% CI [0.039–0.65]), and no proximal occlusion (OR, 0.183; 95% CI [0.038–0.89]) independently predicted a favorable outcome. In patients with moderate stroke, age (OR, 0.95; 95% CI [0.92–0.98]), no proximal occlusion (OR, 0.362; 95% CI [0.17–0.75]), and time-to-treatment within 120 minutes (OR, 2.70; 95% CI [1.14–6.38]) emerged as independent predictors of a favorable outcome.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke [^1173Hge3]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Intravenous thrombolysis is the only approved systemic reperfusion treatment for patients with acute ischaemic stroke. These European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations to assist physicians in their clinical decisions regarding intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke. These guidelines were developed based on the ESO standard operating procedure and followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.

The working group identified relevant clinical questions, performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literature, assessed the quality of the available evidence, and wrote recommendations. Expert consensus statements were provided if not enough evidence was available to offer recommendations based on the GRADE approach. We found high-quality evidence to recommend intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase to improve functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours after symptom onset.

We also found high-quality evidence to recommend intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase in patients with acute ischaemic stroke who awaken from sleep, were last seen well more than 4.5 hours earlier, have MRI DWI-FLAIR mismatch, and for whom mechanical thrombectomy is not planned. These guidelines provide further recommendations regarding patient subgroups, late time windows, imaging selection strategies, and relative and absolute contraindications to alteplase and tenecteplase. Intravenous thrombolysis remains a cornerstone of acute stroke management.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to indications for thrombectomy (0–6 hours from onset), the AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend performing mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever in patients meeting all the following criteria:

- **Age ≥ 18 years**: Patients must be adults, ensuring a minimum age requirement.
- **Pre-stroke mRS score 0–1**: Indicates minimal or no disability before the stroke.
- **Causative occlusion of the internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery segment 1 (M1)**: Ensures that the thrombectomy targets major artery occlusions.
- **NIHSS score ≥ 6**: Patients should exhibit a significant level of neurological impairment.
- **ASPECTS ≥ 6**: Assesses the initial extent of the stroke and viability of the brain tissue.
- **Treatment can be initiated (groin puncture) within 6 hours of symptom onset**: Ensures timely intervention to maximize recovery potential.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

The AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines for acute ischemic stroke management recommend considering MRI to identify diffusion-positive FLAIR-negative lesions. This is crucial for selecting candidates for intravenous alteplase administration within 4.5 hours of stroke symptom recognition in awake patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). It is also applicable for patients with an unclear time of onset when it is greater than 4.5 hours from the last known well or baseline state.

### Reducing door-to-puncture times for intra-arterial stroke therapy: A pilot quality improvement project [^115HRFCF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) and the doubling of treatment rates over the latter half of the past decade, only a small fraction of patients arrive within the time window to receive this treatment. Intra‐arterial therapy (IAT), consisting of device‐mediated thrombus removal or dissolution with lytics, is an alternative treatment option for patients who present with proximal intracranial artery occlusion and are ineligible for, or do not respond to, IV thrombolysis.

Several studies have demonstrated that rapid treatment initiation with IV thrombolysis is associated with better clinical outcomes. Based on the recognition of the "golden hour" in intravenous acute stroke treatment, public health initiatives have set a target door‐to‐needle time of less than 60 minutes. Efforts have targeted pre‐ and in‐hospital delays as part of quality improvement (QI) programs. Similarly, time to angiographic reperfusion of the ischemic brain has been shown to be a significant predictor of favorable clinical outcomes after IAT. However, unlike for IV tPA, there are no large‐scale public health initiatives to improve the delivery of IAT. Although recent guidelines for comprehensive stroke centers (CSCs) have proposed a target door‐to‐groin puncture time of less than 2 hours, no further performance benchmarks are specified because of the lack of data regarding systems‐level processes involved in triaging patients to the neurointerventional (NI) suite and thus potential sources of delay.

In a multidisciplinary pilot QI project, we aimed…

Regarding the acute ischemic stroke in patients with basilar artery occlusion, the ESMINT/ESO 2024 guidelines recommend considering the administration of intravenous thrombolysis. This treatment should be considered in adult patients with basilar artery occlusion-related AIS if it is not contraindicated and the patient presents within 4.5, 4.5–12, or 12–24 hours from the time they were last known well. It is crucial that there are no extensive ischemic changes in the posterior circulation, specifically no extensive bilateral and/or brainstem ischemic changes.

### Thrombolysis for ischemic stroke beyond the 4.5-hour window: A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1141nfjS]. Stroke (2025). High credibility.

A minority of patients with stroke qualify for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) within the 4.5-hour window. The safety and efficacy of IVT beyond this period have not been well studied.
- **Methods**: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov for relevant randomized clinical trials. Randomized clinical trials comparing IVT versus standard medical care in patients with ischemic stroke beyond 4.5 hours of symptom onset or last known well without mechanical thrombectomy (MT) were included. Primary outcomes were excellent (modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1) and good (modified Rankin Scale score of 0–2) functional outcomes at 90 days, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and death at 90 days. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by Q test and quantified by I² values.
- **Results**: Eight randomized clinical trials (1,742 patients; mean age, 69.8 ± 9 years, 63.5% men) were included. Compared with standard medical care, IVT achieved higher rates of excellent (OR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.17–1.75]; Q = 2.30; P = 0.94; I² = 0%) and good functional outcomes (OR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.12–1.66]; Q = 2.07; P = 0.96; I² = 0%) at 90 days but also increased sICH rates (OR, 4.25 [95% CI, 1.67–10.84]; Q = 0.48; P = 0.99; I² = 0%). Mortality at 90 days did not significantly differ between treatment groups (OR, 1.28 [95% CI, 0.87–1.89]; Q = 4.63; P = 0.59; I² = 0%). Subanalyses yielded numerically higher odds of excellent functional outcomes when patients were selected with perfusion imaging (3 studies, OR…).

### Activase [^111VJwqG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Acute ischemic stroke**: Administer Activase as soon as possible, but within 3 hours after the onset of symptoms. The recommended dose is 0.9 mg/kg (not to exceed a total dose of 90 mg), with 10% of the total dose administered as an initial intravenous bolus over 1 minute and the remainder infused over 60 minutes. Frequently monitor and control blood pressure during and following Activase administration for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

In patients without recent use of oral anticoagulants or heparin, Activase treatment can be initiated prior to the availability of coagulation study results. Discontinue Activase if the pretreatment International Normalized Ratio (INR) is greater than 1.7 or the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is elevated [see Contraindications (4.1)].

- **Acute myocardial infarction**: Administer Activase as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. The recommended total dose for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is based on patient weight, not to exceed 100 mg, regardless of the selected administration regimen (accelerated or 3-hour, described below). There are two Activase dose regimens (accelerated and 3-hour) for use in the management of AMI; however, there are no controlled studies to compare clinical outcomes with these regimens [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].
- **Accelerated infusion**: The recommended accelerated infusion dose consists of an IV bolus [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5)] followed by an IV infusion as set forth in the deleted table. The safety and efficacy of the accelerated infusion of Activase have only been investigated with completed infusion regimens.

### Perfusion imaging for endovascular thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke is associated with improved functional outcomes in the early and late time windows [^1153AutD]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

In this large real-world study, the acquisition of perfusion imaging for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was associated with improvement in functional outcomes in both the early and late time windows compared with nonperfusion imaging. These indirect comparisons should be interpreted with caution while awaiting confirmatory data from more inclusive prospective randomized trials, which may prove that a net treatment benefit may still be sustained in patient groups selected without perfusion imaging in the late window.

### Perfusion imaging for endovascular thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke is associated with improved functional outcomes in the early and late time windows [^1154N6BC]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

- **Results**:

The characteristics of the study population were delineated as follows. A total of 4,383 patients were originally admitted to 123 hospitals and underwent EVT at 25 EVT-capable neuroscience centers during the study period. Of these, 104 patients treated beyond 24 hours and 30 patients with a lack of data on the mRS score at discharge were excluded. We included 4,249 patients in the study, with 971 (22.9%) selected with perfusion imaging and 3,278 (77.1%) selected without it.

A total of 3,203 (75.4%) patients were treated within 6 hours, among which 593 (18.5%) were selected with perfusion imaging and 2,610 (81.5%) without. Meanwhile, 1,046 (24.6%) patients received treatment between 6 and 24 hours from stroke onset or last known well, with 378 (36.1%) selected with and 668 (63.9%) selected without perfusion imaging.

Overall, 197 patients had significant prestroke disability, indicated by an mRS score of 3–5, and 257 patients had an NIHSS score of less than 6 on admission. A total of 2,807 patients (66.0%) had a documented precise time of stroke onset, while the remainder were documented as last known well.

### Outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy in the early (< 6-hour) and extended (≥ 6-hour) time window based solely on noncontrast CT and CT angiography: A propensity score-matched cohort study [^1136g9QH]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2021). Low credibility.

Stroke care recommendations for patient selection for mechanical thrombectomy in the extended time window demand advanced imaging to determine the stroke core volume and hypoperfusion mismatch, which may not be available at every center. We aimed to determine outcomes in patients selected for mechanical thrombectomy solely on the basis of noncontrast CT and CTA in the early (< 6-hour) and extended (≥ 6-hour) time windows.
- **Materials and methods**: Consecutive mechanical thrombectomies performed for acute large-vessel occlusion ischemic (ICA, M1, M2) stroke between February 2016 and August 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Eligibility was based solely on demographics and noncontrast CT (ASPECTS) and CTA, due to the limited availability of perfusion imaging during the study period. Propensity score matching was performed to compare outcomes between time windows.
- **Results**: Of 417 mechanical thrombectomies performed, 337 met the inclusion criteria, resulting in 205 (60.8%) and 132 (39.2%) patients in the 0- to 6- and 6- to 24-hour time windows, respectively. The ASPECTS was higher in the early time window (9; interquartile range = 8–10) than the extended time window (9; interquartile range = 7–10; p = 0.005). Propensity score matching yielded 112 well-matched pairs. Equal rates of TICI 2b/3 revascularization and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were observed. A favorable functional outcome (mRS 0–2) at 90 days was numerically more frequent in the early window (45.5% versus 33.9%, P = 0.091). Mortality was numerically more frequent in the early window.

### Reasons for prehospital delay in acute ischemic stroke [^116adrQN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

To investigate the determinants of prehospital delay, the time between stroke onset — or the time point of wake-up — and admission to the Stroke Center of the University Hospital Basel was stratified into two groups with a cutoff of 4.5 hours. We chose this time interval because it corresponds to the window in which intravenous thrombolysis can be administered in most countries. For wake-up strokes, we selected the time point of wake-up as the relevant time point instead of last seen well because the interval between stroke onset during sleep and awakening cannot be influenced by interventions aimed at shortening prehospital delay. Moreover, according to the WAKE-UP (Efficacy and Safety of MRI-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke) trial, intravenous thrombolysis can be considered within 4.5 hours from wake-up. Categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test, and continuous variables were analyzed with the Mann–Whitney test. As a measure of variance for continuous variables, we report the median and interquartile range (IQR). Variables with a P value of ≤ 0.2 in the univariate analysis of prehospital delay were included in a multivariate logistic regression model with prehospital delay as the endpoint. A P value of < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. The following variables were considered potential confounders: age, stroke severity at admission measured using NIHSS, education level, living situation, knowledge level regarding stroke symptoms, and medical history, such as any condition like hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes mellitus.

### Activase [^1126yHGN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Two placebo-controlled, double-blind trials (Studies 1 and 2) were conducted in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Both studies enrolled patients with measurable neurological deficits who could complete screening and begin study treatment within 3 hours from symptom onset. A cranial computerized tomography (CT) scan was performed prior to treatment to rule out the presence of intracranial hemorrhage. Blood pressure was actively controlled (185/110 mm Hg or lower) for 24 hours.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either 0.9 mg/kg Activase (maximum of 90 mg) or placebo. Activase was administered as a 10% initial IV bolus over 1 minute, followed by continuous IV infusion of the remainder over 60 minutes. Study treatment was initiated prior to the availability of coagulation study results in patients without recent use of oral anticoagulants and/or heparin, and it was discontinued if the pretreatment prothrombin time (PT) was greater than 15 seconds or the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was elevated. Patients with prior aspirin use were included. Administration of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents was prohibited for the first 24 hours following symptom onset.

Study 1 (n = 291) evaluated neurological improvement at 24 hours after stroke onset. The primary endpoint, which was the proportion of patients with a 4-point or greater improvement in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or complete recovery (NIHSS score of 0), was not significantly different between treatment groups. A prespecified secondary analysis suggested improved outcomes.

### Clinical policy: Use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator for the management of acute ischemic stroke in the emergency department [^112pc5JH]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). High credibility.

The 2015 guidelines from the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) recommend administering intravenous (IV) alteplase to improve functional outcomes in selected patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) within three hours after symptom onset. This recommendation applies to institutions where systems are in place to safely administer this medication. When deciding whether to administer IV alteplase, it is crucial to consider the increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage in patients with AIS.

The evolution of reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction and acute ischaemic stroke has many similarities. Thrombolysis is superior to placebo, intra-arterial thrombolysis is not superior to intravenous (i.v.), facilitated intervention is of questionable value, and direct mechanical recanalization without thrombolysis is proven in myocardial infarction, or promising in stroke, to be superior to thrombolysis — but only when started with no or minimal delay. However, there are also substantial differences.

- **Complexity**: Direct catheter-based thrombectomy in acute ischaemic stroke is more difficult than primary angioplasty in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in many ways.

- **Challenges**:
	- Complex pre-intervention diagnostic workup.
	- Shorter time window for clinically effective reperfusion.
	- Need for an emergent multidisciplinary approach from the first medical contact.
	- Vessel tortuosity and fragility.
	- Lack of evidence about dosage and combination of peri-procedural antithrombotic drugs.
	- Risk of intracranial bleeding.
	- Unclear respective roles of thrombolysis and mechanical intervention.
	- Lower number of suitable patients, resulting in longer learning curves for staff.

Thus, starting an acute stroke interventional programme requires extensive learning, discipline, and humility. Randomized trials comparing different reperfusion strategies have provided similar results in acute ischaemic stroke as in STEMI. It might be expected that a future randomized trial comparing direct (primary) catheter-based thrombectomy versus i.v. thrombolysis could demonstrate the superiority of mechanical intervention.

### Expanding the treatment window with mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke [^115k6cYX]. Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke is a common disease associated with high mortality and significant long-term disability. Treatment options for acute ischemic stroke continue to evolve and include pharmaceutical and mechanical therapies. With the recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of a new device for mechanical thrombectomy, the options available for treatment of acute ischemic stroke have been expanded. Thrombolytic therapy is generally given intravenously in the first 3 hours and up to 6 hours via the intraarterial route for pharmacological clot disruption. The maximum time frame for mechanical thrombectomy devices has yet to be determined.
- **Methods**: A 78-year-old female presented to the emergency room with a dense right hemiparesis, leftward gaze preference, and dense global aphasia. Eight hours after symptom onset, left carotid angiography confirmed a left internal carotid artery terminus occlusion. A single pass was made through the clot with an X6 Merci Retriever device.
- **Results**: After a single pass, the vessel was reopened and normal flow in the left internal carotid artery was demonstrated. At the time of discharge, her neurological deficits had improved significantly. Furthermore, the final infarct area, as demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging, was probably much smaller than it would have been if the vessel had not been recanalized.
- **Conclusion**: We report the use of a new mechanical thrombectomy device 8 hours after onset of ischemic symptoms, with substantial subsequent improvement in neurological outcome. In selected cases, use of the Merci Retriever can be advantageous for patient recovery.

### In-hospital intravenous thrombolysis offers no benefit in mechanical thrombectomy in optimized tertiary stroke center setting [^112UqQwR]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). High credibility.

Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) has been proven to have a positive effect on patient survival and functional outcome in ischemic stroke if administered within a strict time window from symptom onset. However, the effect of IVT is very limited on large vessel occlusions (LVO) thrombi. Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) performed with modern methods is vastly superior in treating this patient group. IVT prior to MT appears to have a favorable effect on clinical outcome, but some studies have reported no significant effect on the outcome. Bellwald et al. found that there were more deaths at 3 months among the IVT-treated patients.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of MT without IVT in patients with no contraindications to IVT presenting directly to a tertiary stroke center with acute anterior circulation LVO in comparison with patients who received both MT and IVT in the same setting.

### Effect of time delay on reperfusion after tenecteplase in an extended time window: Analysis from the CHABLIS-T trials [^117EYde2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Of the 310 patients enrolled in the CHABLIS‐T trials, 199 patients received tenecteplase treatment per protocol (CHABLIS‐T: 86 patients, CHABLIS‐T II: 113 patients; 0.25 mg/kg: 156 patients [78.4%], 0.32 mg/kg: 43 patients [21.6%]). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 68.0 (59.0–76.0) years old, and the median (IQR) baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 10.0 (6.0–14.0). A proportion of 33.7% (67) of patients achieved major reperfusion after thrombolytic treatment.
- **Clinical and imaging characteristics**: A total of 198 patients were included in the analysis of time from symptom onset and major reperfusion. One patient receiving tenecteplase treatment could not report the accurate time of symptom onset.

### Mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke and lower NIHSS scores: Recanalization rates, periprocedural complications, and clinical outcome [^1162qLxx]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

Mechanical thrombectomy, in addition to intravenous thrombolysis, has become standard in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke for patients with large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation. However, previous randomized controlled stroke trials did not focus on patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, resulting in limited data on patient selection, clinical outcome prediction, and complication occurrence for this population. The purpose of this analysis was to assess clinical and interventional data for patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy in cases of ischemic stroke with mild-to-moderate symptoms.

Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected stroke database. Inclusion criteria were anterior circulation ischemic strokes treated with mechanical thrombectomy at our institution between September 2010 and October 2015, with an NIHSS score of ≤ 8.

Results: Of 484 patients, we identified 33 (6.8%) with the following characteristics: median NIHSS = 5 (interquartile range, 4–7), median onset-to-groin puncture time = 320 minutes (interquartile range, 237–528 minutes). Recanalization (TICI = 2b-3) was achieved in 26 (78.7%) patients. Two cases of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were observed. Favorable (mRS 0–2) and moderate (mRS 0–3) clinical outcomes at 90 days were achieved in 21 (63.6%) and 30 (90.9%) patients, respectively.

Conclusions: The clinical outcome of patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke with mild symptoms due to large-vessel occlusion appears positive.

### Merci mechanical thrombectomy retriever for acute ischemic stroke therapy: Literature review [^1158YeHj]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Mechanical thrombectomy is a promising adjuvant or stand-alone therapy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by occlusion of a large vessel in patients beyond the systemic thrombolysis therapeutic window. This review focuses on the clinical and angiographic outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy with the use of the Merci retriever device.
- **Methods**: Available literature at the time of writing on major trials and observational studies involving the Merci retriever was reviewed. Additionally, results from studies involving the Merci retriever were compared to results from Prolyse in Acute Cerebral Thromboembolism II (PROACT II) and Penumbra device studies. Predictors for favorable outcomes following revascularization with the Merci device were evaluated based on published stratified analyses. A favorable clinical outcome was defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of ≤ 2 at 90 days following AIS.
- **Results**: This review includes a total of 1,226 patients treated with the Merci device. Of these, 305 patients are from two pivotal trials involving the device, and the remaining 921 patients are from observational studies in the Merci registry. A mRS of ≤ 2 at 90 days was achieved in 32% of the patient group, with an overall mortality rate of 35.2%. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was identified in 7.3% of patients treated with the Merci retriever, a result comparable to that in the PROACT II and Penumbra thrombectomy trials. Successful recanalization, a lower NIH Stroke Scale score, and younger age were identified as the strongest predictors for positive outcomes.

### Comparing extended versus standard time window for thrombectomy: Caseload, patient characteristics, treatment rates and outcomes-a prospective single-centre study [^115P9h8i]. Neuroradiology (2021). Low credibility.

Extending the time window from 6 to 24 hours for thrombectomy results in more than a 25% increase in patients receiving thrombectomy. This comes at the cost of significantly increased clinical and imaging screening burdens due to the smaller proportion of treatment-eligible patients beyond 6 hours based on strict eligibility criteria. However, late patients benefit at least equally from the treatment; therefore, active screening for them is recommended. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefit of thrombectomy beyond 6 hours with less strict imaging and clinical criteria. Efforts should be made to achieve earlier patient arrival, as "time is brain" remains an important paradigm at the population level.

### Automatic ischemic core estimation based on noncontrast-enhanced computed tomography [^112aYkC5]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Evaluating the extent of ischemic change is an important step in deciding whether to use thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. However, the standard method, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, is semiquantitative and has low consistency among raters. We aim to create and test a fully automated machine learning-based ischemic core segmentation model using only noncontrast-enhanced computed tomography images.
- **Methods**: In this multicenter retrospective study, patients with anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke who received both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging before thrombolysis or recanalization treatment between 2013 and 2019 were included. On CT, the ischemic core was manually delineated using the diffusion-weighted image and apparent diffusion coefficient maps. A deep learning-based ischemic core segmentation model (DL model) was developed using data from three institutions (n = 272), and the model performance was validated using data from another three institutions (n = 106).
- **Results**: The median time between CT and magnetic resonance imaging in the validation cohort was 18 minutes. The DL model calculated ischemic core volume correlated significantly with the reference standard (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.90, P < 0.01). For patients imaged more than 4.5 hours from onset, the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.93, with P < 0.01, showing significant correlations. The median difference in volume between the model and the reference standard was 4.7.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to indications for thrombectomy (0–6 hours from onset), the AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend considering mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever in carefully selected patients with AIS. These patients should have causative occlusion of the anterior cerebral arteries, vertebral arteries, basilar artery, or posterior cerebral arteries, if treatment can be initiated (groin puncture) within 6 hours of symptom onset.

### Interfacility transfer for thrombectomy: A promising therapeutic window [^1127iiKv]. Stroke (2025). High credibility.

Currently, most acute ischemic stroke patients with a large vessel occlusion are initially evaluated at non-thrombectomy-capable centers before being transferred to comprehensive stroke centers for thrombectomy. Interfacility transfer is a complex process requiring extensive coordination among the referring, transporting, and receiving facilities. Consequently, long delays are common, contributing to poor clinical outcomes.

This review summarizes the accumulating literature concerning clinical and radiological changes during interfacility transfer for thrombectomy, including infarct growth, collateral change, arterial recanalization, and hemorrhagic transformation. Recent evidence indicates that these changes are heterogeneous across patients and significantly impact long-term functional outcomes, underscoring the urgent need to optimize care during this window.

We evaluate promising therapeutic strategies, such as penumbral protection, to reduce infarct growth and improve clinical outcomes for patients being transferred to thrombectomy-capable centers. Finally, we discuss key methodological considerations for designing clinical trials aimed at reducing infarct growth during transfer.

### Mechanical thrombectomy up to 24 hours in large vessel occlusions and infarct velocity assessment [^116eusfr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Infarct growth velocity, measured in mL/h, was defined as the baseline volume divided by the onset‐to‐image time. The median (interquartile range) infarct velocity was 5.1 (0.9–20) mL/h for patients in the early time window (< 6 hours) and 0.6 (0.1–1.9) mL/h for those in the late time window (6–24 hours) (P = 0.003).

No statistically significant differences were observed in the primary outcome, with 42% of the late-presenting time-window group achieving a good outcome compared to 53% of the early time-window group (P = 0.30). Similarly, excellent outcomes were achieved by 26% of the late-presenting group versus 32% of the early group (P = 0.51). Furthermore, no significant differences were found in the rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) at 6.5% in the late-presenting group versus 4.6% in the early-presenting group (P = 0.74), nor in the rates of death, with 3.2% in the late-presenting group versus 5.7% in the early-presenting group (P = 0.58).

In regard to overall outcomes evaluated via the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), no significant differences were identified in the primary outcome rates (mRS 0–2 at 90 days) and excellent outcome rates (mRS 0–1 at 90 days) between early time-window (< 6 hours) and late-presenting time-window (6–24 hours) patients. Primary outcomes were achieved in 53% of early time-window and 42% of late time-window patients (P = 0.30). The secondary outcome of mRS 0–1 at 90 days was achieved in 32% of early time-window and 26% of late time-window patients (P = 0.51).

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute ischemic stroke, specifically with respect to indications for thrombectomy within 0–6 hours from onset, AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend considering mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever in patients with acute ischemic stroke meeting the following criteria:

- **Pre-stroke mRS score**: > 1.
- **Causative occlusion**: Of the internal carotid artery or proximal middle cerebral artery (M1).
- **NIHSS score**: < 6.
- **ASPECTS score**: < 6.
- **Initiation of treatment**: Groin puncture can be performed within 6 hours of symptom onset.

### Endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke [^114NrJif]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

This review describes the evolution of endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke, the state of the art, and the challenges for the next decade. The rapid development of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT), from the first attempts to its establishment as a standard of care on a global scale, is one of the major achievements in modern medicine. This progress was possible thanks to the establishment of a scientific framework for patient selection, assessment of stroke severity and outcome, and technical development by dedicated physicians and the MedTech industry. This includes noninvasive imaging for patient selection and radiological outcome evaluation.

A series of randomized controlled trials on EVT, in addition to intravenous thrombolytics, showed overwhelmingly positive results for anterior circulation stroke within 6 hours of onset, regardless of patient characteristics, with a number needed to treat of less than 3 for any positive shift in outcome. This paved the way for a rapid introduction of EVT into clinical practice. Within the "extended" time window of 6–24 hours, the effect has been even greater for patients with salvageable brain tissue according to perfusion imaging, with a number needed to treat below 2.

Even so, EVT is only available for a small portion of stroke patients, and successfully recanalized EVT patients do not always achieve excellent functional outcomes. The major challenges in the years to come include rapid prehospital detection of stroke symptoms, adequate clinical and radiological diagnosis of severe ischemic stroke cases, and enabling effective recanalization by EVT in dedicated angiosuites.

### Effect of time delay on reperfusion after tenecteplase in an extended time window: Analysis from the CHABLIS-T trials [^116gKHWm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

In this post hoc analysis of the CHABLIS‐T trials, time delay was associated with reduced post‐thrombolytic reperfusion odds in stroke patients treated with tenecteplase in the 4.5- to 24-hour time window, especially in cases without atherosclerosis. Therefore, timely reperfusion is of critical importance to optimize outcomes, even for patients with favorable perfusion profiles in an extended time window.

### Subcortical infarcts on admission CTP predict poor outcome despite excellent reperfusion in delayed time windows [^115Qov8a]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

The effect of pretreatment infarct location on clinical outcome after successful mechanical thrombectomy is not fully understood. This study aimed to evaluate the association between computed tomography perfusion (CTP)-based ischemic core location and clinical outcome following excellent reperfusion in late time windows.

Patients who underwent thrombectomy for acute anterior circulation large vessel occlusion in late time windows from October 2019 to June 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 65 patients with visible ischemic core on admission CTP who achieved excellent reperfusion, defined as modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade 2c/3, were enrolled. Poor outcome was characterized by a modified Rankin scale score of 3–6 at 90 days. The ischemic core infarct territories were classified into cortical and subcortical areas, and multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were conducted.

Of the 65 patients analyzed, 38 (58.5%) had a poor outcome. Multivariable logistic analysis demonstrated that subcortical infarcts (OR 11.75; 95% CI 1.79–77.32; P = 0.010) and their volume (OR 1.17; 95% CI 1.04–1.32; P = 0.011) were independently associated with poor outcome. The ROC curve indicated the capacity of subcortical infarct involvement (AUC = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53–0.77; P < 0.001) and subcortical infarct volume (AUC = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60–0.83; P < 0.001) to accurately predict poor outcomes.

In conclusion, subcortical infarcts and their volume on admission CTP are associated with poor outcomes following excellent reperfusion in delayed time windows.

### Advances in mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke [^113A4WuL]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Guidelines compare the three prominent guidelines for the UK and Ireland (National Clinical Guideline for Stroke), North America (American Heart Association), and Europe (European Stroke Organisation/European Society of Minimally Invasive Neurological Therapy). The guidelines are concordant with their recommendations for the use of thrombectomy in the early and late windows. Bridging treatment with intravenous thrombolysis is recommended by all three.

While the American Stroke Association recommends consideration of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients with a pre-stroke modified Rankin score of 0–1, the National Clinical Guideline for Stroke extends this to a modified Rankin score of 0–2, and the European Stroke Organisation focuses on the radiological parameters. The American Stroke Association provides two separate recommendations for large vessel occlusions and medium vessel occlusions. All three sets of guidelines refer to the type of device and clot extraction technique used.

While the National Clinical Guideline for Stroke moves away from advanced imaging except for in the very late windows (12–24 hours), the American Heart Association and European Stroke Organisation offer alternative strategies to advanced imaging and the optimal targets for peri-procedural hypertension management. The European Stroke Organisation considers pre-hospital pathways in thrombectomy but does not recommend one particular strategy.

### Perfusion imaging for endovascular thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke is associated with improved functional outcomes in the early and late time windows [^113xRJYu]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

The mean onset-to-treatment time in the perfusion imaging group was significantly longer in the late time window compared with the nonperfusion group (671.1 ± 251.5 versus 619.5 ± 247.5 minutes), while no difference was observed in the early window (perfusion: 229.6 ± 68.4 versus nonperfusion: 232.5 ± 67.4 minutes).

In the late window:

- **Neuroimaging-to-arterial puncture time**: Similar between groups (perfusion: 158.0 ± 169.8 versus nonperfusion: 160.3 ± 189.4 minutes).
- **Door-to-end of procedure time and procedural time**: Shorter in the perfusion imaging group (325.5 ± 219.1 versus 334.9 ± 216.3 minutes and 54.4 ± 35.9 versus 61.9 ± 42.4 minutes, respectively).

In the early window, no significant differences were identified:

- **Neuroimaging-to-arterial puncture time**: P = 0.51.
- **Procedural time**: P = 0.06.

The distribution of patients relative to onset-to-puncture time across both time windows is presented in the study.

### Effect of the number of neurointerventionalists on off-hour endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke within 12 hours of symptom onset [^114KDmtE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

- **Results**:

	- Of the 31,133 stroke patients who were admitted to one of the twelve participating centers between January 2010 and December 2015, 1,564 patients met the eligibility criteria (Figure 1). They had a mean age of 69 ± 12 years, and the median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 15 (IQR, 10–19). Of these 1,564 patients, 893 (57.1%) visited the hospitals during off-hours. Compared with the patients who visited during on-hours, they were slightly younger and more frequently had an unclear stroke onset time. However, they showed no significant differences in baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, ischemic stroke subtype, and vascular risk factors, except for atrial fibrillation.
- **Off-hour effects on treatment delay**:

	- The patients that arrived during off-hours had significantly greater median door-to-puncture time (DTPT; 110 versus 95 minutes; P < 0.001) and resultant greater median onset to puncture time (250 [176–360] versus 220 [160–317] minutes; P < 0.001). Exact image time was available for 1,052 patients. Median door-to-image time did not differ significantly between off-hours and on-hours (19 [12–29] versus 19 [11–30] minutes; P = 0.74). However, the image-to-puncture time was delayed by approximately 17 minutes during off-hours (90 [67–117] versus 73 [49–105] minutes; P < 0.001). Procedure times were available for all patients except for thirteen, and the median procedure times were also significantly higher in patients that arrived during off-hours.

### Management of acute ischemic stroke [^114oB4Cg]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The FDA approval of IV-tPA has revolutionized the entire field of emergency neurology. However, up to 69% of stroke patients are ineligible to receive IV-tPA due to delayed hospital presentation. Over the last three years, the time window for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treatment has expanded thanks to endovascular therapy (EVT), providing physicians with a stronger therapeutic arsenal.

The success of EVT is measured by the degree or quality of revascularization. The Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale is a tool to standardize the different degrees of reperfusion, ranging from no perfusion (TICI 0) to complete perfusion (TICI 3). TICI scores of 2B to 3 are usually regarded as successful reperfusion.

Previous studies failed to show improved results with EVT and diminished the initial optimism regarding intervention for AIS. However, the study design of those clinical trials was criticized for not requiring image proof of large vessel occlusion (LVO), using older technology for clot retrieval, and having prolonged stroke-to-puncture times. Since 2015, multiple trials have shown the efficacy of EVT in addition to standard medical care, improving the overall outcome of AIS patients with proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) or internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion. This is especially true when EVT is performed within six, eight, or twelve hours of symptom onset.

A pooled meta-analysis demonstrated that modern EVT more than doubles the odds of a better functional outcome compared with standard therapy alone. This was achieved without any significant difference in mortality or risk of parenchymal hemorrhage at 90 days.

### Advances in mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke [^111iujyQ]. BMJ Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by a large vessel occlusion, presenting within the early window of 6 hours from stroke symptom onset, are eligible for MT if they:

- **Baseline functionality**: Are functionally independent at baseline (modified Rankin score of 0–2).
- **Stroke severity**: Have at least a moderate stroke syndrome (NIHSS ≥ 6).
- **Imaging criteria**: Do not show extensive areas of early ischaemia on non-contrast CT (for example, a cut-off of ASPECTS ≥ 5 can be used).

Example workflow (Figure 5): A patient presenting with symptoms consistent with acute ischaemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusion (LVO) within the standard time windows (0–6 hours from symptom onset) may be considered for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), assuming no contraindications. Eventual thrombectomy will be offered at the nearest comprehensive stroke center that is capable of performing mechanical thrombectomy. These eligibility criteria are typical for patient selection in the UK, but may vary globally. Some expansions of these criteria are discussed throughout the present review.

### Workflows and outcomes in patients with suspected large vessel occlusion stroke triaged in urban and nonurban areas [^116Smqn3]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

We aim to compare the outcome of patients from urban areas, where the referral center is able to perform thrombectomy, with patients from nonurban areas enrolled in the RACECAT trial (Direct Transfer to an Endovascular Center Compared to Transfer to the Closest Stroke Center in Acute Stroke Patients With Suspected Large Vessel Occlusion).
- **Methods**: Patients with suspected large vessel occlusion stroke, as evaluated by a Rapid Arterial Occlusion Evaluation score of ≥ 5, from urban catchment areas of thrombectomy-capable centers during the RACECAT trial enrollment period were included in the Stroke Code Registry of Catalonia. The primary outcome was disability at 90 days, as assessed by the shift analysis on the modified Rankin Scale score, in patients with an ischemic stroke. Secondary outcomes included mortality at 90 days, rate of thrombolysis and thrombectomy, time from onset to thrombolysis, and thrombectomy initiation. Propensity score matching was used to assemble a cohort of patients with similar characteristics.
- **Results**: The analysis included 1,369 patients from nonurban areas and 2,502 from urban areas. We matched 920 patients with an ischemic stroke from urban and nonurban areas based on their propensity scores. Patients with ischemic stroke from nonurban areas had higher degrees of disability at 90 days (median [interquartile range] modified Rankin Scale score, 3 [2–5] versus 3 [1–5], common odds ratio, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.06–1.48]); the observed average effect was only significant in patients with large vessel stroke (common odds ratio, 1.36 [95% CI…).

### Fibrinolysis: strategies to enhance the treatment of acute ischemic stroke [^111jsJgs]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Stroke is a major cause of disability worldwide and is the second leading cause of death after ischemic heart disease. Until recently, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) was the only treatment for acute ischemic stroke. If administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, t-PA improves the outcome in stroke patients. Mechanical thrombectomy is now the preferred treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke resulting from a large-artery occlusion in the anterior circulation. However, the widespread use of mechanical thrombectomy is limited by two factors.

First, only approximately 10% of patients with acute ischemic stroke have a proximal large-artery occlusion in the anterior circulation and present early enough to undergo mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours; an additional 9–10% of patients presenting within the 6–24 hour time window may also qualify for the procedure. Second, not all stroke centers have the resources or expertise to perform mechanical thrombectomy. Nonetheless, patients who present to hospitals where thrombectomy is not an option can receive intravenous t-PA, and those with qualifying anterior circulation strokes can then be transferred to tertiary stroke centers where thrombectomy is available.

Therefore, despite the advances afforded by mechanical thrombectomy, there remains a need for treatments that improve the efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy. In this review, we discuss:

- **Treatment options for acute ischemic stroke**: Available approaches and innovations.
- **Mechanism of action of fibrinolytic agents**: Understanding how these agents work at a molecular level.
- **Potential strategies to manipulate the fibrinolytic system**: Exploring ways to enhance treatment outcomes.

### Is the cost-effectiveness of stroke thrombolysis affected by proportion of stroke mimics [^111P9Ly8]. Stroke (2019). Low credibility.

Differentiating ischemic stroke patients from stroke mimics (SM) — nonvascular conditions that simulate stroke — can be challenging in the acute setting. We sought to model the cost-effectiveness of treating suspected acute ischemic stroke patients before a definitive diagnosis could be made. We hypothesized that we would identify threshold proportions of SM among suspected stroke patients arriving at an emergency department, above which administration of intravenous thrombolysis was no longer cost-effective.

We constructed a decision-analytic model to examine various emergency department thrombolytic treatment scenarios. The main variables were the proportion of SM to true stroke patients, time from symptom onset to treatment, and complication rates. Costs, reimbursement rates, and expected clinical outcomes of ischemic stroke and SM patients were estimated from published data. We report the 90-day incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of administering intravenous thrombolysis compared with no acute treatment from a healthcare sector perspective, as well as the cost-reimbursement ratio from a hospital-level perspective. Cost-effectiveness was defined as a willingness to pay 1.5.

There was an increase in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios as the proportion of SM cases increased in the 3-hour time window. The threshold proportion of SM, above which the decision to administer thrombolysis was no longer cost-effective, was 30%.

Regarding quality improvement for acute ischemic stroke, the AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend performing mechanical thrombectomy in an experienced stroke center with rapid access to cerebral angiography, qualified neuro-interventionalists, and a comprehensive periprocedural care team. Design, execute, and monitor systems to emphasize expeditious assessment and treatment. Track outcomes in all patients and encourage facilities to define criteria that can be used to credential individuals who can perform safe and timely intra-arterial revascularization procedures.

### Outcomes of thrombectomy in transferred patients with ischemic stroke in the late window: A subanalysis from the DEFUSE 3 trial [^116GFPQv]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

The importance of this study lies in understanding the outcomes of thrombectomy, as the benefit was maintained in transfer patients with ischemic stroke in early-window trials. However, overall functional independence rates were observed to be lower in both the thrombectomy and medical management-only groups.

The objective of the study was to evaluate whether the imaging-based selection criteria used in the Endovascular Therapy Following Imaging Evaluation for Ischemic Stroke 3 (DEFUSE 3) trial would lead to comparable outcome rates and treatment benefits in transfer versus direct-admission patients.
- **Design, setting, and participants**: This is a subgroup analysis of DEFUSE 3, a prospective, randomized, multicenter, blinded-end point trial. Patients were enrolled between May 2016 and May 2017 and were followed up for 90 days. The trial comprised 38 stroke centers in the United States and included 182 patients with stroke featuring a large-vessel anterior circulation occlusion, an initial infarct volume of less than 70 mL, a mismatch ratio of at least 1.8, and a mismatch volume of at least 15 mL. Patients were treated within 6 to 16 hours from the last known well and were stratified based on whether they presented directly to the study site or were transferred from a primary center. Data were analyzed between July 2018 and October 2018.
- **Interventions or exposures**: Patients received endovascular thrombectomy plus standard medical therapy versus standard medical therapy alone.
- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the distribution of 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores.

The results showed that out of the 296 patients who consented, 182 were randomized, with 66% being transfer patients and 34% directly presenting to a study site.

### Perfusion imaging for endovascular thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke is associated with improved functional outcomes in the early and late time windows [^1157fTgF]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Sensitivity analysis of patients in the late window with a witnessed stroke onset and selected using perfusion imaging demonstrated improved odds of improving the mRS score at discharge (ordinal shift: adjusted common OR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.16–2.06]; P = 0.002). Patients selected with perfusion imaging at centers that employed a mix of either perfusion or nonperfusion imaging in the early window had lower rates of sICH compared with those selected without (Model 2; aOR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.13–0.95]; P = 0.04). No other significant associations were identified in the remaining outcomes in the subgroups across both time windows.

Baseline characteristics of patients treated at centers that used perfusion imaging only (early window: 9.7%, late window: 3.7%), nonperfusion imaging only (early window: 51.6%, late window: 41.7%), or a mix of both (early window: 38.6%, late window: 54.4%), are demonstrated. The subgroup of patients with futile recanalization (early window: 46.1%, late window: 57.9%) had a significantly higher baseline NIHSS score versus those without in the late window (12 [7–18] versus 17 [11–22]; P = 0.001), with a similar difference also noted in the early window. There was a significantly higher rate of sICH among patients with futile recanalization versus those without in both the late (5.2% versus 0.7%) and early (5.3% versus 0.6%) windows.

### Hyperacute management of ischemic strokes: JACC focus seminar [^117WJrix]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke is the leading cause of disability and among the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator has been a cornerstone for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke for more than 20 years; however, its use is limited due to a narrow therapeutic window, several contraindications, and low efficacy in recanalizing the artery in large vessel occlusion. Recently, the addition of endovascular mechanical thrombectomy for large artery occlusion has revolutionized stroke treatment for the most disabling strokes. This paper reviews updates to thrombolytic treatment, catheter-based treatment, and results from recent trials in the selection of patients in an extended time window using perfusion imaging.

### Time to treatment with endovascular thrombectomy and outcomes from ischemic stroke: A meta-analysis [^115anX1A]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

Endovascular thrombectomy with second-generation devices is beneficial for patients with ischemic stroke due to intracranial large-vessel occlusions. Delineation of the association of treatment time with outcomes would help to guide implementation.

The objective of the study was to characterize the period in which endovascular thrombectomy is associated with benefit and to quantify the extent to which treatment delay is related to functional outcomes, mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

Demographic, clinical, and brain imaging data were collected, as well as functional and radiologic outcomes. These were pooled from randomized phase 3 trials involving stent retrievers or other second-generation devices in a peer-reviewed publication by July 1, 2016. The identified five trials enrolled patients at 89 international sites.

The exposures involved endovascular thrombectomy plus medical therapy compared to medical therapy alone, focusing on time to treatment.
- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the degree of disability, measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) range of 0–6, with lower scores indicating less disability at 3 months. This was analyzed with the common odds ratio (cOR) to detect ordinal shifts in the distribution of disability over the mRS range. Secondary outcomes included functional independence at 3 months, mortality by 3 months, and symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation.

Results showed that among all 1287 patients (634 receiving endovascular thrombectomy plus medical therapy and 653 receiving medical therapy alone) enrolled in the five trials, the mean age was 66.5 years (SD, 13.1), with women comprising 47.0% of participants. The average time from symptom onset to randomization was 196 minutes.

### Endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke may be safely performed with no time window limit in appropriately selected patients [^114JVknp]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

The traditional time window for acute ischemic stroke intra-arterial therapy (IAT) is 6 hours.

- **Results**: Fifty-five patients (mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale = 19.7 ± 5.7) were treated; 34 early and 21 late, with mean time-to-intervention of 3.4 ± 1.6 hours and 18.6 ± 16.0 hours, respectively. Thrombolysis In Myocardial Ischemia 2 or 3 recanalization was achieved in 82.8% of early and 85.7% of late patients (P = 1.0). Intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 25.5% overall, with symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurring in 8.8% of early and 9.5% of late patients (P = 1.0). Thirty-day mortality was similar (29.4% versus 23.8%, P = 0.650). At 3 months, 41.2% and 42.9%, respectively, achieved a modified Rankin Scale ≤ 2 (P = 0.902). Only the presenting National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was a determining factor.

### The impact of large core and late treatment trials: An update on the modelled annual thrombectomy eligibility of UK stroke patients [^1149kznk]. European Stroke Journal (2024). High credibility.

For pre-thrombectomy recanalisation in later presenters (node L), we retained an unchanged rate of 2% amongst both the 4.5–12 h and 12–24 h populations. We recognize that there will be a small but probably increasing number of patients who receive thrombolysis based on advanced imaging within the 4.5–9 h (known onset) or last seen well 4.5–24 h time windows, which could increase the rate of recanalisation within this group. However, the recanalisation effect of IVT in the late time window may well be lower, and we have left the 2% rate unchanged until more data on both late IVT rates and efficacy become available. Thus, the changes to clinical and imaging exclusion criteria and advanced imaging selection criteria mean that despite reduced estimates of LAO incidence, there are 4,890 UK LAO stroke patients presenting within 4.5–12 h of onset/LKW who are now eligible for thrombectomy, with most not being eligible for thrombolysis. We previously estimated this figure to be 1,250, that is, an additional 3,640 eligible.

The final branch of the MT eligibility tree contains patients who present between 12 and 24 h after stroke onset. The number of patients falls from 1,500 to 1,400 at node M after those presenting after 24 h are excluded, based on SSNAP data that indicates that 11.5% of ischemic stroke patients with LAO present > 24 h. The revised clinical/imaging exclusion rate in this group at node N is 52%. This is derived as follows: 30% of patients in this time window have a pre-stroke mRS of 2 or more, 15% of late time window patients have an ASPECTS value of 2 or lower, and 7% have a…

### European Stroke Organisation guidelines on stroke in women: Management of menopause, pregnancy and postpartum [^117TKjCo]. European Stroke Journal (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, particularly with postpartum patients, the ESO 2022 guidelines recommend considering mechanical thrombectomy after an appropriate assessment of the benefit/risk profile on an individual basis in postpartum patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who meet eligibility criteria. Prefer mechanical thrombectomy alone, if available, over intravenous (IV) thrombolysis or bridging therapy (IV thrombolysis plus mechanical thrombectomy) based on the time of stroke onset from delivery, especially if the risk of bleeding is deemed high.

### Potential effects of a mobile stroke unit on time to treatment and outcome in patients treated with thrombectomy or thrombolysis: A Danish-German cross-border analysis [^111NCbQo]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The study investigates the potential effects of deploying a mobile stroke unit on time to treatment and outcomes for patients undergoing thrombectomy or thrombolysis across Danish-German regions. It provides a cross-border analysis of treatment timelines and patient outcomes, aiming to enhance the understanding of mobile stroke unit utilization in diverse geographic areas. Collectively, results suggest an improvement in treatment times, though outcomes may vary depending on regional factors.

### Effect of time delay on reperfusion after tenecteplase in an extended time window: Analysis from the CHABLIS-T trials [^113zADsZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

This study has several strengths and important clinical implications. As a post hoc analysis of the CHABLIS-T randomized clinical trials, which included 199 patients who were thrombolyzed within the extended time window, it provides robust, high-quality evidence for the time–benefit association observed. Furthermore, the study used four time intervals, analyzed as both continuous and categorical variables in logistic regression models with confirmed linearity, enhancing the persuasiveness of the results.

The time–benefit association highlights that, even for selected "slow progressors" within the extended time window, rapid hospital arrival and prompt tenecteplase administration are crucial for achieving major reperfusion post-thrombolysis. This is especially significant for patients admitted to primary stroke centers lacking endovascular treatment capabilities. For those admitted to or transferred to comprehensive stroke centers, timely treatment and reperfusion are also essential for achieving functional independence. Additionally, rapid reperfusion facilitated by tenecteplase can lead to reduced economic costs by potentially averting the need for endovascular therapy.

### Current concepts in imaging and endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke: Implications for the clinician [^1139fpLp]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Ischemic stroke is an ever-growing and highly significant worldwide health problem. The incidence of acute ischemic stroke in the United States is about 800,000 patients per year (0.25% of the total population), and this number is expected to increase significantly in the coming decades due to the aging population. Stroke impacts not only patients but also their immediate environment and society as a whole. Approximately one-third of stroke patients remain completely or partially dependent on their caregivers.

Before the regular clinical implementation of intravenous thrombolysis in the late 1990s, no primary acute stroke treatment tool was available. The development of thrombectomy medical devices followed shortly after the beginning of the thrombolysis era. After the introduction of detachable stents in acute stroke treatment — specifically designed as an adjunctive tool in cerebral aneurysm treatment — the concept of using a "stent retriever" as an endovascular thrombectomy device was embraced by the interventional neuroradiology community. However, after the initial enthusiasm, the increasing use of stent retrievers was halted due to the publication of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 2013, which reported the non-superiority of endovascular treatment versus intravenous treatment alone. At the beginning of 2015, the paradigm of acute stroke treatment shifted back to endovascular treatment. Several RCTs clearly confirmed the benefits of using endovascular thrombectomy devices on the clinical outcome of stroke patients compared to intravenous treatment alone.

### Reducing door-to-puncture times for intra-arterial stroke therapy: a pilot quality improvement project [^115wL3ED]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

There are likely several factors responsible for the negative results of the recent randomized, controlled trials that compared IAT against best medical management, including IV tPA. Of particular concern are the time delays that were observed in these studies. In IMS 3, the mean time from patient arrival to groin puncture was approximately 150 minutes. In the Mechanical Retrieval and Recanalization of Stroke Clots Using Embolectomy (MR RESCUE) trial, the mean time from imaging to groin puncture alone was 124 minutes. Based on data from the retrospective Rapid Reperfusion Registry, these times are much too long — the worst clinical outcomes were noted with door‐to‐puncture times of 136 minutes or greater. In contrast, our door‐to‐puncture times using the new process were substantially shorter (mean ± SD, 106 ± 22 minutes). To remedy this problem, ongoing randomized trials of IAT have incorporated maximum allowable time limits for treatment delivery. However, establishing a time goal is just one step in the quality improvement process and is unlikely to produce durable systemic change by itself. Rather, we believe that the multistep approach described here provides an effective template for similar initiatives that seek to reduce times and standardize treatment delivery for acute stroke intervention.

An important lesson from our experience is that a formal process for documenting time delays is essential. As a first step, it reveals the magnitude of the problem and thus provides necessary feedback data for evaluation of QI efforts. Although there were several perceived sources of delay, comprehensive documentation allowed us to identify and address each issue systematically.

### Contraindications to intravenous thrombolysis in prehospital triage of thrombectomy candidates [^115trgUk]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The existence of contraindications to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is considered a criterion for direct transfer of patients with suspected acute stroke to thrombectomy-capable centers in the prehospital setting. Our aim was to assess the utility of this criterion in a setting where routing protocols are defined by the Madrid - Direct Referral to Endovascular Center (M-DIRECT) prehospital scale.
- **Methods**: This was a post hoc analysis of the M-DIRECT study. Reported contraindications to IVT were retrospectively collected from emergency medical services reports and categorized into late window, anticoagulant treatment, and other contraindications. Final diagnosis and treatment rates were compared between patients with and without reported IVT contraindications and according to anticoagulant treatment or late window categories.
- **Results**: The M-DIRECT study included 541 patients. Reported IVT contraindications were present in 227 (42.0%) patients. Regarding final diagnosis, no significant differences were found between patients with or without reported IVT contraindications: ischaemic stroke (any) 65.6% vs. 62.1%, ischaemic stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO) 32.2% vs. 28.3%, hemorrhagic stroke 15.4% vs. 15.6%, stroke mimic 18.9% vs. 22.3%, respectively. Amongst patients with LVO, endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was performed less often in the presence of IVT contraindications (56.2% vs. 74.2%). M-DIRECT-positive patients had higher rates of LVO and EVT compared with M-DIRECT-negative patients, independent of reported IVT contraindications.

### Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: A guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^1136FyHC]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute ischemic stroke, specifically concerning the indications for thrombectomy (0–6 hours from onset), the AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend considering mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever in carefully selected patients. These patients should have acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with causative occlusion of the middle cerebral artery segment 2 (M2) or segment 3 (M3). Treatment should be initiated (groin puncture) within 6 hours of symptom onset.

### Seeing the good in the bad: Actual clinical outcome of thrombectomy stroke patients with formally unfavorable outcome [^116zcMKm]. Neuroradiology (2022). Low credibility.

Data from the stroke registry of BLINDED were used for this analysis. This study was approved by the local ethics committee (approval reference BLINDED).

Our hospital is a tertiary stroke center with a catchment area of approximately 1 million inhabitants. We provide stroke therapy 7 days a week and 24 hours a day. Available acute revascularization therapies include intravenous thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, and carotid surgery. If patients arrive at the hospital within a 4.5-hour window after symptom onset or if there is relevant tissue at risk beyond this window, intravenous thrombolysis is administered unless contraindications exist. If the patient has a large-vessel occlusion, thrombectomy is performed regardless of the time window, provided that computed tomography (CT), including perfusion imaging, implies that there is clinically relevant tissue at risk.

For this analysis, we included all patients between May 2010 and July 2020 who met the following inclusion criteria: consecutive thrombectomy patients with occlusions in the terminal carotid artery or the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (with and without involvement of the bifurcation) in whom complete recanalization (expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction; eTICI 3) was achieved and who had an mRS score of 3–5 at 90 days. We only included patients in whom we achieved complete recanalization because reperfusion of an affected area is an important prerequisite for its recovery.

For these patients, several variables were prospectively collected: the mRS score pre-stroke, age, sex, comorbidities, time from symptom onset to recanalization, and imaging characteristics, among others.

### Clinical policy: Use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator for the management of acute ischemic stroke in the emergency department [^111PzDYA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute ischemic stroke, specifically with respect to intravenous alteplase, the ACEP 2015 guidelines recommend considering the administration of IV alteplase in carefully selected patients with AIS within 3 to 4.5 hours after symptom onset. This is applicable at institutions where systems are in place to safely administer the medication, though there is a known risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and variability in the degree of benefit in functional outcomes.

### The extended treatment window's impact on emergency systems of care for acute stroke [^112Q3d6W]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The window for acute ischemic stroke treatment was previously limited to 4.5 hours for intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and to 6 hours for thrombectomy. Recent studies using advanced imaging selection expand this window for select patients up to 24 hours from the last known well. These studies directly affect emergency stroke management, including prehospital triage and emergency department (ED) management of suspected stroke patients.

This narrative review summarizes the data expanding the treatment window for ischemic stroke to 24 hours and discusses these implications on stroke systems of care. It analyzes the implications on prehospital protocols to identify and transfer large-vessel occlusion stroke patients, on issues of distributive justice, and on ED management to provide advanced imaging and access to thrombectomy centers. The creation of high-performing systems of care to manage acute ischemic stroke patients requires academic emergency physician leadership attentive to the rapidly changing science of stroke care.

### Management of acute ischemic stroke [^112sC4X6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The treatment of acute ischemic stroke includes both intravenous (IV) thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. Important advances regarding both treatment modalities have occurred recently, which all physicians who see patients at risk for, or who have had, a stroke should be aware of. This review will focus on recent clinical trials of IV thrombolysis, both positive and negative. Additionally, the results of a large number of early and late time window thrombectomy trials will be presented, demonstrating the remarkable efficacy of this treatment for appropriately selected patients.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) expedited recommendation on tenecteplase for acute ischaemic stroke [^112XXFrs]. European Stroke Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, specifically with respect to intravenous tenecteplase, ESO 2023 guidelines recommend considering the administration of tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg over alteplase 0.90 mg/kg. This approach is suggested to increase the rate of early reperfusion and to shorten the time from imaging to treatment initiation in patients with AIS of less than 4.5 hours duration, who are eligible for IV thrombolysis and receiving prehospital management in a mobile stroke unit.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) expedited recommendation on tenecteplase for acute ischaemic stroke [^111iPm2Z]. European Stroke Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, specifically concerning intravenous tenecteplase, the ESO 2023 guidelines recommend administering tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg over alteplase 0.9 mg/kg in patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke of less than 4.5 hours duration who are eligible for IV thrombolysis, provided this does not delay mechanical thrombectomy.

Consider administering tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg or 0.40 mg/kg instead of skipping IV thrombolysis in patients directly admitted to a thrombectomy-capable center. Additionally, consider administering tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg followed by rapid transfer to a thrombectomy-capable center in patients admitted to a center without mechanical thrombectomy capability.

### Imaging selection for reperfusion therapy in acute ischemic stroke beyond the conventional time window [^113CVq92]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Originally, the efficacy of acute ischemic stroke treatment with thrombolysis or thrombectomy was only proven within narrow time windows of 4.5 and 6 hours after onset, respectively. Introducing imaging-based selection beyond non-contrast enhanced computed tomography has expanded the treatment window, focusing on presumed tissue status rather than solely on time after stroke onset. Different mismatch concepts have been adopted in clinical practice to select patients in the extended and unknown time window based on findings from randomized controlled trials. Since various concepts exist that can identify patients likely to benefit from reperfusion strategies, clinicians may wonder which imaging modality may be preferred in the emergency setting. In this review, we discuss the different mismatch concepts and their practical implementation for patient selection for thrombolysis or thrombectomy, beyond the conventional time window.

### Advances in mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke [^1147p8Ym]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Thrombectomy has been conducted for over two decades, but the evidence base proving efficacy and cost-effectiveness was initially lacking. In the early 2010s, the first three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) looking at interventional procedures failed to show the benefit of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) but had their limitations, including one trial (IMS-III), which did not require direct vascular imaging evidence of large vessel occlusion for the selection of patients.

This trial was swiftly followed in 2015 with the publication of five RCTs comparing the efficacy of MT (using second-generation thrombectomy devices) in addition to intravenous thrombolysis, where eligible, versus intravenous thrombolysis alone. All five trials focused exclusively on the anterior circulation, and four of the trials recruited patients in windows of up to 8 hours from symptom onset. Outcomes were measured using the modified Rankin score, which is an ordinal score from 0 to 6, with 0 meaning free of disability and 6 meaning death. MR CLEAN was the first positive trial to be published. The results were compelling and prompted the data safety monitoring boards of the remaining trials to conduct interim analyses, leading to the early stoppage of these trials.

The five trials included over 1200 patients in total, and their data were combined in the HERMES meta-analysis. The researchers of this meta-analysis concluded that MT led to significantly better "good functional outcomes", as defined by a modified Rankin score of 0–2.

### Impact of time to treatment on tissue-type plasminogen activator-induced recanalization in acute ischemic stroke [^114ko5j3]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

Although tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) efficacy depends on time, it is unknown whether its effect on recanalization is time dependent. Information about the likelihood of successful recanalization as a function of time to treatment may improve patient selection for advanced reperfusion strategies. We aimed to identify the impact of time to treatment on tPA-induced recanalization in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with intracranial acute occlusion treated with intravenous tPA underwent transcranial Doppler examination before and 1 hour after tPA administration. Patients were categorized according to occlusion localization in proximal and distal occlusion. Sequential analysis of recanalization according to time to treatment was performed for every 30-minute cutoff point.
- **Results**: Overall (n = 508), 54.3% had proximal and 45.7% had distal occlusion. Median time to treatment was 171.4 ± 61.9 minutes, and 5.9% were treated > 270 minutes. Recanalization occurred in 36.1% of patients. There was no linear association between time to treatment and time to recanalization, but sequential analysis showed that patients treated > 270 minutes had a lower recanalization rate. Lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission (odds ratio [OR], 0.305; 95% confidence interval, 0.1–0.933) and time to treatment ≤ 270 minutes (OR, 0.995; 95% CI, 0.99–0.999) emerged as independent predictors of recanalization. In patients with proximal occlusion, 41.8% recanalized. Time to treatment > 90 minutes was associated with…

### Mechanical thrombectomy up to 24 hours in large vessel occlusions and infarct velocity assessment [^111HVWDq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Our retrospective findings from a real‐world data set showed that both early and late time-window patients selected for thrombectomy with automated perfusion imaging had outcomes comparable with those from randomized trials, despite extending the window from 16 to 24 hours. Infarct velocity was significantly different between the two groups.
