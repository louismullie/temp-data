## Question

When to order doac

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to order direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming a clear, guideline-supported indication. Then, I should verify absolute contraindications. Next, I will compare DOACs versus warfarin for suitability, assess renal and hepatic function, review drug interactions and bleeding risk, select the specific agent, determine the correct dose, provide education and shared decision-making, set up monitoring including peri-procedural planning and selective drug-level testing, and document the indication and rationale thoroughly, before issuing the prescription.

> Let me first confirm the clinical indication and avoid jumping to conclusions; DOACs are first-line for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism, and they are also used in cancer-associated VTE and in primary post-operative prophylaxis after hip and knee arthroplasty, with extended lower-intensity regimens in select settings such as prolonged VTE prevention and certain medical or vascular disease contexts, so I should match the patient scenario to one of these evidence-based indications before proceeding [^notfound] [^1155dUxX] [^112thCqj] [^114pb5s3] [^115FQGHo].

> Hold on, I should verify absolute or near-absolute contraindications next; DOACs should not be used in mechanical heart valves or in moderate-to-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis in AF where VKAs are recommended, and triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome carries increased thrombotic risk on DOACs such that warfarin is preferred, and in pregnancy DOACs are generally avoided, so if any of these are present I should pivot to warfarin with appropriate monitoring rather than a DOAC [^117MT2Gg] [^116qdVzb] [^1148u9gb] [^1155dUxX].

> I need to ensure the overall strategy favors DOACs when appropriate; compared with warfarin, DOACs have at least equivalent efficacy with less intracranial hemorrhage and greater ease of use, but if the patient has severe renal dysfunction, advanced liver disease, cost barriers, or is exceptionally stable with high warfarin time-in-therapeutic-range, warfarin may be reasonable, so I will weigh these factors with the patient rather than assuming a one-size-fits-all approach [^1155dUxX] [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify kidney and liver parameters before choosing and dosing; DOAC clearance and labeling differ by agent, standard doses are generally for creatinine clearance at or above roughly 50 mL/min, dose adjustments are often needed in the 15–50 mL/min range depending on the drug, and most DOACs should be avoided in severe renal failure and in Child-Pugh C hepatic disease, so I will calculate creatinine clearance, assess hepatic function, and apply agent-specific labeling rather than extrapolating [^1155dUxX] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review potential drug-drug interactions and bleeding risk; strong inhibitors or inducers of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 can materially alter DOAC exposure, and concomitant antiplatelets, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids amplify bleeding risk, with meta-analytic data showing a class signal for gastrointestinal bleeding compared with warfarin, so I will reconcile medications, mitigate avoidable combinations, consider gastroprotection in high-risk patients, and quantify bleeding risk rather than presuming safety [^111UcWtA] [^115wNNbq] [^114Cu5Ue].

> I will now examine which DOAC fits best for the clinical scenario; factor Xa inhibitors are endorsed options for cancer-associated thrombosis, low-intensity regimens are used in extended VTE prevention and in stable atherosclerotic vascular disease contexts, and anticoagulant reversal infrastructure matters since idarucizumab reverses dabigatran and andexanet alfa or four-factor PCC are recommended for life-threatening bleeding on factor Xa inhibitors, so I will align agent selection with indication, patient preference for dosing frequency, renal profile, and local reversal access [^112thCqj] [^114pb5s3] [^115Z6nqd] [^113cBF1r].

> Let me first confirm the labeled dosing and resist the urge to empirically reduce doses; contemporary AF guidelines explicitly discourage non–evidence-based low dosing, and European guidance warns against underdosing outside defined criteria, so I will apply drug-specific reduction rules based on renal function and validated clinical criteria rather than lowering doses just because of perceived bleeding risk [^11394PWx] [^113xd6B9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about patient acceptance; I should discuss benefits, risks, costs, adherence, and peri-procedural expectations with the patient, emphasizing the absence of routine coagulation monitoring but the need for ongoing clinical follow-up and perioperative planning, so we can make a shared decision that fits their values and logistics [^1155dUxX] [^116G1VVp].

> Next, I should review what to monitor and when to measure drug levels; routine coagulation testing is not required and perioperative management should not rely on routine DOAC function testing, but selective drug-specific assays can be useful in emergencies such as urgent surgery, life-threatening bleeding, suspected overdose, or thrombotic events on therapy, so I will reserve dilute thrombin time or ecarin-based assays for dabigatran and calibrated anti-Xa tests for factor Xa inhibitors in those scenarios, and otherwise monitor renal and hepatic function, adherence, and bleeding at regular intervals [^116G1VVp] [^114cfZ9K] [^116gToSn].

> I will now examine the peri-procedural plan; because DOACs have rapid offset and onset, most patients do not require bridging, timing of interruption depends on bleeding risk and renal function, creatinine clearance should be checked before surgery, and full therapeutic dosing is typically resumed within 48–72 hours postoperatively once hemostasis is secured, so I will tailor holds and resumption to the procedure and the patient rather than using a fixed schedule [^115HiT9o] [^111WWF7Z] [^112rrP7x].

> I need to ensure complete documentation; I will record the precise indication and risk score context, contraindications excluded, renal and hepatic data, drug and dose selection criteria, interaction mitigation steps, education provided, and the monitoring and peri-procedural plan, which aligns with population health approaches that flag dosing, interactions, adherence, and lab issues for ongoing safety [^113ykXJy].

> But wait, what if active major bleeding or a recent major GI bleed is present; in that case I should stabilize, withhold the DOAC, consider reversal when indicated, and resume anticoagulation after a careful reassessment window once hemostasis is achieved given the competing thrombotic risks, rather than reflexively stopping indefinitely without a plan [^114f1i5U] [^113cBF1r] [^115Z6nqd].

> In summary and as a final verification step, I will order a DOAC when there is a clear, guideline-supported indication such as AF without mechanical valves or rheumatic MS or for VTE and CAT, no absolute contraindications exist such as triple-positive APS or mechanical valves, renal and hepatic function permit labeled dosing, interactions and bleeding risks are acceptably mitigated, and the patient agrees after shared decision-making; otherwise I will prefer warfarin when contraindications or severe organ dysfunction are present, and defer anticoagulation during active major bleeding until stabilized and reversible risks addressed, ensuring each choice is explicitly justified in the record [^117MT2Gg] [^1155dUxX] [^116qdVzb] [^112thCqj] [^113xd6B9].

Order a DOAC for **nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with elevated stroke risk** (CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women) [^117MT2Gg], **acute VTE treatment** (DVT/PE) [^112thCqj], and **VTE prophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery** (hip/knee replacement) [^114pb5s3]. DOACs are also appropriate for **cancer-associated VTE** [^112thCqj] and **extended VTE prevention** [^114pb5s3]. Avoid DOACs in mechanical heart valves, moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, severe renal impairment (CrCl < 15 mL/min), advanced liver disease, or triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome [^117MT2Gg] [^1155dUxX] [^116qdVzb]. Follow DOAC-specific dosing criteria and adjust based on renal function, age, weight, and drug interactions [^113xd6B9] [^111UcWtA].

## Indications for DOAC therapy

### Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF)

For stroke prevention, **DOACs are first-line** in NVAF when stroke risk is elevated (CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women) [^117MT2Gg]. In asymptomatic, device-detected subclinical AF with elevated thromboembolic risk, consider DOACs unless bleeding risk is high [^115Vd5Wb]. Initiate anticoagulation regardless of other risk factors in AF with HCM, cardiac amyloidosis, or congenital heart disease with intracardiac repair, cyanosis, Fontan palliation, or a systemic right ventricle [^115gwwYh] [^116swkQj].

---

### Venous thromboembolism (VTE)

For acute treatment, **DOACs are indicated for DVT and PE** [^112thCqj]. In cancer-associated (non-catheter-related) VTE, use a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor or low-molecular-weight heparin for an initial 6 months [^112thCqj]. For extended prevention of VTE, use low-dose DOACs [^114aCyez].

---

### Orthopedic surgery prophylaxis

For orthopedic surgery, **postoperative DOAC prophylaxis** is indicated after major orthopedic surgery (hip/knee replacement) [^114aCyez].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring DOAC level measurement

Routine monitoring is not required; **measure levels only in specific scenarios**:

- **Urgent surgery**: Measure before urgent surgery or invasive procedures [^116gToSn].

- **Bleeding or thrombosis**: Measure in major bleeding or suspected overdose [^114cfZ9K].

- **Renal impairment**: Measure in severe renal impairment or suspected accumulation [^114cfZ9K].

- **Thrombolysis**: Measure before thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke [^114cfZ9K].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

### Contraindications

- **Mechanical valves**: Contraindicated in mechanical heart valves [^117MT2Gg].

- **Mitral stenosis**: Contraindicated in moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis [^117MT2Gg].

---

### Precautions

Adjust the dose and monitor **renal function** regularly [^113xd6B9]. Avoid strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors or inducers due to drug interactions. Use caution in patients at high bleeding risk or when concomitant antiplatelets or NSAIDs are used.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing DOAC selection

- **Renal function**: Dose adjust or avoid in severe impairment [^113xd6B9].

- **Hepatic function**: Avoid in advanced liver disease [^1155dUxX].

- **Age and weight**: Adjust dose in elderly or low body weight [^113xd6B9].

- **Drug interactions**: Consider CYP3A4 and P-gp interactions.

- **Patient preference**: Consider adherence, monitoring, and cost [^114svfRp].

### Direct oral anticoagulants: Evidence and unresolved issues [^1155dUxX]. Lancet (2020). High credibility.

Currently licensed direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) selectively target thrombin, such as dabigatran, or coagulation factor Xa, as in apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. Designed to be administered in fixed doses without routine monitoring, DOACs have a lower propensity for food and drug interactions compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). In randomized controlled trials involving around 250,000 patients, they demonstrated at least equivalent effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of thrombosis and were associated with a lower risk of life-threatening bleeding.

The absolute benefits of DOACs over VKAs are modest; however, guidelines recommend them in preference to VKAs for most indications due to their ease of use and superior safety. The greatest benefits of these anticoagulants are likely to be seen in patients previously deemed unsuitable for VKA therapy. The emergence of generic preparations is expected to further boost the adoption of DOACs, particularly in countries where their use is limited by cost.

DOACs are contraindicated in patients with mechanical heart valves and should be used with caution or avoided in patients with advanced kidney or liver disease. This review examines the pharmacology of DOACs, summarizes the evidence supporting their approval and inclusion in treatment guidelines, and explores key unresolved issues. Future perspectives for the development of DOACs are also briefly discussed.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend initiating DOACs over warfarin. This recommendation is made to reduce the risk of mortality, stroke, systemic embolism, and intracerebral hemorrhage in patients with atrial fibrillation who do not have a history of moderate-to-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, and who are eligible for anticoagulation.

### Is there a role for low-dose DOACs as prophylaxis [^114aCyez]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have transformed the management of thrombotic disorders. Large clinical trials have demonstrated that DOACs can replace vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in the two existing major indications for anticoagulation: the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation and the acute treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE); this literature is widely known. In this article, we focus on the less well-discussed benefits of using DOACs in low doses as primary and secondary prophylaxis in both venous and arterial thromboprophylaxis. The attractiveness of using a low-dose DOAC is that the bleeding risk appears to be slightly lower than with the standard dose and significantly lower than with VKAs, allowing them to be used safely for long periods. Previously, VKAs had unfavorable risk/benefit ratios that did not permit such extended use.

We discuss in detail the extended use of low-dose DOACs in secondary VTE prevention. We also cover the utility of low-dose DOACs in the evolving fields of prevention of hospital-associated VTE in acutely ill medical patients, after total hip and knee replacement, and in cancer patients. Finally, we briefly discuss the role of low-dose DOACs in the secondary prevention of arterial vascular events.

**Increased risk of thrombosis in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome**: Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including Pradaxa, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS — especially those who are triple-positive (positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies) — treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.

### Select drug-drug interactions with direct oral anticoagulants: JACC review topic of the week [^111UcWtA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Millions of individuals in the United States require long-term treatment with an oral anticoagulant. For decades, vitamin K antagonists were the only oral option available; however, they have a number of well-known limitations. The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has long been considered a major therapeutic advance, largely because they lack the need for therapeutic monitoring. Despite this, DOACs, like vitamin K antagonists, can still cause major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, even when used appropriately. Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving the DOACs represent an important contributor to increased bleeding risk. Awareness of these DDIs and how best to address them is of critical importance in optimizing management while mitigating bleeding risk. This review provides an overview of DOAC metabolism, the most common drugs likely to contribute to DOAC DDIs, their underlying mechanisms, and how best to address them.

### The relationship between DOAC levels and clinical outcomes: The measures tell the tale [^113KbHuw]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

As discussed in previous sections, several clues support the possibility of an optimal dose-benefit relation for DOACs. However, because limited data are available, it is currently unknown whether level-dosed DOAC strategies are superior to fixed-dosed DOAC strategies. These clues, however, provide us with a number of research opportunities.

First, we need to know if patients on DOAC are willing to be monitored and tested on their DOAC levels. Previous studies have shown that most patients on DOAC are satisfied with their treatment and feel safe when using DOAC without regular thrombin inhibitor or anti-Xa measurements. It is assumed that DOACs have a broad therapeutic window (i.e. they work the same for almost everybody; a one-size-fits-all approach) and that for efficacy and safety, the actual DOAC plasma concentration is of less importance in a patient who takes this drug. This gives credence to this patient strategy. Given that the overall bleeding and thromboembolism rates are similar to those when using VKA, further supports that the fixed-dose strategy is safe and effective for the majority of patients. Yet, according to a survey in patients who formerly used VKA and who were switched to DOAC, up to 70% of them were willing to undergo some form of blood testing at least once a year if that could further increase the safety and efficacy of the DOAC they were using.

### Direct oral anticoagulants: Unique properties and practical approaches to management [^111jGyq5]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Since 2009, four direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been introduced for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. While they are currently first-line therapy for a majority of patients, there are a number of clinical situations where warfarin is preferable. In both randomized trials and real-world populations, the use of DOACs significantly reduces the risk of intracranial hemorrhage compared with warfarin.

While drug-specific reversal agents are currently only available for dabigatran, andexanet alpha is pending approval for reversal of factor Xa inhibitors, reducing concerns about major bleeding for many patients and providers. DOACs can be held for 2–4 days prior to a procedure, depending on a patient's renal function, but should not be restarted too rapidly post-procedurally given their fast time to peak activity (∼2 hours). The anticoagulation clinic should play an important role in managing patients on all oral anticoagulation, both warfarin and DOACs.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation developed in collaboration with the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) [^115gwwYh]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically concerning anticoagulant therapy, the EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend initiating oral anticoagulation in all patients with AF and HCM or cardiac amyloidosis, regardless of the CHA₂DS₂-VA score, to prevent ischemic stroke and thromboembolism.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1136KyqC]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

The guidelines from the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS for 2024 recommend that oral anticoagulation therapy should be continued for at least three months after catheter ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation. This duration should be extended based on the underlying risk.

### Direct oral anticoagulants and digestive bleeding: Therapeutic management and preventive measures [^114f1i5U]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) was an important step forward in the management of atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE). The DOACs, anti-IIa for dabigatran and anti-Xa for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, all have a rapid onset of action and a short half-life. There is no need for routine hemostasis testing for treatment monitoring of a DOAC. Compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), DOACs may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (relative risk 1.25).

Withholding DOAC treatment, evaluating the time of the last intake, and estimating the patient's renal function are the first steps in the management of gastrointestinal bleeding. For patients without impaired renal function, achieving low coagulation takes around 24 hours after the last intake of a DOAC. The use of DOAC antagonists will be helpful in controlling bleeding in the most severe and urgent situations.

Idarucizumab is available for clinical use for dabigatran, as well as andexanet is currently being reviewed by drug agencies for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. It is important to assess the bleeding risk associated with the planned procedure and the patient's renal function before withholding DOAC therapy for a scheduled intervention. Strengthening local hemostasis strategies in DOAC-treated patients undergoing a therapeutic endoscopic procedure is mandatory. Resuming or not resuming anticoagulation with a DOAC after bleeding or a risky procedure depends on the thrombotic and bleeding risk, as well as the procedure involved. This discussion should always involve the card.

### Safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists: Pilot implementation of a near-real-time monitoring program in Italy [^1173q1i8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The study population consisted of sequential cohorts of DOAC or VKA new users aged 18 to 100 years between July 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015. In Italy, DOACs were authorized for nonvalvular AF treatment during 2013: the first was dabigatran on June 19, followed by rivaroxaban and apixaban later in September 2013 and January 2014. We considered a period of 11 days as the minimum time gap for physicians to begin to implement the extended indication. Moreover, this choice allowed us to easily divide the overall study period into 3-month sequential interim periods.

Study participants were patients not prescribed any oral anticoagulant drugs in the 6 months before the first drug claim for a DOAC or a VKA agent during the study period (index date). We only included drug initiators who were continuously enrolled in the regional healthcare assistance file throughout the 12 months preceding the index date and who had a diagnosis of AF (ICD-9-CM codes 427.31 or 427.32) registered in the Hospital Information System or Healthcare Emergency Information System in the 12 months before the index date.

We excluded patients with mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve to select only patients with nonvalvular AF. Patients undergoing dialysis or with a history of renal transplant were also excluded, as severe renal impairment is a contraindication for DOAC prescription. Finally, patients with joint replacement were excluded to ensure that DOACs were used for the AF indication only. All exclusion criteria were assessed during the 12 months before the start of the study period.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115Z6nqd]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, particularly in relation to the management of bleeding, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend administering idarucizumab to rapidly reverse the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran in patients with AF who develop life-threatening bleeding while on dabigatran. If idarucizumab is unavailable, consider administering activated prothrombin complex concentrate to reverse the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran.

### Shifting the paradigm: A population health approach to the management of direct oral anticoagulants [^113ykXJy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The DOAC PMT is an interactive clinical report that collates data from the VHA Corporate Data Warehouse, applying numerous algorithms across all patients prescribed DOACs in the VHA. Building on established Veterans Affairs (VA) Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM), Medical Advisory Panel, and Veterans Integrated Service Network Pharmacist Executive guidance on the oversight and monitoring of DOACs, the subject matter experts and informaticists established logic designed to "flag" patients with issues of potential clinical concern.

These flags are grouped categorically and highlight issues related to dosage, indication, drug-drug interactions (including selected pharmacodynamic interactions such as concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents), overdue or concerning laboratory results, medication non-adherence, prescriptions lacking documented indication, and patient situations where DOACs are contraindicated or controversial (e.g. the presence of a prosthetic heart valve; female of childbearing age without contraceptives). Additionally, the logic also covers DOAC orders requiring renewal soon. The algorithm used to determine dosing appropriateness has been published previously and remains in use with minimal modification over time.

As the Corporate Data Warehouse updates daily, this logic applies to the DOAC population anew each day. These flags allow all patients prescribed a DOAC through VHA to undergo evaluation for clinical issues each day the prescription is active — a goal that is unattainable in a standard practice model with scheduled evaluations.

### Unanswered questions in cancer-associated thrombosis [^1163uQPH]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Low credibility.

Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Treatment of cancer-associated VTE comes with a heightened risk of anticoagulant-related bleeding that differs by choice of anticoagulant as well as by patient- and disease-specific risk factors. Available data from randomized controlled trials and observational studies in cancer-associated VTE suggest that direct oral anticoagulants are effective, continuing anticoagulation beyond six months is indicated in those with active cancer, and that patients who develop 'breakthrough' thrombotic events can be effectively treated.

We review the evidence that addresses these key clinical questions and offer pragmatic approaches in individualizing care. While significant investigative efforts over the past decade have made impactful advances, future research is needed to better define the factors that contribute to anticoagulant-related bleeding and VTE recurrence, in order to aid clinical decision-making that improves the care of patients with cancer-associated VTE.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^115wNNbq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

**Agents concurrently affecting bleeding risk**: Bleeding complications increase when DOACs are co-prescribed with antiplatelets (aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors) or agents with antiplatelet properties (NSAIDs, systemic corticosteroids, etc). These combinations should be minimized whenever possible and carefully balanced against improved thrombosis prevention when clinically indicated. If concomitant therapy cannot be avoided, the addition of H2 antihistamine receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors to mitigate gastrointestinal bleeding should be undertaken.

### Spontaneous rectal sheath bleed while on DOAC anticoagulation [^113YEN2U]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Following resolution of the bleeding, deciding whether and when to restart anticoagulation can be challenging. This decision is often complicated by the presence of extensive comorbidities, the degree of stroke risk, the circumstances around the initial bleed, and patient preference. Generally, it is reasonable to restart DOAC therapy one to two weeks after most mild to moderate gastrointestinal bleeding. The American Stroke Association recommends an interval of at least four weeks before restarting treatment after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. However, no definitive guidelines have currently been agreed upon for situations such as the one discussed here. Given the potential for life-threatening complications with both under- and over-treatment, the decision is often difficult.

With the expanding role of DOAC therapy in modern practice, clinicians should be cognizant of the potential risks that accompany what is often a prolonged course of anticoagulation, particularly in patients with multiple comorbidities. Reversal agents are licensed and effective but are also costly and may be prothrombotic. Prompt recognition and early intervention can sometimes greatly improve outcomes. Supportive care only is indicated if a bleed is minor. Finally, whether and when it is appropriate to restart anticoagulation is a challenging decision with the potential for profound consequences. Further research is needed to construct substantive guidelines.

- **Learning points**: The incidence of adverse effects is lower with DOAC therapy than with vitamin K antagonists. However, the increased risk of haemorrhage needs to be carefully managed.

### Safety of direct oral anticoagulants: Insights from postmarketing studies [^115B5CMS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been marketed in the United States since 2010. While numerous large-scale prospective phase 3 outcomes studies have documented the effectiveness of DOACs for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, the primary safety concern with all of these drugs — as it is with the more established oral anticoagulant warfarin — is the risk of major bleeding. Postmarketing surveillance studies (PMSS) provide the opportunity to evaluate the safety of these recently approved drugs across a spectrum of patients that may be broader than those included in randomized controlled trials. This review will summarize the safety findings of numerous recently performed, large-scale PMSS evaluations, and consider the currently available evidence regarding the risks for bleeding in patients treated with DOACs, in order to give providers and patients additional evidence regarding the safety of DOACs.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^117FfHNP]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Recommendations for laboratory screening or quantifying

If the laboratory is providing screening tests that are sufficiently sensitive to detect around 25–30 ng/ml of DOACs, there should be accompanying information with the test result to indicate laboratory-verified test sensitivity. For laboratories using LMWH-calibrated anti-FXa to screen for direct FXa inhibitors, we suggest that the test be reported as "not detected" or "detected", with information provided that the lower limit of quantitation associated with LMWH is "estimated" to be a given concentration of FXa DOAC based on local laboratory findings.

Before implementing a DOAC quantitative assay, we strongly recommend the laboratory consult clinical stakeholders for their feedback. Early recommendations suggest trough time collections be used, although more recent studies suggested peak values may be associated with bleeding risks. For laboratories that provide quantitative DOAC measurements, we recommend that:

1. Each DOAC be a separate orderable test to assure the proper drug-calibrated test is used.
2. Each result is accompanied by an expected "within therapy" range traceable to a clinical study or peer-reviewed publication based on collection time (peak or trough).
3. Results be reported in ng/ml when properly drug calibrated.

DOAC levels that are required for acute or emergent clinical needs should be reported within 30 min of receipt in the testing laboratory.

### The relationship between DOAC levels and clinical outcomes: The measures tell the tale [^113B4H55]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

Since their introduction nearly a decade ago, the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is rapidly increasing. In large randomized clinical trials, DOACs were found to be noninferior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and for the management of venous thromboembolism. Having fewer interactions with comedication and diet and a more stable pharmacokinetic profile than VKAs, DOACs currently do not require routine laboratory monitoring. For these reasons, DOACs have replaced VKAs in international guidelines as the first choice of anticoagulant for management and prevention of thrombotic diseases.

Unfortunately, complications during management with DOACs still occur. In clinical trials, the risk for thromboembolic events in patients randomized to DOAC is 1% to 2% per year, and although the risk of intracranial hemorrhage is lower with DOACs when compared with VKAs, the overall major bleeding risk for DOAC use in observational studies remains 1% to 3% per year due to a large proportion of major extracranial bleeds. This is reflected in the large number of emergency room visits for adverse drug events, which is higher for anticoagulants than for any other drug class. Additionally, the total number of oral anticoagulant users has increased in the past five years, which is related to the aging population and changing guidelines.

Because both bleeding complications and thromboembolic events still occur during the management of DOACs, there is room for improvement.

Regarding the medical management of atrial fibrillation, particularly anticoagulant therapy, the 2024 ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS guidelines recommend avoiding non-evidence-based doses of DOACs. This approach aims to minimize the risks of preventable thromboembolism or major bleeding and improve the survival of patients with AF.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, specifically in terms of anticoagulant therapy, the ESO 2022 guidelines recommend not to use oral anticoagulation instead of aspirin unless there is another formal indication for it. This applies to patients with ischemic stroke or TIA due to high-grade stenosis related to intracranial atherosclerotic disease.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^116gToSn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are an effective and easy-to-use treatment option for conditions that require long-term anticoagulation. Although the fixed-dose scheme omits the requirement of routine coagulation assessment, testing may be needed under certain clinical conditions, such as before surgery or invasive procedures, in case of trauma or bleeding, or if thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke is evaluated.

Ultraperformance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) remains the criterion standard for exact quantification of DOAC concentrations. However, limited availability and slow turnaround times prevent the routine clinical implementation of this method. Hence, if coagulation testing is deemed necessary, clinical practice guidelines advise using DOAC-specific coagulation assays. These include diluted thrombin time or ecarin clotting time (ECT) for dabigatran and chromogenic anti-Xa assays (AXA) for factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). Quantitative assessment of DOAC concentrations can be achieved with the help of substance-specific calibrators for all of these assays.

A special situation arises for the FXa inhibitors: AXA are set up in many institutions, but calibrations are mostly limited to the traditional indication of therapeutic drug monitoring during low-molecular-weight heparin therapy. If DOAC-specific calibration is not available, different cut-offs for AXA have been proposed, below which unimpaired coagulation can be expected.

### Early surgical fixation for hip fractures in patients taking direct oral anticoagulation: A retrospective cohort study [^112VksUx]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

Our study suggests that hip fracture patients taking DOACs upon admission is not a reason to delay surgery. Patients receiving early surgery showed no increase in hemoglobin loss, transfusion rates, or mortality. Given the variability in recent retrospective studies, further meta-analysis and prospective research are required with larger patient numbers, recording of patient renal function, and subgroup analysis of each DOAC type in order to definitively guide clinical practice. On this basis, detailed patient and drug-specific clinical guidelines could be produced.

### Edoxaban: How does the newest agent fit into the DOAC landscape [^115aP7xa]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Edoxaban is the most recently approved factor Xa inhibitor within the class of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Like other DOACs, edoxaban was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Similar to other DOACs, edoxaban has fewer drug-drug interactions than warfarin and does not require routine laboratory monitoring. Unlike other DOACs, edoxaban has yet to be approved for secondary or postoperative venous thromboembolism thromboprophylaxis. Currently, no antidote for edoxaban is available. To optimally prescribe agents in the DOAC class, it is critical that providers understand how the agents compare and identify specific settings in which one agent may be preferred over another.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in the treatment and long-term prevention of venous thrombo-embolism [^1111C9de]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) specifically target factor IIa or Xa and represent a major step forward in the treatment of acute- and long-term prevention of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE). They are at least as effective and as safe as conventional therapy (heparins and vitamin K inhibitors) and have practical advantages, such as fixed dosing and no need for laboratory monitoring. These antithrombotic agents introduce a new paradigm for the day-to-day management of VTE. Direct oral anticoagulants should streamline the management of most patients with VTE and will facilitate care in the outpatient setting. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain how to select specific DOACs for particular profiles of patients, and the optimal management of bleeding complications is evolving.

### Peri-procedural management of oral anticoagulants in the DOAC era [^1145H6eJ]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Peri-procedural management of oral anticoagulants can be complex and confusing for many providers. It involves a careful balance of a patient's thromboembolic risk and bleeding risk. For every patient chronically taking an oral anticoagulant who will be undergoing an elective procedure, a four-step approach may be considered when creating a plan for the oral anticoagulant:

1. **Need to stop oral anticoagulant**: Does the oral anticoagulant need to stop for the procedure?
2. **Timing of stopping**: If yes, when should the oral anticoagulant be stopped pre-procedure?
3. **Bridging anticoagulation**: Does the patient require a "bridging" parenteral anticoagulant?
4. **Restarting anticoagulation**: When should anticoagulation be re-started post-procedure?

Based on the unique features of warfarin versus the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), a unique, personalized plan should be developed and tailored to the individual patient. Anticoagulant specialists, such as anticoagulation clinic pharmacists, may help facilitate this process.

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists following a major bleed [^116JrQHw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a relatively recent addition to the oral anticoagulant armamentarium, providing an alternative to the use of vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin. Regardless of the type of agent used, bleeding is the major complication of anticoagulant therapy. The decision to restart oral anticoagulation following a major hemorrhage in a previously anticoagulated patient is supported largely by retrospective studies rather than randomized clinical trials (mostly with vitamin K antagonists), and remains an issue of individualized clinical assessment; the patient's risk of thromboembolism must be balanced with the risk of major bleeding. This review provides guidance for clinicians regarding if and when a patient should be re-initiated on DOAC therapy following a major hemorrhage, based on the existing evidence.

### Executive summary: Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: An American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116G1VVp]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

In the context of perioperative care for managing antithrombotic therapy and addressing perioperative bleeding, the ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend avoiding routine DOAC coagulation function testing to guide perioperative DOAC management. This recommendation is specifically for patients who have DOACs interrupted for an elective surgery or procedure.

### Safety of urgent hip fracture surgery protocol under influence of direct oral anticoagulation medications [^113HEVeg]. Injury (2019). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulation agents (DOACs) are increasingly prescribed to older adults. Concerns for perioperative blood loss dictate cessation of anticoagulation treatment and postponement of surgery until the coagulation system returns to a normal state. The goal of this study is to compare the estimates of perioperative blood loss and mortality between patients using DOACs and patients receiving no anticoagulation, in order to challenge the existing policy and question the need for surgery deferral.

- **Materials and methods**: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients (age > 65) with proximal hip fractures treated with either closed reduction internal fixation (CRIF, n = 1143; DOAC use n = 60) or hemiarthroplasty (HA, n = 571; DOAC use n = 29). Baseline patient characteristics included age, gender, ASA score, socioeconomic level, type of surgical treatment, duration of surgery, and time from admission to surgery. The effect of anticoagulant prescription on the percentage of hemoglobin change, odds of receiving blood transfusions, and one-month and one-year mortality was evaluated separately for CRIF and HA patients.

- **Results**: Patients receiving DOACs had similar perioperative hemoglobin change, transfusion rates, and mortality compared to subjects without anticoagulants in both CRIF and HA cohorts. DOAC patients undergoing CRIF had a longer delay to surgery (40.2 ± 26.9 vs. 31.2 ± 22.2, p = 0.003) and higher mortality rates at one year postoperatively (26.7% vs. 16.1%, p = 0.015).

- **Conclusions**: DOAC use was not associated with increased perioperative blood loss or m.

### Intravenous thrombolysis in patients taking direct oral anticoagulation treatment before stroke onset: Results from the Safe Implementations of Treatments in Stroke International Stroke Registry [^113itw6d]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

We performed a secondary analysis to examine the association between the time of the last dose of DOAC taken and outcomes in all patients with available data on DOAC treatment before stroke onset. The last dose of DOAC taken was divided into time intervals of hours: 0–4 hours, 4–8 hours ago, 8–12 hours ago, 12–24 hours ago, and over 24 hours but within 72 hours. For univariate comparison of the time intervals as a categorical variable on a group level, we used Pearson's χ² test. Additionally, we performed multivariable analyses to examine if the time of the last dose of DOAC, treated as an ordinal variable, was an independent predictor for the outcomes, using the same time categories in the following order (where the upper value is included in the interval): 0–4 hours, 4–8 hours, 8–12 hours, 12–24 hours, and over 24 hours.

We selected covariates for adjustment of the multivariable models based on their clinical significance and potential for confounding. The selected covariates were age, sex, baseline NIHSS, onset to IVT treatment time, history of atrial fibrillation, history of hypertension, history of hyperlipidemia, history of diabetes mellitus, history of congestive heart failure, and treatment with endovascular thrombectomy.

Several sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the outcomes within selected subgroups. For the first sensitivity analysis, we performed the analyses on patients that did not receive DOAC reversal agents. The SITS database collects data on the use of idarucizumab for dabigatran reversal but does not collect data on any other reversal agent.

Direct oral anticoagulant therapies, including direct anti-Xa and thrombin inhibitors, have recently been introduced and may have advantages over vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin. This review briefly describes the clinical utility and mechanisms of action of these agents. Detailed information is provided on the effects of these agents on routine assays, including the APTT and PT, as well as their impact on specialty laboratory assays. It also includes the use of drug-specific assays and a discussion of alternative methods to determine relative drug concentration, such as evaluating drug calibrators in APTT and PT assays and using heparin-calibrated anti-Xa assays to measure direct Xa inhibitors.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^1145McAu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), edoxaban (Savaysa), and betrixaban (Bevyxxa) — are anticoagulant pharmacotherapies used for the prevention of thrombosis in various cardiovascular contexts. DOACs are categorized into two main classes: oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran). In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first DOAC, dabigatran, followed by rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban in the subsequent years.

DOACs are relatively new agents showing superiority or noninferiority to the previous standards of care, namely anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA; warfarin) or low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), in reducing the risk of thromboembolic complications with similar or reduced bleeding risk. Advantages of DOACs compared with VKAs include fewer monitoring requirements, less frequent follow-up, more immediate drug onset and offset effects (important for periprocedural and acute bleeding management), and fewer drug and food interactions. As a result, by 2013, DOAC prescriptions exceeded those for warfarin, with apixaban emerging as the most frequently prescribed DOAC for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).

Over the past decade, DOACs have been extensively investigated in numerous clinical scenarios. Although guidelines and review articles have offered detailed and comprehensive analyses of this vast literature, they can sometimes be overly cumbersome.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^114svfRp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

DOACs have revolutionized anticoagulant management and are becoming the cornerstone treatment for stroke prevention in AF and VTE prophylaxis and treatment, with the list of other indications expanding. There are many factors that will affect appropriate efficacy and safety endpoints when prescribing DOAC therapy, and this review aims to address these scenarios.

Patient comorbidities must be considered when selecting the most appropriate anticoagulant. It is now recognized that routine monitoring of renal and hepatic function, signs and symptoms of bleeding, and parameters of compliance should be considered for all patients. Clinicians should incorporate patient preferences, clinical outcomes data, patient characteristics, and quality-of-life considerations when recommending an anticoagulant.

Cost can play a critical role in this decision, with DOAC affordability for individual patients varying based on medication benefit copayment tiers. As the future of anticoagulant therapies continues to evolve, DOACs will remain a critical therapy for preventing thrombotic events.

### Benefits and harms of direct oral anticoagulation and low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115FQGHo]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

The risk of venous thromboembolism varies significantly across different types of non-cardiac surgery. Evidence from randomised controlled trials on drug treatment for thromboprophylaxis in non-cardiac, non-orthopaedic surgeries is more limited. Consequently, guidelines on drug treatment for thromboprophylaxis in these surgeries emphasize the expected risk of venous thromboembolism based on the specific surgery and patient-related factors, such as malignancy versus non-malignancy as the reason for surgery. These guidelines often include less strong or conditional recommendations.

In both orthopaedic and other non-cardiac surgeries, the best choice of drug for thromboprophylaxis remains uncertain. In orthopaedic surgery, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and direct oral anticoagulants are among the most studied agents. Since their market introduction, most guidelines have suggested direct oral anticoagulants as an alternative to LMWH. More recent guidelines from the American Society of Hematology recommend direct oral anticoagulants over LMWH for thromboprophylaxis, based on direct comparative evidence on efficacy and safety, as well as cost-effectiveness, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. However, the evidence on effects was rated as of moderate certainty due to the imprecision of the estimates.

For other non-orthopaedic surgeries, guidelines do not consider direct oral anticoagulants as an option for thromboprophylaxis because of the lack of randomised controlled trials. In practice, clinicians commonly use LMWH. In fact, the literature indicates that most patients…

### International collaboration in real-world evidence generation for direct acting oral anti-coagulants [^113YZDXA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). High credibility.

At the time of authorization, the different DOACs had high-quality clinical trial evidence supporting their positive benefit-risk balance. However, additional studies were imposed on these products by some jurisdictions due to limitations related to the duration and nature of the clinical trial exposure, and some uncertainties related to their safe and effective use, including the optimal dose, use in patients with renal impairment, and use in at-risk populations. To take stock of the knowledge on the products and to catalyze the generation of information to fill knowledge gaps, the EMA organized an expert workshop on November 25, 2015. Among the conclusions of the workshop was the request for further research in real-life patients to support the safe use of anticoagulants in clinical practice outside the setting of a clinical trial. On this basis, the EMA commissioned independent research from academia in the European Union and embarked on collaboration with Health Canada through the Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network and with the FDA on real-world studies of DOACs.

### Novel oral anticoagulants: Efficacy, laboratory measurement, and approaches to emergent reversal [^112EiJjk]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Warfarin, the most commonly used of the vitamin K antagonists, has been a mainstay of oral anticoagulation for decades. However, its usage is limited by morbidity and mortality secondary to bleeding, as well as a cumbersome therapeutic monitoring process. In the past several years, a number of competing novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been developed. Each aims to match or exceed warfarin's effectiveness while mitigating bleeding risk and eliminating therapeutic monitoring requirements.

At present, one oral direct thrombin inhibitor and two direct factor Xa inhibitors are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Here, we compare the clinical efficacy and safety profiles of these new drugs.

- **Laboratory assays**: We discuss various laboratory assays that may be useful to measure these drugs in certain clinical circumstances.

- **Emerging reversal strategies**: Finally, we discuss emerging strategies to reverse these agents in an emergency.

The purpose of this article is to provide a framework for practicing pathologists to advise clinicians on NOAC laboratory measurement and management of NOAC-associated bleeding.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^114rRH41]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

For more than a decade, US laboratories have failed to implement solutions to assist clinicians in managing complex situations or patients on DOACs. The problem may stem from various origins, including the position of the FDA, which categorized these drugs as monitoring- and measurement-free. In contrast, other regulatory bodies were more conservative, adhering to the principle that the absence of proof (of monitoring/measurement benefits) is not proof of an absence (of monitoring/measurement needs). Pivotal clinical studies leading to the approval of DOACs were presented as devoid of such testing, even though some companies considered monitoring as a means to improve their benefit/risk ratio. Key opinion leaders and early guidelines on DOAC management also conveyed the message that these tests were unnecessary, if not harmful. Nevertheless, numerous groups of experts in hemostasis laboratory practice have contributed to the general knowledge surrounding DOACs by providing independent laboratory data on test method development, evaluation of drug levels in real life, and their association with clinical events.

While we all agree that "monitoring" is not the adequate term to describe the clinical need in the era of DOACs, "point measurement" is certainly more appropriate, as almost all clinicians dealing with DOAC-treated patients may need to evaluate the residual anticoagulant activity in certain situations. More than a decade of development has also permitted the activation of smart laboratory solutions to qualify or quantify DOACs.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, particularly in the management of antithrombotic therapy, the ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend considering the administration of prophylactic doses of LMWH or DOACs (according to specific indications) after intermediate- or high-bleeding-risk procedures whenever thromboprophylaxis is necessary. Full therapeutic doses of DOACs should be resumed up to 72 hours postoperatively if surgical hemostasis is achieved.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^111GY8D9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Past guidelines on perioperative and postoperative management for patients on DOACs have been primarily based on surgical risk (both thrombotic and bleeding), the DOAC's pharmacokinetic profile, concomitant medications, and patient characteristics (e.g. comorbid diseases, history of bleeding complications, renal function, and age). Because of DOACs' fast onset and offset, periprocedural bridging is generally not required; however, it is important to note the length of time to hold regimens before and after procedures. Providers may find it useful to obtain specific coagulation measurements before procedures, especially in high-risk interventions, to determine the level of hemostasis.

However, for the majority of patients undergoing elective procedures, the interruption of DOAC therapy can be substantiated on a time-based approach that takes into consideration bleeding risk of the procedure and renal function. Furthermore, the results of the ongoing PAUSE (Perioperative Anticoagulant Use for Surgery Evaluation; NCT02228798) will help to further define a more conclusive standard-of-care approach for perioperative management.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^1118hUbo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

While firm evidence supports the efficacy of DOACs for long-term anticoagulation, reliable data on DOAC concentration thresholds that result in clinically significant coagulation impairment are lacking. Although we acknowledge this ambiguity, the safe-for-treatment threshold of 30 ng/mL, which has been proposed for invasive procedures or thrombolysis in several recent guidelines and expert recommendations, seems to have been chosen with a focus on patient safety and is lower than previous recommendations. In cases of severe but less critical bleeding, a threshold of 50 ng/mL has been proposed to warrant antidote administration. We have included test accuracy calculations for this higher threshold.

It should be noted that these threshold recommendations are founded on an extrapolation based on retrospective analyses of existing trial data. Supporting these thresholds with better quality clinical data is of paramount importance because the number of DOAC-treated patients is steadily increasing. To accomplish this, concentration measurements using DOAC-specific assays in all patients who develop ischemic or hemorrhagic events seem advisable. Furthermore, the wide availability of DOAC-specific coagulation assays is very important in this context, both to guide further research and for the treatment of these patients.

### Direct-acting oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in relation to risk of gastrointestinal bleeding: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114Cu5Ue]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Use of vitamin K antagonists, mainly warfarin, is characterized by frequent clinic visits for monitoring the international normalized ratio (INR) to assess therapeutic efficacy. It also requires heparin use for bridging and faces the disadvantage of drug-drug and drug-food interactions necessitating dose adjustments. Given these drawbacks, the use of warfarin is cumbersome and can lead to low adherence. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) offer the distinct advantage of fixed dosing and do not require continuous laboratory monitoring. These features, combined with the availability of FDA-approved reversal agents, have made them desirable anticoagulants.

Several studies have shown equivalent therapeutic efficacy of DOACs compared with warfarin in atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, there are few specific guidelines available to guide physicians about the individualized use of a particular DOAC for patients. Most choices rely on healthcare providers' preference, the patient's risk status, and the cost of the drugs, through a shared decision-making process.

In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the overall safety profile of DOACs, emphasizing the overall risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and, more specifically, the risk of fatal GIB. In addition, we compared individual DOACs to warfarin regarding the risk of GIB and safety in light of the variability of INR controls, i.e. the time in therapeutic range (TTR).

### Is there a role for the laboratory monitoring in the management of specific antidotes of direct oral anticoagulants [^116pTTH9]. Thrombosis Research (2024). High credibility.

Given the growing number of patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), the need for rapid neutralization in cases of major bleeding or urgent surgery/procedures is also increasing. Idarucizumab is commercialized as a specific antidote to dabigatran, while andexanet alfa has gained approval from the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency as an antidote for oral anti-factor Xa inhibitors. Other antidotes or hemostatic agents are still under preclinical or clinical development, with ciraparantag being the most advanced. Measurement of DOAC plasma levels allows for the appropriate selection of patients for antidote administration and may prevent the unnecessary prescription of expensive molecules in some acute clinical settings. However, these tests might be inconclusive after the administration of certain antidotes, namely andexanet alfa and ciraparantag. The benefit of laboratory monitoring following DOAC reversal remains unclear.

This study aims to provide an overview of key studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of DOAC reversal using the most developed/commercialized specific antidotes. It also discusses the potential role of laboratory monitoring in the management of patients receiving DOAC-specific antidotes and highlights areas that require further investigation to establish the exact role of laboratory monitoring in the appropriate management of these antidotes.

### The laboratory's 2015 perspective on direct oral anticoagulant testing [^1173KaLd]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

The introduction of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy into clinical use in the past five years has significantly impacted the clinical laboratory. Clinicians' desire to determine plasma drug presence or measure drug concentration, along with recent observations on the limitations and utility of coagulation testing in the setting of DOAC treatment, suggest that early published recommendations regarding laboratory testing should be reassessed. These initial recommendations were often based on drug-spiked plasma studies rather than samples from patients receiving DOAC therapy.

We have demonstrated that reagent sensitivity varies significantly depending on whether drug-spiked samples or samples from DOAC-treated patients are tested. Therefore, data from drug-enriched samples must be interpreted with caution or used as a guide only. We present laboratory assays that can be utilized to determine drug presence and measure drug concentration and provide recommended testing algorithms. As DOAC therapy may significantly impact specialty coagulation assays, we review those tests with the potential to give false-positive and false-negative results.

### Switching from vitamin K antagonists to direct oral anticoagulants: Treatment satisfaction and patient concerns [^116N1Sva]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

The general therapy satisfaction for patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) was high, with a mean score of 8.8 on a 10‐point scale. A total of 1,029 patients (88%) indicated they were "very satisfied", 120 patients (10%) expressed they were "satisfied", and only 23 patients (2%) reported being "unsatisfied" during the month before completing the questionnaire. After stratifying for anticoagulation indication and DOAC type, results remained similar. Notably, 227 patients (16%) did not report satisfaction as they did not fill in the question of interest. Concerns about the occurrence of a major bleed were reported by 322 patients (26%) as being slightly to extremely concerned. However, the majority of patients (n = 959, 75%) indicated they were not concerned about the risk of major bleeding while on DOAC therapy. These rates were similar for minor bleeding concerns. Concerns about the occurrence of a thromboembolic event were present in 286 patients (22%), and 277 patients (22%) expressed concern about death due to a bleeding or thromboembolic event while on DOAC therapy. Additionally, 132 patients (9%) did not report their level of concern for these events.

- **Antidote availability and anticoagulant level monitoring**: When asked about the importance of the availability of an antidote for the anticoagulant, 103 patients (8%) strongly disagreed or disagreed with the statement "The availability of an antidote is important".

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^114hty2c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

- **Cost analysis**: DOACs have quickly gained popularity as an alternative anticoagulation strategy, surpassing VKAs as first-line agents due to improved clinical outcomes, simplicity of dosing, lack of monitoring requirements, and an expanding indication list. All DOACs are currently branded medications; therefore, cost remains a significant barrier to access. Apixaban was recently granted generic approval at the end of 2019, but product availability is likely not expected for several more years, and the cost and generic status of the other DOACs remain unknown. While DOACs are substantially more expensive than VKAs, laboratory monitoring costs are reduced since INR monitoring is not required. US cost analyses have shown that apixaban has the highest quality-adjusted life year for stroke prevention in NVAF patients, followed by dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and the lowest being warfarin.

A recent study demonstrated that dabigatran was associated with lower all-cause costs and healthcare resource use compared with rivaroxaban, while having similar all-cause costs and hospitalizations compared to apixaban, but higher outpatient and pharmacy healthcare resource use. In the United States, commercially insured patients are eligible for time-limited programs to reduce out-of-pocket expenses using manufacturer copayment cards, most limiting patient costs to ≤ $10 per month. Federally funded patients (Medicare, Medicaid, etc) are ineligible for these programs. Despite the cost, from 2010 to 2017, there was a dramatic increase in the use of DOACs for NVAF.

### Risk of stroke in patients with prior VKA or DOAC: A population-based real-world registry analysis [^116ZoNJG]. European Stroke Journal (2024). High credibility.

At the time of writing, risk assessment for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in individuals under oral anticoagulation (OAC) is limited to hospital-based cohorts and patients with atrial fibrillation. Through the combination of three individual datasets — (1) the population-based Tyrolean Stroke Pathway database, prospectively documenting all unselected stroke patients in the entire federal state of Tyrol, (2) nationwide prescription data detailing each reimbursed prescription in Austria, and (3) the Austrian Stroke Unit Registry, a nationwide registry comprising data on all patients admitted to any of the 38 stroke units in Austria — we assessed the risk of stroke in patients with prior oral anticoagulation. We compared characteristics of patients taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and Vitamin-K-Antagonists (VKAs).

In Austria, oral anticoagulant prescription reimbursements increased from 292,475 in 2015 to 389,407 in 2021. In Tyrol, prior oral anticoagulation treatment was evident in 586 of 3,861 (15.2%) patients with ischemic and 131 of 523 (25.0%) with hemorrhagic stroke, with 20% and 35% of those stroke patients, respectively, having prior oral anticoagulation due to indications other than non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Considering prescription rates, treatment with DOACs was associated with a reduced stroke risk compared to VKAs, especially in ischemic stroke (1.05% vs. 0.62%; RR 0.59, p < 0.001), but also in hemorrhagic stroke, albeit less pronounced (0.21% vs. 0.14%; RR 0.68, p = 0.06).

### Direct oral anticoagulant plasma level measurement in clinical practice: A French single-institution retrospective study [^111s3hpJ]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Low credibility.

The study aimed to describe patient characteristics and clinical situations where DOAC assays were ordered and to determine whether the assay indications and subsequent patient management were consistent with guidelines.

- **Methods**: Retrospective study of data from patients with prescriptions for three DOACs: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, treated at Percy Military Hospital (France) between 2016 and 2019.

- **Results**: During the study period, 196 DOAC measurements were performed on 148 patients (median age: 82.5 years). The most frequently prescribed DOAC was rivaroxaban (57.5%), and the most common indication was nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (77%). Measurements were performed on 3.5% of patients with an active prescription for DOAC, and DOAC prescriptions complied with the product's characteristic summary in 62.8% of cases. The number of assays performed increased 2.5-fold between 2017 and 2019. Most DOAC assays were ordered due to emergency surgery or procedures (46.9%), bleeding (19.9%), or a risk of drug accumulation (13.8%). Time from the last DOAC dose to sample collection was specified in only 25.5% of cases. Reasons for ordering DOAC measurements were consistent with the guidelines in 87.2% of cases, and subsequent clinical decisions were consistent with the guidelines in 86.2% of cases.

- **Conclusions**: DOAC assay ordering frequency was rare but increased during the study. Acute clinical situations were the most common source of test orders. A correct interpretation of the results and subsequent management occurred in most, but not all, cases, indicating areas for improvement.

### Differences in preferences between clinicians and patients for the use and dosing of direct oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation [^115a7S6z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Almost 30% of clinicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation prescribed an underdosed direct oral anticoagulant despite the patient not meeting labeled dose reduction criteria. Most clinicians stated that they would never or rarely empirically underdose a patient in their practice. However, a large majority of clinicians demonstrated gaps in their knowledge of DOAC dosing.

Additionally, we observed differences in what patients and clinicians considered important in anticoagulant decision-making. Patients were more likely than clinicians to rank the ability to reduce the dose of the DOAC as very important. Further work is needed to determine how to optimize clinician and patient decision-making for DOAC selection and dosing.

### Safety of direct oral anticoagulants: Insights from postmarketing studies [^113napsC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been marketed in the United States since 2010. Numerous large-scale prospective phase 3 outcome studies have documented the effectiveness of DOACs for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. The primary safety concern with all of these drugs, as with the more established oral anticoagulant warfarin, is the risk of major bleeding. Postmarketing surveillance studies (PMSS) provide the opportunity to evaluate the safety of these recently approved drugs across a spectrum of patients that may be broader than those included in randomized controlled trials. This review summarizes the safety findings of numerous recently performed, large-scale PMSS evaluations and considers the currently available evidence regarding the risks for bleeding in patients treated with DOACs. This information aims to provide providers and patients with additional evidence regarding the safety of DOACs.

### Efficacy and safety considerations with dose-reduced direct oral anticoagulants: A review [^114pb5s3]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Dose-reduced regimens of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be used for two main purposes: dose-adjusted treatment intended as full-intensity anticoagulation (e.g. for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [AF] in patients requiring dose reduction) or low-intensity treatment (e.g. extended-duration treatment of venous thromboembolism [VTE]). We reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to understand the scenarios in which dose-adjusted or low-intensity DOACs were tested and reviewed the labeled indications by regulatory authorities. This review used data from large registries to assess whether the use of dose-reduced DOACs in routine practice aligned with the findings of RCTs.

Among the 4,191 screened publications, 35 RCTs that used dose-adjusted DOACs were identified for dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban. Of these 35 RCTs, 29 were related to stroke prevention in AF. The efficacy and safety results for dose-adjusted DOACs in large RCTs of AF were similar to those found for full-dose DOACs. To our knowledge, dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban have not been studied as dose-adjusted therapy for acute VTE treatment. Low-intensity DOACs were identified in 37 RCTs. Low-intensity DOACs may be used for extended-duration treatment of VTE (apixaban and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in orthopedic surgeries (dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in ambulatory high-risk cancer patients (apixaban and rivaroxaban), or (post-discharge) high-risk medical patients (rivaroxaban). They are also used in stable atherosclerotic vascular disease or following a recent revascularization procedure.

### Direct oral anticoagulant drug level testing in clinical practice: A single institution experience [^1114u6ys]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

We performed a review of all direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) levels — ecarin times for dabigatran and anti-Xa levels for rivaroxaban and apixaban — ordered at our institution. The purpose was to evaluate DOAC levels from "real-world" (non-clinical trial) patients taking DOACs long-term, to assess levels obtained, reasons for checking levels, and actions taken based on the testing result. A total of 28 patients had 48 levels sent over a 36-month period. The majority of outpatient levels were within or close to the range of published values.

The setting in which levels were sent influenced how results affected management decisions. In the outpatient setting, the majority of levels served to reassure clinicians that DOAC levels were within expected ranges, resulting in the continuation of chosen management. In the inpatient setting, DOAC levels were used most frequently to detect DOAC presence in urgent clinical situations and influenced clinical decision-making in the peri-procedural and pre-operative periods.

Our results demonstrate that while testing may be useful if immediately available in urgent clinical situations where assessment of drug presence is needed, DOAC level monitoring is infrequently used overall. The lack of use combined with the paucity of available evidence to guide clinical decision-making based on the results suggests there is little urgency to make the tests widely available for routine use outside of acute settings in the emergency department and urgent surgical setting.

### New oral anticoagulants: Which one should my patient use [^113GEt11]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants are rapidly replacing warfarin for several indications. Unlike warfarin, which lowers the functional levels of all the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, the new agents target either factor Xa or thrombin. With targeted inhibition of coagulation, the new oral anticoagulants possess pharmacologic and clinical features distinguishing them from warfarin.

- **Comparative pharmacology**: This paper compares the pharmacology of the new oral anticoagulants with that of warfarin.
- **Class effects and differentiating features**: It identifies the class effects of these drugs and their differentiating features.
- **Review of indications**: The paper reviews the indications for these new oral anticoagulants.
- **Clinical decision support**: It uses this information to help clinicians make informed decisions regarding the choice of the right anticoagulant for the right patient.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^117Mc6JC]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Laboratories in Canada, UK, Australasia, and Europe have demonstrated that these tests are easily implementable, show adequate analytical and clinical performance according to their regional regulations, and are helpful for clinicians as demonstrated by the numerous studies arising from these parts of the globe. In the United States, there is no need to wait for FDA approval of DOAC dedicated methods to develop these methods because almost all laboratories have the minimum material requirements for performing these analyses. In centers dealing with DOAC reversal agents, offering these product-dedicated methods may even be extremely cost-effective because it may help rationalize the administration of andexanet alfa or idarucizumab for direct factor Xa inhibitors and dabigatran, respectively.

Use of DOACs is ever-expanding, with DOAC prescriptions now exceeding those of other anticoagulants, including VKA, in some geographies. As this use increases, the likely need to measure DOAC exposure will also increase. Measurement of DOACs does not represent any technical difficulty. That these laboratory tests are not available in some locations suggests disparities in patient care, and we suggest it is time to address such disparities.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation developed in collaboration with the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) [^112HneAG]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of atrial fibrillation, particularly in relation to anticoagulant therapy, the EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of long-term oral anticoagulation in suitable patients with trigger-induced atrial fibrillation at elevated thromboembolic risk to prevent ischemic stroke and systemic thromboembolism.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome: Guidance from the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [^1148u9gb]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of antiphospholipid syndrome, particularly with respect to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), the ISTH 2020 guidelines recommend considering alternative vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) if available. This should be done before opting for direct oral anticoagulants in single- or double-positive, non-high-risk patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) who have experienced a single prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) requiring standard-intensity VKA therapy. This consideration is particularly pertinent for patients with an allergy or intolerance to VKAs or those with erratic international normalized ratios (INRs) despite adherence.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically concerning anticoagulant therapy, the 2024 EACTS/ESC guidelines recommend not to switch from one direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) to another, or from a DOAC to a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), without a clear indication in patients with atrial fibrillation to prevent embolic stroke.

### Direct oral anticoagulant dose selection: Challenging cases [^1165bg7H]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are administered in fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring of their anticoagulant effect, based on the results of pivotal phase III trials. In some of these trials, patients were randomly allocated to receive either a higher or lower dose of a DOAC, whereas in others, most patients were given a standard dose, with only a subset deemed at risk of drug accumulation receiving a lower dose. Treatment guidelines recommend dosing DOACs according to the way they were tested in the trials, but for some patients, the optimal dosing remains uncertain.

One example is patients with atrial fibrillation who are considered to have an unacceptably high risk of bleeding but do not meet the guideline criteria for dose reduction. Another example includes patients with venous thromboembolism who have completed 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation and are eligible for extended treatment with a standard or reduced dose of DOAC. This review presents a case-based approach to DOAC dose selection in these two settings.

### Progress in the monitoring of direct oral anticoagulant therapy [^1155agDb]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

The availability of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has led to a paradigm shift in the field of anticoagulation, with DOACs increasingly being prescribed for patients in preference to vitamin K antagonists and low molecular weight heparin. Despite good experience with the use of these agents at fixed doses, there are clinical scenarios where monitoring is recommended. Data from phase III studies of the DOACs and small real-world studies suggest a relationship between DOAC concentration and clinical events.

DOACs have differing impacts on the common tests of haemostasis, and it is important that clinicians are familiar with the sensitivity of the reagents used in their laboratory to individual DOACs. Specific DOAC drug concentrations can be assayed in the laboratory, when required, to guide appropriate clinical decision-making. Studies from the real world with sufficient numbers evaluating the association of DOAC concentrations with outcomes should be a research priority to understand if we could improve through dose individualization.

### The laboratory and the direct oral anticoagulants [^113wCj1s]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Although direct oral anticoagulants do not require laboratory testing for dose adjustment, there are instances when laboratory measurement of the drug's anticoagulant effect may be useful. These instances include before the initiation of treatment, prior to surgical or invasive procedures, during hemorrhagic or thrombotic events, and whenever immediate reversal of anticoagulation is needed. The choice of tests should primarily be based on their prompt availability. Accordingly, the dilute-thrombin or the ecarin clotting times are best suited for dabigatran, while the prothrombin time or the anti-FXa is recommended for rivaroxaban.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^113EFB3o]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

The 2021 guidelines from the AHA/ASA recommend initiating oral anticoagulation therapy, such as apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin, in patients with acute ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation (AF) to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with stroke or TIA and non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Oral anticoagulation should be initiated regardless of the pattern of AF, whether paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^114KX42i]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Long-term oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy is used for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism. As OAC use is so widespread, emergency physicians are likely to encounter patients on anticoagulant therapy in the emergency department (ED) on a regular basis, either for the same reasons as the population in general or as a result of the increased bleeding risk that OAC use entails.

The vitamin K antagonist warfarin has been the standard OAC for several decades. Recently, the newer agents dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban (collectively, novel OACs, non-vitamin K OACs, or simply 'NOACs') have become available for long-term use. Protocols for assessing and managing warfarin-treated patients in the ED are well established and include international normalised ratio (INR) testing, which helps guide patient management. However, the INR does not give an accurate evaluation of coagulation status with NOACs, and alternative tests are therefore needed for use in emergency settings. This paper discusses what information the INR provides for a patient taking warfarin and which coagulation tests can guide the physician when treating patients on one of the NOACs, as well as other differences in emergency anticoagulation management.

### Laboratory tests and the new oral anticoagulants [^116E9s2Y]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

New oral anticoagulants are poised to become widely used in the treatment and prophylaxis of various cardiovascular diseases. Despite not requiring dose-adjustment based on laboratory testing, laboratories play a crucial role in aiding clinicians with the management of anticoagulated patients. Many tests can potentially evaluate the anticoagulant effects of these new drugs; however, the choice should favor those that are readily available in emergency settings and easy to conduct. Considerations such as the linearity of dose-response, responsiveness to increasing doses, and standardization are important factors. This article reviews the available tests, their characteristics, and the most appropriate choices.

### DOACs: Role of anti-Xa and drug level monitoring [^114cfZ9K]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not require routine monitoring of anticoagulant effect. However, measuring DOAC activity may be desirable in specific circumstances to detect whether clinically significant DOAC levels are present, such as prior to urgent surgery, or to assess whether drug levels are excessively high or excessively low in at-risk patients, for example, after malabsorptive gastrointestinal surgery.

Routine coagulation tests, including the international normalized ratio (INR) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), cannot accurately quantify drug levels. Nevertheless, they may provide a qualitative assessment of DOAC activity when considering the estimated time to drug clearance, based on the timing of the last drug ingestion and renal and hepatic function. Drug-specific chromogenic and clot-based assays can quantify drug levels, but they are not universally available and do not have established therapeutic ranges.

In this review, we discuss our approach to measuring DOAC drug levels, including patient selection, interpretation of coagulation testing, and how measurement may inform clinical decision-making in specific scenarios.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation developed in collaboration with the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) [^115Vd5Wb]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, and more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, the EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of DOAC therapy in patients with asymptomatic, device-detected subclinical AF and elevated thromboembolic risk to prevent ischemic stroke and thromboembolism, while excluding patients at high risk of bleeding.
