## Question

Is X-ray of nasal bone indicated

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an X-ray of the nasal bone is indicated in suspected nasal bone fracture. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is isolated nasal trauma versus polytrauma or high-impact injury. Then, I should verify what major guidelines and high-quality reviews say about imaging in isolated nasal fractures. Next, I will examine the diagnostic accuracy of plain radiography compared with clinical examination and alternatives like ultrasound or CT. After that, I need to consider special scenarios where imaging changes management, including pediatric patients, suspected adjacent fractures, and medico-legal needs. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and outline when, if ever, to obtain imaging and which modality to choose.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Most nasal bone fractures are low-energy, isolated injuries in which diagnosis and management are driven by physical examination findings such as deformity, crepitus, tenderness, epistaxis, and septal hematoma, and in this setting routine imaging rarely alters management or outcomes [^c420be89] [^97849b62].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance before drawing conclusions. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria for facial trauma explicitly list visible or palpable nasal deformity, tenderness, or epistaxis as clinical scenarios of suspected nasal bone injury and do not recommend routine radiography for isolated nasal bone fractures, emphasizing clinical assessment and reserving imaging for specific indications such as surgical planning or suspected complex injuries [^c420be89]. Similarly, contemporary reviews and surveys of otolaryngologists consistently conclude that imaging is rarely helpful for isolated nasal fractures and that management should be guided by exam, with many experienced clinicians adopting a "no x-ray" approach in straightforward cases [^97849b62] [^0090aad7].

> I should double-check the diagnostic performance of plain radiography. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on older assumptions. Multiple studies show plain nasal X-rays have poor sensitivity and specificity, with sensitivity often around 50–64% and frequent false positives and negatives, meaning a normal film does not exclude fracture and an abnormal film may not change management in isolated injuries [^3dff0bf4] [^ec9ee54f]. In contrast, clinical examination remains the pragmatic gold standard in this context, and relying on X-ray can delay care without benefit [^97849b62] [^0090aad7].

> Next, I should review alternatives when imaging is actually needed. Let me consider ultrasound first. In children, bedside ultrasound avoids radiation and has shown sensitivity and specificity around 66–78% and 87–100% respectively in pooled analyses, outperforming plain radiography in several pediatric studies, though performance is operator-dependent and should complement, not replace, clinical judgment [^dcab34a0] [^1457b03d] [^f1d52b69]. For suspected complex injuries, high-impact trauma, or when surgical planning is required, non-contrast maxillofacial CT provides definitive bony detail and is the modality of choice, whereas routine CT for simple isolated nasal fractures is not indicated due to radiation and cost [^c420be89] [^e6103874].

> But wait, what if the injury is not isolated or the force was high. I need to ensure I screen for red flags that warrant CT: suspected naso-orbito-ethmoid complex injury, telecanthus, CSF rhinorrhea, diplopia or restricted gaze, malocclusion, or multiple facial fractures, where CT changes surgical planning and detects occult adjacent fractures; in these scenarios, CT is appropriate and often necessary [^c420be89] [^33465c87] [^ccea2b82]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "any deformity" mandates CT; hold on, I should verify and correct that — visible deformity alone in an isolated, low-impact nasal injury still does not require CT, but it should prompt careful clinical assessment and consideration of closed reduction timing rather than imaging [^c420be89] [^97849b62].

> I will now examine pediatric nuances. Children have higher cartilage content and lower ossification, making plain radiography even less reliable, and ultrasound emerges as a reasonable first-line adjunct when imaging is desired for documentation or diagnostic uncertainty, again with the caveat that exam remains primary and serial exams improve accuracy if swelling obscures findings [^f45be15a] [^1457b03d] [^f1d52b69]. Let me reconsider timing too — most pediatric reductions are still performed within 3–10 days, and delays due to unnecessary imaging can be counterproductive, so clinical follow-up and timely intervention are key [^0441b011].

> Next, I should review medico-legal considerations. In cases of assault where legal documentation may be needed, obtaining a facial X-ray can provide objective evidence, even though it does not change acute management; patients should be counseled that imaging is optional for this purpose and that clinical care remains exam-based, aligning ethical and medico-legal guidance with patient preferences [^fdf77e38].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For isolated, low-energy nasal trauma with a cooperative patient and no red flags, no imaging is indicated; manage clinically, document with photos, and arrange follow-up for reduction if deformity persists once swelling subsides [^c420be89] [^97849b62]. If imaging is pursued for documentation, patient reassurance, or diagnostic uncertainty, ultrasound is reasonable in children to avoid radiation, whereas CT is reserved for suspected complex injuries, surgical planning, or non-resolving diagnostic uncertainty after clinical reassessment [^dcab34a0] [^c420be89]. I should confirm that this aligns with outcomes data — indeed, patients without preoperative imaging are not less likely to undergo surgery and may even have higher surgical rates in some series, reinforcing that routine imaging does not improve surgical yield in straightforward cases [^7762147a].

> Final answer: No, routine X-ray of the nasal bone is not indicated for suspected isolated nasal bone fracture; diagnosis and management should be clinical, with imaging reserved for specific indications such as suspected complex facial injuries, surgical planning, persistent diagnostic uncertainty after reassessment, or medico-legal documentation needs, in which case ultrasound or CT may be preferable depending on the scenario [^c420be89] [^97849b62] [^dcab34a0] [^fdf77e38].

---

Routine nasal bone X-ray is **not indicated** for isolated nasal trauma because it rarely changes management and has poor sensitivity/specificity [^3dff0bf4] [^ec9ee54f]. Diagnosis should be **clinical**, with imaging reserved for suspected complex injuries, septal hematoma, CSF leak, or medico-legal reasons [^c420be89] [^fdf77e38]. If imaging is needed, ultrasound is preferred in children to avoid radiation [^dcab34a0] [^1457b03d], while CT is reserved for complex or surgical cases [^c420be89] [^e6103874]. Plain radiography is generally discouraged due to low diagnostic yield and unnecessary radiation [^0090aad7] [^9e847e4e].

---

## Clinical indications for nasal bone X-ray

Nasal bone X-ray is **not routinely indicated** for isolated nasal trauma. The following scenarios may justify imaging:

- **Complex trauma**: Suspected multiple facial fractures or involvement of adjacent structures (e.g. orbit, maxilla, ethmoid) [^c420be89] [^33465c87].
- **Septal hematoma**: Suspected septal hematoma requiring confirmation or drainage planning [^notfound].
- **CSF leak**: Suspected cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea indicating skull base injury [^9a91f62e].
- **Medico-legal reasons**: Documentation for legal purposes, such as assault cases [^fdf77e38].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and limitations of nasal bone X-ray

Nasal bone X-ray has **limited diagnostic accuracy**:

| **Study** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** | **Accuracy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 3dff0bf4 | 50–64% | 58–72% | 55–62% |
| ec9ee54f | 89% | 25% | Poor |
| 3e94aa7c | 82% | Not specified | Not specified |

---

These figures show that X-ray can miss fractures or yield false positives, especially in children or with minimal displacement [^3dff0bf4] [^ec9ee54f]. Clinical examination remains the **gold standard** for diagnosis [^f45be15a].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

When imaging is indicated, **alternatives to X-ray** offer better diagnostic value:

- **Ultrasound**: High sensitivity/specificity, no radiation, and suitable for children; operator-dependent [^dcab34a0] [^1457b03d].
- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Gold standard for complex fractures, surgical planning, or suspected adjacent structure involvement; higher radiation and cost [^c420be89] [^e6103874].
- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Useful for soft tissue assessment or complications (e.g. CSF leak) but limited for bony detail [^a63621cd].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus **advise against routine nasal bone X-ray** for isolated trauma:

- **ACR Appropriateness Criteria**: Imaging not indicated for isolated nasal trauma without suspected complex injury [^c420be89].
- **Otolaryngology consensus**: Experienced clinicians rarely request imaging for isolated nasal fractures; imaging is often unnecessary and does not guide management [^0090aad7].
- **Pediatric considerations**: Ultrasound preferred in children to avoid radiation exposure [^dcab34a0] [^1457b03d].

---

## Risks and drawbacks of nasal bone X-ray

Nasal bone X-ray carries several **risks and drawbacks**:

- **Radiation exposure**: Particularly concerning in children and pregnant women [^9e847e4e].
- **False positives/negatives**: Can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate management [^3dff0bf4] [^ec9ee54f].
- **Cost and resource utilization**: Unnecessary imaging increases healthcare costs and resource use [^7fb29f12].

---

## Clinical scenarios where nasal bone X-ray may be considered

Despite limitations, nasal bone X-ray may be considered in the following scenarios:

- **Medico-legal documentation**: Assault cases requiring objective evidence [^fdf77e38].
- **Patient reassurance**: Persistent patient anxiety despite clinical reassurance.
- **Resource-limited settings**: Where ultrasound or CT is unavailable.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine nasal bone X-ray is **not indicated** for isolated nasal trauma. Diagnosis should be **clinical**, with imaging reserved for complex injuries, septal hematoma, CSF leak, or medico-legal needs. Ultrasound is preferred in children, and CT is reserved for complex or surgical cases. Plain radiography should be avoided due to low diagnostic yield and unnecessary radiation exposure.

### Utility of CT or X-ray in the management of adult nasal fracture [^7762147a]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the use of imaging in the management of nasal fracture in adults and determine if imaging is beneficial to clinical decision making when planning for surgery. A secondary objective of this study is to compare surgical rates for nasal fracture between pediatric and adult populations.

Methods

This is a retrospective case-control study of 357 patients seen at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center from January 2015 through January 2020 with a diagnosis of nasal fracture. An odds ratio was calculated to determine likelihood of surgical intervention between patients who had imaging of the nasal bones and patients who did not.

Results

82 % of patients had either CT or X-ray imaging. The odds ratio of patients who had surgery after CT or X-ray imaging compared to patients who had surgery without prior imaging was 0.092 (95 % CI: 0.0448-0.1898, p-value <0.0001). A total of 54 (15 %) adult patients had surgery, in comparison to 50 % of pediatric patients with diagnosis of nasal fracture. 202 (57 %) of patients did not follow up after initial diagnosis by radiology.

Conclusion

The statistical analysis suggests that while CT and X-ray are frequently obtained in the setting of nasal fracture, patients without imaging are more likely to have surgery (p < 0.05) than patients with imaging. This indicates that imaging is likely unnecessary for surgical planning. Most adults do not pursue surgery, and surgical rates for adults with nasal fracture are much lower than those of pediatric patients with nasal fracture.

### Nasal bone fractures and the use of radiographic imaging: an otolaryngologist perspective [^0090aad7]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine radiologic preferences of practicing otolaryngologists regarding isolated nasal bone fractures.

Study Design

An 8-question survey on isolated nasal bone fractures was designed.

Setting

Surveys were sent to all otolaryngology residency program directors for distribution among residents and faculty. Additional surveys were distributed to private practice otolaryngology groups.

Results

140 physicians responded to the survey. 57% of the respondents were practicing otolaryngologists (75% with 10+ years of experience), while 43% of respondents were residents-in-training. 56% of respondents treated 1-5 nasal bone fractures per month. 80% of all respondents reported imaging being performed prior to consultation. If imaging was obtained before consultation, plain films and computed tomography (CT) maxillofacial/sinus scans were the most frequent modalities. 33% of residents and 70% of practicing otolaryngologists report imaging as 'rarely' or 'never' helpful in guiding management. 42% of residents and 20% of practicing otolaryngologists report asking for imaging when it wasn't already obtained. Decreased use of radiography was associated with greater years in practice and higher frequency of fractures treated.

Conclusions and Relevance

Otolaryngologists seldom request imaging to evaluate and treat isolated nasal bone fractures. When ordered, imaging is utilized more often among residents-in-training and non-otolaryngology consulting physicians. This study highlights an opportunity to educate primary care and emergency room providers as well as otolaryngology residents on the value of comprehensive physical exam over radiographic imaging in the work-up of isolated nasal fractures. In addition, widespread adoption of a "no x-ray policy" in this setting may result in better resource utilization.

### To X-ray or not to X-ray? Discussing unknown nasal foreign bodies and button batteries [^07c1790b]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The emergency of esophageal button batteries is recognized. Foreign bodies in the ear or nose are treated as comparatively nonemergent. We present the case of a child who presented with suspected pen-nib in the nostril to highlight the importance of investigation and intervention in unwitnessed nasal foreign body and review the literature regarding X-rays in these cases. Fifteen papers were identified as per search parameters; 3 papers recommend the use of plain radiographs for nasal foreign bodies. We propose that in unwitnessed pediatric nasal foreign body insertion, a facial X-ray should be considered, especially if suspecting a metallic foreign body.

### Management of acute nasal fractures [^1a27a8d6]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

In cases of facial trauma, nasal fractures account for approximately 40 percent of bone injuries. Treatment in the primary care setting begins with evaluating the injury, taking an accurate history of the situation in which the injury occurred, and ascertaining how the face and nose appeared and functioned before the injury occurred. Serious injuries should be treated, then nasal inspection and palpation may be performed to assess for airway patency, mucosal laceration, and septal deformity. A thorough examination of the nose and surrounding structures, including the orbits, mandible, and cervical spine, should be completed. Imaging studies are necessary for facial or mandibular fractures. Patients with septal hematomas, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, malocclusion, or extraocular movement defects should be referred to a subspecialist. Treatment in the primary care setting consists of evaluation, pain and infection management, minimal debridement and, when the physician is appropriately trained, closed reduction. If an immediate referral is not indicated, close follow-up, possibly with a subspecialist, should be arranged within three to five days after the injury.

### A preliminary study of the use of ultrasound in defining nasal fractures: criteria for a confident diagnosis [^a4d5b968]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Nasal fractures are usually diagnosed by clinical examination, with or without the support of imaging studies. While plain-film radiography lacks sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing nasal fractures, and computed tomography (CT) is not always practical or cost-effective, ultrasonography (US) may be useful in this regard. The criteria by which adult nasal fractures are reliably identified on US must be clear. We conducted a preliminary prospective, controlled, observational study to define the appearance of nasal fractures on US. We used US to image 12 patients with a clinical or radiologic (CT or x-ray) diagnosis of nasal fracture. All patients presented within 2 weeks of their injury. For comparison purposes, we also obtained US images from 12 control subjects who had no history of nasal trauma or surgery. We found that we could confidently diagnose nasal fractures on lateral-view US on the basis of a disruption of bone continuity and/or displacement of fracture segments. However, our findings were not as consistent with dorsal-view US, and we do not believe it is adequate for diagnosis. We conclude that lateral US can be used to detect nasal fractures in adults, but further studies are needed to assess its sensitivity, specificity, cost-effectiveness, and practicality.

### Comparative evaluation of ultrasonography and lateral radiography in nasal fractures diagnosis [^07c41ebd]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Nasal fractures are the most common type of trauma fracture. Conventional radiography is the primary method of choice. Ultrasonography is used as a new and non-invasive method for this purpose. The aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic values of ultrasonography with nasal X-ray.

Methods

This was a prospective study which was conducted during 2018-2019 at Bouali hospital, Sari, northern Iran. 130 patients who met our criteria enrolled our study. All patients underwent nasal X-ray and ultrasonography on a day of trauma. The physical examination during the reduction in operation room considered as gold standard for nasal bone fracture. The sensitivity, specificity, precision, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values, along with 95% confidence intervals, were determined by SPSS.

Results

The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, and precision of nasal X-ray were all reported to be 100% when compared to physical examination (the gold standard). Ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 78.13%, a specificity of 100%, a PPV of 100%, an NPV of 61.82%, and a precision of 83.85% in comparison to physical examination (the gold standard).

Conclusion

The findings of this study suggest that ultrasonography can be utilized as a main diagnostic tool in the identification of nasal bone fractures in the vast majority of cases, avoiding the unwanted dangers and problems of X-rays. This is especially critical for expecting mothers and children.

### Management of nasal fractures [^88f8ad69]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The goal of treatment for nasal fractures is to restore the pretraumatic state and normal function. The decision by the surgeon regarding the surgical approach should be based on the degree of injury, the presence of concomitant facial injuries, patient compliance, training of the surgeon, and the presence and degree of septal injury. The use of a closed or open approach will then depend on the extent of the injury.

Appropriate medical care for a patient with a facial fracture can not only optimize aesthetic outcomes but also prevent the potential morbidity and mortality of delayed treatment. In this article, we focus on the clinical presentations, physical examination findings, diagnostic imaging, consultations, and follow-up that patients with facial fractures need related to their emergency department management. Specifically, we address the nuances of evaluating frontal, orbital, nasal, maxillofacial, and mandibular fractures.

### Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric nasal fractures [^0441b011]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

During the pre-pandemic period, interventions for patients with nasal fractures were performed at an average of 5 days from injury; during the pandemic period of our study, an average 6 days was calculated. When the 2 groups were compared in terms of nasal fracture intervention time, it was seen that the intervention time was statistically significant later during the pandemic period (P <.001). Since the recommended optimal intervention time is between 3 and 5 days, our intervention time seems appropriate during the pre- and post-pandemic periods. However, we observed the difference between the 2 periods as statistically different. Delayed hospital admission of children due to the pandemic, waiting for the results of the COVID-19 diagnostic test for intervention, and the reluctance of doctors to intervene because nasal fracture reduction procedures contain aerosols may be the main causes of this delay in pandemic period. We preferred the closed reduction approach for our patients in both periods. The general approach to the isolated nasal bone fractures was closed reduction to maintain the optimal appearance and function of the nose. While fracture replacement is a simple procedure, the postoperative results of the surgical procedure may not be satisfactory. Conservative treatment modality can be preferable in cases where there are no external or functional problems due to the linear fractures, where there is lesser displacement of the fracture particles, or in accordance with the preference of a patient’s parent. The parents of children with nasal bone fractures frequently prefer non-surgical procedures. Therefore, conservative treatment is preferred in children with slight nasal bone fractures without prominent displacement of the fracture fragments. Computed tomography is superior to X-ray imaging in monitoring the recovery processes of children with nasal bone fractures whose parents prefer a conservative treatment approach. X-ray imaging may not provide an exact examination of pediatric nasal bone fractures during the recovery period because nasal fractures that have not completely ossified may be inadequately determined.

### Facial trauma affects the radiological diagnosis of nasal bone fractures [^b32d1251]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Timely and accurate diagnosis of nasal bone fractures (NBFs) is crucial for preserving the cosmetic and functional aspects of the nose. This study aims to identify factors influencing radiographic and computed tomography (CT) diagnosis of NBF in patients with nasal trauma.

Methods

Two hundred six patients with acute nasal trauma underwent both conventional radiography and facial bone CT. An experienced otorhinolaryngologist independently interpreted images. Results were categorized into "Concordance" or "Discrepancy" groups, with demographic and clinical data compared.

Results

The study classified 167 patients into "Concordance" and 39 into "Discrepancy" groups based on radiography and CT interpretations. The "discrepancy group" showed higher rates of previous nasal bone fractures (P=0.044), rhinoplasty history (P=0.044), and concomitant facial bone fractures (P=0.001). Adjusted odds ratios revealed significant associations between discrepancies and a history of nasal bone fracture (OR=5.197, 95% CI 1.165-23.171), rhinoplasty (OR=6.114, 95% CI 1.393-26.847), and concomitant facial bone fractures (OR=3.765, 95% CI 1.663-8.523).

Conclusion

This study highlights the impact of facial trauma, including rhinoplasty, on the radiological diagnosis of NBF. Consequently, in the presence of signs of concurrent facial trauma, previous nasal trauma, or rhinoplasty history, a prompt CT scan and comprehensive evaluation are recommended for accurate diagnosis and timely treatment, ultimately improving the patient's prognosis.

### Nasal packs with X-ray indicators [^238bdc4e]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Nasal packing is routinely performed by many surgeons following nasal surgery and is also frequently used for the treatment of epistaxis. The use of nasal packing, however, is sometimes associated with serious complications such as aspiration, bowel perforation, obstructive apnea, and hypoxia. This author has also once had the experience of losing a nasal pack during a procedure performed on a mentally impaired patient. If a nasal pack could be easily tracked by x-ray, treatment would be faster and easier. We now use x-ray indicators quilted into our nasal packs, which enable us to find the packs quickly and easily with plain x-ray film.

### Diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric nasal bone fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f45be15a]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric nasal bone fractures are highly prevalent, constituting 40–50% of facial fractures in children. The untreated consequences of these fractures can lead to both cosmetic and functional impairments, underscoring the critical need for accurate and timely diagnosis.

While physical examination is widely acknowledged as the gold standard for diagnosing nasal fractures, challenges arise when significant post-traumatic swelling occurs, hindering the prompt identification of deformities, especially in younger age patients who have higher amount of cartilage in nasal structures,. Furthermore, the subjective nature of physical examination necessitates the exploration of supplementary objective imaging techniques, particularly for comprehensive documentation, often for legal purposes. This requirement is accentuated in pediatric cases, where the inherent challenges of patient non-compliance further complicate the efficacy of physical examinations. Traditional imaging methods, including X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans, present limitations in sensitivity, specificity, and concerns about radiation exposure. In this context, ultrasonography emerges as a promising method for evaluating pediatric nasal bone fractures. This imaging modality can detect skeletal deformation along three axes without radiation exposure. Its cost-effectiveness, especially in resource-limited settings, and the improved quality of results due to the absence of an air gap between the transducer and bones make it a valuable diagnostic tool. Furthermore, owing to the portability of ultrasound devices, their utility extends beyond hospital environments, proving invaluable in situations involving multiple trauma patients. This advantage enables swift assessment and diagnosis without the constraints associated with bulkier imaging modalities.

Prior research has investigated the effectiveness of ultrasound in the diagnosis of nasal bone fractures, yielding promising outcomes. However, the literature on its application in detecting nasal bone fractures in the pediatric population is limited. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the diagnostic utility of ultrasound for nasal bone fractures, examining its sensitivity, specificity, and other diagnostic accuracy measures in the pediatric population.

Quality assessment

The quality assessment of the included studies is detailed in Table 2. These studies primarily exhibited bias related to the reference standard test, which stemmed from the use of physical examination, an inherently subjective method reliant on the examiner’s expertise. Furthermore, two studies in the review did not clearly specify sonographic criteria for diagnosing nasal fractures. Additionally, one study exclusively employed CT scans as a reference test for patients with suspected nasal fractures in ultrasound results, rather than uniformly applying it to all patients. In summary, the review suggests a moderate overall quality of the included studies.

### Diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric nasal bone fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^43de09c5]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study highlighted the utility of ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool for pediatric nasal bone fractures, particularly due to its high accuracy and specificity. Following the exclusion of an outlier study, the analysis also revealed a notable level of sensitivity for this modality in this context. However, the suboptimal overall diagnostic performance of ultrasound, as indicated by likelihood ratios, underscores the importance of exercising caution in relying solely on ultrasound and highlights the necessity for additional diagnostic methods and further refinement in clinical practice. Researchers are encouraged to conduct additional large-scale studies to improve the generalizability of findings. Specifically, they should investigate the impact of potential factors on the diagnostic performance of ultrasound in this area, contributing more robust evidence to the field.

### Management of nasal bone fractures [^91cc608f]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2005). Low credibility.

This review discusses treatment options for nasal fracture, a common condition due mainly to road accidents, sport injuries, and physical confrontations. Being frequently associated with multiple trauma, many broken noses are not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to secondary nasal deformities and chronic obstructions. A description of nasal anatomy is followed by considerations on the pathogenesis of nasal fracture and its clinical assessment. Each patient's history must be recorded (cause of trauma, previous facial injuries, prior nasal deformity, or obstruction) and careful physical examination guides the choice of treatment (open vs closed reduction), its timing, and the type of anesthesia required. Adequate follow-up is essential. Manipulation under local anesthesia is an effective first-line treatment for simple nasal fractures and should become a standard practice, but any associated septal injury can be responsible for postoperative nasal deformity and obstruction so other options may need to be considered.

### Correction of nasal fractures [^764fe843]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Nasal fractures are the most frequently fractured facial bone from blunt facial trauma resulting in a significant number of patients seeking treatment. Proper evaluation and treatment in the acute setting can minimize secondary surgeries, lower overall health care costs, and increase patient satisfaction. Nasal fracture management, however, varies widely between surgeons. The open treatment of isolated nasal fractures is a particularly controversial subject. This review seeks to describe the existing literature in isolated nasal fracture management.

### A new approach to the treatment of nasal bone fracture: radiologic classification of nasal bone fractures and its clinical application [^79fecdcf]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

A radiologic examination is required in the treatment of nasal bone fracture to determine the fracture condition. Thus, there is an increasing need for radiologic classification of nasal bone fractures that can be applied to clinical practice.

Materials and Methods

Computed tomography was performed in 125 patients with nasal bone fractures to determine which axial view best showed the entire nasal view. The obtained axial view was then used as a reference for classification. The length from the top to the base of the nasal bone was divided into upper, middle, and lower levels, after which the fracture location was determined. If the fracture spanned the boundaries of these levels, it was classified as the total level. Subsequently, the fracture was subclassified based on the fracture direction and pattern and the concurrent fracture.

Results

Radiologic examination of patients with nasal bone fracture showed that nasal bone fracture was frequently found at the total, middle, upper, and lower levels, in that order. Nasal bone fractures at the upper level showed lower frequencies of complication and reoperation than the fractures at the other levels, whereas nasal bone fractures at the total level showed the highest frequencies of complication and reoperation.

Conclusion

Radiologic classification can be useful for preoperative and postoperative evaluations of nasal bone fractures and can be helpful in understanding such fractures because it can efficiently predict the prognosis of a fracture.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^c6e652f2]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR)—imaging: Clinicians should not routinely perform sinonasal imaging in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of AR; this is a recommendation against based on observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile identifies aggregate evidence quality as Grade C, based on observational studies, the level of confidence in evidence as high, and the policy level as recommendation. Benefits include avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure, reduction of cost, and reducing variation in care, while risks include inaccurate or missed diagnosis of pathology with similar presenting symptoms; the benefit–harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness is noted because the word routine was used to allow for circumstances where the patient history may warrant imaging for evaluation of another problem besides AR. Supporting text states there are no radiological findings specifically diagnostic for AR, that radiographic imaging is unwarranted in patients who already meet clinical criteria for the diagnosis of AR, and that plain film radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans expose patients to ionizing radiation which may result in future radiation-induced cancers; iodinated contrast carries the risk of allergic anaphylactic reactions and nephrotoxicity.

### Analysis of nasal bone fractures ; a six-year study of 503 patients [^3e94aa7c]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to classify the nasal bone fractures based on computed tomography (CT) analysis and patterns of the nasal bone fractures, and review 503 cases treated between 1998-2004 at the Department of Plastic Surgery, Inha University Hospital, Incheon, South Korea. The age, sex, etiology, associated injuries, pattern of fractures and treatments were reviewed and a radiographic study was analyzed. Plain simple radiographs of lateral and Waters view of the nasal bones combined with computed tomography scans were done. Nasal bone fractures were classified into six types: Type I) Simple without displacement; Type II) Simple with displacement/without telescoping; IIA; Unilateral; IIAs) Unilateral with septal fracture; IIB) Bilateral; IIBs) Bilateral with septal fracture; Type III) Comminuted with telescoping or depression. Diagnosis of nasal bone fractures were made positively by plain x-ray films in 82% of cases, negative finding was 9.5% and 8.5% of cases were suspicious of the fractures. Reliability of the plain film radiographs of the nasal bone fracture was 82% in this study. In the most of the fractured nasal bones (93%) the closed reduction was done, open reduction in 4% and no surgical intervention in 3%. Nasal reduction was carried out in average 6.5 days post the injury. The patterns of the nasal bones fractures classified by CT findings were type IIA (182 cases, 36%), IIBs (105 cases, 21%), IIB (90 cases, 18%), IIAs (66 cases, 13%), I (39 cases, 8%) and III (21 cases, 4.3%). We think the CT is necessary for diagnosing nasal bone fracture because the reliability of the plain film was only 82%.

### Conductor-assisted nasal sonography: an innovative technique for rapid and accurate detection of nasal bone fracture [^ec9ee54f]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Nasal bone is frequently involved in craniofacial trauma. We sought to investigate the role of conductor-assisted nasal sonography (CANS) in patients with nasal trauma.

Methods

In all, 71 patients sustaining midfacial trauma who underwent CANS examination with simultaneous facial computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of nasal bone fracture identified by CANS and other plain films versus nasal bone fracture evidenced by CT scan, taken as the gold standard, were measured.

Results

Of these patients (52 males and 19 females; mean age, 40 years ± 19.8 years), 52 of 71 were diagnosed with nasal fractures by facial CT scans. No demographic difference was found in fracture and nonfracture groups. In addition to nasal sonography and facial CT scan, 23 patients also received nasal X-ray examination, 17 experienced skull X-rays, and 12 underwent Waters' view survey. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of nasal X-ray were 89%, 25%, 85%, and 33%, respectively. The skull X-ray showed a poor sensitivity of 50%, with 100% specificity, 100% PPV, and 30% NPV. The Waters' view survey gave the worst sensitivity of 13% and a high specificity of 100%, with a PPV of 100% and a NPV of 36%. CANS proved to be the most reliable in detection of nasal fracture, with 100% sensitivity and 89% specificity, 96% PPV, and 100% NPV.

Conclusions

CANS technique could detect nasal bone fracture more accurately compared with conventional methods. We recommend it as a new standard of diagnostic tool for nasal fracture.

### Diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric nasal bone fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b9adfc31]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review adheres to the guidelines established in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The literature search, initiated on December 5, 2023, spanned four major databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase. Distinct search terms tailored for each database included (“nasal” OR “midfacial”) AND (“fracture*”) AND (“sonograph*” OR “ultrasonograph*” OR “ultrasound” OR “POCUS”) AND (“pediatric*” OR “paediatric*” OR “child*” OR “neonat*” OR “infant*” OR “toddler*” OR “preschool” OR “pre-school” OR “juvenile” OR “young adult*”). Additionally, a meticulous manual examination of references within the selected studies ensured comprehensive coverage. The review process involved a thorough evaluation of each article’s title, abstract, and/or full text, conducted independently by two co-authors. Uncertainties or ambiguities were addressed through consultation with a senior co-author. Deduplication, screening, and data extraction were facilitated by the AutoLit platform, developed by Nested Knowledge in St. Paul, Minnesota, USA.

All studies relevant to the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound in pediatric patients (under 21 years old) were considered for inclusion if they presented at least one of the following diagnostic measures: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), likelihood ratio (LR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). No restrictions were imposed on publication date, country of origin, patient characteristics, reference standard type, or study design. Non-English literature, case reports, case series with fewer than five eligible patients, conference abstracts, editorial comments, and review articles were excluded from the study.

Details extracted from each qualifying paper included the first author’s name, publication year, study design, sample size, participant and fracture characteristics, reference standard modality, ultrasound operator, type of ultrasound device, type of ultrasound probe, image acquisition methods, ultrasound features indicating nasal bone fractures, and diagnostic accuracy measures of ultrasound.

### SLC10A7 mutations cause a skeletal dysplasia with amelogenesis imperfecta mediated by GAG biosynthesis defects [^1f5b1fe2]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Slc10a7 deficiency causes skeletal dysplasia in mice

In order to decipher the impact of Slc10a7 deficiency on bone development in vivo, a Slc10a7 -deficient mouse strain was generated using embryonic stem (ES) cell lines from European Mouse Mutant Cell Repository (EuMMCR) in which a lacZ/ neo cassette was inserted into intron 1 of Slc10a7 gene: the resulting heterozygous mice (Slc10a7 +/−) were intercrossed to obtain homozygous mice (Slc10a7 −/−). At birth, Slc10a7 −/− mice were smaller, displaying significantly reduced body weight (1.121 g ± 0.02188 [Slc10a7 −/−] vs. (1.297 g ± 0.03913 [Slc10a7 +/+]), reduced naso-occipital length and a more rounded head (as observed with X-ray imaging) compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 3a). Morphometric measurements indicated that the stylopod (femur and humerus) and zeugopod (tibia and radius) were more affected than the autopod (hindfoot and forefoot) (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Although Slc10a7 −/− hindfeet were smaller, the proportion of ossified tissue, visualized using alizarin red staining, was greater in the tarsals, metatarsals and phalanges of Slc10a7 −/− mice compared with wild-type littermates, suggesting advanced ossification (Supplementary Fig. 4c). The growth delay of Slc10a7 −/− mice continued after birth and at 8 weeks they were smaller than their wild-type littermates (Fig. 3b, c). However, the differences in size reduction between the stylopod/zeugopod and autopod of the Slc10a7 −/− mice was less pronounced than at birth (Supplementary Fig. 4b). No obvious large joint dislocations were visible on the x-rays of Slc10a7 −/− mice at birth or at 8 weeks of age. Skull morphology alterations at 8 weeks was analysed by micro-computed tomography (μCT) analyses. The length and width and the overall elongation (determined from the length/width ratio) of the Slc10a7 −/− skulls was reduced compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 3d). More precise measurements demonstrated that mostly nasal bone, frontal bone and occipital bone lengths were reduced, while parietal bone length was less reduced and interparietal bone length was not affected in Slc10a7 −/− skulls. Furthermore, only parietal bone and occipital bone widths were slightly smaller in Slc10a7 −/− skulls compared to wild-type skulls (Supplementary Fig. 5a). This affected the mandible morphology as the angle formed by the two hemi-mandibles was significantly increased in Slc10a7 −/− mice compared with wild-type littermates (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Out of six analysed Slc10a7 −/− mice, two presented with a deviated nasal bone (Supplementary Fig. 5c) and one with a shortened nasal bone, whereas no nasal bone abnormalities were observed in Slc10a7 +/− and Slc10a7 +/+ mice, suggesting an incomplete penetrance for that phenotype. No significant differences were observed in any morphometric measurements performed comparing Slc10a7 +/− and Slc10a7 +/+ mice.

### Overcorrection of nasal bone fracture reduction can Be minimized by packing removal [^285178cc]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We experienced 16 cases of overcorrection among 524 cases of packing following nasal bone fracture (NBF) reduction. In these cases, the packing was removed immediately.From July 2017 to October 2020, 535 cases of NBF were reduced by closed reduction. Nasal packing was applied in 524 cases (97.9%). In all cases, postoperative X-rays (both nasal bone lateral view and Water's view) were taken. The degree of overcorrection was measured in the nasal bone lateral views.Among the 524 patients who underwent nasal packing, overcorrection was noted in 16 cases (3.1%). The average degree of overcorrection was 2.09±0.70mm. In these patients, the packing was removed immediately and X-rays were taken directly after packing removal. The degree of overcorrection decreased; however, no significant difference was found (1.83±0.71mm, P  = 0.081, [paired t test]).In this study, overcorrection was noted in 3.1% of patients in whom nasal packing was applied. After packing removal, the degree of overcorrection decreased but was not significant. Postoperative X-rays should be taken after reduction of NBF and nasal packing, and if overcorrection is noticed, the packing should be removed immediately.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^7fb29f12]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Statement 1b—Radiologic imaging and acute rhinosinusitis (ARS)—states that clinicians should not obtain radiologic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for acute rhinosinusitis unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected. The recommendation is against imaging based on diagnostic studies with minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm for not obtaining imaging. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B with diagnostic studies with minor limitations, and the Level of Confidence in Evidence is High. Benefits include avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure, delays from obtaining and interpreting imaging studies, financial costs, and incidental findings that may prompt additional imaging; risks include delayed diagnosis of a serious underlying condition. The benefits-harm assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit over harm, and value judgments emphasize the importance of avoiding unnecessary radiation and cost in diagnosing acute rhinosinusitis.

(Rec, C).” For soft tissue detail and complications, “Summary Statement 6: Perform MRI if soft tissue resolution is required, such as with a suspected tumor or in patients with complications. If a CT scan depicts a soft tissue mass, the patient should then be referred to an ear, nose, and throat physician. (Rec, B).” Additionally, “The diagnosis of ABRS is generally made based on history and physical examination,” and imaging is useful “when acute complications are suspected, the response to initial management is poor, or when the diagnosis is in question.”

### Diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric nasal bone fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4f08e538]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the current study, the pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios suggest that ultrasound’s overall diagnostic performance is approximately moderate but falls short of an ideal level. These findings emphasize the importance of exercising caution when solely relying on ultrasound for definitive diagnostic decisions in pediatric nasal bone fractures. There is potential value in supplementing ultrasound with other imaging modalities or diagnostic approaches. This also emphasizes the need for additional research and refinement to improve diagnostic accuracy and reliability of ultrasound in this context.

In our analysis, the study conducted by Dogan et al. emerged as an outlier, leading to an 11.8% reduction in the pooled sensitivity in our findings. Their study reported a sensitivity of 22.5% and a specificity of 83.1%. They attributed the low sensitivity to the younger age and higher number of their patients. Additionally, the determination of the presence of a fracture relied on a physical examination by an emergency physician specialist, while the sonography was performed by a radiologist. The clarity of whether the radiologists were aware of the diagnosis during the sonography was not provided. Furthermore, their study exclusively included patients with isolated nasal fractures who did not meet the criteria for a CT scan. It is worth mentioning that in two other included studies, the diagnosis was established through the physical examination by an otolaryngologist. Tamada et al. on the other hand, considered serial physical examinations by emergency physicians or general pediatric registrars as the ground truth. Additionally, they followed patients with a negative physical examination for nasal fracture a few days after the initial visit. If symptoms persisted, a second ultrasonography was conducted, confirming a nasal fracture in four more patients and raising the sensitivity to 91.7%. However, we included only the initial results to align with the approach taken in other included studies.

### Ability of bedside ultrasonography to detect pediatric nasal bone fractures [^1457b03d]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

The aims of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic test features of bedside ultrasonography in pediatric patients with nasal trauma and to investigate whether it is a preferable alternative method to conventional radiography (CR).

Study Design

Cross-sectional prospective study.

Methods

This prospective study was conducted from March 1, 2019, through November 1, 2019. Thirty-one patients under the age of 18years who had nasal trauma were consecutively included. CR and ultrasonographic imaging tests were investigated in patients with clinical indications for nasal bone fracture. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ultrasonography and CR were calculated with respect to detecting nasal fractures according to the gold standard method.

Results

Participants were between 3 and 16years old and the median age was 8 (5-13) years. Nasal bone fracture was clinically detected in 18 patients. While 13 of these fractures were detected with ultrasonography, only 11 were also detected with CR. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography and CR in detecting nasal fractures were 72.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 46.5-90.3) and 76.9% (95% CI: 46.2-95.0) for ultrasonography and 61.1% (95% CI: 35.8-82.7) and 69.2% (95% CI: 38.6-90.9) for CR.

Conclusions

According to the results of this study, ultrasonography may be used with confidence as a first imaging method in the investigation of nasal fractures, particularly with consideration for avoiding the effects of radiation as much as possible. Our findings point to the next step of conducting trials with a greater number of patients in order to define the diagnostic test features of ultrasonography in pediatric patients.

### The role of ultrasound in the diagnosis of pediatric nasal fractures [^1ed2728d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Nasal fractures are the most commonly encountered facial fracture in children presenting to emergency departments. Though plain radiographs have long been used to aid the diagnosis of fractures, its limited diagnostic accuracy has led to the increasing use of ultrasound. Ultrasound offers a cheap, safe, and readily available imaging modality. Evidence in the adult population has shown ultrasound to be far more accurate in identifying nasal fractures. The efficacy of ultrasound in the pediatric setting though remains uncertain.

Methods

A systematic review of the Pubmed and EmBase databases was undertaken. The search terms (nose OR nasal) AND (fracture) AND (ultrasound OR ultrasonography OR sonography) and associated MeSH terms were searched. The search was limited to those <18 years of age.

Results

Following review and exclusion, 3 papers met the inclusion criteria. All 3 studies showed ultrasound was able to detect nasal fractures in children. Two studies showed that ultrasound diagnosed fractures with a greater accuracy than plain radiographs. One study used ultrasound alone and reported a sensitivity of 75% and specificity as 92.3%.

Conclusion

With the limited evidence to date in the pediatric population, ultrasound appears to offer a more accurate radiological investigation in nasal fractures. It could be considered diagnostically superior to plain radiographs and reduces radiation exposure in children. Further work is required to better determine its true utility and improve its diagnostic accuracy.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® imaging of facial trauma following primary survey [^c420be89]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Maxillofacial trauma patients comprise a significant subset of patients presenting to emergency departments. Before evaluating for facial trauma, an emergency or trauma physician must perform a primary survey to ensure patient stabilization. Following this primary survey, this document discusses the following clinical scenarios for facial trauma: tenderness to palpation or contusion or edema over frontal bone (suspected frontal bone injury); pain with upper jaw manipulation or pain overlying zygoma or zygomatic deformity or facial elongation or malocclusion or infraorbital nerve paresthesia (suspected midface injury); visible nasal deformity or palpable nasal deformity or tenderness to palpation of the nose or epistaxis (suspected nasal bone injury); and trismus or malocclusion or gingival hemorrhage or mucosal hemorrhage or loose teeth or fractured teeth or displaced teeth (suspected mandibular injury). The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Guideline statement categories—definitions and implications specify how to act on recommendations: A strong recommendation means that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and that the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent; clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. A recommendation means that the benefits exceed the harms but that the quality of evidence is not as strong; clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. An option means either that the quality of evidence that exists is suspect or that well-done studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another; clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, may set bounds on alternatives, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric nasal bone fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^dcab34a0]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ultrasonography, a radiation-free and cost-effective modality, stands out as a promising tool for evaluating nasal bone fractures. Despite limited literature on its pediatric application, there is an increasing recognition of its potential to enhance diagnostic precision. To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasound in detecting pediatric nasal bone fractures. Employing established guidelines, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted through a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases until December 5, 2023. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies reporting diagnostic accuracy measures of ultrasound in pediatric patients with nasal bone fractures. Data extraction and analysis were undertaken for the selected studies. Involving four studies with 277 patients, ultrasound demonstrated a pooled sensitivity of 66.1% (95% CI: 35.1-87.5%) and specificity of 86.8% (95% CI: 80.1-91.4%) in diagnosing pediatric nasal fractures. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.72–0.93). After excluding an outlier study, sensitivity and specificity increased to 78.0% (95% CI: 65.6-86.9%) and 87.8 (95% CI: 78.1-93.6%), respectively, with an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.75–0.94). Pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios were 5.11 (95% CI: 2.12–9.15) and 0.40 (95% CI: 0.14–0.77) before exclusion and 6.75 (95% CI: 3.47–12.30) and 0.26 (95% CI: 0.15–0.40) after exclusion of an outlier study, respectively. This study highlighted ultrasonography’s utility in diagnosing pediatric nasal bone fractures with high accuracy and specificity. However, caution is advised in relying solely on ultrasound due to suboptimal overall diagnostic performance, evident in likelihood ratios.

### Facial fractures: classification and highlights for a useful report [^33465c87]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Nasal bone

The superficial location of the nose and the relative thinness of the nasal bones mean that nasal bone fractures are the most common injuries to the facial skeleton. The two nasal bones articulate with the frontal bone at the frontonasal suture and with the frontal process of the maxilla at the nasomaxillary suture, forming the bony nasal pyramid. It can be easy to miss subtle fractures of the pyramidal bone, anterior nasal spine, and bony septal fractures. If any of these injuries are detected, the septal cartilage must be examined with a speculum.When fracture the nasal cartilage, they can disrupt the perichondrium, causing a septal hematoma, which can lead to various complications such as impairment of nasal airflow, abscess formation, and necrosis that can even perforate the septum.

Nasal bone fractures are classified according to the anatomic plane involved. Type 1 fractures affect only the region below the plane that extends from the caudal tip of the nose to the anterior nasal spine; the nasal septum is unaffected in these fractures. By contrast, in type 2 fractures, both the septum and the anterior nasal spine are involved (Fig. 16). Finally, type 3 fractures involve the bones that surround the orbit and sometimes intracranial structures in addition to the nasal bone and septum.

Fig. 16 
Nasal bone fracture. Axial unenhanced CT image shows nondisplaced nasal bone fractures extending to the anterior bone septum (arrow)

In low-force impacts, trauma often causes isolated fracture of the nasal bones. However, because the nasal bones are located close to the ethmoid sinuses and the medial orbital walls, high-force impacts can also cause injury to the underlying ethmoid sinuses and orbit. The close physical and functional relationships among the bony structures in this area have led some authors to recommend that the nasal-orbital-ethmoid region be considered a single unit in cases of high-impact trauma. Other authors stress the importance of separating simple nasal fractures from more serious naso-orbito-ethmoid fractures that extend into the nose through the ethmoid bones.

### Nasal bone assessment in prenatal screening for trisomy 21 [^681be8e6]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

A small nose is a common facial feature of individuals with trisomy 21. Evidence based on radiologic, histomorphologic, and sonographic studies shows that nasal bone abnormalities are significantly more common in trisomy 21 fetuses than in euploid fetuses. These abnormalities, which include both nasal bone absence and short nasal bone length, can be detected by prenatal ultrasound. In this article we review the evidence and discuss the potential value of assessment of the fetal nasal bone in screening for trisomy 21.

### Perfecting the outcome of nasal bone fracture in the pediatric population with a navigation system [^e5fc297d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The trend of using navigation systems for treating facial bone fractures is increasing. Nevertheless, any detailed recommendation on using a navigation system to treat nasal bone fracture has never been discussed. Plastic surgeons are prone to do closed reduction of nasal bone fractures with remnant posttraumatic edema in the pediatric population. This study hypothesized that the navigation system benefits this population's treatment of nasal bone fractures.

Methods

The authors evaluated the medical records, plain x-ray, and facial computed tomography scans of 44 pediatric patients (below the age of 18) with nasal bone fractures treated with a closed reduction from May 2021 to December 2022. Preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scan were used to assess the outcome.

Results

The average age for 44 pediatric nasal bone fracture patients was 10. Fifteen were female, while males were 29. All cases were successfully corrected clinically and radiologically without noticeable complications.

Conclusions

Using navigation systems to correct nasal bone fractures provides additional benefits for the pediatric population. This technique is especially useful if the fracture is located at the junction between the nasal bone and nasal process of the maxilla and is combined with concurrent old nasal bone fractures.

### Comparison of the diagnosis and treatment of nasal bone fracture by physicians in China with different levels of experience [^744307a0]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to investigate the conflicts in the diagnosis and treatment of nasal bone fracture by Chinese otolaryngologists to improve the diagnosis and treatment accuracy of junior otolaryngologists and emergency physicians.

Methods

A questionnaire was designed and filled out by otolaryngologists in large general hospitals. The questions included how to choose an auxiliary examination to diagnose nasal bone fracture, whether tamponade is required after closed reduction, the selection of packing materials, the timing of an operation, and the evaluation of postoperative effect. The questionnaire results were divided into 3 groups according to the experience levels of experienced of physicians.

Results

A total of 151 otolaryngologists with different levels of experience from 26 provinces in China completed the questionnaire. 90.73% of physicians thought that nasal bone computed tomography was the most important auxiliary examination to diagnose a nasal bone fracture. 52.32% of them compared photos before and after the operation to evaluate postoperative effects. About 53% of physicians thought that 7 to 10 days after reducing local swelling is the optimal time for closed reduction.

Conclusions

There is no obvious difference in the diagnosis and treatment of nasal bone fracture among otolaryngologists with different levels of experience in Chinese otolaryngologists with different levels. Most physicians choose nasal bone computed tomography for diagnosis, perform surgery at 7 to 10 days after injury, and compare photos from before and after the operation to evaluate the postoperative effect.

### Diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric nasal bone fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ca04a319]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, ultrasonography exhibited a significant level of diagnostic accuracy in identifying nasal bone fractures in children. Importantly, even with the inclusion of more homogeneous studies, this finding remained consistent, as evidenced by a minimal difference of approximately 0.10 in the AUC. The analysis revealed that the pooled specificity of ultrasonography was significantly higher than its pooled sensitivity, both across the four included studies and even after excluding one outlier study. However, the test overall performance, as indicated by likelihood ratios, was observed to be low to moderate for both exclusion and confirmation purposes.

A meta-analysis involving 1480 patients, with no age restrictions, revealed that ultrasonography achieved a pooled sensitivity of 87.2% and specificity of 87.4% in diagnosing nasal bone fractures. The study suggests that ultrasonography surpasses plain radiography in sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. Moreover, CT scans showed only marginally higher performance indices compared to ultrasonography, except for specificity. This implies that, overall, the diagnostic accuracy for nasal bone fractures appears comparable between these studied imaging techniques. In a separate meta-analysis centered on facial bone fractures, utilizing CT scans as the reference standard and with no age restrictions, ultrasonography exhibited remarkable sensitivity and specificity rates of 99% and 94%, respectively, in diagnosing nasal bone fractures. These results emphasize the strong diagnostic capabilities of ultrasonography for nasal bone fractures compared to CT scans.

Our findings indicated a lower pooled sensitivity compared to the two meta-analyses mentioned earlier. It is important to acknowledge that ultrasonography encounters inherent limitations in assessing bones during childhood. Nasal bones in younger children are less prominent and not fully ossified. The ongoing process of ossification results in anatomical variations during different stages of childhood, potentially contributing to the increased difficulty of utilizing ultrasonography for fracture detection. Additionally, a study involving 423 patients with nasal bone fractures revealed significant differences in the most prevalent fracture types between children under 12 years old and adults. In this study, Yabe et al. observed that the most common type of nasal bone fracture in children was unilateral bone displacement without posterior shift, whereas bilateral displacement was more prevalent in older patients. Moreover, the diagnosis of nasal bone fractures in children presents greater challenges due to factors such as smaller body size and reduced cooperativeness compared to adults.

### Facial fractures: classification and highlights for a useful report [^5df85274]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many patients seen in emergency departments have facial trauma. In these patients, major findings may go undetected due to multiple trauma, clinicians’ inability to perform a thorough physical examination, patients’ inability to cooperate, and pronounced facial swelling; thus, facial injuries can be challenging for trauma surgeons.

Most patients with facial trauma are male (56.8–92.8%), and the mean age in reported series ranges from 24.6 to 51.0 years [,–]. The most common causes of facial injury are assault (44–61%), traffic accidents (15.8%), and falls (15%). In patients who require surgery, the most commonly fractured bone is the mandible (41.6–75.2%). The second and third most commonly fractured bones vary with the series, being the maxilla and orbit (39.8% each) in one series but the malar bone (15.2%) and maxilla (6.4%) in another. In all emergency department patients (those who require surgery and those who do not), closed nasal bone fractures are the most common, being found in 30.1% to 55.8%.

Although some authors affirm that appropriate physical examination of the face reliably rules out fractures in some patients (as low impact trauma ones) and some clinical variables are associated with facial fractures, physical examination alone cannot classify facial injuries. In other patients like such with polytrauma is widely known that even that physical exam does not rule out fractures because of distracting injuries, obtundation, or facial swelling. Thus, imaging is critical for surgeons to understand which anatomic structures are involved so they can plan the surgical approach and intraoperative technique.

It is essential to know the typical patterns and classifications of facial fractures, including those of the zygomaticomaxillary complex and naso-orbito-ethmoidal complex, because each pattern is often associated with particular functional and esthetic complications. There are also specific terms to classify the location of mandibular and orbital fractures. Radiologists’ interpretations of CT scans are important for planning surgery in patients with facial trauma. To ensure efficient communication with surgeons, radiology reports should use the anatomic descriptors and classification schemes that surgeons are familiar with; otherwise, surgeons may choose to rely on their own interpretation of the images. However, an important obstacle in the management of facial trauma is that only low level evidence supports current recommendations.

### Diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric nasal bone fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1067c914]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Screening and selection of articles

The initial phase involved a systematic literature search using a predefined strategy, resulting in the identification of 173 articles. After the removal of duplicates, 79 papers underwent screening based on title and abstract. Subsequently, 68 articles were excluded during this initial screening phase. The full text of the remaining 11 papers underwent review. Following a thorough examination, 7 articles were excluded due to insufficient numerical data, preventing the calculation of required values for conducting diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis. Eventually, 4 articles that met the inclusion criteria were identified and included in the study. The screening process and eligibility criteria were in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, and a visual representation is provided in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1 
PRISMA flow diagram showing the review process. PRISMA: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses

Study and patient characteristics

The meta-analysis incorporated four studies that evaluated the efficacy of ultrasound in diagnosing pediatric nasal bone fractures. Together, these studies investigated 277 pediatric patients, employing various ultrasound devices. The inclusion criteria across studies typically involved participants aged ≤ 18 with isolated nasal trauma, excluding cases with multiple traumas. The reference tests in all included studies relied on physical examination; however, the testing protocols varied between examinations conducted by emergency physicians and those carried out by otolaryngologists and plastic surgeons. Additional information regarding the studies, characteristics of the patients, and details of the ultrasound examinations can be found in Table 1.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: imaging and clinical laboratory tests in the diagnosis and management of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw [^4d77b7de]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging—staging

Staging of MRONJ is important for treatment decisions and for communication between clinicians.
While stages 1 and 2 are determined based on the clinical findings, imaging is essential to classify MRONJ as stage 0 and stage 3 of the AAOMS scale: ○ MRONJ stage 0 is diagnosed when there are asymptomatic non-specific clinical signs, symptoms of local inflammation, or symptoms without evidence of necrotic bone, in a patient with a history of BMA use. Radiologic findings such as an irregular pattern of bone trabeculation with foci of sclerosing or rarefaction, or thickening of the lamina dura, may support a diagnosis of stage 0 MRONJ. ○ MRONJ stage 3 is diagnosed when the MRONJ extends beyond the alveolar bone, presents as a pathologic fracture, manifests with an extraoral fistula, or involves an oro-antral/nasal communication. Imaging may identify these features and upgrade the diagnosis to stage 3.

Imaging—monitoring

As part of the healing process, the necrotic bone may gradually separate from the normal surrounding alveolar bone and eventually exfoliate.
Periodic radiographs may enable assessment of the involved site for early signs of sequestrum formation, such as the presence of well-demarcated borders of necrotic bone. The rearrangement of bone next to the sequestrum can often be observed on radiographs before there is clinical evidence of a detached sequestrum.
The selection of the specific imaging technique is determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the advantages and disadvantages of each technique (Table 1), while attempting to use the least radiation exposure.
If deterioration is suspected based on the clinical presentation, radiographs may confirm worsening of MRONJ by demonstrating extended involvement of bone and surrounding structures. Extension of the area of necrosis may be seen on imaging and not be appreciated on examination alone.

Imaging—treatment decisions

Imaging is a critical tool in preparation for maxillofacial surgery with CT and CBCT being used routinely to plan the resection and reconstruction.
Imaging may demonstrate proximity of the MRONJ to anatomical structures that carry a high risk for post-surgical complications such as post-operative neuralgia, neuropathy, or oro-antral/nasal communication. In such cases, the radiograph may guide a conservative treatment approach.
3D imaging may confirm a detached sequestrum which suggests feasibility for sequestrum removal. Likewise, 3D imaging may assist in estimating the risk for post-surgery fracture.
CT studies showing signs of periosteal reaction were correlated with lower rates of MRONJ healing, and therefore may assist with treatment decisions.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^fbd50fb4]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Classification of evidence-based statements—Guidelines are intended to produce optimal health outcomes for patients, to minimize harms, and to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, using an evidence-based approach in which supporting evidence is identified, appraised, and summarized with an explicit link to statements, and statements reflect both evidence quality and the balance of benefit and harm anticipated when followed. Less frequent variation in practice is expected for a “strong recommendation” than for a “recommendation,” while “Options” offer the most opportunity for practice variability; clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their patients’ interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations, and guidelines are not intended to supersede professional judgment but constrain discretion only relatively in specific circumstances.

### Nasal trauma and the deviated nose [^24f4c49a]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

As the most prominent facial feature, the nose carries an increased risk of traumatic injury. Nasal fracture is the most common bone injury of the adult face and frequently results from motor vehicle accidents, sports-related injuries, and altercations. Although often initially considered minor, nasal fracture may eventually result in significant cosmetic or functional defects. Optimal management of nasal trauma in the acute setting is critical in minimizing secondary nasal deformities. In recent years, numerous guidelines have been described to refine and optimize acute nasal trauma management. However, restoration of pretraumatic form and function remains a challenge. Commonly the product of a poorly addressed underlying structural injury, posttraumatic nasal deformity requiring subsequent rhinoplasty or septorhinoplasty remains in as many as 50 percent of cases. In this article, the authors review the anatomic, diagnostic, and management considerations as well as discuss their own experience in approaching nasal trauma and the deviated nose.

In the following years, the patient exhibited normal cognitive development but his growth remained retarded and muscular weakness worsened. By the age of seven years, he could barely climb a stair without intense support. A boutonniere deformity of both hands was noted (Fig. 1 C) and a hand X-ray showed acro-osteolysis (Fig. 3 C, D), consistent with inflammatory bone destruction. At the age of eight years, the patient developed with severe psoriasis (Fig. 2 A), unresponsive to steroid treatment. In addition, the patient exhibited failure of secondary dentition with aplasia of several teeth (18, 28, 31, 38 and 48) and hypoplastic roots of remaining teeth (Fig. 1 D, E). A cardiologic examination, including echocardiography and electrocardiography, and an ophthalmologic exam were unremarkable.

### Development of AI-based diagnostic algorithm for nasal bone fracture using deep learning [^4bd57373]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Facial bone fractures are relatively common, with the nasal bone the most frequently fractured facial bone. Computed tomography is the gold standard for diagnosing such fractures. Most nasal bone fractures can be treated using a closed reduction. However, delayed diagnosis may cause nasal deformity or other complications that are difficult and expensive to treat. In this study, the authors developed an algorithm for diagnosing nasal fractures by learning computed tomography images of facial bones with artificial intelligence through deep learning. A significant concordance with human doctors' reading results of 100% sensitivity and 77% specificity was achieved. Herein, the authors report the results of a pilot study on the first stage of developing an algorithm for analyzing fractures in the facial bone.

### Thoracic trauma WSES-AAST guidelines [^13263aa2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Thoracic trauma classification

Thoracic trauma are classified as follow (Table 1).

Table 1 
Thoracic trauma classification (Respiratory impairment : reduced lung function without distress; Respiratory distress: an acute diffuse lung injury that occurs within a short period of time and can cause severe hypoxemia leading to hypoxic damage to various organs throughout the body

Respiratory function evaluation

To evaluate the severity of respiratory impairment and respiratory distress, the Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be used, but we suggest the application of the more recently published Global definition of ARDS, (Table 2), which is more applicable in different settings, including lower resource ones.

Table 2 
ARDS definition

In fact, the impairment in oxygenation may be evaluated by the SpO2/FiO2 ratio (or, with the classical PaO2/FiO2 ratio). In contrast, lung infiltrates may be assessed using ultrasound (or the classical chest x-ray). In this regard, the value of the Lung Ultrasound Score in quantifying the extension of pulmonary contusions in blunt chest trauma has been recently evaluated. Moreover, the definition does not mandate using positive pressure ventilation to diagnose and stratify ARDS severity, but it includes the application of oxygen by high flow nasal cannulas.

The risk of delayed development of ARDS may be predicted by the application of the Thoracic Trauma severity score, which includes several factors (Table 3): a value of the score between 13 and 25 predicts a high risk of developing ARDS.

Table 3 
Thoracic trauma severity score

Diagnosis

Systematic evaluation of the patient is indicated to promptly identify life-threatening thoracic injuries, including lung parenchymal injuries (LoE moderate, GoR strong).
In unstable penetrating and blunt thoracic trauma patients lesions diagnosis should be pursued with E-FAST and/or chest-x ray (LoE moderate, GoR strong).
In stable penetrating and blunt thoracic trauma patients contrast enhanced CT-scan (with eventual 3D reconstruction) is strongly indicated to define the type and extent of injuries (LoE moderate, GoR strong).
Contrast-enhanced CT-scan and eventual CT-Angiography are indicated for precise vascular mapping, facilitating a tailored approach, and planning appropriate interventions (LoE moderate, GoR strong).
Bronchoscopy remains the gold standard for diagnosing specific tracheal and bronchial injuries, providing direct airway visualization (LoE moderate, GoR strong).
In case of suspected oesophageal perforation, contrast CT-scan or esophagoscopy is recommended (LoE moderate, GoR strong)

### Comparison of the outcomes of closed reduction nasal bone fractures with a surgical navigation system [^fdeb1798]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The most prevalent form of facial bone fractures is nasal fractures. The surgical procedures used for these fractures are relatively simple, but complete correction is not easy because the nasal bone is small and identifying the fracture site by palpation is difficult. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of intraoperative surgical navigation systems in nasal bone fracture surgery through a prospective analysis.

Methods

Between February 2019 and July 2019, 25 navigation-assisted closed reductions of nasal fractures were performed. Preoperative computed tomography images were obtained at 1-mm intervals before surgery and the navigation was set by a simulation to have an error rate of less than 1. Then, the navigation system was used to identify the fracture site. Closed reduction was performed with Asch forceps and a Langenbeck elevator based on the previous markings made using the navigation system.

Results

The degree of reduction was evaluated by plain X-rays and computed tomography scans, which were performed 1 month after surgery. In the navigation group, the average distance between the fragment and normal bony alignment was decreased from 2.38 to 0.49mm and the modified Motomura score was an average of 2.40 points. The decrease in the mean distance was significantly different (P=0.038) compared with the conventional group.

Conclusions

Surgical navigation systems could be a useful tool for localizing fracture sites and guiding closed reductions. In particular, the system could be recommended for nasal bone fracture reductions in the tip or pyriform regions, which are difficult to correct.

### Nasal bone fractures: analysis of 1193 cases with an emphasis on coincident adjacent fractures [^99ae672a]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Importance: The nasal bone is one of the most commonly fractured bones of the midface. However, the frequency of coincident fractures of adjacent bones such as the frontal process of the maxillary bone, nasal septum, and medial or inferior orbital walls has not been fully evaluated. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of fractures of adjacent structures in the setting of a nasal bone fracture. Second, we propose a new classification system of nasal bone fractures with involvement of adjacent bony structures. Design, Setting, and Participants: One thousand, one hundred ninety-three patients with midfacial fractures were retrospectively reviewed. The characteristics of fractures of the nasal bone and the incidence of coincident fractures of the frontal process of maxilla, bony nasal septum, medial, or inferior orbital walls were analyzed. Exposure: All patients included in the study presented with nasal trauma. Main Outcomes and Measures: The coincident fractures of adjacent midfacial structures were assessed, and a new classification of midfacial fractures based on computed tomography (CT) scan images was proposed. Results: Among the 1193 cases, bilateral fractures of the nasal bone were most common (69.24%), and coexistent fracture of the frontal process of the maxilla and bony nasal septum was 66.89% and 42.25%, respectively. Coincident fracture of the orbital walls was observed in 16.51% of cases. The major etiology of fracture for the younger and elderly groups was falls, compared with assault as the most common etiology in the adult group. A classification scheme was generated in which fractures of the nasal bone were divided into five types depending on coexisting fractures of adjacent structures. Conclusions and Relevance: External force applied to the nasal bone can also lead to coexistent fracture of adjacent bony structures including the frontal process of the maxilla, nasal septum, and orbital walls. The proposed classification of nasal fracture based on CT imaging helps to incorporate coincident disruption of adjacent structures.

### Use of radiography and ultrasonography for nasal fracture identification in children under 18 years of age presenting to the ED [^f1d52b69]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the diagnostic value of ultrasonography (USG), which is rapid, inexpensive, simple, and does not involve radiation, with that of direct radiography for identifying fractures in the nasal bones of pediatric patients presenting in the emergency department with nasal trauma.

Equipment and Methods

Patients under 18years old presenting with nasal trauma at the emergency department included prospectively. The patients' age and sex distribution, trauma type, GCS, physical examination findings, direct radiography, and USG results were recorded. The physical examination made by the emergency medicine specialist on arrival was accepted as the gold standard for diagnosis.

Findings

In total, 133 patients, 34.6% female and 65.4% male, were included in this study. The average patient age was 7.44±5.05years, with the greatest proportion (21.8%, n=29) of patients in the age ranges of 0-2 and 6-8years. The most frequently observed finding on physical examinations was swelling (51.1%, n=68). In total, 50 (37.6%) patients had nasal fractures according to their first physical examination, which was performed by emergency medicine specialists. That is, fractures were detected by direct radiography in only 11 of the 34 cases who were diagnosed with fractures by USG.

Conclusions

We consider that USG should be preferred over direct radiography for use at the bedside of pediatric patients who present at emergency department with nasal trauma, because of its superior diagnostic ability and the lack of a requirement for radiation.

### Assessment of the nasal bone by 2-dimensional ultrasound in 2 different planes: Do they give the same results? [^0050b91e]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Measurement of the nasal bone is an important part of the genetic sonogram. This study aimed to compare nasal bone length measurements taken in 2 different planes and to determine whether there is consistency between the measurements.

Methods

The nasal bone was measured in 103 fetuses whose mothers were admitted to our clinic for second-trimester ultrasound examinations and who did not have any accompanying diseases. In this prospective study, the gestational ages of fetuses ranged from 19 to 23weeks. Nasal bones were measured in both coronal and midsagittal planes, and the similarity between the measurements was evaluated. Pearson correlation, Wilcoxon signed rank, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate the results.

Results

The median nasal bone length increased with increasing gestational age in both planes, as expected. There were no statistically significant differences between the fetal nasal bone lengths taken in the midsagittal and coronal planes at 19 to 23weeks' gestation (P>.05).

Conclusions

The coronal plane may be used as an alternative to evaluate the nasal bone in the second trimester of pregnancy.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® sinonasal disease: 2021 update [^a63621cd]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

This article presents guidelines for initial imaging utilization in patients presenting with sinonasal disease, including acute rhinosinusitis without and with suspected orbital and intracranial complications, chronic rhinosinusitis, suspected invasive fungal sinusitis, suspected sinonasal mass, and suspected cerebrospinal fluid leak. CT and MRI are the primary imaging modalities used to evaluate patients with sinonasal disease. Given its detailed depiction of bony anatomy, CT can accurately demonstrate the presence of sinonasal disease, bony erosions, and anatomic variants, and is essential for surgical planning. Given its superior soft tissue contrast, MRI can accurately identify clinically suspected intracranial and intraorbital complications, delineate soft tissue extension of tumor and distinguish mass from obstructed secretions.The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Fluticasone propionate (Xhance) [^1efbafde]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.6 Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors

The use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin, conivaptan, lopinavir, voriconazole) with XHANCE is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid adverse effects may occur [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

5.7 Reduction in Bone Mineral Density

Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term oral inhalation of products containing corticosteroids into the lungs. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids), should be monitored and treated with established standards of care.

A 2-year trial in 160 patients (females aged 18 to 40 years, males aged 18 to 50 years) with asthma receiving chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-propelled fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol 88 or 440 mcg twice daily demonstrated no statistically significant changes in BMD at any time point (24, 52, 76, and 104 weeks of double-blind treatment) as assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at lumbar regions L1 through L4.

5.8 Effect on Growth

Nasal corticosteroids, including XHANCE, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of XHANCE has not been established in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] .

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^798a2936]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) surgical planning—computed tomography (CT) imaging provides functional and practical information for surgery, whereas plain films provide little or no definitive information; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alone has limitations but can complement CT when soft-tissue assessment is needed. The American College of Radiology (ACR) endorses a maxillofacial CT without contrast as typically appropriate for surgical candidates, and nearly all members of the GDG endorsed a fine-cut protocol with cuts ideally at 1 mm or finer, with radiologist input on parameters such as image acquisition at 1 mm cuts with 50% slice overlap. Surgeons review their patients' images themselves in advance, and CT interpretation assesses mucosal thickening and anatomic abnormalities; although the degree of mucosal thickening may not always correlate with symptoms or directly influence decisions, it provides useful information about disease severity and extent that guides the overall surgical approach.

### Fracture of the anterior nasal spine [^f0abf9f9]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

A 24-year-old man was assaulted and complained of vague discomfort with tenderness on the nose. Physical examination manifested pain over the nasolabial angle region aggravated by upper lip closure. Computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstruction of the facial bone revealed a fracture of the anterior nasal spine accompanying the overt displacement. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation. Clinical symptoms were completely resolved after the surgery. Regular diet was recommenced in 2 weeks without any complications. The purpose of this study was to emphasize the awareness of the clinical feature and the modality of treatment in case of anterior nasal spine fracture with displacement.

### Changes in fresh nasal bone fractures with time on computed tomographic scans [^fe3d0e66]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Twenty cases of fresh nasal bone fractures were examined for which computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained at the time of initial consultation, immediately after surgery, and 1 month after surgery. CT scans were obtained in the axial position from the nasal bone to the nasal apex, with slice intervals and slice thicknesses of 2 mm. For evaluation after reduction, classification of fracture and measurement of angle (0) of the fractured portion were performed by CT examination. The authors considered angles close to 0 deg to indicate good reduction. In addition, they performed overall evaluation based on the shape of the arch formed by the nasal bone and maxilla. Based on this, they compared the result of evaluation immediately after surgery with that found 1 month after surgery. Evaluation of reduction by CT examination performed immediately after surgery revealed excellent results in 2 patients, good results in 10 patients, and fair results in 8 patients. Reevaluation of reduction by CT 1 month after surgery revealed excellent results in 10 patients, good results in 9 patients, and fair results in 1 patient. The shape of the nasal bone tended to improve with time.

However, whether US is reliable as a screening tool in the pediatric emergency department (ED) remains unknown. This prospective cohort study had a 2-fold aim: to assess the utility of US in the diagnosis of pediatric nasal bone fracture, and to evaluate the validity of our protocol for managing pediatric nasal bone fractures (Fuchu-Kids algorithm).

Patients and Methods

Among the patients who presented at the ED with facial trauma, those with a suspected nasal bone fracture were enrolled in the study. Patients were treated according to Fuchu-Kids algorithm, and the validity of the protocol using US imaging was evaluated.

Results

Among 81 patients who were enrolled during the 1-year study period, 63 patients were able to complete the process described in our protocol for further examination. The diagnostic power of the Fuchu-Kids algorithm had a sensitivity of 91.7%, a specificity of 92.3%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.7%. However, when the performance of US was assessed as a single examination, its sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 75%, 92.3%, 85.7%, and 85.7%, respectively.

Conclusion

Using our algorithm, the majority of patients with nasal bone fracture were successfully diagnosed and screened out successfully. Repeated US imaging is effective when clinical symptoms persist even if the first US imaging was negative for nasal bone fracture. However, a detailed medical interview and clinical examination are mandatory, regardless of the use of US.

### A new low-dose multi-phase trauma CT protocol and its impact on diagnostic assessment and radiation dose in multi-trauma patients [^90ed81f0]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Our low-dose multi-phase trauma CT protocol uses a single contrast injection for WBCT angiography followed by an abdominal scan in venous phase. Compared to a requested complementary CT angiography, this method saves time and does not increase the intravenous contrast load. It has been shown that the request for a complementary CT angiography leads to a risk of delayed diagnoses in the emergent situation.

We also assessed the incidence of missed non-arterial injuries in both groups and did not find a statistically significant difference. Therefore, the diagnostic accuracy of trauma-related non-arterial injuries is not affected by the low-dose multi-phase trauma CT protocol. Among the most frequently missed injuries in both groups were fractures of the ribcage, the midface, and the transverse vertebral processes. Similarly, several others have shown that the most frequently missed diagnoses during a trauma CT are skeletal injuries. This has been reasoned with the explanation that, e.g. broken nasal bones and fractured ribs do not affect the emergency handling of a potentially critically injured patient and that the radiologists purposely direct their main attention to obvious and vitally important injuries, such as arterial or organ injuries, mostly only found during the arterial phase of a CT scan.

Sinus CT—acquisition, reformations, and contrast indications are specified as follows: With a multidetector CT, axial images are most commonly performed parallel to the hard palate, and the scanned volume should be from above the top of the frontal sinus and continue inferiorly through the maxillary teeth. Routine axial, sagittal, and/or coronal reformations should be reconstructed; coronal reformations are performed perpendicular to the plane of the hard palate from the nasal vestibule to the sella, and sagittal reformations are performed perpendicular to the plane of the hard palate through the maxillary sinuses. Contrast is not recommended for evaluating facial trauma or for routine evaluation of patients with uncomplicated sinusitis. IV contrast should be used to evaluate neoplasms, and IV contrast is also indicated to evaluate patients with complicated sinusitis as indicated by proptosis, periorbital or facial swelling, or other signs suspicious of intracranial or orbital extension. Considerations should be given to specific acquisition parameters required for image use in surgical navigation.

### Diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric nasal bone fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b694e54d]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

It is also important to emphasize that enhancing the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography can be achieved by incorporating physical signs of a nasal bone fracture. This is demonstrated in the study by Hong et al. where the absence of edema and hypoechoic hematoma is identified as distinguishing features that can differentiate an old fracture line from acute trauma.

While the current meta-analysis provided compelling findings regarding the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasound in detecting nasal bone fractures in children, certain limitations should be acknowledged. Although the reference test across all included studies was physical examination, factors such as the operator’s expertise, patient age groups, types of fractures, criteria used for definition of fractures, transducer resolution, adherence to standardized imaging protocols, real-time visualization, interpretation of results during imaging, and the time elapsed from injury to imaging may influence the diagnostic validity of ultrasonography in detecting fractures. These factors serve as potential sources of heterogeneity in the study. However, the limited number of studies on this topic constrained our ability to conduct meta-regression or subgroup analysis to assess the impact of these factors on diagnostic performance. It also remains unclear whether the results of the physical examination and medical history were blinded to the sonography operator in all the studies included in our analysis. Moreover, observer bias is a limitation attributed to the superficial nature of the nasal bone. Ultrasound operators might be influenced by visible deformities when interpreting images, potentially resulting in an overestimation of ultrasound accuracy.

Conducting additional well-designed studies with larger sample sizes and rigorous methodologies is essential. These studies should include blinding sonography operators to physical examination and medical history results, while also comparing various standardized diagnostic protocols and imaging modalities. These investigations should aim to explore the potential impact of the various factors mentioned above on the diagnostic performance of ultrasound in children with nasal bone fractures.

### Unjustified CT examinations in young patients [^9e847e4e]. European Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

The doses of radiation from computed tomography (CT) are relatively high, yet CT is being increasingly utilized. Furthermore, the radiation-induced lifetime risk of cancer mortality is higher at younger age. The purpose of this study was to find out whether previous CT examinations done on patients aged under 35 years were justified, and if not, whether there would have been other, more justifiable imaging modalities available. Fifty CT examinations of the head and 30 CT examinations each of the lumbar spine, cervical spine, abdomen, nasal sinuses and trauma were evaluated consecutively since the beginning of the year 2005 by using electronic patient files, the referral guidelines for imaging recommended by the European Commission and certain principles of classification. Seventy-seven per cent of the CT examinations of the lumbar spine, 36% of the head, 37% of the abdomen, 20% of the nasal sinuses and 3% of the cervical spine were unjustified. Most of these unjustified examinations could have been replaced by magnetic resonance imaging. In order to reduce utilization of ionizing radiation, both the referring practitioner and the radiologist responsible for the examination should carefully consider the justification for CT examinations and the possibility of using other imaging modalities.

Case presentation

We report on a male patient who was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy to non-consanguineous parents. Birth weight, height and head circumference were within normal limits. The patient initially thrived well but was noted to reach developmental milestones later than expected. He was able to sit at 12 months of age, to stand at 18 months of age, and to walk unsupported at 27 months of age. At the age of four years, he presented with muscular weakness of the lower extremities. While he was able to walk on a flat surface, he had difficulties to climb up stairs or to squat. In addition, his growth stunted, and his length was below the 3rd percentile. During clinical examination, he showed a stiff gait with overextension of knee joints and a mild hyperlordosis. In contrast to the lower extremities, the patient exhibited a normal function of his upper extremities with a precise and well-controlled visual coordination of his hands. His speech and cognitive functions were within normal range. Neurophysiological examination revealed a discretely reduced motor nerve conduction speed (N. tibialis 39 m/s [N > 45], N. peroneus 43 m/s, [N > 45 m/s]) with unremarkable findings on repetitive nerve stimulation. His muscular mass was reduced with a normal muscle texture without any signs of inflammation on ultrasound and MR imaging. An MRI of the brain and spine showed normal findings. Endocrinological work-up for short stature revealed normal values for growth hormone, IGF-1 and IGFBP-III. His thyroid function test was normal and the inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (CRP), was below 5 mg/ml. However, an X-ray of the hands showed osteopenia with a thinned cortex of the finger bones and a DEXA scan revealed reduced mineralization of bones (femur, Z-score -2.7SD; hip, Z-score -2.8SD; spine, Z-score -0.8SD). An X-ray of the skull revealed an absent nasal bone (Fig. 1 A). The X-ray of the hip and femurs showed a pathological caput-collum-diaphyseal angle (Fig. 1 B). The family declined further genetic testing at that point. The child was treated with physiotherapy and orthopedic support. Due to progressive pes equinus an Achilles tendon extension was performed.

### Diagnostic value of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of nasal fractures [^3dff0bf4]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

This study examined the diagnostic value of ultrasound and radiography compared with clinical examinations as the gold standard method to determine whether ultrasound can be used for early diagnosis of nasal fracture.

Methods

This prospective study was conducted on 128 patients with clinical signs of nasal fracture. Radiography in all patients was performed by 2 different radiologists on Waters and lateral view with a 10-MHz ultrasound probe, and clinical examinations were done by an ENT specialist. Radiography and ultrasound findings were recorded and compared with the final diagnosis which was based on clinical examinations. Results were analyzed with different statistical methods to determine sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.

Results

In the assessment of fracture with ultrasound, sensitivity was 84%, specificity 75%, accuracy 82%, positive predictive value 91%, and negative predictive value 61%. In the assessment of fracture on lateral view radiography, sensitivity was 50%, specificity 72%, accuracy 55%, positive predictive value 84%, and negative predictive value 32%. On Waters view radiography, sensitivity was 53%, specificity 65%, accuracy 56%, positive predictive value 82%, and negative predictive value 31%. On lateral-waters view radiography, sensitivity was 64%, specificity 58%, accuracy 62%, positive predictive value 82%, and negative predictive value 34%. Fracture diagnosis by ultrasound was significantly better as compared with radiography (P = 0.04).

Conclusion

The nasal bone ultrasound study is a useful method in determining the nasal fracture and radiography can be replaced with ultrasound in early diagnosis of fracture.

Facial trauma can have long-lasting physical and mental consequences. Trauma to the nose is commonly seen in the emergency department. Nasal lacerations account for 7% of all facial lacerations. Thorough examination and documentation including photographs is important for documentation and creating a reconstruction plan. Underlying damage to cartilage or bone must be reconstructed initially or in a delayed fashion to recreate the pretrauma anatomy and function. There are several options for soft tissue nasal reconstruction, including local flaps, skin grafts, pedicle flaps, and free flaps. At present there is no standard of care for postoperative facial trauma wound care.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^c8515afb]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult neck mass imaging—CT vs MRI selection and protocol states that both CT and MRI are effective tools in the assessment of neck masses, although CT has several benefits that support its utilization as a primary imaging modality and that the standard neck CT or MRI is protocoled to extend from the skull base to the thoracic inlet to adequately capture all structures for evaluation. While CT utilizes ionizing radiation, the average dose of 3 mSv (equivalent to approximately 150 chest x-rays) is considered acceptable in the adult population. MRI offers improved tissue contrast and can help detect subclinical tumors not evident with nasal endoscopy, and MRI is preferred when a primary tumor of the nasopharynx is suspected or when there is cranial nerve abnormality on physical examination because of its improved sensitivity to abnormalities of the skull base and in the detection of perineural spread. This benefit is often offset by motion artifact related to breathing and by the inability of the patient to remain motionless for scan times that typically exceed 30 minutes, and the presence of some implantable medical devices, such as pacemakers and neurostimulators, precludes MRI scanning. If dental artifact obscures visualization of the tonsillar fossa and base of tongue and if an abnormality in this area is suspected, MRI or referral to a specialist for examination should be considered.

### The diagnostic value of the sagittal multiplanar reconstruction CT images for nasal bone fractures [^55ce2c70]. Clinical Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

To compare the diagnostic performance of sagittal multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) images and axial images for the detection of a nasal bone fracture.

Materials and Methods

This prospective study included 533 consecutive patients who underwent three-dimensional images with 64-section multidetector-row CT for the evaluation of a facial bone fracture between June 2007 and May 2008 (366 males; 167 females; mean age +/- standard deviation 31.1+/-21.2 years; age range 1-92 years). Two observers independently scored the possibility of a nasal bone fracture on axial and sagittal images. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed.

Results

The Az values of the sagittal images were higher than those of the axial images for both observers (p=0.002 and 0.010, respectively) with higher accuracy (p<0.001 and 0.016, respectively). The sensitivities of sagittal images were superior to those of axial images, especially for type 1simple nasal bone fractures with no or minimal displacement (observer 1, 98.6 versus 72.8%; observer 2, 84.9 versus 71%).

Conclusion

Sagittal MPR facial bone CT images provided superior diagnostic performance, and their addition to axial images is useful for the evaluation of nasal bone fractures.

### Improving the quality of assessment and management of nasal trauma in a major trauma centre (MTC): queen elizabeth hospital, birmingham [^07e9d8ec]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Strategy

Plan-Do-Study-Act Cycle 1

We aimed to improve the quality of care for nasal trauma patients in the ENT SHO-led emergency clinic to ensure timely management, accurate assessment and documentation of key symptoms and examination findings during all nasal trauma consultations through the proforma. The proforma was presented, along with current evidence and expert consensus around nasal injury management, in a monthly departmental meeting and was made available as open access to all ENT SHOs. As predicted, the proforma was well received in the department and junior doctors were keen to use it in the clinical setting.

Plan-Do-Study-Act Cycle 2

The aim of the second cycle was to further improve outcomes from proforma use through a registrar led teaching programme which was delivered to all SHOs. Pre-teaching and post-teaching questionnaire data showed an increase in trainee confidence in history taking and examination from 0% (very confident), to 100% (fairly-very confident). Junior doctors provided exceptional ‘free text’ feedback supporting the use of the proforma. Suggestions from the feedback highlighted that SHOs may benefit from additional tools such as a PIL and clinic poster on MUA. A fifth of SHOs reported that the outcomes from this project were contributing to off-load clinic time pressures; perhaps due to increased confidence in managing nasal trauma patients through training and guidance tools.

Plan-Do-Study-Act Cycle 3

We created a PIL and a ‘Carrying out a MUA of Nasal Bones under Local Anaesthetic’ poster. These tools were displayed in clinic rooms and circulated to all SHOs via email. The poster was a reference tool to assist clinicians already competent in carrying out MUA, otherwise junior doctors were encouraged to continue to seek advice from the on-call Registrar if needed. A reminder system was put in place in the form of a poster on the ward and doctors’ office which showed how to navigate the computer system to locate the assessment tools.

The only issue that remained was the last section of the proforma (‘patient education’). On discussion with SHOs it was felt that aspects of ‘patient education’ were inapplicable to some patients. For example, advice surrounding avoiding contact sport is inappropriate for an elderly patient with a nasal injury after a fall. This was taken into consideration and it was decided that patient education prompts would remain in the proforma but should be discussed on a patient-specific basis.

### Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric nasal fractures [^2919d7de]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Overall, the results of our study indicated that the number of nasal fracture cases decreased during the pandemic period compared to the 1-year period before the pandemic. We observed the most common fracture type to be the IIA nasal fracture. We provided outpatient treatment to most of the patients in our study. The most common cause of the treated fractures was assault. We intervened in our cases at an average of 6 days and preferred closed reduction most frequently. Although our intervention time for pediatric nasal fractures and the etiology of the fractures changed, we did not observe any different effects of nasal fracture on our patients in either period. We could not locate studies on the same subject in the existing literature, and thus, we aimed to contribute to the literature with this study.

The limitations of our study are such that it consists of a single center and a small sample number of patients; therefore, the ideas presented should be supported or confirmed by multicenter studies with larger sample numbers of patients.

### ACR appropriateness criteria sinonasal disease [^5edf0d61]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Sinonasal imaging is performed in 2 major clinical scenarios: inflammatory rhinosinusitis or suspected mass lesion. Rhinosinusitis affects more than 16% of the US population annually. It poses an immense economic burden, accounting for more than 26 million outpatient visits annually and costing more than $4.3 billion annually in direct medical expenses. Most cases of uncomplicated acute and subacute rhinosinusitis are diagnosed clinically and should not require any imaging procedure. CT of the sinuses without contrast is the imaging method of choice in patients with recurrent acute sinusitis or chronic sinusitis. Sinusitis cannot be diagnosed on the basis of imaging findings alone. CT scan findings should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and endoscopic findings. MRI is currently used for evaluation of sinus disease as a complementary study in cases of aggressive sinus infection with ocular/intracranial complications, potential invasive fungal sinusitis in immunocompromised patients or in the evaluation of a sinonasal mass. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

Naso-orbitoethmoidal complex fractures

Naso-orbitoethmoidal complex fractures (Fig. 10) are caused by a posteriorly oriented high-impact force applied to the nasoethmoidal region, with transmission through the nasal cavity, medial orbital wall, and ethmoid sinuses, resulting in the fractures of the ethmoid sinuses and medial orbital wall, and usually associated with the fractures of the nasal bone and septum. This type of fracture is frequently characterized by a BOF of the medial orbital wall, with intraorbital volume loss, and is often associated with complications such as telecanthus (increased distance between the medial eyes canthi) due to medial canthal tendon injury,

nasolacrimal duct lesion with impaired tear drainage and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea caused by the cribriform plate fracture with a dural tear, which is considered one of the most difficult fractures patterns for surgery.

According to Markowitz and Manson's classification, the naso-orbitoethmoidal complex fractures can be divided into three types: Type I is a single-segment central fragment with no involvement of the medial canthal tendon attachment; type II is a comminuted central fragment with fractures external to the medial canthal tendon insertion, and type III is a medial canthal tendon avulsion with a comminuted lacrimal fossa fracture. Injuries can be further classified as unilateral and bilateral and according to the extension into other anatomic areas. Although the medial canthal tendon is not visible on CT, the degree of comminution of the medial orbital wall at its expected attachment in the lacrimal fossa can help guide surgical repair planning. Up to 20% of patients affected by this type of fracture present with nasolacrimal duct involvement that can evolve in impaired tear drainage if not timely treated.

Level of confidence in evidence is Medium, with aggregate evidence quality Grade C, based on observational studies and 2 randomized controlled trials. Benefits include effective and prompt control of nasal bleeding, reduce morbidity, protect airway, reduce need for blood products, allow for additional assessment and management to control bleeding, while risks, harm, and cost include failure to control bleeding, delay in care, can make subsequent examination more difficult, patient discomfort, mucosal damage from packing insertion/removal, damage to intranasal structures, possible infection, possible antibiotic exposure, adverse respiratory effects of nasal obstruction, and cost of packing materials and procedure. Benefit-harm assessment is Preponderance of benefit over harm, policy level is Recommendation, intentional vagueness notes the duration of packing is not specified but that long durations should be avoided, and the role of patient preferences is Small to moderate. Quality improvement opportunity is to promote effective treatment for nosebleed patients.
