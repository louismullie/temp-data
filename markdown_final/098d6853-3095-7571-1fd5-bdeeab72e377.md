## Question

how to rule out falst positive HIV lab result

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to rule out a false-positive HIV lab result. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability and why the result might be false. Then, I should verify the testing algorithm and where the result fits. Next, I will check for pre-analytical and analytical errors, followed by targeted supplemental testing. After that, I need to interpret discordant patterns and decide when to repeat testing. Finally, I will consider special populations, document and communicate clearly, and outline a practical decision pathway with contingencies for acute infection and HIV-2.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability, because in low-prevalence settings or in patients with low risk, the positive predictive value drops and false positives become relatively more likely, so I should not jump to conclusions before I verify the algorithmic next steps and the patient's risk profile [^d7b5794a] [^f015d219].

> Wait, let me verify the testing algorithm that was used, because ruling out a false positive depends on whether the CDC/APHL 2014–2018 recommended sequence was followed: a 4th-generation antigen/antibody immunoassay first, then an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay, and if discordant, an HIV-1 NAT to distinguish acute infection from a false-positive screen; if a different sequence was used, I should repeat testing within the correct algorithm to avoid misclassification [^c79f52d0] [^810e597a] [^3db3d606].

> I need to check for pre-analytical and analytical errors next, including specimen mix-up, mislabeling, hemolysis, fibrin clots, or wrong specimen type, and I should confirm patient identity and specimen integrity; if there is any doubt, I should collect a fresh specimen and repeat the algorithm, because these are preventable causes of apparent false positives that can be corrected with a new sample [^09553d1b] [^9fb9e78b] [^d08fdc24].

> Hold on, I should verify the supplemental results before labeling a false positive: if the 4th-gen screen is reactive but the HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation is nonreactive or indeterminate, I should reflex to HIV-1 NAT; a negative NAT with a nonreactive differentiation supports a false-positive screen, whereas a reactive NAT indicates acute HIV-1 infection and mandates linkage to care and therapy consideration while confirmatory serology evolves [^c79f52d0] [^810e597a] [^7eaf9104].

> Let me consider the pattern carefully: a reactive 4th-gen Ag/Ab with nonreactive differentiation and negative HIV-1 NAT is the classic profile for a false-positive screen; conversely, a reactive 4th-gen with nonreactive differentiation but a high viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL) strongly suggests acute HIV-1, and I should repeat RNA on a new specimen to confirm and initiate ART without delay if clinically indicated, documenting seroconversion thereafter [^c79f52d0] [^7eaf9104] [^284f51ae].

> But wait, what if the viral load is low-positive, say 50–200 copies/mL? I should double-check because low-level RNA in the setting of a negative or indeterminate antibody test can be a false-positive NAT; repeating RNA on a fresh specimen and ensuring no laboratory contamination or clerical error is essential before diagnosing acute infection, and I should avoid anchoring on a single low-level result [^284f51ae] [^7eaf9104].

> I will now examine special populations and settings where false positives are more frequent: in pregnancy, especially late gestation, and during or after COVID-19, false-positive 4th-gen results have been reported, so I should maintain a lower threshold to add NAT and repeat testing; similarly, in low-prevalence settings, I should anticipate more false positives and plan for confirmatory testing to reach a positive predictive value ≥ 99% per WHO principles [^a4bc13eb] [^7ede1ec9] [^f015d219].

> Let me think about HIV-2 and dual reactivity, because if the differentiation shows HIV-2 or dually reactive results, I should confirm with an appropriate HIV-2 assay or referral, recognizing that HIV-2 is rare in the U.S. and that most dually reactive patterns reflect HIV-1 cross-reactivity; if HIV-1 RNA is undetectable and HIV-2 is suspected clinically, I should pursue HIV-2-specific testing or repeat the algorithm in 2–4 weeks [^16382a07] [^49478c4d] [^810e597a].

> I should confirm that I am not missing acute infection in the window period; if exposure was recent and the 4th-gen is negative but suspicion remains high, I should order HIV-1 RNA directly and repeat serology in 2–4 weeks, because RNA becomes detectable roughly 10–12 days after exposure, before antibodies appear, and early detection changes management and prevention strategies [^284f51ae] [^7eaf9104].

> Next, I should review documentation and communication: I need to report the exact algorithm results, including screen, differentiation, and NAT, and clearly interpret the outcome as "no laboratory evidence of HIV infection" when appropriate; I should also counsel the patient, avoid premature labeling, and arrange follow-up testing if acute infection remains a concern or if the clinical picture evolves [^5fd7b55d] [^e9d52ed0] [^ff8e44f8].

> Hold on, I should verify that I have a practical decision pathway: if the 4th-gen is nonreactive, I can stop and exclude infection unless acute infection is suspected; if the 4th-gen is reactive, I must complete differentiation and, if discordant, add NAT; if NAT is negative and differentiation is nonreactive, I can conclude a false-positive screen and repeat testing in 2–4 weeks if risk persists; if NAT is positive, I diagnose acute HIV-1 and initiate care; if results remain discordant or the clinical story is incompatible, I should repeat the entire algorithm on a new specimen and consider HIV-2 or alternative explanations [^c79f52d0] [^810e597a] [^7eaf9104].

> Finally, I need to ensure system-level safeguards: using validated assays, adhering to the CDC/APHL algorithm, maintaining quality control, and training staff reduce false positives and resolve discordances efficiently; when in doubt, repeating on a fresh specimen and escalating to NAT are the safest, evidence-based steps to avoid misdiagnosis and to catch true infection early [^09553d1b] [^c79f52d0] [^810e597a].

To rule out a false-positive HIV lab result, **repeat testing with a new specimen** using the CDC-recommended algorithm [^c79f52d0] (4th-generation Ag/Ab assay, then HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation, and HIV-1 NAT if discordant) [^810e597a]. False positives are rare but can occur due to **cross-reactivity**, **lab error**, or **recent vaccination** [^7f07d69d] [^5929560e]. If the repeat algorithm is negative or indeterminate, **no HIV infection is present** and the initial result was a false positive [^c79f52d0]; if results remain discordant, **repeat testing in 2–4 weeks** or use an alternative assay [^810e597a] [^09553d1b]. Always **confirm with NAT** when acute infection is suspected or results are discordant [^7eaf9104] [^284f51ae].

## Step-by-step approach to rule out false-positive HIV results

### 1. Repeat testing with a new specimen

- **Collect a new specimen**: Obtain a fresh blood sample to exclude pre-analytical errors (e.g. specimen mix-up, degradation) [^09553d1b].

- **Use the CDC-recommended algorithm**: Start with a 4th-generation Ag/Ab assay, then perform HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation; if discordant, add HIV-1 NAT [^c79f52d0] [^810e597a].

- **Document specimen integrity**: Ensure proper labeling, handling, and chain of custody to minimize errors [^09553d1b].

---

### 2. Analyze test results using the CDC algorithm

| **Step** | **Test** | **Interpretation** | **Action** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | 4th-generation Ag/Ab assay | Nonreactive | HIV-negative; no further testing |
| 2 | HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation | Reactive | HIV-1 or HIV-2 confirmed |
| 3 | HIV-1 NAT | Reactive | Acute HIV-1 infection |
| 4 | HIV-1 NAT | Negative | False-positive initial screen |

---

If the **initial Ag/Ab is reactive** but differentiation is nonreactive or indeterminate, perform HIV-1 NAT; a negative NAT with nonreactive differentiation indicates a false-positive screen [^c79f52d0] [^810e597a].

---

### 3. Consider clinical context and risk factors

- **Assess pretest probability**: Low-risk patients in low-prevalence settings have a higher false-positive rate [^d7b5794a] [^f015d219].

- **Review recent exposures**: Recent vaccinations (e.g. COVID-19, Tdap) or autoimmune conditions can cause false positives [^7ede1ec9] [^5929560e] [^938af19e].

- **Evaluate symptoms**: Absence of acute HIV symptoms (fever, rash, lymphadenopathy) lowers likelihood of true infection [^c568acc6].

---

### 4. Perform additional confirmatory testing if needed

- **HIV-2 testing**: If clinically indicated (e.g. West African origin), use HIV-2-specific assays or send to a reference lab [^16382a07] [^810e597a].

- **Alternative assays**: Consider a different FDA-approved assay or a qualitative HIV-1 RNA test if discordance persists [^09553d1b] [^b4f47957].

- **Repeat testing**: If acute infection is suspected, repeat testing in 2–4 weeks to document seroconversion [^284f51ae] [^7eaf9104].

---

### 5. Document and communicate results clearly

- **Report all results**: Include initial, supplemental, and NAT results with clear interpretations [^5fd7b55d].

- **Counsel the patient**: Explain the false-positive result, reassure, and discuss retesting if risk persists [^9fb9e78b].

- **Record follow-up**: Note any repeat testing or clinical monitoring planned [^ff8e44f8].

---

## Common causes of false-positive HIV results

- **Cross-reactivity**: Autoimmune disorders, recent vaccinations, or other infections (e.g. COVID-19) [^7f07d69d] [^7ede1ec9].

- **Laboratory error**: Specimen mix-up, contamination, or mislabeling [^09553d1b] [^32dd1a88].

- **Assay interference**: Heterophilic antibodies or nonspecific binding [^430ff354].

---

## Clinical implications of false-positive HIV results

False-positive results can cause **psychological distress**, inappropriate ART initiation, and legal or social harm; therefore, **confirmatory testing is essential** to prevent misdiagnosis and ensure appropriate care [^c1764124] [^48e18934].

---

## Conclusion

To rule out a false-positive HIV result, **repeat testing with a new specimen** using the CDC algorithm is essential [^c79f52d0]. If the repeat algorithm is negative or indeterminate, the initial result was a false positive; if discordant, repeat in 2–4 weeks or use an alternative assay [^810e597a]. Always confirm with NAT when acute infection is suspected or results are discordant [^7eaf9104].

Analytic framework — CDC writing group members conducted a systematic literature review to compare outcomes of previous and proposed HIV testing algorithm recommendations, and evaluated evidence using criteria adapted to relevant study designs within an analytic framework linking key questions to outcomes related to performance of individual assays and their use in combinations. The evidence synthesis focused on the relative effects of previous and recommended testing algorithms on diagnostic accuracy and yield. Benefits were defined as tests or algorithms classifying specimens as true-positive or true-negative for HIV-1 or HIV-2, and as reduced turnaround time, whereas harms included being classified as false-positive or false-negative, receiving indeterminate or inconclusive results, and delayed diagnosis due to the need for additional specimens or follow-up testing. Services after diagnosis for persons with HIV and for those identified as uninfected would be needed regardless of which testing algorithm is used.

Technical update on HIV-1/2 differentiation assays — laboratory guidance states to "Validate another HIV test for use as a supplemental antibody test". A validated test is described as one meeting Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) or other regulatory standards and that "can therefore be used to report clinical results for diagnosis and patient management". The document cautions that "There will remain cases for which diagnostic tests and algorithms are not accurate", noting that "Biologic causes for false-positive and false-negative HIV test results have been reported" and that "Pre- and post-analytic steps such as incorrect specimen type, specimen mix-up, mislabeling or data transcription errors can also lead to incorrect HIV test results". For discordant results, it directs that "Inconsistent or conflicting test results should therefore be investigated with follow-up testing on a newly collected specimen".

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^2e905509]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection — updated recommendations describe a recommended algorithm as a sequence of tests used in combination to improve the accuracy of diagnosis from serum or plasma specimens; CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories issued these recommendations based on FDA-approved tests as of December 2012 with evidence collected from 2007 through December 2013. The recommendations do not include the rapid HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination test approved by the FDA in August 2013 or HIV-2 nucleic acid tests (NATs), which lack FDA approval. The report provides recommendations to laboratory personnel for adults and children > 24 months of age, and in brief, testing begins with a combination immunoassay that detects HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. The need for updated testing reflects FDA approval of improved HIV assays that allow detection sooner after infection, evidence that relying on Western blot or indirect immunofluorescence assay for confirmation can produce false-negative or indeterminate results early, recognition that risk of HIV transmission from persons with acute and early infection is much higher than that from persons with established infection, recent indications for the clinical benefits from antiretroviral treatment of all persons with HIV infection including those with acute infection, and demonstration that the majority of HIV-2 infections detected by available HIV antibody immunoassays are misclassified as HIV-1 by the HIV-1 Western blot.

HIV laboratory diagnostic testing algorithm — public health reporting: If the algorithm conclusion is positive, indicating the presence of HIV infection, laboratories should report in the same data transmission to public health authorities the overall result or conclusion of the lab algorithm and results from each test performed (including negative/nonreactive or indeterminate results). If the recommended algorithm was not completed and the overall conclusion was not determined, the laboratory should follow local requirements for reporting incomplete or inconclusive results.

Systematic literature review scope for HIV diagnostic algorithms — Three CDC writing group members updated this with a systematic literature review in 2013 focused on 10 key questions addressing: the sensitivity of individual assays in specimens from persons with established HIV-1 and established HIV-2 infection and with acute HIV-1 infection; the specificity of individual assays in specimens from uninfected persons; the accuracy of previous and recommended algorithms based on combinations of assays in specimens from persons with established HIV-1 infection, with acute HIV-1 infection, with established HIV-2 infection, and not infected with HIV-1 or HIV-2; which algorithm(s) requires the minimum number of assays to maximize the accuracy of the laboratory diagnosis of HIV-1 infection and HIV-2 infection and minimize the number of specimens with indeterminate or inconclusive test results; and whether the proposed diagnostic algorithm differs from the previous algorithm in costs and cost-effectiveness and in benefits and harms for patients.

False-positive fourth-generation HIV screening tests are rare and are usually associated with various infections and autoimmune diseases. SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination were recently linked with false-positive HIV screening test results. However, little is known about false-positives in people who performed HIV screening tests after outbreaks of different SARS-CoV-2 strains and vaccination campaigns. Here, we examined the false-positive rates in samples collected by the Israeli AIDS Task Force in 2018–2022, with respect to such factors.

Key questions for HIV diagnostic testing focus on assay performance and algorithm evaluation, asking about the sensitivity of individual assays in specimens from persons with established HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection and from persons with acute HIV-1 infection; the specificity of individual assays in specimens from uninfected persons; the accuracy of algorithms based on combinations of assays in specimens from persons with established HIV-1 infection, from persons with acute HIV-1 infection, from persons with established HIV-2 infection, and from persons not infected with HIV; which algorithm(s) required the fewest number of assays to maximize accuracy and minimize indeterminate or inconclusive results; and whether the costs and cost-effectiveness and the benefits and harms for patients of the proposed diagnostic algorithm differ from those of the previous algorithm.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^c79f52d0]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Updated recommendations for HIV laboratory diagnosis state that laboratories should conduct initial testing for HIV with an FDA-approved antigen/antibody combination immunoassay that detects HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen, and no further testing is required for specimens that are nonreactive on the initial immunoassay. Specimens with a reactive antigen/antibody combination immunoassay result should be tested with an FDA-approved antibody immunoassay that differentiates HIV-1 antibodies from HIV-2 antibodies, and reactive results on both the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay should be interpreted as positive for HIV-1 antibodies, HIV-2 antibodies, or HIV antibodies, undifferentiated. If the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay is reactive and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay is nonreactive or indeterminate, specimens should be tested with an FDA-approved HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT); a reactive HIV-1 NAT with a nonreactive differentiation immunoassay indicates laboratory evidence for acute HIV-1 infection, a reactive HIV-1 NAT with an indeterminate differentiation immunoassay indicates the presence of HIV-1 infection confirmed by HIV-1 NAT, and a negative HIV-1 NAT with nonreactive or indeterminate differentiation immunoassay indicates a false-positive result on the initial immunoassay. Laboratories should use this same testing algorithm, beginning with an antigen/antibody combination immunoassay, for serum or plasma specimens submitted after a reactive (preliminary positive) rapid HIV test; Exception: As of April 2014, data are insufficient to recommend use of the FDA-approved single-use rapid HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassay as the initial assay in the algorithm.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^50ee68e4]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Assays that detect HIV-1 infection earlier — adoption and confirmation caveats are described: New generations of immunoassays with improved sensitivity can narrow the interval between the time of infection and initial immunoassay reactivity; in 2006, 74% of U.S. public health laboratories used a 1st or 2nd generation immunoassay as the initial test, whereas in 2012, 92% used a 3rd or 4th generation immunoassay as the initial test. Because these immunoassays become reactive days to weeks before the HIV-1 Western blot becomes positive, using the HIV-1 Western blot for confirmation can produce false-negative results during seroconversion.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^9fb9e78b]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the recommended laboratory testing algorithm emphasize that no diagnostic test or algorithm can be completely accurate in all cases of HIV infection; rare instances have been reported of persons who remained persistently negative for antibodies despite detectable HIV RNA; false-positive HIV test results have been attributed to specimen mix-up, mislabeling, and to autoimmune disorders; and inconsistent or conflicting test results should be investigated with follow-up testing on a newly collected specimen. The document adds that a small percentage of specimens produce undifferentiated (dually reactive) results on the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay, the frequency in the United States is unknown and follow-up data are limited, and one study reported 5 (0.50%) of 993 specimens with repeatedly reactive immunoassay results were dually reactive with the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay approved by the FDA as of March 2013.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^c71cbbf1]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV diagnostic algorithm — reactive results on the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay should be interpreted as positive for HIV-1 antibodies, HIV-2 antibodies, or HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies, undifferentiated. Available evidence is insufficient to recommend specific additional testing, without clinical follow-up, for specimens that are dually reactive for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies on the differentiation immunoassay. Specimens that are reactive on the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay and nonreactive or indeterminate on the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay should be tested with an FDA-approved HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT). A reactive HIV-1 NAT result and nonreactive HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay result indicates laboratory evidence for acute HIV-1 infection. A reactive HIV-1 NAT result and indeterminate HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay result indicates the presence of HIV-1 antibodies confirmed by HIV-1 NAT. A negative HIV-1 NAT result and nonreactive or indeterminate HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay result indicates a false-positive result on the initial immunoassay. HIV-1 NAT results can distinguish acute HIV-1 infection from false-positive initial immunoassay results in specimens with a reactive antigen/antibody immunoassay and a nonreactive HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay result. HIV-1 NAT does not detect HIV-2, and no HIV-2 NAT is FDA-approved. Available evidence is insufficient to recommend testing for acute HIV-2 infection after a nonreactive HIV-1 NAT result.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^b4f47957]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV-1 NAT alternative testing pathways outline specific steps and limitations. Use of HIV-1 NAT as the second test instead of an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay is specified: If HIV-1 NAT result is negative, perform an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay or other FDA-approved HIV-1 supplemental antibody test, and if result of an HIV-1 supplemental antibody test is nonreactive or indeterminate, perform an HIV-2 antibody test. Another option is use of HIV-1 NAT (or pooled HIV-1 NAT) after a nonreactive 3rd or 4th generation immunoassay; a reactive NAT result provides evidence of acute HIV-1 infection, but false-positive results occur, and follow-up testing to document seroconversion should be conducted if a laboratory HIV diagnosis is based on the result of HIV-1 NAT only. Stated limitations include that this alternative fails to distinguish acute HIV-1 infection from established HIV-1 infection, increases turnaround time for test results and incurs additional costs, and that no HIV-1 NAT is FDA-approved for pooled testing for HIV diagnosis and individual or pooled HIV-1 NAT can detect acute infections not detected by a 4th generation immunoassay, but occasionally produces a false-positive result, requires more tests on each specimen, increases turnaround time for test results, and is more costly than the recommended algorithm.

### Country adherence to WHO recommendations to improve the quality of HIV diagnosis: a global policy review [^f015d219]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

The majority of non-adherence issues for low-prevalence settings centred on diagnosing HIV infection using only two assays. This deviation has the potential to increase the occurrence of misdiagnosis, particularly false-positive diagnosis. According to previous modelling by WHO, using reactive test results from two assays in low-prevalence settings would lead to reduced positive predictive value as low as 90.8% in settings where prevalence is 0.1%, well below the 99% positive predictive value recommended. In a population of one million people who are unaware of their HIV status, this could cause up to 100 individuals to be placed on ART who are HIV negative.

While correct use of assay 3 results was poor in low HIV prevalence settings, many policies included strategies that used assay 3 to resolve discrepant test results from the first two assays. Thus, changing the testing strategy so that an assay 3 is used to confirm HIV infection for individuals who are reactive on the first two assays may be feasible. Implementing this shift across settings would increase adherence with WHO recommendations from 26% to approximately 50%.

For high-prevalence settings, the primary issue was not having an assay three to resolve discrepant results from the first two assays. While misdiagnosis in these scenarios is not of primary concern, lacking an assay 3 to resolve discrepancies leads to important missed opportunities to provide a definitive HIV-negative diagnosis to those at ongoing risk for HIV and offer PrEP if warranted. Adding an assay 3 to the testing strategy or putting in clear referral mechanisms to a laboratory that could conduct an assay 3 is needed. For countries using an assay 3 inappropriately to rule in HIV infection, strategies could be altered to allow assay 3 to rule out HIV infection only.

Minor issues identified in strategies, such as unnecessarily using an assay 3 to resolve discrepant results from assay 1 and assay 2 or not repeating the first and second assays in case of discrepant results, if corrected, could improve efficiency and cost related to HIV testing.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^de15bfb2]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV diagnostic algorithm — acute infection detection and antiretroviral therapy context indicates that the recommended algorithm increases the ability to detect acute HIV-1 infection, but no laboratory assay can detect HIV infection immediately after acquisition; the eclipse period between infection and the appearance of HIV RNA is not well-defined and likely varies with infection route, inoculum size, and nucleic acid test (NAT) sensitivity. Additionally, as of May 2014 data are insufficient to determine whether the algorithm might produce false-negative results with specimens from persons on antiretroviral therapy who have maintained long-term viral suppression.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^20f0524d]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV diagnostic algorithm — required supplemental assays: The recommended algorithm requires a lower number of assays than the previous algorithms for accurate HIV-1 and HIV-2 results, with both including 1 initial assay and 1 or 2 supplemental assays; the recommended algorithm requires one supplemental assay if HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies are present and, if the first supplemental assay is negative or indeterminate, requires a second supplemental assay, HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT), to test for acute HIV-1 infection and eliminate indeterminate results, with three studies showing that only 0.1% to 0.2% of all specimens required NAT testing, whereas the previous algorithm requires 1 supplemental assay to test for HIV-1 antibodies and, if negative or indeterminate, a second supplemental assay to test for HIV-2 antibodies, cannot identify acute HIV-1 infection and often needs a follow-up specimen, and produced indeterminate results in from 1.9% to 4.5% of repeatedly reactive 3rd or 4th generation immunoassays; with both algorithms, HIV-1 antibody-positive specimens are resolved with 2 assays and initial false-positives require 3 tests.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^7eaf9104]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Acute HIV infection — testing and interpretation: Quantitative or qualitative HIV RNA testing should be considered even if the HIV Ag/Ab test result is negative, and HIV infection should be confirmed by repeat quantitative HIV RNA testing or subsequent testing to document HIV antibody seroconversion. Even a low-positive quantitative HIV RNA level (e.g., < 200 copies/mL but detectable) in the setting of a negative or indeterminate antibody test result is consistent with acute HIV infection; when present at this level, the HIV RNA test should be repeated on a new blood specimen to confirm the diagnosis, and repeated false-positive HIV RNA test results are unlikely. HIV RNA levels in acute infection are generally very high (e.g., > 100,000 copies/mL), however, levels may be < 200 copies/mL in the earliest weeks, and a negative or indeterminate HIV antibody test result and a positive HIV RNA test result (< 200 copies/mL) indicate that acute HIV infection is highly likely. The previously proposed threshold of < 3,000 copies/mL is based on historical data that are now considered obsolete, and improvements in plasma viral load methodology suggest that any positive result on a quantitative plasma HIV RNA test in this setting may be consistent with acute HIV infection. In settings where testing algorithms use only anti-HIV antibodies, when acute HIV infection is suspected in a person with a negative or indeterminate HIV antibody test result, a quantitative or qualitative HIV RNA test should be performed.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^98449ce4]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV-1 and HIV-2 laboratory diagnosis — need for updated recommendations is based on the prior algorithm of a repeatedly reactive immunoassay for HIV antibodies with a positive HIV-1 Western blot or HIV-1 IFA as the gold standard since 1989, with false-positive results rare, while HIV-2 infection remains uncommon in the United States and lacks definitive diagnostic criteria; developments and observations in five areas led CDC to update recommendations, noting that the previous HIV-1 testing algorithm fails to identify acute HIV-1 infections and that since 1999 blood screening centers in the United States have used pooled HIV-1 nucleic acid testing to identify acute infection in donors with nonreactive 3rd generation immunoassay results, using pooled screening to reduce costs followed by individual NAT to identify the specimen with HIV-1 RNA.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^de8e298d]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV testing algorithm — benefits, harms, and turnaround time are summarized as follows: the recommended algorithm is associated with additional health benefits and fewer harms for patients than the previous algorithm and, by reducing the number of false-negative and indeterminate results and misclassified HIV-2 infections, is more accurate; the previous algorithm produces indeterminate results in from 2% to 4.5% of persons with repeatedly reactive 3rd or 4th generation immunoassays, and reducing indeterminate test results reduces delays, anxiety, and the inconvenience and cost of collecting additional specimens for more testing; one program that expedited shipping found the laboratory considered only 1.6% of specimens submitted unsuitable for testing; the recommended algorithm can also reduce turnaround time, with one public health laboratory reporting 96% of antibody-positive test results in 2 workdays or less compared with 22% previously, and another program shortening the interval between specimen collection and routine notification of test results by 1 week; however, turnaround time is longer for specimens that required HIV-1 NAT testing and no studies documented the time necessary to obtain the NAT results.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^5a205b8a]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV diagnostic testing algorithm — nonreactive screening interpretation states that a nonreactive HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab combination immunoassay is "Negative for HIV-1 antigen and HIV-1/HIV-2 antibodies" with "No laboratory evidence of HIV infection", and "If acute HIV infection is suspected, consider testing for HIV-1 RNA", while "Reporting this test result is not required".

### Screening for HIV: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^3db3d606]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Screening tests and diagnostic algorithm — Current CDC guidelines recommend screening with an antigen/antibody immunoassay approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that detects HIV‑1 and HIV‑2 antibodies and the HIV‑1 p24 antigen, with supplemental testing following a reactive assay to differentiate HIV‑1 and HIV‑2 antibodies; if supplemental testing for HIV‑1/HIV‑2 antibodies is nonreactive or indeterminate (or if acute HIV infection or recent exposure is suspected or reported), an HIV‑1 nucleic acid test is recommended to differentiate acute HIV‑1 infection from a false‑positive test result. Antigen/antibody tests for HIV are highly accurate and results can be available in 2 days; rapid antigen/antibody tests are also available, and when using a rapid HIV test for screening, positive results should be confirmed.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^16382a07]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV-2 infection — epidemiology and testing implications: Fewer than 200 cases of HIV-2 in the United States had been reported to CDC through 2009, although criteria for an HIV-2 case definition were not specified until 2014; the majority of U.S. HIV-2 diagnoses have been in persons born in Africa, especially West Africa, but 12% of HIV-2 diagnoses were made in persons whose birthplace was India, North America or Europe. It is theoretically possible that acute HIV-2 infection might produce a repeatedly reactive HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassay result with nonreactive HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay and HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT) results, and based on expert opinion and the low prevalence of HIV-2 infection in the United States, this sequence most likely indicates a false-positive initial immunoassay result; laboratories should report that such test results indicate no laboratory evidence for HIV-1 infection and suggest follow-up testing for HIV-2 if clinically indicated. Although accurate diagnosis of HIV-2 is clinically important because HIV-2 strains are naturally resistant to several antiretroviral drugs developed to suppress HIV-1, diagnosis of HIV-2 can be problematic; only two reports of acute HIV-2 infections have been published, the reliability of HIV-2 NAT during acute HIV-2 infection is unknown, and in specimens obtained 5 to 6 months after seroconversion, plasma HIV-2 viral load was 28 times lower in HIV-2 seroconverters than among comparable HIV-1 seroconverters.

### 2018 quick reference guide: recommended laboratory HIV testing algorithm for serum or plasma specimens [^810e597a]. CDC (2018). Medium credibility.

Recommended laboratory HIV testing algorithm for serum or plasma specimens — initial and reflex testing: Laboratories should conduct initial testing for HIV with an FDA-approved antigen/antibody immunoassay that detects HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen; no further testing is required for non-reactive specimens, but if very early infection is possible (e.g., recent exposure), conduct an HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT) or obtain a new specimen and repeat the algorithm. Specimens with a reactive antigen/antibody immunoassay result should be tested with an FDA-approved supplemental antibody immunoassay that differentiates HIV-1 antibodies from HIV-2 antibodies; reactive results on both the initial antigen/antibody immunoassay and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay should be interpreted as positive for HIV-1 antibodies, HIV-2 antibodies, or HIV antibodies, undifferentiated, and this includes specimens reported as HIV-2 positive with HIV-1 cross-reactivity. If the initial immunoassay is reactive but the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay is non-reactive or indeterminate, specimens should be tested with an FDA-approved HIV-1 NAT; a reactive HIV-1 NAT with a non-reactive or indeterminate differentiation immunoassay indicates laboratory evidence of acute HIV-1 infection, while a negative HIV-1 NAT with a non-reactive or HIV-1 indeterminate differentiation immunoassay indicates an HIV-1 false-positive initial result. If HIV-1 NAT is negative and the differentiation immunoassay is repeatedly HIV-2 indeterminate or HIV-2 indeterminate, refer for testing with a different validated supplemental HIV-2 test (antibody test or NAT) or repeat the algorithm in 2 to 4 weeks, starting with an antigen/antibody immunoassay.

### What if they don't have tuberculosis? The consequences and trade-offs involved in false-positive diagnoses of tuberculosis [^96539471]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The proportion and the underlying reasons for false-positive TB test results vary, and are highly setting-dependent as local guidelines and policy will dictate different diagnostic algorithms in different populations. Differences in background prevalence of TB or comorbidity patterns (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], silicosis) as well as human performance and laboratory capacity can influence test performance and result interpretation. A key example is empirical (or "clincal") diagnosis, where TB is diagnosed (and treatment is started) in the absence of a recorded positive bacteriological test. Empirical diagnosis accounted for 43% of all cases reported to WHO globally in 2017. Decisions to treat empirically are based on a mix of symptomatic presentation, comorbidities, chest radiography and other ancillary tests, nonresponse to other therapeutic maneuvers (eg, trials of broad-spectrum antibiotics), and individual clinician assessment — all of which vary from one population (and one provider) to the next. Empirical diagnosis is a critical part of the diagnostic arsenal, especially in low-resource settings where health workers may see a high number of TB patients to inform their clinical judgement. However, the limited data available suggest that the sensitivity and specificity of empirical diagnosis are both highly variable and suboptimal. A multicountry diagnostics trial found that sensitivity ranged from 16% to 44.4% and the specificity ranged from 86.9% to 95.3% across study sites, and was significantly influenced by coverage of chest radiography.

### Diagnosing acute HIV infection: the performance of quantitative HIV-1 RNA testing (viral load) in the 2014 laboratory testing algorithm [^8afa7cea]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

New recommendations for laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection in the United States were published in 2014. The updated testing algorithm includes a qualitative HIV-1 RNA assay to resolve discordant immunoassay results and to identify acute HIV-1 infection (AHI). The qualitative HIV-1 RNA assay is not widely available; therefore, we evaluated the performance of a more widely available quantitative HIV-1 RNA assay, viral load, for diagnosing AHI. We determined that quantitative viral loads consistently distinguished AHI from a false-positive immunoassay result. Among 100 study participants with AHI and a viral load result, the estimated geometric mean viral load was 1,377,793copies/mL.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^284f51ae]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acute infection — diagnostic timing and NAAT usage are described as follows: After exposure to HIV, HIV RNA is detectable in plasma by 10–12 days, followed by appearance of HIV p24 antigen at 15–17 days. Due to the time course of test positivity and the possibility of seronegativity, laboratory diagnosis of primary (acute) HIV infection is usually based on qualitative detection of HIV RNA or proviral DNA or a high quantitative HIV RNA (viral load) result (typically > 10⁶ copies/mL). In non–acute HIV infection, HIV RNA (viral load) assays should be used with caution for diagnosis because of the possibility of false positive results, which are generally of low copy number (< 200 copies/mL) and should prompt retesting of a second specimen. Because there is a 10- to 12-day period after infection when serologic markers are not detectable, testing another specimen 2–4 weeks later should be considered if initial antibody, antigen, or RNA tests are negative. NAAT is not 100% sensitive in individuals with established HIV infection, and if NAAT is used to make a diagnosis of acute HIV infection, subsequent HIV-1 seroconversion by conventional serologic testing is recommended.

### Virological exploration of individuals with discordant HIV screening tests [^2ed2f05b]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2004). Low credibility.

Screening for HIV infection can use many algorithms. When two different HIV antibody assays are used, discordant results may occur. To discriminate between HIV seroconversion, HIV variant infection and false positive reactivity, 30 consecutive subjects with two discordant HIV antibody-screening assays were extensively investigated for HIV infection. No subject had HIV seroconversion or reached HIV seropositivity criteria after a follow-up of 3 months. By contrast 36% became HIV negative by the use of both HIV screening assays. p24 Antigen, HIV-1 RNA, HIV-1 DNA, HIV-2 DNA assays and HIV isolation by sensitive culture were unable to identify HIV infection in the 30 subjects with discordant HIV screening assays. The data suggest that the use of two HIV screening assays increase false-positive HIV results without increasing clinical sensitivity. To compliment follow-up of HIV screening, early testing for HIV RNA could be useful to identify or eliminate a recent infection.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^104dc546]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV diagnostic algorithm — specimens after reactive single-use rapid HIV test results: CDC's 2004 recommendation to confirm all reactive rapid tests by HIV-1 Western blot or HIV-1 IFA regardless of initial immunoassay results was based on observed false-negative immunoassay results and the predominant assay was discontinued in 2007. Three studies using all FDA-approved tests on the same 166 plasma specimens from 16 seroconverters indicated that for tests FDA-approved as of May 2014, 4th generation laboratory-based combination antigen/antibody immunoassays become reactive earlier during early infection than any single-use rapid HIV tests, including the 4th generation rapid test. In a prospective evaluation of 428 specimens submitted after reactive rapid test results, all were correctly classified by the recommended algorithm, and a nonreactive antigen/antibody combination immunoassay result after a reactive rapid HIV test result indicates a false-positive rapid HIV test result and averts the need to conduct additional supplemental testing.

### HIV misdiagnosis: a root cause analysis leading to improvements in HIV diagnosis and patient care [^c1764124]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Standard diagnostic testing for HIV infection has traditionally relied on a high sensitivity HIV antibody screening test using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by a high specificity antibody confirmatory test such as a Western Blot. Recently several of the screening assays have been enhanced with an ability to identify p24 antigen thereby narrowing the diagnostic window.

Objectives

To explore the implications of enhanced HIV screening methods that may be leading to HIV misdiagnoses.

Study Design

A patient deemed to be an HIV infected 'elite controller' was found to be misdiagnosed when undergoing detailed investigations prior to initiating antiretroviral therapy. A root cause analysis was performed to identify the causative factors of this misdiagnosis. A retrospective review of all "elite controllers" in Alberta, Canada revealed challenges of current HIV testing algorithms.

Results

Technical and human factors were identified as being causative in this HIV misdiagnosis including (i) high rates of false reactive results on the Abbott ARCHITECT HIV-1&2 COMBO EIA, (ii) human error in reading the initial Western blot, (iii) HIV algorithmic directives in which confirmatory (Western blot) testing was not performed on a repeatedly reactive screen test. The outcome of this analysis identified opportunities for improvement, including implementation of a newly approved (automated) confirmatory assay and improved communication between the clinician and laboratory.

Conclusions

HIV testing remains problematic despite significant advances in HIV test performance and algorithm development, presenting new and unexpected issues. Ensuring a high-quality management system including implementation of the latest HIV technologies and algorithms along with human resources and policies are required to minimize the impact of false positive diagnoses, especially in the era of universal screening and 'test and treat' recommendations.

### Evaluation of a point-of-care rapid HIV antibody test with insights into acute HIV symptomatology in a population with low prevalence [^3d729203]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

To this end, the CDC has preferentially recommended the use of in-lab fourth-generation HIV antigen and antibody combination assays, which detect IgG/IgM and p24 antigen, as they are more sensitive and maintain comparable specificity compared to other currently available rapid tests. In-lab fourth-generation screening assays have been shown to decrease the window period approximately by 5 days and have ~87.8% sensitivity for detecting acute HIV infections. This raises questions regarding the utility of lateral flow-based rapid tests in clinical settings alongside fourth-generation algorithmic testing. Few studies have directly examined the accuracy of third-generation rapid HIV tests performed at POC in clinical settings since the implementation of the CDC's fourth-generation screening algorithm in 2014. These studies exclusively report on the performance of rapid tests with minimal insights into scenarios which warrant in-lab screening over rapid testing at the POC. Thus, there is a need for further investigation to determine a balance between lateral flow-based rapid tests and the recommended testing algorithm for diagnosing HIV infections.

The goal of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the impact of POC rapid HIV testing on the diagnosis of HIV, in a population with low HIV prevalence. Through an analysis of results from POC and in-lab HIV tests, coupled with clinical data, we sought to gain insights into the performance of rapid HIV testing in our patient population. We further aimed to characterize the clinical findings associated with false- versus true-positive screening results, which may guide in the overall interpretation of results in a clinical context. Finally, we aimed to quantify the different screening approaches across multiple years of clinical practice at our institution.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^c4462e73]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV diagnostic testing — limitations of the evidence supporting these recommendations include that evaluations of test performance were based on comparison with a composite standard consisting of a positive HIV-1 Western blot, the presence of HIV-1 RNA, or both, and clinical evidence from follow-up evaluations was rarely available to document true HIV status; therefore some false-positive test results might have gone undetected. Only two HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassays, one HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay, and one HIV-1 NAT were approved by the FDA for HIV diagnosis as of December 2012, and all performance evaluations were conducted with these assays, with additional evaluations required as new assays are introduced. Published studies document indeterminate results on the FDA-approved HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay in 0.8% to 1.4% of specimens with reactivity, and 11% to 15% of indeterminate specimens proved to be HIV-negative; no published follow-up data are available to definitively determine whether indeterminate results with detectable HIV-1 RNA represent an evolving antibody response or whether such results might persist during established infection. For HIV-2, little evidence exists for the timing of antibody development or the occurrence of acute HIV-2 infection in the United States, and no HIV-2 NAT is FDA-approved; 4th generation antigen/antibody combination assays detect IgM and IgG against both HIV-1 and HIV-2 as well as p24 antigen specific for HIV-1 but not p26/27, and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay detects only IgG against HIV-1 and HIV-2.

To mitigate misdiagnosis and detect unrecognized acute infection when PrEP is prescribed "based solely on the results of point of care rapid tests", "a laboratory antigen/antibody test should always be ordered at the time baseline labs are drawn", since "without confirmatory tests, such false-positive results can lead to misdiagnosis of HIV infection". Test performance can differ while on PrEP, as "the antiretrovirals used for PrEP can suppress early viral replication which can affect the timing of antibody development".

Research

Work is needed to provide quantitative estimates for the weight a false-positive diagnosis should carry compared to a false negative, or example, by quantifying the costs and quality-adjusted life years lost through incorrect diagnoses for individuals with vs without TB. Such work could examine the acceptable number of false-positive TB diagnoses for one additional true-positive diagnosis, across settings. A number of papers have already highlighted strong discrepancies between perceived and data-based thresholds, as well as variation between the preferences of clinicians, public health officials, and patients.

Another key area of research is to improve the empirical data underlying our current estimates of test performance, particularly the accuracy of empirical diagnosis and the specificity of "definitive" diagnostic tests. While reviews and examples of research exist, substantial uncertainty remains on the baseline performance of key tests, particularly as implemented in actual field settings. One example is the specificity of sputum smear, which has shown great variability in recent prevalence surveys, with up to 43% of smear-positive cases not confirmed by culture. Again, some of these data will be setting-specific, in particular for empirical diagnosis. But a better understanding of how the performance depends on specific factors (eg, background TB and HIV prevalence, use/availability of radiograph) will help inform estimates. Recent studies have also highlighted the value of considering urine LAM and C-reactive protein as part of TB screening in high-risk HIV-infected populations.

Test Application

False-positive TB diagnoses are not exclusively caused by suboptimal diagnostic accuracy, but are also driven by pre- and postanalytic errors and administrative errors as well as laboratory errors in handling of reagents and/or maintenance of instruments. By strengthening domestic and international laboratory networks, TB diagnostics can be embedded in well-functioning systems of training and quality control to help reduce false-positive TB diagnoses.

### Detection of acute HIV infection in two evaluations of a new HIV diagnostic testing algorithm-United States, 2011–2013 [^d64334bb]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

Improved HIV IAs enhance the ability to detect HIV infection earlier, even during the acute phase of infection, when substantial HIV transmission occurs. However, specimens with reactive IA and negative supplemental test results must undergo further testing to differentiate acute HIV infection from false-positive results. This report demonstrates that acute HIV infections detected with third- or fourth-generation IAs often are misclassified as HIV-negative by WB or IFA, potentially leading to adverse clinical outcomes for patients and further HIV transmission within the community. Applying the HIV testing algorithm evaluated in this analysis averted missed diagnoses in 32% of the HIV-infected patients in the Phoenix ED and 9% of those in the STOP study. With FDA's approval of the Multispot HIV-1/HIV-2 rapid test for use as the second test in this algorithm in March 2013, laboratories can adopt this algorithm, which is a recommended option in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute's Criteria for Laboratory Testing and Diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection; Approved Guideline. The fast turnaround time for test results from most third- and fourth-generation IAs (< 1 hour) and the Multispot rapid test (15 minutes) affords the opportunity to deliver same-day definitive test results to the majority of HIV-infected persons who are antibody-positive. Regardless of which supplemental test is used, clinicians and laboratories might want to consider further HIV RNA testing for patients whose supplemental antibody test results are negative after a reactive third- or fourth-generation IA result.

### A case of false-positive test results in a pregnant woman of unknown HIV status at delivery [^d08fdc24]. Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

We report a case of a false-positive HIV result in an apparently healthy pregnant woman. Since no prenatal HIV testing had been performed, we screened for HIV reactivity utilizing the Architect HIV-Ag/Ab Combo assay. Results obtained were inconsistent in that they were repeatedly HIV reactive on a single serum sample while nonreactive on a plasma sample. However, both sample types were nonreactive on the Advia Centaur HIV-1/O/2 and Oraquick assays. For further confirmation, an HIV-1 Western blot and viral load were performed; blot results were indeterminate while the viral load was undetectable. We concluded that the repeatedly reactive serum serology results were false-positive. While the cause of this false reactivity is not clear, most likely fibrin microclots in the serum sample interfered with the assay and thus accounted for the false positivity. Plasma may thus provide a more appropriate sample type when using the Architect assay, especially when testing pregnant women.

HIV-1 Western blot misclassification of HIV-2 infections — diagnostic performance and updated assays is summarized as follows: Correct identification of HIV-2 infections is clinically important because some antiretroviral agents effective against HIV-1 (including nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and some protease inhibitors) are not effective against HIV-2, and considerable serologic cross-reaction occurs between HIV-1 and HIV-2; screening exclusively with tests for HIV-1 antibodies failed to detect 15% to 53% of HIV-2 infections, and studies published in 2010 and 2011 showed that the HIV-1 Western blot was interpreted as positive for HIV-1 in 46% to 85% of specimens from persons found to be infected with HIV-2, resulting in incorrect or delayed diagnosis. As of May 2014, all FDA-approved 3rd and 4th generation immunoassays incorporate specific antigens to detect antibodies directed against both HIV-1 and HIV-2, CDC's previous recommendations advised specific testing for HIV-2 for specimens with negative or indeterminate HIV-1 Western blot results, and the rapid immunoassay approved by the FDA in 2013 for use in algorithms to differentiate HIV-1 from HIV-2 antibodies correctly classifies the majority of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections in antibody-positive specimens, including the subset misclassified as HIV-1 by the HIV-1 Western blot.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^3fac997d]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Reverse-sequence algorithm — most people who have reactive treponemal tests will have reactive tests for the remainder of their lives, regardless of adequate treatment or disease activity and do not predict treatment response. Some laboratories have initiated a reverse-sequence screening algorithm using treponemal EIA or CIA as a screening test, followed by a reflex-quantitative nontreponemal test if the EIA or CIA is positive. This reverse-sequence algorithm can identify people previously treated for syphilis, those with untreated or incompletely treated syphilis, and those with false-positive results that can occur with a low likelihood of infection. People with a positive treponemal screening test should have a standard quantitative nontreponemal test with titer performed reflexively by the laboratory to guide patient management decisions. In the reverse-sequence screening strategy, having a positive treponemal EIA or CIA and a negative reflex-quantitative nontreponemal test requires a second treponemal test (based on different antigens from the initial test) to confirm the results of the positive initial treponemal test.

HIV testing after a reactive rapid HIV test — Laboratories should use this same testing algorithm, beginning with a laboratory-based antigen/antibody combination immunoassay, with serum or plasma specimens submitted for testing after a reactive (preliminary positive) result from any rapid HIV test. With the recommended algorithm, the FDA-approved laboratory-based antigen/antibody combination immunoassays detect HIV infection earlier during seroconversion than any of the rapid HIV tests available in the United States as of May 2014, including the rapid HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination test. Therefore, no supplemental testing is required for specimens that are nonreactive on the initial immunoassay in the recommended algorithm.

### Detection of acute HIV infection in two evaluations of a new HIV diagnostic testing algorithm-United States, 2011–2013 [^c568acc6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

The ED at Maricopa Integrated Health Systems adopted routine, opt-out HIV screening consistent with CDC's 2006 recommendations, using a fourth-generation IA. As a result, an additional 37 patients with HIV infection, including 12 with acute infection, were identified. Because most currently available FDA-approved rapid HIV tests are second-generation format (i.e. they detect only IgG-class antibodies), these acute HIV infections likely would have been missed if point-of-care rapid tests had been used for screening. The high percentage of HIV infections that were acute among these ED patients was unexpected; however, consistent with observations that 50%–90% of persons with acute HIV infection develop symptoms that prompt them to seek medical care, this finding suggests that acute HIV infection in persons who seek care for its nonspecific symptoms in EDs and other urgent-care venues might go undiagnosed unless HIV screening is conducted with fourth-generation HIV IAs. Currently, only one RNA assay, the Aptima HIV-1 RNA Qualitative Assay, is FDA-approved for HIV diagnosis, but it is available in far fewer laboratories than quantitative HIV-1 (viral load) RNA assays. To facilitate prompt diagnosis of acute HIV infection when faced with discordant screening and supplemental antibody test results, clinicians can order a viral load test to differentiate acute HIV-1 infection from false-positive IA results.

### Heterogeneity of false reactivity profiles of HIV assays while optimizing national HIV testing algorithms: findings from a multi-country analysis [^bb2cd851]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Verification study design

Laboratory data from verification studies conducted by each participating country was included in the multi-country analysis.

Briefly, a verification study consisted of prospectively collecting between 100 and 230 HIV-negative specimens from individuals attending routine HTS, including antenatal care. Specimens were characterized as HIV-negative using a parallel testing strategy comprising one EIA and one RDT. Positive and discordant specimens are excluded from the panel.

This sample size was calculated to detect a 2–8% false reactivity rate from products and assess the extent of shared false reactivity between them. Inclusion criteria were i) aged above 18 years; ii) seeking HTS; iii) able to understand the scope of the study and provide written informed consent. Individuals with a known (self-reported) HIV-positive status and/or on antiretroviral therapy (self-reported) were excluded.

Participating countries selected WHO-prequalified products assays (except two products) to include in the study, typically prioritizing 10–12 products based on performance (e.g. sensitivity, specificity), other operational characteristics (e.g. storage conditions, shelf life, ease of use) and pricing. Two separate production lots (denoted as lot A and lot B) of each shortlisted product were tested against the panel of HIV-negative specimens. False reactivity was confirmed if the result on lot A or lot B result were reactive. To reduce bias, the products used to confirm HIV-negative status of the specimen panel were not eligible to be candidate products in the study.

Countries selected their national testing algorithms by choosing products with lowest false reactivity rates and little to no shared false reactivity on the same specimens. Study findings, along with performance and operational criteria for each product, were then used to guide countries in making their final algorithm selection. More details are published elsewhere including the generic WHO protocol.

Each verification study was submitted for institutional approval and obtained ethical clearance from the National Health Research Ethics Committee as well as the WHO Ethical Review Board.

### Low and decreasing prevalence and rate of false positive HIV diagnosis-Chókwèdistrict, Mozambique, 2014–2017 [^48e18934]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

After being informed of their misdiagnosis, nearly all contacted participants expressed relief that they were not infected and no longer needed HIV care. At the request of one participant, the psychologist and medical officer from the local health authority confirmed the client's status with concerned family members; no other follow-up support services were requested. All contacted participants were successfully disengaged from HIV care, including 16 who were on ART. Public concerns about the accuracy of HIV testing and reductions in uptake of rapid HIV testing services in Chókwè District have not been reported.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, after the first round, fewer than half of participants who claimed a prior diagnosis were tested for HIV. Estimated cases and prevalence of false diagnosis, however, is conservative because imputed cases were based on the higher cumulative false diagnosis rate rather than lower round-specific rates, and participants who did not complete all testing and prior-diagnosis verification steps were assumed to have received false diagnoses. Second, surveillance of quality management system activities among facility and community rapid HIV test providers was not conducted, and the potential impact of these activities on reducing the rate and prevalence of false diagnosis is unknown. Third, it is possible that some HIV-infected participants who were receiving ART might have false negative test results because of loss of detectable antibody. Total nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction is not 100% sensitive, and retesting negative does not rule out HIV infection for patients on ART. Participants who discontinued ART are being retested periodically. Finally, this study was conducted in a high HIV prevalence district in southern Mozambique. Because the positive predictive value of diagnostic tests depends, in part, on disease prevalence, other areas and districts of Mozambique might have higher rates of false diagnosis attributed to lower HIV prevalence alone.

Low and decreasing trends in the estimated prevalence of false positive HIV diagnosis in CHDSS indicate that residents in Chókwè District have received high-quality rapid HIV testing services, and that HIV care and ART is provided near universally to only those in need. However, observed false diagnoses in Chókwè District underscore the importance of routine retesting and confirmation of HIV infection for all patients before ART initiation, and implementation of comprehensive quality management systems to ensure appropriate training, supervision, proficiency testing, and external quality assessment of rapid HIV test providers.

### Sense and sensitivity: can an inaccurate test be better than no test at all? [^d7b5794a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

However, sensitivity and specificity are not the only dimensions of test accuracy that might interest us. We might also want to know how likely it is that a given result is a true result rather than a false result; that is, we might want to know the test's predictive value.

Crucially, the predictive value of a test is influenced by the prevalence of the virus within the tested population. Suppose you have a test with 99% specificity and 99% sensitivity. This test is highly accurate. However, suppose you use that test in a population of 100 000 people, of which only 1% have the virus. Ex hypothesi, in your population, you will have 99 000 uninfected people, and 1000 infected people. If the test is 99% sensitive, you can thus expect it to generate 990 true positives and 10 false negatives in the infected members of the group. With 99% specificity, you can expect the test to identify 98 010 true negatives, and 990 false positives in the uninfected members of the group. So even with a test that is 99% specific and sensitive, there will be as many false-positive results as true positives in this population. So while the negative predictive value of test in this example is 99.99%, its positive predictive value in this population is only 50%, due to the low prevalence of the virus within the population. See table 1 for an illustration of these figures.

Table 1
Worked example of a specific and sensitive test with low positive predictive value

The moral costs of false positive and false negative provide the basis for the DHSC's claim that 'an unreliable test is worse than no test'. Ultimately though, the standards of specificity and sensitivity that we require of VDTs is an ethical judgement. We can only assess this by attending to the moral costs of false-positive and false-negative results, and the benefits of identifying true positive and negative results. For new point-of-care VDTs, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency target product profile suggests that the minimum threshold for acceptable test sensitivity is 80% (within 95% CIs of 70%–100%), while the respective threshold for specificity is 95% (within 95% CIs of 90%–100%). By point of contrast, it has been suggested that RT-PCR assays used in the UK have a sensitivity and specificity of over 95% in laboratory conditions.(Notably, analytic performance in laboratory settings can differ significantly from real-world operational performance.)

This case report describes a 22-year-old female Ambulance Technician student who displayed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) false positivity following a recent hepatitis B vaccination. Occupational health clinicians who work in a healthcare setting (with healthcare staff and/or students) should be aware of the possibility of false-positive HIV screening test results, and where a false positive is suspected, they should consider what the underlying cause could be and should consider whether further medical investigation is required.

### BioRad bioPlex® HIV Ag-Ab assay: incidence of false positivity in a low-prevalence population and its effects on the current HIV testing algorithm [^67532cba]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The BioPlex® HIV Ag-Ab assay, unlike other HIV 1/2 antigen/antibody immunoassays, is capable of differentiating positive HIV-1 antibodies (Groups M and O) from HIV-2 antibodies and/or HIV-1 p24 antigen in a single test.

Objective

The Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL) adopted the BioPlex® HIV Ag-Ab assay early 2017 and can report on its performance in terms of false positivity in a low-prevalence population and its effects on the current HIV testing algorithm recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Study Design

Specimens received between March 2017 and August 2018 were screened using the BioPlex® HIV Ag-Ab assay. Specimens screening positive for HIV antibodies or antigen were further confirmed using the Geenius™ HIV 1/2 Supplemental Assay and/or HIV RNA testing.

Results

Of the 12,338 sera screened by the BioPlex assay for HIV, 35 specimens were positive. Only 22 of the specimens were confirmed by supplemental testing and were considered to be truly positive (PPV, 62.9%). RNA was not detected in these cases suggesting initial false positivity on the BioPlex® HIV Ag-Ab assay. True positive results had index values (IDX) of > 180 whereas false positive IDX's were between 1 and 4, with the exception of one specimen.

Conclusions

We suggest that specimens demonstrating positivity with low IDX values < 4 on the BioPlex® HIV Ag-Ab assay proceed directly to RNA testing, essentially bypassing supplemental antibody confirmation tests, to reduce turnaround time and cost of HIV confirmation.

Established HIV-2 infection — algorithm accuracy using combined assays could not be directly determined because "there is no FDA-approved NAT for HIV-2" and, under prior practice, "specimens with a positive HIV-1 Western blot would not undergo specific testing for HIV-2; most studies evaluating algorithms involved specimens with evidence of HIV-2 infection that had been misclassified as HIV-1 infection". In a prospective study using parallel differentiation assay and HIV-1 Western blot, 26 (0.29%) of 8,678 HIV-1 Western blot-positive specimens were classified as HIV-2, and in a retrospective study the recommended algorithm reclassified 2 (0.4%) of 493 positive HIV-1 Western blot specimens as HIV-2.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^49478c4d]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV-1/HIV-2 dual-reactive antibody results — interpretation and follow-up: Published data and genotypic analyses from West Africa indicate that most dual HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody reactivity represents HIV-1 cross-reactivity to HIV-2 antigens, and in the United States a single dual HIV-1/HIV-2 infection has been reported; no other published U.S. studies provide evidence to recommend specific additional tests for such specimens. Based on expert opinion, low HIV-2 prevalence, and the lack of an FDA-approved NAT for HIV-2, laboratories should report dually reactive test results as positive for HIV antibodies that could not be differentiated as HIV-1 or HIV-2, and recommend further investigation for HIV-2 if clinically indicated (for example, if HIV-1 RNA is undetectable on the viral load assay conducted as part of the initial medical workup).

### False-positive human immunodeficiency virus test results in patients receiving lentivirus-based chimeric antigen receptor T-Cell therapy: case report, review of the literature, and proposed recommendations [^a6516634]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

There are emerging reports of false-positive HIV nucleic acid testing (NAT) in patients who have received chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies. We present a case of a 66-year-old-woman with primary-refractory stage IIIA double-hit high-grade B-cell lymphoma, in whom we detected false-positive HIV-1 NAT results after receipt of a third-generation self-inactivating investigational lentivirus-based CAR T-cell therapy. We reviewed the current state of the science on HIV-1 NAT and found that all reported false-positive cases have occurred in the setting of lentivirus-based CAR T-cell therapy and testing with FDA-approved platforms targeting the 5'LTR genomic region. Herein, we offer recommendations for HIV diagnostic testing in patients undergoing this mode of therapy. Clinicians managing this patient population should be aware of cross-reactivity between these therapeutic agents and commonly used HIV-1 NAT assays.

### Increase in false-positive fourth-generation human immunodeficiency virus tests in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 [^7ede1ec9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

While all potential confounding variables could not be eliminated, neither COVID-19 vaccination nor pregnancy changed the association of FP HIV results with concurrent COVID-19 infection, although we did not control for time from vaccination or period of gestation. We manually chart-reviewed all FP tests to determine if there was another etiology for their result. No other known alternative explanations were found.

The exact biochemistry of falsely reactive tests is often unknown and attributed to a "general" inflammatory process, to which COVID-19 is no stranger. While we were unable to link the degree of inflammation to false HIV positivity, we were able to show that HIV Ag reactivity was a primary trigger for an FP result on the test used in this study. A major strength of our study is that it included many patients, and all positive fourth-generation assay results, that is, TP, FP, and selected PN (in suspected acute HIV), were tracked by CTR program staff to confirm or reject an HIV diagnosis.

In conclusion, acute COVID-19 should be considered as a potential etiology for an FP fourth-generation HIV test.

### Designing HIV testing algorithms based on 2015 WHO guidelines using data from six sites in sub-saharan Africa [^afd0bdbd]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The HIV rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are the main diagnostic tools for HIV screening and diagnosis in resource-constrained settings. Given the potential for the severe medical, psychological, and social impacts of HIV misdiagnosis and the evidence of elevated false-positive results from some settings, it is imperative that HIV diagnosis is confirmed to be both sensitive and specific.

In 2012 and 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) published revisions of the HIV testing guidelines with different recommendations for low (< 5%)- and high (≥ 5%)-HIV-prevalence settings. These recommendations call for the sequential use of up to three different serological assays, including RDTs, for final HIV diagnoses. Whereas a first nonreactive test result is sufficient to provide a final negative result in both settings, two and three reactive assays are needed to provide final HIV-positive results in high- and low-prevalence settings, respectively (Fig. 1). The guidelines stipulate that each of the three RDTs should have a sensitivity of at least 99%, while the first RDT should have at least 98% specificity and the second and third RDTs at least 99% specificity; overall, the combination should be designed to minimize the potential for shared false reactivity. Different strategies for high- and low-prevalence settings were developed based on mathematical models using three theoretical assays assumed to meet the criteria described above to achieve an overall positive predictive value (PPV) of at least 99%. To date, however, these recommendations and the performance of the resulting algorithms have not been validated using real data from different field contexts.

FIG 1
HIV testing strategies used to simulate algorithms (A to C) and reference testing algorithm used in this study (D).

Several factors could influence the design and performance of these algorithms. Although WHO-prequalified HIV RDTs met the minimum recommended sensitivity and specificity criteria in the prequalification evaluations, several reports from different countries indicate much poorer performance in real-world settings. Moreover, little is known about shared false-reactivity results among different RDTs. The use of the same antigen (Ag) preparations to produce different tests, which is occurring with increasing frequency due to rebranding or relabeling arrangements among test manufacturers, can lead to shared cross-reactivity, though this may not be the only cause. Even low levels of shared cross-reactivity, or marginally substandard performance of one RDT, could have a meaningful impact on the performance of an algorithm.

### Low rate of false-positive results with use of a rapid HIV test [^39aca787]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Occupational exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an important threat to healthcare workers. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend prompt institution of prophylaxis. This requires (1) immediate prophylaxis after exposure, pending test results that may take more than 24 hours in many hospitals; or (2) performance of a rapid test. The Single Use Diagnostic System (SUDS) HIV-1 Test is used to screen rapidly for antibodies to HIV type 1 in plasma or serum, with a reported sensitivity of more than 99.9%. We used this test from January 1999 until September 2000, when it was withdrawn from the market following reports claiming a high rate of false-positive results.

Methods

We reviewed the results of postexposure HIV testing during 21 months.

Results

A total of 884 SUDS tests were performed on source patients after occupational exposures (883 negative results, 1 reactive result). The results of repeat SUDS testing on the reactive specimen were also reactive, but the results of enzyme immunoassay and Western blot testing were negative. A new specimen from the same patient showed a negative result on SUDS testing. This suggested a specificity of 99.9%. In the 4 months after SUDS testing was suspended, there was 1 false-positive result on enzyme immunoassay for 1 of 132 source patients (presumed specificity, 99.2%).

Conclusion

Use of the SUDS test facilitated rapid and accurate evaluation of source specimens, obviating unnecessary prophylaxis.

### Field accuracy of fourth-generation rapid diagnostic tests for acute HIV-1: a systematic review [^26d7e1a3]. AIDS (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

In accordance with our published protocol, we systematically searched Medline (using PubMed) and ISI Web of Science for studies published between 1 January 2005 and 22 April 2015 that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of fourth-generation RDTs for acute HIV-1 (Supplementary Table 1: Search Strategy). Studies were eligible if they evaluated the field performance of at least one fourth-generation RDT for acute HIV-1 in adults (aged > 15 years). We defined field performance as the RDT being used on an unselected population, at the point of care (defined as being conducted in the presence of the patient), in the setting of intended use and carried out by the intended user. Cross-sectional studies, cohort studies and randomized control trials were included. Studies that evaluated fourth-generation RDTs within laboratories or retrospectively against specimen panels were excluded. We placed no restrictions on assay manufacturer, language or country.

Two reviewers (P.M. E. A.) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of all studies against inclusion and exclusion criteria, with discrepancies resolved by group decision with a third reviewer (M.T.). Two reviewers (J.L. P.M.) independently reviewed the full text of all selected studies using a piloted data extraction form to determine final selection status. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by group decision with a third reviewer (M.T.). Participants receiving the index test were defined as true positive, false positive, false negative and true negative for the presence of a positive HIV-1 p24 antigen reaction on the fourth-generation HIV RDT compared with the study-defined reference standard for acute HIV-1 infection. We recognized that there is no current consensus reference standard for the diagnosis of acute HIV infection and specified that an acceptable reference standard for the diagnosis of acute HIV-1 infection would include at least one nonreactive antibody test result using a third-generation HIV immunoassay, and at least one reactive antigen test result on a fourth-generation HIV immunoassay, and/or at least one reactive result using an HIV-1 p24 antigen immunoassay. However, where this was not used, we used study-reported reference standards. Details of studies excluded after full-text review are shown in the supplementary appendix (Supplementary Table 2).

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^d4e7a9b5]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV testing during labor when HIV status is unknown — when HIV status is undocumented during labor or HIV testing was negative early in pregnancy but there is an increased risk of HIV infection and there was no retesting in the third trimester, expedited HIV testing should be performed. Perform an expedited HIV test — either an antigen/antibody immunoassay that can provide results within 1 hour or the most sensitive rapid test (includes rapid POC tests) available during labor, and an HIV RNA assay should also be performed when there is suspected acute HIV infection. In a setting with low prevalence and/or frequent testing, false positive initial test results will be common, and expedited and/or concurrent NATs can be helpful in managing an initial positive HIV test result. If the initial HIV test result is negative (nonreactive), no further testing is required unless acute HIV infection is suspected.

HIV testing in pregnancy — false positives and confirmatory HIV RNA testing is outlined with study data and diagnostic steps: In a large urban hospital in Dallas, 21,163 women were screened using a combination antigen/antibody immunoassay, and of the 190 who tested positive, 28 were determined to have a false positive HIV test, yielding a positive predictive value of 83% (95% confidence interval [CI] 77% to 88%) and a false positive rate of 0.16% (95% CI, 0.11% to 0.22%) using the ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab assay. For women screened a second time in pregnancy, the rate of false positive results relative to true positive results may be higher over the 6 months between first- and third-trimester testing. For any positive HIV screen late in pregnancy, during labor, or immediately postpartum, an HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) assay should be done at the same time as the supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay, and the HIV RNA assay will be needed to resolve questions raised by discordant results between the antigen/antibody screen and the antibody differentiation assay. The combination of a positive HIV antigen/antibody screen with a negative supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay and a negative HIV RNA assay is seen when there is a false positive antigen/antibody screen.

### HIV diagnostic algorithm requires confirmatory testing for initial indeterminate or positive screens in the first week of life [^4f42240d]. AIDS (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Risk for nondiagnostic and false-positive HIV testing has not been quantified for neonates.

Methods

From April 2015 to July 2018, we screened HIV-exposed infants in Botswana less than 96h from birth by qualitative DNA PCR. Repeat blood draws for DNA and RNA PCR testing occurred for initial positive and indeterminate results to establish final diagnosis. We compared screening DNA PCR cycle threshold values with final HIV status of the child.

Results

Of 10622 HIV-exposed infants, 10549 (99.3%) had no HIV DNA detected (negative), 42 (0.4%) had HIV DNA detected (positive), and 31 (0.3%) tested indeterminate at first HIV screen. Repeat testing identified 2 (5.0%) of 40 positive screens (2 declined additional testing) as false positives and confirmed 2 (6.5%) of 31 indeterminate screens as infected. Median cycle threshold value at screening was 28.1 (IQR 19.8–34.8) for children with final positive status, and 35.5 (IQR 32.8–41.4) for indeterminates who were ultimately negative. Six (15%) of 40 infants with final positive status had cycle threshold value greater than 33 at first screen, whereas 3 (9.7%) of 31 indeterminates with final negative status had cycle threshold value 33 or less at first screen. This threshold resulted in a negative predictive value of 82% and a positive predictive value of 92% for a single screen.

Conclusion

Although a DNA PCR cycle threshold value of 33 was predictive of the final HIV status in newborns, overlap occurred for true positives, false positives, and initial indeterminates. Testing additional samples should be standard practice for positive and indeterminate HIV DNA PCR tests in the first week of life.

### Estimating the economic consequences of leveraging the novel cobas HIV-1 / HIV-2 qualitative nucleic acid amplification test in routine HIV testing [^42752e4d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be critical for reducing the HIV burden in the United States. In 2021, approximately 13% of individuals with HIV in the United States were unaware of their HIV-positive status. An estimated 80% of new infections are due to transmission from people who are unaware of their HIV status or who remain untreated. More than 20% of new infections occur in youth 13–24 years of age, and almost half are unaware of their status. An economic study estimated that for every 5 unidentified acute HIV infections, 4.55 transmissions would occur within the following 12-month period, accruing $1 753 739 in healthcare costs incurred over the individuals' lifetimes.

The current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) laboratory testing guidelines for the diagnosis of HIV, last updated in 2018, involve a multistep algorithm. The first test in the algorithm is a fourth-generation antigen-antibody (Ag/Ab) immunoassay for the detection of HIV-1 antibodies, HIV-2 antibodies, and HIV-1 p24 antigen. Specimens with positive or indeterminate results are reflexed to a second test that differentiates between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. For discordant results or specimens reactive in the first step but nonreactive or indeterminate in the second step, a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is recommended to confirm HIV-1 infection, distinguishing acute HIV-1 infection from a false-positive initial immunoassay result. In May 2023 the CDC issued a technical update advising on supplemental tests for differentiation of HIV. As a result, additional tests such as NAATs and supplemental differentiation assays are incorporated into the existing algorithm at steps 2 and 3, but the overall algorithm remains intact.

### Discrepant HIV results resolved by human DNA testing [^32dd1a88]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

A high-risk patient was informed of a positive HIV antibody/antigen test. However, follow-up samples taken 2–3 months later for HIV RNA and anti-HIV antibodies were negative. Human DNA testing confirmed that all samples were from this patient, excluding a sample mix-up. Laboratory investigations revealed a likely splash-over contamination event.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^c47dc978]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV testing during labor when status is unknown — expedited testing should be performed when HIV status is undocumented during labor or testing was negative early in pregnancy but risk is increased and there was no third-trimester retesting. During labor, perform an expedited HIV test — either an antigen/antibody immunoassay that can provide results within 1 hour or the most sensitive rapid test (includes rapid POC tests) — and an HIV RNA assay should also be performed when there is suspected acute HIV infection. In settings with low prevalence and/or frequent testing, false positive initial test results will be common, and expedited and/or concurrent NATs can be helpful in managing an initial positive HIV test result.

### Increase in false-positive fourth-generation human immunodeficiency virus tests in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 [^430ff354]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunoassays that rely on antibody (Ab) or antigen (Ag) detection are subject to a variety of interferences that can lead to false-negative or false-positive (FP) results. There are exogenous causes such as sample integrity, errors in assay performance, interpretation and reporting, and methodologic errors. Endogenous causes within the sample being tested include rheumatoid factors, autoantibodies, hyperglobulinemia, heterophile Abs, human anti-animal Abs, lysozyme, cross-reacting Ags, paraproteins, and biotin. FP tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been reported in a variety of inflammatory conditions and possibly secondary to cross-reactivity to other infectious agents. The occurrence of an FP HIV test is not without consequences for patients, providers, and laboratories.

The expansion of an emergency department (ED)-based HIV counseling, testing, and referral (CTR) program occurred several months before the 2020 surge in ED visits associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Observations from this expansion led us to examine the performance of a fourth-generation HIV 1/2 Ag/Ab assay among persons presenting with and without polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 infection.

### Evaluation of an alternative supplemental testing strategy for HIV diagnosis by retrospective analysis of clinical HIV testing data [^9d9d0384]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Because newer screening assays are more sensitive than traditional confirmatory assays, a new HIV testing algorithm was proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) in 2010 to replace the current enzyme immunoassay (EIA)-Western blot (WB) algorithm that was established in 1989. The new algorithm includes a sensitive screening EIA and a HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation immunoassay (Multispot) for confirmation. Concordant reactive specimens are reported as HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 positive; those with discordant results receive nucleic acid testing (NAT).

Objective

Our laboratory uses all components of both the current and proposed algorithms and conducted a retrospective analysis of test results to compare algorithm performance.

Study Design

All available test results from 38,257 specimens were analyzed, of which 36,598 were EIA non-reactive. Of 1659 EIA-reactive specimens, 1578 were defined by our laboratory as HIV-1 positive, 5 as HIV-2 positive, 69 as negative and 7 as unknown. These results were used to evaluate both algorithms.

Results

Under the proposed algorithm, all 1578 HIV-1-positive specimens would be reported as 'HIV-1 positive', whereas the current algorithm only confirmed 98% (1546/1578). The proposed algorithm produced fewer inconclusive results (9 vs 48); consequently, fewer follow-up specimens would be needed. The current algorithm produced one false-positive result whereas the proposed algorithm produced four. Two of these four false-positive results could be eliminated by requiring NAT for specimens with discordant HIV-1 results on the Multispot. Although both algorithms identified all HIV-2-positive specimens, the current algorithm required an additional 112 tests.

Conclusion

The CDC/APHL HIV testing algorithm, proposed in 2010, outperformed the current algorithm because it was more sensitive for detecting HIV-1 infection, provided a greater number of definitive HIV results, and detected HIV-2 more efficiently.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^5b0c43cc]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Discordant or false positive HIV test results — interpretation and actions during pregnancy include that early in HIV infection, before HIV seroconversion, the combination of a positive antigen/antibody screen, negative HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay, and positive HIV RNA assay may be seen, because the immunoglobulin G–based antibody differentiation assay is positive later in infection than the antigen capture or the immunoglobulin M result in the antigen/antibody screen. In a large urban hospital in Dallas, 21,163 women were screened using a combination antigen/antibody immunoassay; of the 190 who tested positive, 28 were determined to have a false positive HIV test, yielding a positive predictive value of 83% (95% confidence interval [CI] 77% to 88%) and a false positive rate of 0.16% (95% CI, 0.11% to 0.22%), using the ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab assay. For any positive HIV screen late in pregnancy, during labor, or immediately postpartum, an HIV RNA assay should be done at the same time as the supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay, and the combination of a positive HIV antigen/antibody screen with a negative supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay and a negative HIV RNA assay is seen when there is a false positive antigen/antibody screen. For women screened a second time in pregnancy, the rate of false positive results relative to true positive results may be higher.

### Trends in HIV-2 diagnoses and use of the HIV-1 / HIV-2 differentiation test-United States, 2010–2017 [^1ad5d245]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Since 2014, the recommended laboratory testing algorithm for diagnosing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has included a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test to confirm infection type on the basis of the presence of type-specific antibodies (1). Correctly identifying HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections is vital because their epidemiology and clinical management differ. To describe the percentage of diagnoses for which an HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test result was reported and to categorize HIV type based on laboratory test results, 2010–2017 data from CDC's National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) were analyzed. During 2010–2017, a substantial increase in the number of HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation test results were reported to NHSS, consistent with implementation of the HIV laboratory-based testing algorithm recommended in 2014. However, > 99.9% of all HIV infections identified in the United States were categorized as HIV-1, and the number of HIV-2 diagnoses (mono-infection or dual-infection) remained extremely low (< 0.03% of all HIV infections). In addition, the overall number of false positive HIV-2 test results produced by the HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation increased. The diagnostic value of a confirmatory antibody differentiation test in a setting with sensitive and specific screening tests and few HIV-2 infections might be limited. Evaluation and consideration of other HIV tests approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that might increase efficiencies in the CDC and Association of Public Health Laboratories-recommended HIV testing algorithm are warranted.

### False-positive human immunodeficiency virus screening results in pregnancy during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [^a4bc13eb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

False-positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test results are rare but have been documented in the setting of certain underlying conditions such as Epstein-Barr virus, metastatic cancer, and certain autoimmune conditions. A retrospective cohort study in a large hospital system was conducted to compare the occurrence of false-positive HIV fourth-generation test results before and after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in a population of pregnant patients (N = 44,187; 22,073 pre-COVID and 22,114 during COVID). The COVID cohort had a significantly higher frequency of false-positive HIV test results compared with the pre-COVID cohort (0.381 vs 0.676, P = 0.002). Within the COVID cohort, 25% of patients had a positive polymerase chain reaction test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) preceding their false-positive HIV test results. When this subgroup was excluded, the difference in frequency of false-positive HIV test results between the cohorts was no longer significant (0.381 vs 0.507, P = 0.348). Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was associated with an increased frequency of false-positive HIV test results in the pregnant population.

### Increase in false-positive fourth-generation human immunodeficiency virus tests in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 [^38e2683c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study from March 2020 to January 2022 at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan. Through electronic medical record extraction, all patients who were PCR tested for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and had a result within 2 weeks of an HIV fourth-generation assay (Elecsys HIV Duo, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) were selected. All positive HIV fourth-generation assays were independently reviewed and divided into groups: FP (fourth-generation assay positive, HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay enzyme immunoassay negative/indeterminant, and HIV-1 nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) negative); true positive (TP; fourth-generation assay positive, enzyme immunoassay positive); and presumptive negative (PN; fourth-generation assay negative). We developed these groups because, in the absence of suspected acute HIV infection or recent HIV exposure, negative fourth-generation tests were not systematically followed up to determine true-negative vs false-negative status. FP, TP, and PN were then subdivided by SARS CoV-2 PCR status, positive or negative. In the case of duplicate patients, only the first encounter was counted; however, if an individual initially tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative but was then positive on a repeat test within the 2-week window, that individual was counted as having COVID-19 in the dataset. To gain insight into possible mechanisms for the observed FP results, the numeric signal-to-cutoff ratio (cutoff indices [COIs]) readings for both Ag and Ab that were available were then selected for analyses from this subset of individuals based on availability.

HIV Screening

Routine HIV testing was performed following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) testing guidelines using a fourth-generation HIV Ag/Ab test following CDC/Association of Public Health Laboratories laboratory algorithmic recommendations. In addition, individuals suspected of acute HIV infection and those newly diagnosed underwent NAT testing. Screening was also done in the ED as part of an HIV CTR program. ED-based screening uses an algorithmic approach, generating a best practice alert to order a laboratory-based fourth-generation HIV test upon ordering a complete blood count for individuals aged 18–65 years. CTR staff are responsible for follow-up of patients with a positive fourth-generation test and those who may test negative with suspected acute HIV.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^bb41f2a0]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV diagnostic algorithm — cost and cost-effectiveness compared with the previous algorithm: Investigators collected cost information from 17 clinical and public health laboratories and modeled median costs to compare the previous versus recommended algorithm. The recommended algorithm identified more specimens with HIV-1 infection and was less costly for specimens positive for HIV antibody, but more costly for the subset that required HIV-1 NAT to evaluate acute infection or false-positive initial immunoassay results. Estimates of both the number of HIV infections detected and overall laboratory testing costs were higher with the recommended algorithm than with the previous algorithm, and in specimens with 1% prevalence of established HIV-1 infection and 0.1% prevalence of acute HIV-1 infection (characteristic of specimens from high-risk populations), the incremental cost per additional HIV-1 infection detected ranged from $5,027 to $14,400.

### False-positive human immunodeficiency virus-1 test results with rapid seroreversion after third-trimester tdap booster vaccination [^938af19e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

False-positive and false-negative results in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing are expected at some frequency. False-positive results have been reported in association with various conditions, including pregnancy, autoimmune disease, and infection. We present an atypical case of a pregnant patient receiving false-positive HIV results for both screening and antibody confirmatory tests after a recent routine vaccination.

Case

A 34-year-old woman, G4P1021, with a negative first-trimester HIV test result received a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) booster at 35 2/7 weeks of gestation. Test results at 36 2/7 weeks of gestation were positive in both HIV-1/2 antigen-antibody screening and a confirmatory HIV-1 antibody differentiation immunoassay, but follow-up test results at 36 5/7 weeks and later were negative. Repeat testing and erythrocyte typing confirmed that this was not a result of laboratory error or specimen mishandling. HIV antiretroviral therapy was started and was later discontinued. A scheduled primary cesarean delivery performed at 39 1/7 weeks of gestation due to breech presentation was uncomplicated.

Conclusions

False-positive results in HIV screen and confirmation testing were associated with receipt of a Tdap vaccine booster 7 days prior. This test result pattern is similar to that seen very rarely in previous cases, and the rapid seroreversion to negative suggests an acute immunologic trigger leading to a falsely reactive antibody. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for false-positive HIV test results in patients who recently received vaccination or with other immune triggers and retest at a short interval if suspected.
